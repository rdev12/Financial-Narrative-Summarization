CHairMan’S ST aTeMenT
The strategy has produced a strong fundamental 
business with a solid platform for future growth 
and following on from the success to date we 
continue to look for opportunities to expand the 
Group’s offering.
2008/2009	was	a	very	good	year	
for	A CM	and	I	am	delighted	to	
report	such	a	strong	set	of	results.	
The	Group	has	seen	significant	
growth	from	both	its	UK	and	
overseas	offices	and	most	areas	
of	the	business	outperformed	
management	expectations.	
The	complementary	acquisition	
of	Harris	&	Dixon	Shipbrok ers	
(Harris	&	Dixon)	has	been	
successfully	integrated	and	has	
proven	to	be	a	strong	strategic	
addition	to	the	Group.	In	addition,	
the	strengthening	of	the	US	Dollar	
against	the	P ound	in	the	second	
half	of	the	year	had	a	positive	
e f f e c t 	 o n 	 t h e 	 G r o u p ’ s 	 p r o fi t a b i l i t y .	
Resul Ts
The	Group ’s	revenue	from	ship	
broking	increased	in	US	Dollar	
terms	by	29%	to	US$50.9	million	
(2008:	US$39.3	million).	It	was	an	
excellent	period	for	the	spot	desk,	
freight	rates	were	good	through	
the	majority	of	the	year	and	the	
number	of	spot	fixtures	was	up	
19%,	excluding	income	from	
Harris	&	Dixon.	T ime	charter	
continues	to	perform	strongly	and	
delivered	a	33%	revenue	increase

expectations.	In	addition	A CM	has	
formally	opened	its	Indian	office,	
expanded	its	team	of	brok ers	in	
the	UK	and	started	to	see	tangible	
rewards	from	its	Singapore	office.

The	success	of	A CM	is	due	to	the

As	the	business	evolves,	the	Group	
continues	to	expand	and	diversify	
its	broking	teams.	It	is	important	
that	the	desks	are	integrated	with	
brok ers	working	together	to	ensure	
maximum	success	of	A CM.	I	would	
lik e	to	thank	all	of	our	employees	
for	their	committed	support	in	
enabling	a	good	set	of	results	
to	be	produced.

T ank er	freight	rates	were	
exceptionally	strong	during	2008.	
A CM	was	well	placed	to	tak e	
advantage	of	this	and	as	a	result	
had	an	excellent	year .	T ank er	rates	
have	fallen	during	the	last	quarter	
and,	in	line	with	mark et	forecasts,	
the	Group	does	not	expect	to	see	
the	same	level	of	revenue	next

ongoing	global	demand	for	oil	
and	the	volume	of	trades	has	
held	up	extremely	well	in	the	first

CorporA te GovernAnCe
introduction The Board is committed to achieving good standards of corporate governance. Although under the rules of AIM the Group is not 
required to comply with the Combined Code, the Directors intend to comply so far as reasonably practicable for a company of 
ACM’s size and nature. Where full compliance is not appropriate due to the Company’s size and/or nature, the Directors will refer 
to guidance for AIM listed companies issued by the Quoted Companies Alliance.
board oF directors The Board consists of three executive and three non‑executive Directors, a composition which the Board believes is best suited 
to the continued success of the Group. 
The Board is responsible for establishing the strategic direction of the Group and monitoring the Group’s performance against its business 
plan. It is also responsible for leading and controlling the Group and in particular for formulating, reviewing and approving the Group’s 
strategy, budget, major items of capital expenditure and acquisitions and disposals. Regular meetings are held and all necessary information 
is supplied on a timely basis to enable the Board to discharge its duties effectively. Additionally, special meetings take place, or other 
arrangements are made when Board decisions are required in advance of the regular meetings. 
It is the Company’s policy that Directors are re‑elected by shareholders and the Company’s Articles of Association require one third 
to retire by rotation. 
board committees
The Board has a remuneration committee, an audit committee and a nomination committee. Each of these committees consist 
of the three non‑executive Directors and are chaired by Peter Sechiari. The Board also has a compliance committee consisting 
of Peter Sechiari and Ian Hartley.
The remuneration committee is discussed within the Directors’ remuneration report on page 16.
The audit committee meets whenever there is business to discuss and meets at least twice each year. The audit committee is responsible 
for ensuring that the financial performance of the Group is properly monitored, controlled and reported on. It also meets with the auditor 
without executive Directors being present and review reports from the auditor relating to accounts and internal control systems.
The nomination committee has responsibility for making recommendations on the appointment of additional Directors to the Board 
and the appointment of members of the Company’s senior management team. It meets at least twice a year. 
internal control
The Board is responsible for the system of internal control. Although no system can provide absolute assurance against misstatement 
or loss, the Group’s systems are designed to provide the Directors with reasonable assurance. The Board is also responsible for reviewing 
the effectiveness of the system.
going concern
The Directors confirm that they are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to continue its business for the foreseeable future. 
For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
shareholder relations The Board places significant importance on maintaining good communications with its shareholders. This includes meetings 
with shareholders and analysts as appropriate. Shareholders are also invited to the Company’s AGM, where questions are taken. 
The Company also uses its Annual Report and Accounts, Interim Statement and website (www.acmshippinggroup.com) 
to provide further information to shareholders.  ACM Shipping Group plc Annual report and accounts 2009 16

The committee meets formally at least twice a year and otherwise as required. The remuneration committee considers all material elements 
of remuneration policy, including remuneration and incentives of executive Directors and senior management (including pension rights 
and compensation payments) with reference to independent remuneration research and professional advice. The Board is responsible 
for implementing the recommendations and agreeing the remuneration packages for individual Directors. The remuneration committee 
is also responsible for making recommendations for grants of options under share option and incentivisation schemes. No Director is able 
to participate in discussions relating to his own terms and conditions of remuneration. Non‑executive Directors’ and the Chairman’s fees 
are determined by the full Board on the advice of the remuneration committee.

annual bonus
In order to attract and retain the highest calibre of employees, a significant proportion of remuneration packages of executive Directors 
and senior management are geared towards an annual bonus. The Group adopts an industry standard bonus model whereby proportions 
of revenue and profit are distributed to senior employees as bonuses. The individual allocation of this bonus between the Directors and senior 
employees is discretionary. This discretion is exercised by the remuneration committee upon the recommendation of senior executives.
Pension contributions
The Company makes pension contributions on behalf of its executive Directors. James Gundy is a member of the Group’s defined benefit 
scheme. Ian Hartley is a member of the Group’s stakeholder scheme. John Plumbe chose not to have pension contributions paid on his 
behalf and exercised his right to receive an allowance equivalent to the Company contribution, net of national insurance. The non‑executive 
Directors do not participate in the Group’s pension schemes.  YeAr in review CorporA te GovernAnCe FinAnciAl st Atements

We have audited the Group and parent company financial statements (the financial statements) of ACM Shipping Group plc for the year 
ended 31 March 2009 which comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense, 
the balance sheets, the statements of changes in equity, the cash flow statements, and the related notes. These financial statements 
have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the Directors’ remuneration 
report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than 
the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
resPective resPonsibilities oF directors and auditor The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ remuneration report and the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and IFRS as adopted by the European Union are set out in the statement of Directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited in accordance 
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the part 
of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given

In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all 
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration

The other information comprises only the Directors’ report, the unaudited part of the Directors’ remuneration report, the Chairman’s

ACM Shipping Group plc Annual report and accounts 2009 25
1. accounting Policies (a) basis oF accounting
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act and those EU endorsed IFRS standards 
and IFRIC interpretations issued and effective or issued and early adopted as at the time of preparing these statements (July 2009). 
The policies set out below have been consistently applied to all the years presented.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except as noted below.
No separate profit and loss account is presented for the parent company as provided by Section 230, Companies Act 1985.
(b) basis oF consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ACM Shipping Group plc and its subsidiary and associated undertakings 
and joint venture arrangements.
(c) revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow and can be reliably measured. Revenue 
is recognised when the Group has a contractual entitlement to commission. This is generally the point at which there is completion 
of contractual terms between the principles of a transaction. Time charter revenue is recognised on a monthly basis.
(d) ProPerty , Plant and equiPment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. Depreciation is provided 
on a straight line basis over the expected economic life of that asset as follows:
Leasehold improvements –  seven years 
Fixtures, fittings and office equipment – two to five years
(e) oPerating lease agreements
Rentals applicable to operating leases where substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership remain with the lessor are charged 
against profits on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
(F) Pension costs and other Post‑retirement beneFits The Group operates a defined benefit scheme and recognises the pension liability in the Group balance sheet. The liability is the present 
value of the accrued defined benefit obligations at the balance sheet date less the fair value of the scheme’s assets. The present value 
of the defined benefit obligations are measured using the projected unit method and discounted at an AA corporate bond rate. Assets are 
valued at market value. The Group recognises actuarial gains and losses via the statement of recognised income and expense in the 
year in which they occur. 
The Company also contributes to defined contribution schemes. Contributions to these schemes have been charged against profit 
as they fall due.

1. accounting Policies continued
(g) deFerred tax Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. The deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition 
of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting 
nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the 
balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised. 
(h) Foreign currencies
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted into Sterling at the rate of exchange at the time of the transaction. At each 
balance sheet, monetary assets and liabilities are converted at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date with any gain or loss being 
included in the income statement.
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of overseas operations are converted at the balance sheet rate while the income statement 
is translated at the average rate for the year. Any exchange gain or loss arising on consolidation is charged to reserves.
(i) joint ventures
The Group’s investment and share of the profits or losses of the joint ventures are included in the financial statements using the equity method.
(j) investments All investments are stated at cost less provisions for diminution in value.
(k) goodwill On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the net assets (including any identifiable intangible assets) acquired. 
Goodwill arises where the fair value of the consideration exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is recognised 
as an asset and is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Impairments are recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purposes of impairment testing. On the disposal of a business, goodwill 
relating to that business remaining on the balance sheet is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal. 
(l) o ther intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are stated in the balance sheet at their fair value at the date of acquisition 
less accumulated amortisation and any provisions for impairment. The amortisation of the carrying value of the capitalised forward order 
book and customer relationships is charged to the income statement over an estimated useful life determined by either the expected 
due dates for future income in the case of forward order books or the expected duration of customer relationships. The carrying values 
of intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually or when there is an indication that they may be impaired. The estimated 
useful life of the items in the forward order book is generally three to four years and for the customer relationships is ten years.

(m) share‑based P ayments The Company awards employees bonuses in the form of share options and long‑term incentive plan share awards, on a discretionary 
basis from time to time. The options and awards are normally subject to vesting conditions and, where it is considered likely that 
the conditions will be met, their fair value is recognised as an employee benefits expense with a corresponding increase in other 
reserves over the vesting period. The cash proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share 
capital (nominal value) and share premium. 
(n) Financial instruments
Classification
Following the adoption of IAS 32, financial instruments issued by the Company are treated as equity (i.e. forming part of shareholders’ 
funds) only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions:
a)  they include no contractual obligations upon the Company to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets 
or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Company; and
b)  where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is either a non‑derivative that includes 
no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company’s 
exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument so classified 
takes the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up share capital 
and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
(o) the comP any’s share caPital is treated as equity
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance expenses. Finance payments associated with financial 
instruments that are classified in equity are dividends and are recorded directly in equity.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at nominal value.
Forward contracts
The Company uses forward contracts for foreign currency and accounts for these using hedge accounting. ACM Shipping Group plc Annual report and accounts 2009 28

2. segmental rePorting The Group has taken early adoption of IFRS 8 Operating segments. The Group operates in one business sector and does not report 
internally any segmental information other than revenue streams. As a result no additional business sector information is provided. 
Business is the Group’s primary reporting segment. Geographical information is not produced and is not readily available. In view 
of management, the cost of developing this information would be excessive.

10. intangible assets continued
Goodwill has been allocated to the H&D cash generating unit for impairment testing purposes. The recoverable amount has been determined 
based on a value in use calculation using risk‑adjusted cash flow projections based on financial budgets prepared by the Group. The key 
assumptions used in the value in use calculation are:
X
  the discount rate applied to the cash flow projections is 12%. This is the Group’s weighted average cost of capital adjusted to reflect 
market assessment of specific risks associated with the segment cash flows;
X
  the period over which cash flows are projected based on financial budgets approved by the Board is one year; and
X
  the growth rate used to extrapolate cash flow projections beyond the budget period is 3%.
Management believes that it is unlikely that any reasonable possible change in the key assumptions would cause the carrying value 
of any of the cash generating units to exceed its recoverable amount.

The Group operates a defined benefit scheme in the UK which is closed to new members. The Group also operates a stakeholder scheme 
and contributes to independent funds on behalf of certain of the Group’s employees.
The operating charge for pension costs in the year is:
         2009 2008 
         £000 £000
UK defined benefit scheme        228 167
Defined contribution schemes         767 325
         995 492
The last full funding valuation on the defined benefit scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2005. A qualified independent actuary has 
carried out a valuation for IAS 19 purposes as at 31 March 2009 to obtain the figures in this disclosure note. The figures for the year ended 
31 March 2008 have also been included for comparison.
The projected unit valuation method has been used. 
The principal actuarial assumptions at the balance sheet date were:
         2009 2008
economic assumptions
Discount rate        6.9% pa 6.6% pa
Price inflation        3.0% pa 3.5% pa

Diversified Growth Fund (DGF)        7.1% pa 7.5% pa
Cash        3.8% pa 4.6% pa
Demographic assumptions
Average expected remaining life of:

– 60 year old non‑retired female        30.4 yrs 28.7 yrs
– 60 year old retired female        29.4 yrs 27.4 yrs
Scheme assets are stated at their bid values at the respective balance sheet dates. The expected long‑term rate of return on DGFs 
of 7.1% pa reflects historic UK equity returns and DGFs and is within the range of assumptions typically used by other companies. 
The expected long‑term rate of return on cash of 3.8% pa is based upon the gross redemption yield available on long‑dated gilts. ACM Shipping Group plc Annual report and accounts 2009 40

The Company has no other form of share capital other than ordinary shares as shown in this note.
20. share‑based P ayments The Enterprise Management Incentive (EMI) scheme, Sharesave scheme and Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) have been set up to provide 
executives and employees with options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company. 
During the year, the Group made grants under its EMI scheme and awards under its LTIP that fall to be accounted for in accordance 
with IFRS 2.
Under the EMI scheme, 196,666 options over ordinary shares of 1 pence each were granted to employees during the year. There are 
no performance conditions attaching to these grants which vest 50% after three years, 25% after four years and 25% after five years 
subject only to the employee remaining with the Group. The exercise price of 50,000 options granted in July 2008 was 233.5 pence 
and for the 146,666 options granted in December 2008 was 150 pence, which were the share prices at the time of the grant. The fair 
values of the awards at grant date were 64.5 pence for the July grant and 36.6 pence for the December grant, determined using the 
Binomial option pricing model. The life of the awards was assumed to be five and a half years.
Other assumptions used in the application of the option pricing models were:

ACM Shipping Group plc Annual report and accounts 2009 43
20. share‑based P ayments continued
Expected volatility was estimated by reference to historical share price movements in both the Group and comparable quoted 
companies with a longer listing history than the Group.
In addition there were 48,661 options under the EMI scheme granted at 205.5 pence per share and 217,500 options granted at 160 pence 
per share under the Sharesave scheme that were outstanding at the beginning of the year, no options were exercised, forfeited or expired 
during the period. There were 462,827 options outstanding at the end of the year, none of which are exercisable.
Under the LTIP , 566,060 shares were awarded to employees during the year. Two employees were each awarded 180,000 LTIP shares. 
The employees paid one pence per share for the LTIPs which vest 50% after three years, 25% after four years and 25% after five years 
subject only to the employee remaining with the Group. One Director was awarded 206,060 LTIP shares in January 2009. These shares 
for the LTIPs vest after three years subject to the satisfaction of an EPS performance target. The fair values of these LTIPs were inherently 
valued at the share price at the date of grant less 1 pence per share.
The total charge in the consolidated income statement for the year with regard to these awards is £178,000 (2008: £9,000).

25. Financial instruments and risks
The Group’s financial risk management policies are designed to reduce the risk of currency, liquidity and credit risk exposure.
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash at bank and other items including trade receivables and trade payables that arise 
directly from its operations. 
The Group has no assets or liabilities other than forward foreign exchange contracts that fall to be classed as derivatives. The Group 
does not engage in instruments of a speculative nature.
(a) currency risk
The Group carries out most of its business in US Dollars and hence it is exposed to currency risk arising from fluctuations in exchange 
rates. So as to mitigate this risk the Group places forward contracts for the sale of US Dollars at fixed rates. The purpose of such 
transactions is to manage the currency risk arising from the Group’s operations. At year end the Group had contracts outstanding 
to sell US$9.0 million (2008: US$6.4 million) and to receive Sterling. These contracts all had a maturity date of less than one year 
and were contracted at rates ranging from $1.37 to $1.73 to £1. The average rate of the forward contracts was $1.48 to £1. 
At each balance sheet date, the contracts which are designated and effective as cash flow hedges are restated to their fair value, based 
on currency contracts with similar maturity profiles. At 31 March 2009 the fair value of these contracts was £10,000 (2008: £1,000).
The rate on the balance sheet date was $1.43 to £1 (2008: $1.99).
As at 31 March 2009 all cash and cash equivalents were held in Sterling except for bank accounts totalling US$1.6 million 
(2008: US$2.4 million) and Euro 0.3million (2008: nil). There is no difference between the book values and fair values of financial 
assets and liabilities.
The effect on profit before taxation of a 10% weakening in the average US Dollar exchange rate in the year compared to the effective 
rates for the year is approximately £1.4 million adverse (2008: £0.9 million). This effect is before hedging and with all other variables 
being equal. A 10% strengthening in the average US Dollar is approximately £1.4 million favourable (2008: £0.9 million). The effect 
on equity is similar to that on profit before taxation.
(b) liquidity risk
The Group finances itself through retained earnings. The Group is fundamentally cash generative and manages its liquid resources 
so as to obtain the best available rates of return on cash investments, whilst retaining access to those resources. 
An analysis of cash and cash equivalents is given in note 24. The Group does not currently have any borrowings.
(c) credit risk
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group. The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets 
is represented by the carrying value of receivables as at the balance sheet date. Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing 
basis and a bad debt provision is held to cover doubtful debts. The Group has not historically suffered from significant bad debts.
(d) interest rate risk
The Group has exposure to interest rates on its cash and short term deposits.  YeAr in review corporA te governAnce finAnCiAl St AteMentS

27. business combinations On 23 June 2008 the Group acquired the business of Harris & Dixon Shipbrokers (H&D) for a total cash consideration of £2.5 million.
The provisional fair value of the assets acquired was:

          2,538
In the year H&D contributed £2,499,000 to revenue and £321,000 to the net profit of the Group after amortisation of intangible assets 
and taxation. If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the year, the net profit contributed to the Group would have been 
£419,000 and revenue contributed would have been £3,261,000.
Included in the £1,521,000 of goodwill recognised above are certain intangible assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably 
measured due to their nature. These items include an assembled workforce and the detailed knowledge and expertise of the specialist markets.
£1,002,000 of intangible assets were separated from goodwill as part of this business combination and relate to the forward order book 
and customer relationships. The fair values of these intangible assets were calculated by an independent valuer using the net present 
value of future cash flows. ACM Shipping Group plc Annual report and accounts 2009 46

notes 1.  If you have sold or transferred all your ordinary shares in the Company, please send this document and the enclosed form of proxy 
(Proxy Form) to the stockbroker, or other agent through whom the sale or transfer was effected, for transmission to the purchaser 
or transferee.
2.  Holders of ordinary shares, or their duly appointed representatives, are entitled to attend and vote at the AGM. Shareholders are entitled to 
appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of their rights to attend and speak and vote on their behalf at the meeting. A shareholder can appoint 
the Chairman of the meeting or anyone else to be his/her proxy at the meeting. A proxy need not be a shareholder. More than one 
proxy can be appointed in relation to the AGM provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different 
ordinary share or shares held by that shareholder. T o appoint more than one proxy, the Proxy Form should be photocopied and completed 
for each proxy holder. The proxy holder’s name should be written on the Proxy Form together with the number of shares in relation 
to which the proxy is authorised to act. The box on the Proxy Form must also be ticked to indicate that the proxy instruction is one of 
multiple instructions being given. All Proxy Forms must be signed and, to be effective, must be lodged with the Company’s registrar 
so as to arrive not later than 48 hours before the time of the meeting, or in the case of an adjournment 48 hours before the adjourned 
time. In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy, only the appointment submitted 
by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint holders appear in the 
Company’s register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first‑named being the most senior).
3.  The return of a completed Proxy Form will not prevent a shareholder attending the AGM and voting in person if he/she wishes to do so.
4.  Only shareholders whose names appear on the register of members of the Company as at 48 hours before the time of the meeting 
shall be entitled to attend the AGM either in person or by proxy and the number of ordinary shares then registered in their respective 
names shall determine the number of votes such persons are entitled to cast on a poll at the AGM.
5.  The statement of the rights of shareholders in relation to the appointment of proxies in note 2 does not apply to Nominated Persons. 
The rights described in that note can only be exercised by shareholders of the Company.
6.  In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the AGM, arrangements will be put in place at the AGM so that; (i) if a corporate 
shareholder has appointed the Chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative to vote on a poll in accordance with the directions 
of all of the other corporate representatives for that shareholder at the meeting, then on a poll those corporate representatives will 
give voting directions to the Chairman and the Chairman will vote (or withhold a vote) as corporate representative in accordance with 
those directions; and (ii) if more than one corporate representative for the same corporate shareholder attends the meeting but the 
corporate shareholder has not appointed the Chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative, a designated corporate representative 
will be nominated, from those corporate representatives who attend, who will vote on a poll and the other corporate representatives 
will give voting directions to that designated corporate representative. Corporate shareholders are referred to the guidance issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators on proxies and corporate representatives (www.icsa.org.uk) for further details of 
this procedure. The guidance includes a sample form of appointment letter if the Chairman is being appointed as described in (i) above. 
7.  In accordance with regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, to be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting 
(and for the purposes of the determination by the Company of the number of votes they may cast), members must be entered on 
the Company’s register of members by 6.00pm on 1 September 2009, or if the meeting is adjourned, by not later than 48 hours 
before the time and date fixed for the adjourned meeting.
8.  A vote withheld is not a vote in law, which means that the vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or against the resolution.
9.  Copies of all service agreements under which Directors of the Company are employed by the Company or any subsidiaries will be available 
for inspection at the Company’s registered office, during normal business hours on any weekday (Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays 
excepted) from the date of this notice until the conclusion of the AGM, and at the venue of the AGM for 15 minutes prior to and during 
the meeting.
10.  Except as provided above, shareholders who have general queries about the meeting should write to the Company Secretary at the 
address of our registered office. You may not use any electronic address provided either in this notice of AGM or any related documents 
(including the Proxy Form) to communicate with the Company for any purposes other than those expressly stated.

agm – business at the agm Shareholders will see from the notice of AGM that they are asked to consider and, if thought fit, pass a number of resolutions 
as ordinary and special business which are summarised below.
as ordinary business
resolution 1 – to receive the financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2009.
resolution 2 – to approve the Directors’ remuneration report for the financial year ended 31 March 2009.
resolution 3 – to declare a final dividend for the financial year ended 31 March 2009 of 6 pence per share. Subject to approval, 
the final dividend will be payable on 9 October 2009 to shareholders on the register as at close of business on 11 September 2009.
resolutions 4 and 5 – under the Company’s Articles of Association and in accordance with Group policy, one third of the Company’s 
Directors retire by rotation and, being eligible, David Cobb and Ian Hartley offer themselves for re‑election.
resolution 6 – auditor – this resolution, if passed, will re‑appoint Tenon Audit Limited as auditor of the Company and authorise  
the Directors to fix their remuneration.
as sPecial business
The following item will be proposed as an ordinary resolution:
resolution 7 – authority to allot shares
This resolution, if passed, will authorise the Directors of the Company generally and unconditionally to allot ordinary shares of the Company 
up to a maximum nominal value of £57,600 representing approximately one third of the current issued share capital of the Company. 
This authority will expire at the conclusion of the next AGM of the Company unless previously varied, revoked or renewed by the 
Company in general meeting.
The following items will be proposed as special resolutions:
resolution 8 – disaPPlication oF Pre‑emPtion rights
This resolution, if passed, will grant the Directors of the Company power to allot shares wholly for cash pursuant to the authority conferred 
on them by resolution 7 otherwise than to the existing shareholders of the Company in proportion to their existing holdings of ordinary 
shares. The first part of the disapplication is limited to rights issues, open offers and similar pro‑rata issues. In relation to a rights issue, 
open offer or other pro rata issues the disapplication authority is unlimited and allows the Directors to offer shares to existing shareholders 
other than strictly in proportion to their holdings, where for example, overseas regulations make it difficult to offer shares pro rata to existing 
overseas shareholders or when dealing with fractions of shares. The second part of the disapplication is limited to issues of shares pursuant 
to the terms of the Company’s current share scheme and any other share schemes approved by the Company in general meeting. The final 
part of the resolution also enables your Board to allot shares for any purpose up to an aggregate nominal value of £17,640 representing 
approximately 10% of the current issued share capital of the Company.

resolution 9 – share buy back 
This resolution seeks authority for the Company to make market purchases of its own shares and is proposed as a special resolution. 
If passed, the resolution gives authority for the Company to purchase up to 1,764,000 of its shares, representing just under 10% 
of the Company’s issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) as at the date of this notice of AGM.
The resolution specifies the minimum and maximum prices which may be paid for any shares purchased under this authority. The authority 
will expire at the conclusion of the Company’s next AGM.
Whilst the Directors do not currently have any intention of exercising the authority granted by this resolution, the Directors would require 
the authority granted by this resolution to make market purchases of the Company’s ordinary shares as a method of returning surplus 
cash to shareholders. The Directors will only exercise the authority to purchase shares where they consider that such purchases will 
be in the best interests of shareholders generally and will result in an increase in EPS.
The Company may either cancel any shares it purchases under this authority or transfer them into treasury (and subsequently sell or transfer 
them out of treasury or cancel them). The Directors currently intend to transfer sufficient shares purchased under this authority into 
treasury in order to satisfy the Company’s share incentive schemes and to cancel any excess shares purchased. YeAr in review corporA te governAnce finAnCiAl St AteMentS

notes:
1.  Any member entitled to attend and vote at the AGM is entitled to appoint one or more proxies (who need not be a member of the Company but must attend 
the meeting in person) of his own choice to attend and to vote in his/her place. To appoint more than one proxy you may photocopy this form. Please indicate 
the proxy holder’s name and the number of shares in relation to which they are authorised to act as your proxy (which, in aggregate, should not exceed the 
number of shares held by you). Please also indicate if the proxy instruction is one of multiple instructions being given. All forms must be signed and should 
be returned together in the same envelope. If a member wishes to appoint a proxy other than the Chairman, delete the words “the Chairman of the meeting or,” 
initial the alteration and insert the name of the person you wish to appoint as your proxy. All members are entitled to attend and vote at the meeting, whether 
or not they have returned a form of proxy.
2.  If you indicate that you want your vote withheld your proxy may abstain from voting and therefore there is no vote at law to be counted in the calculation 
of the proportion of votes for and against the resolution. 
3.  If a member is a corporation, this form of proxy must be executed under its common seal or by the signature of an officer or attorney duly authorised in writing. 
4.  In the case of joint holders, the signature of any one holder will be sufficient, but the names of all joint holders should be stated, and the vote of the senior holder 
who tenders a vote will be accepted to the exclusion of the vote(s) of other joint holder(s), seniority being determined by the order in which the names stand 
in the register of members of the Company.
5.  In order to be valid, this form of proxy, duly executed together with any power of attorney or other authority under which it is signed, or a notarially certified or office 
copy of such power or authority, must be lodged at the Company’s Registrars not less than 48 hours before the time of the meeting or any adjournment of the meeting.
6.  The return of a completed Proxy Form will not prevent a shareholder attending the AGM and voting in person if he/she wishes to do so.

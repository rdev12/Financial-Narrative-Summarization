Application Server
The Telecoms 
Industry
Market
Opportunity
The hundred year old 
telecommunications industry is 
undergoing a fundamental and 
highly disruptive transition. 
Antiquated, voice-centric, “circuit-
switched” networks are giving way 
to digital, Internet Protocol (IP) 
based packet networks that 
enable the swift, efficient delivery 
of voice, video and data services 
in a ubiquitous manner to end 
users, anytime and anywhere. This 
is reshaping the industry’s overall 
structure, and opening the door 
to a new set of companies that 
bring an Internet-centric approach 
to delivering innovation within 
the $2.1 trillion worldwide 
telecommunications industry.
Ubiquity’s award-winning  
SIP Application Server (SIP A/S)  
is a Java-based software platform 
that allows telecom Service 
Providers to develop and deploy 
next-generation converged 
communications services faster 
and more easily than using 
traditional methods.
SIP A/S brings the distributed, 
open application development 
model of the Internet to 
telecommunications. This 
maximizes the ability of an 
application developer to reuse 
features and components from 
one service offering to another 
using open, familiar application 
programming interfaces (APIs). 
Migrating Internet development 
practices to the telecoms industry 
enables Service Providers and 
applications developers to create 
and rapidly deploy different 
SIP-based applications across 
fixed and mobile networks.
The Yankee Group forecasts  
the market for telecom-grade,  
SIP-based Application Servers will 
reach $4.7 billion by 2009, as they 
are deployed for a myriad of 
enhanced IP services, as well as  
for service mediation and other 
application routing functions within 
the IP network. Yankee Group also 
believes the opportunity for  
SIP-based Application Servers will 
be fully exploited by the advent of 
IP Multimedia Subsystems within 
carrier IP core networks as well as 
the emergence of robust Service 
Delivery Platforms within Service 
Provider’ s networks.
Ubiquity Software develops and markets 
SIP-based communications software for 
fixed and mobile Service Providers, System 
Integrators, Independent Software 
Vendors and OEM partners worldwide.

I became the Chairman of 
Ubiquity in May 2005 timed with 
the Company’s flotation on AIM. 
Having spent the last 22 years in 
the telecommunications industry 
in roles ranging from Research  
and Development through to 
Chief Technology Officer of both 
a fixed line and mobile operator,  
I feel adequately grounded  
to comment on the evolution  
of technology in the 
telecommunications industry.  
It is my belief that Ubiquity is 
uniquely positioned to take 
advantage of the next round  
of fundamental changes in the 
telecommunications industry. 
These changes are generally 
characterised as the convergence 
of information technology and 
telecommunications technology. 
This convergence will result in 
large open standard information 
technology-based architectures, 
products and services which  
were previously dominated  
by proprietary and expensive 
technology solutions. Industry 
analysts project this spend to be 
over $30 billion in the next several 
years. Over time the ultimate 
customers will have better value, 
variety and better designed and 
complementary families of 
products and services available  
to them. 
The evolution to next-generation 
architectures and their resultant 
products and services will take 
place at different paces for 
different Service Providers. The 
technology will also give rise to 
completely new Service Providers 
of which NetZero and Skype are 
outstanding examples. One can 
see very ambitious evolutions in 
some of the traditional fixed-line 
Service Providers, and one can see 
Service Providers who have yet to 
come to grips with the changes 
enabled by this technology. 
Ubiquity provides a very complex 
and important part of the new 
architecture which facilitates the 
creation, coordination, and 
sharing of common resources  
for new products and services.
You can best think of Ubiquity’s 
offering as having two major 
elements. First, it has a super-high-
capacity server to run complex 
and valuable services for Service 
Providers (services in the future will 
be written in a way that is much 
more consistent with rich web 
pages than monolithic, vertically 
integrated software). Second, 
Ubiquity provides the tools and 
service creation environment to 
make the job of designing services 
(particularly those which can or 
should inter-operate with other 
services) much easier and 
inherently faster. Early architecture 
wins and the selection of Ubiquity 
as a partner by many of the large 
suppliers to the Service Providers’ 
space is a good indication of the 
respect and reputation that 
Ubiquity continues to build.
The Board
Leading to the preparation for the 
flotation, there were a number  
of changes to the Board of 
Directors, mostly driven by our 
appetite to comply with best 
practice recommendations.  
I would like to thank those 
Directors who left the Board for 
their contribution during their 
This exciting evolution in the 
telecommunications industry provides 
a tremendous opportunity; however, it 
is not without challenges. Companies 
like Ubiquity will have to both lead and 
serve this evolution.
Chairman’s statement
Chris Burke, Chairman of the Board Ubiquity Software Corporation PLC Annual report and financial statements 2005 Ubiquity Software Corporation PLC Annual report and financial statements 2005   
tenure. I would also like to 
welcome a new Board member 
and a new Company Secretary 
who joined with me this year. 
David Seibel, who brings a wealth 
of experience from his former 
position as Chairman of Accenture 
Canada, also joined the Board as  
a Non-Executive Director and is 
Chairman of the Audit Committee.
Rafferty Atha Jackson, a former 
associate general counsel from 
Macromedia, joined the Company 
in 2004 as General Counsel  
and was appointed to Company 
Secretary in May 2005. 
The Advisory Board
We also have an Advisory Board. 
This Advisory Board is chaired by 
Patrick Smith, who brings 
significant experience to the role 
as a former executive board 
member of Sprint US and Sprint 
Canada. The composition of the 
Advisory Board is designed to be 
dynamic and fluid. Depending 
upon specific windows of strategic 
execution, the Advisory Board 
pulls on various executives and 
skill sets from within the industry. 
The mandate of the Advisory 
Board is to enhance shareholder 
value by providing executive 
management with support and 
advice from leaders in industry, 
academia and professional 
societies with a focus on 
development of strategic business 
opportunities, product strategy 
and brand.
Outlook
This exciting evolution in the 
telecommunications industry 
provides a tremendous 
opportunity; however, it is not 
without challenges. Companies 
like Ubiquity will have to both lead 
and serve this evolution. The 
threats to the Service Providers as 
we know them today are obvious 
and well documented, but very 
difficult for them to address. There 
are few parallels and precedents 
for this magnitude of change in 
this industry. As such, predicting 
the speed of reaction of the 
various fixed, wireless and cable 
Carriers, across multiple 
geographies, all with differing 
competitive challenges and 
evolving pricing strategies, is very 
difficult. We will therefore continue 
to carefully invest in line with our 
financial goal of matching revenue 
growth with required expenses to 
meet the demand of delivering to 
a growing customer base. What is 
predictable and inevitable is that 
all of the various fixed, wireless, 
and cable Carriers have started 
moving towards addressing this 
evolution. I have every faith in the 
role Ubiquity is to play and the 
value it brings across the spectrum 
of new Service Providers to  
mega-Carriers. We have an 
excellent reputation in the industry, 
a great and growing base of 
customers, and a strong financial 
position that I believe will enable 
us to grow as we develop with  
the market. We are very excited 
about our prospects.

 00 in review
In 2005, our revenues grew 40% 
year over year; we captured several 
new key customers; we developed 
or strengthened relationships  
with global channel partners; 
we introduced pre-packaged 
applications intended to drive 
commercial deployments of our  
SIP Application Server; and we 
prepared the Company for growth 
by raising £20 million through the 
floatation on AIM.
During 2005, we were selected by a 
number of customers that we plan 
to leverage in order to accelerate 
our growth in the SIP market in 
2006 and beyond. First, we 
announced a deployment with 
United Online Inc (Netzero), an 
alternative Service Provider based 
in the US who is an early adopter of 
Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) 
services. Second, we won 
numerous trial engagements with 
the early adopter Carriers that 
include 7 of the 12 industry 
recognised leading global Carriers. 
Finally, we signed contracts with 
Bell Canada and another two Tier-1 
US Carriers and subsequent to the 
2005 year-end, two further Tier-1 
global Carriers via our partners. 
These contracts currently represent 
relatively small amounts of revenue 
through the sale of licences for 
development and initial small-scale 
deployments. I believe that these 
wins will form the foundation of  
our future revenues, which will  
grow as multiple new and existing 
applications are deployed on our 
SIP Application Server. I also believe 
that through our hard work and 
continued efforts at moving our 
customers into wide-scale 
deployments we have earned the 
right to be recognised as a leader 
in the SIP marketplace in 2006  
and beyond. 
In addition to winning the 
architectural beachhead with 
specific Carriers, we have been 
successful in establishing 
partnerships with leading Network 
Equipment Vendors (NEVs), 
including HP , Nokia, Lucent, 
Siemens and Huawei and play an 
important role in their product 
portfolio with our open,  
standards-based SIP platform.  
We return value to these partners 
by way of the applications 
delivered on our platform, which 
helps drive sales of their media 
servers, gateways, session-border 
controllers and other IMS-based 
network elements. These 
relationships provide incentives to 
work together on joint marketing 
and selling activities where both 
parties can be successful. It is 
through these partnerships that  
a company of Ubiquity’s size and 
scale is able to sell to and fulfil 
Tier-1 Carrier requirements and we 
therefore value them very highly. 
Going forward our focus will be  
on helping our partners become 
even more effective in selling our 
products. We intend to further 
leverage this sales model to 
accelerate our growth and further 
extend our global reach.
We also enjoy the benefit of 
complementary technology 
partners such as HP and Microsoft 
where our products are integrated 
into overall Service Delivery 
Platforms. These technologies are 
then used together to design,

Ian McLaren, President and Chief Executive Ubiquity Software Corporation PLC Annual report and financial statements 2005 Ubiquity Software Corporation PLC Annual report and financial statements 2005  develop and deliver specific 
solutions in a common repeatable 
framework. Recently, we 
co-hosted a “developer’s 
hothouse” with Microsoft for 
British Telecom where we helped 
developers from around the world 
conceptualise, design, develop 
and demonstrate several 
applications created on the 
Ubiquity SIP Application Server. 
This was a compressed two-week 
exercise that demonstrated  
the speed and flexibility of 
development using our rapid 
service creation environment. 
Additionally, we have worked  
with Microsoft to integrate our  
SIP Application Server with their 
web-services-enabled Connected 
Services Framework (CSF). The 
resulting “I’m Lost” application 
showcases our combined 
strengths by allowing a mobile 
subscriber to access an address  
in their remote Outlook calendar, 
map the location of the address, 
and to get driving directions 
spoken to them via natural speech 
technology over their mobile 
phone. This is just one example  
of how we intend to leverage our 
partners to help deliver new,  
high-value services to our carrier 
customers in the future.
In 2005, we continued to invest in 
our SIP Application Server Platform, 
mediation platform and 
application-creation environment. 
We also invested in pre-packaged 
application products that our 
customers can deploy quickly for 
a faster return on our investment 
with little or no professional 
services support. Currently, there 
are an estimated 3 billion users of 
the Public Switched T elephone 
Network (PSTN), and less then 20 
million users of VoIP , representing 
a tremendous opportunity for 
Carriers to capture new subscribers 
as they migrate to VoIP . 
Recognising this opportunity, 
Ubiquity has introduced Voice Plus, 
a pre-packaged consumer VoIP 
solution that allows Carriers, 
Internet Service Providers (ISPs), 
and alternative Carriers to 
participate and compete in this 
growing market. Voice Plus is 
developed and deployed on our  
SIP Application Server Platform 
and is designed to make it easy 
for Service Providers to add new 
features and scale to millions  
of subscribers. 
IP conferencing is another strategic 
application area for Ubiquity as 
conferencing minutes of use are 
growing significantly. Legacy 
conferencing applications are not 
proving to serve mobile users well 
as they have difficulty capitalising 
on the advanced capabilities of the 
web. SPEAK Conference Director 
is a pre-packaged application that 
takes advantage of the advanced 
multimedia capabilities of the  
SIP Application Server. SPEAK 
offers a full-featured audio and 
web conferencing solution at a 
fraction of the cost of our 
competitors. Easy-to-use SPEAK 
web collaboration tools allow 
moderators to share presentations, 
web content, applications and 
documents in real time with 
individuals and groups around  
the world. This product is moving 
into deployment with two Tier-1 
Carriers, and has several other 
prospects in the near term.
While Ubiquity is well prepared 
to deliver and support the  
Voice Plus and SPEAK solutions 
described above, these 
applications are only two 
weapons in our strategy to 
grow our market position 
going forward.

they have a lot of mindshare, I have a feeling that 
they’ll probably do well and this signals more

The overall strategy for the 
Company remains unchanged and 
clear: to leverage our proven 
technical strengths and continue 
to do what we do best:
 Build on beachhead of customer 
wins, design wins and trials by 
helping move our customers 
towards commercial 
deployments, and adding new 
applications over time to 
aggressively drive subscriber 
growth on our platform.
 Foster and grow our 
relationship with our select 
channel partners to ensure their 
success with our platform.
 Embed our platform in carrier 
networks and enable ISVs and 
third parties to develop new 
applications that drive higher 
utilisation of our platform and 
enable our customers to 
generate a greater return on 
investment.
 Manage our financial assets 
wisely to grow the Company in 
line with future revenues.
 In 2006, it is our plan to launch

Profit and loss account
In 2005, we had another year of 
continued sound growth with 
turnover increasing 40% to £7.5m 
(2004: £5.3m). During the year, we 
also saw significant increases in 
turnover in our two core operating 
regions with North America 
increasing to £4.7m representing 
growth of 133% (2004: £2.0m) and 
Europe to £1.6m an increase of 
58% (2004: £1m). Gross margin 
was also consistent against 
turnover remaining at 85% for the 
year (2004: 85%). In line with our 
business model, going forward we 
will maintain focus on delivery of 
strong gross margins. 
Operating charges for the year 
which comprises distribution  
and administration expenses, 
increased to £15.6m (2004: 
£11.0m) of which £6.3m was 
investment in research and 
development. This represents an 
increased investment of 63% year 
on year (2004: £3.9m). Having 
established Ubiquity as a leading 
technology company it will 
remain important to continue 
investment in research and 
development over forthcoming 
years. All investment in research 
and development is written off to 
the profit and loss account in the 
year that it is incurred. 
Included in administration expenses 
is a non-recurring exceptional cost 
of £0.6m relating to a bad debt 
provision. Since the year-end, the 
customer has declared bankruptcy 
and Ubiquity has filed the 
appropriate documentation with 
the administrator to make a claim 
against its outstanding receivable. 
However, the prospect of any 
recovery is remote.
During the year we changed the 
basis for estimating income 
receivable in the form of research 
and development tax credits 
from recognition on a cash-
received basis to accruing 
income for claims submitted and 
expected to be submitted based 
on the qualifying research and 
development costs incurred  
up to the balance sheet date.  
As such the profit and loss 
account for 2005 reflects £1.9m  
of income from tax credits 
representing the actual and 
anticipated claims for financial 
years 2003, 2004 and 2005. Of 
this balance, £0.6m had been 
received during the year and  
a further £0.6m was received  
after the year-end. In line with 
continued investment in research 
and development, we expect 
these tax credits to continue  
but they will start to reduce as  
a percentage of research and 
development investment as the 
investment focus moves away 
from innovative, new product 
design towards product 
development which supports 
market penetration. 
The overall loss for the financial 
year increased by 18.4% to £6.9m 
(2004: £5.8m) and the net cash 
outflow before financing and 
management of liquid resources 
was £8.2m which is an increase of 
15.6% over 2004 (2004: £7.1m). 
Chief Financial Officer’s statement
In line with our business model,  
going forward we will maintain focus  
on delivery of strong gross margins. 
Richard Ralph, Chief Financial Officer Ubiquity Software Corporation PLC Annual report and financial statements 2005 Ubiquity Software Corporation PLC Annual report and financial statements 2005  Treasury 
Ubiquity’s strong cash position is 
largely due to the successful float 
of the Company on AIM in May 
2005, raising £18.6m in net cash 
proceeds. At the year-end, total 
cash and short-term investments 
were £16.3m, of which £5.3m was 
held in bank accounts with less 
than 7 days to maturity. A further 
£11.0m was held in money market 
deposit accounts.
Ubiquity has operations outside  
of the United Kingdom and as 
such is exposed to exchange-rate 
movements. To protect cash  
flows against high levels of  
exchange-rate risk the Group 
maintains the majority of its  
short-term monetary assets in 
sterling and pursues a natural 
hedge between local currency 
receipts and payments wherever 
possible. Whenever possible, 
once this natural hedge has been 
satisfied, funds are held in sterling 
to minimise any foreign exchange 
risk arising from the consolidation 
of overseas operations. At this 
point, the Group does not enter 
into any foreign-exchange or 
derivative contracts to hedge 
foreign exchange exposures. 
Through 2005, the Group’s 
treasury policy has been to 
maintain a minimum of £10m 
invested at fixed interest rates in 
order to provide protection 
against fluctuating interest rates. 
Balance Sheet
At the year-end, debtors had 
increased to £4.3m (2004: £2.8m), 
of which approximately £2.1m 
relates to trade debtors and  
£1.3m relating to research  
and development tax credits. 
Creditors also increased to £2.2m 
at the end of 2005 (2004: £1.7m) 
and included £0.6m of deferred 
revenue which will be largely 
recognised during 2006.

distribution of the annual financial statements to all employees. In January 2006, a Group-wide share scheme 
was incepted that is open to all employees and allows them to save a set amount per month, over a three- 
year period that can be exchanged for the option to purchase shares in the Company at an agreed price  
below the year-end market value.
Auditors
Deloitte & Touche LLP have indicated their willingness to continue in office as the Company’s auditors and  
a resolution for their reappointment will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

Directors’ report continued Ubiquity Software Corporation PLC Annual report and financial statements 2005 Ubiquity Software Corporation PLC Annual report and financial statements 2005 15
The Board of Directors recognises the value of ensuring good corporate governance. Although, as an AIM 
listed Company, Ubiquity is not required to comply with the provisions of the Combined Code, and does not 
comply with those provisions, the Board of Directors is committed to applying the principles relevant to a 
Company of its size. The statement below describes the framework for corporate governance and internal 
controls that the directors have established. 
The Board and committees
The Board of Directors comprises a non-executive Chairman, three non-executive directors and two executive 
directors. The positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are separated and have clearly defined roles. 
While none of the directors meets the Code’s definition of independence, the Board considers that the current 
composition provides the right balance of experience and does not consider it necessary to appoint a senior 
independent director.
The Board of Directors is collectively responsible for the overall success of the Group and has a formal 
schedule of matters reserved for its approval. The Board calendar of meetings is set out at the beginning  
of the financial year and each Board meeting is preceded by a clear agenda and any relevant information is 
provided to the Board in advance of the meeting. 
Given the small size of the Board, and as permitted by the Code, the Board has not appointed a Nominations 
Committee. The Board as a whole considers the appointment of all directors and chief officers. The Articles  
of Association of the Company require directors to submit themselves for re-election at the first Annual 
General Meeting following their appointment and every three years by rotation. In accordance with good 
practice, one third of directors will be submitted for re-election annually. 
The Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises David Seibel (Chairman), Randl Shure and Simon Gibson. The Committee 
operates under written terms of reference and meets as often as required in order to discharge its duties  
but at a minimum of three times a year in accordance with the financial calendar. The Group Chief Executive 
Officer and Group Chief Financial Officer are invited to attend all meetings as well as senior staff of the 
external auditors although the Committee reserves the right to ask any of these individuals to withdraw  
from the meeting. The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the integrity of the financial systems, 
reviewing the Group’s management reports and financial statements and its internal financial controls. This  
is achieved primarily through a review of the annual and interim financial statements and a review of the  
nature and scope of the external audit. The Committee is also responsible for reviewing and monitoring the 
external auditors’ independence and objectivity and proposing the appointment of the external auditors  
to the Board. The Audit Committee has also considered the need for an internal audit function, but has 
resolved that, due to the size of the Group, this is not required at present. 
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises Simon Gibson (Chairman), Randl Shure and David Seibel. The  
report on directors’ remuneration provides a detailed description of the remuneration policy, and the 
directors’ emoluments, shareholdings and share options. 
Relations with shareholders
The Board of Directors seeks to ensure that shareholders are regularly informed about the Group and its 
activities. Comprehensive annual and interim reports are issued to all shareholders and there is frequent 
dialogue with institutional investors including presentations following interim and annual results 
announcements. 
Further information about the Group, its strategy and overall performance can be found on the Company’s 
website (www.ubiquitysoftware.com) which includes copies of the Company’s press releases. 
Corporate governance statement Ubiquity Software Corporation PLC Annual report and financial statements 2005 16 Ubiquity Software Corporation PLC Annual report and financial statements 2005
Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s systems of internal control and the monitoring of its 
effectiveness. Although no system of internal control can provide absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss, the Group’s systems are designed to provide the directors with reasonable assurance 
that issues are identified on a timely basis and dealt with appropriately.
 
The Group has an established organisational structure with clearly defined lines of authority, responsibility  
and accountability, which is reviewed regularly. Group management are responsible for the identification and 
evaluation of key risks applicable to their areas of business. 
The external auditors are engaged to express an opinion on the financial statements. They review the  
systems of internal financial controls and data contained in the financial statements, and discuss with 
management the reporting of operational results and the financial condition of the Group, to the extent 
necessary to express their audit opinion.
Going concern
The directors, having made appropriate enquiries, consider that the Company and the Group have sufficient 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and therefore it is appropriate that 
the going concern basis is adopted in preparing the financial statements. 
Corporate governance statement continued Ubiquity Software Corporation PLC Annual report and financial statements 2005 Ubiquity Software Corporation PLC Annual report and financial statements 2005 17
Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7S of the Companies Act 1985. The report 
describes how the Board has applied the principles relating to directors’ remuneration. As required by the  
Act, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at 
which the financial statements will be approved.
The regulations require the auditors to report to the Company’s members on the auditable part of the 
directors’ remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. The report has therefore been divided into separate 
sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises Simon Gibson (Chairman), David Seibel and Randl Shure. These 
directors were the only members of the Committee during the year.
The Committee meets as often as is necessary in order for it to discharge its duties and is responsible  
for determining all aspects of remuneration for executive directors and other senior managers. The  
fees of the executive directors are determined by the Board as a whole. No director or employee  
has a role in determining his own remuneration. 
In determining the directors’ and executives’ remuneration for the year, the Committee consulted Ian  
McLaren (Chief Executive), Richard Ralph (Chief Financial Officer) and Emma Gardner (Group Human 
Resources Director) about its proposals.
Remuneration policy
The Committee determines overall policy for executive remuneration. It sets levels of remuneration to  
attract, retain and motivate executive directors and other senior managers and, in doing so, takes into  
account the level of remuneration throughout the industry, personal performance and independently 
compiled salary survey information. Employees throughout the Group have performance reviews annually.
The main elements of executive directors’ and senior managers’ remuneration are:
A competitive base salary.
An annual performance bonus.
Benefits in kind.
Share options.
The Group operates a discretionary bonus scheme. The scheme applies to directors, senior managers  
and certain other employees. Payments under the scheme to executive directors and senior managers  
are dependent on a combination of financial objectives and other individual targets. 
Permanent health insurance is in place for all employees of the Company and other customary benefits such  
as company cars, car allowances and life assurance are made available as appropriate. 
The Group has four share options schemes – the approved share option scheme, the unapproved share  
option scheme, the EMI scheme and an employee share ownership scheme. All employees are eligible to 
participate in these schemes. Full details of options granted under the schemes are given in note 15 to the 
financial statements.

United Kingdom company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year 
which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at the end of the 
financial year and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those financial statements,  
the directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed. 
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for the system of internal control, for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities Ubiquity Software Corporation PLC Annual report and financial statements 2005 22 Ubiquity Software Corporation PLC Annual report and financial statements 2005
Independent Auditors’ report
to the members of Ubiquity Software Corporation PLC (formerly Ubiquity Software Corporation Limited)
We have audited the Group and individual Company financial statements (the ‘financial statements’) of 
Ubiquity Software Corporation PLC for the year-ended 31 December 2005 which comprise the consolidated 
profit and loss account, the combined statement of movement in shareholders’ funds and reconciliation of 
movements on reserves, the balance sheets, the consolidated cash flow statement and the related notes 1  
to 21. These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the 
Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s  
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose.  
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance  
with applicable United Kingdom law and United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice are set  
out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant United Kingdom legal and 
regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view in accordance 
with the relevant framework and are properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also 
report if, in our opinion, the directors’ report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the Company  
has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and transactions  
with the Company and other members of the Group is not disclosed. We have also audited the information  
in the part of the directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
We read the other information within the Annual Report, and consider whether it is consistent with the  
audited financial statements. The other information comprises only the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief 
Executive’s Statement, the Chief Financial Officer’s Statement, the Director’s Report and the Corporate 
Governance Statement. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent 
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend  
to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued  
by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to  
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant 
estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements and of  
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the circumstances of the Company and the Group, 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we 
considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or  
error. In forming our opinion, we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in  
the financial statements. Ubiquity Software Corporation PLC Annual report and financial statements 2005 Ubiquity Software Corporation PLC Annual report and financial statements 2005 23
Opinion
In our opinion:
 the financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice, of the state of affairs of the Group and the individual Company as at 31 December 
2005 and of the loss of the Group for the year then ended; and
 the financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report described as having been 
audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

1. Accounting policies
The	 financial	 statements	 are	 prepared	 in	 accordance	 with	 applicable	 United	 Kingdom	 accounting	 standards.	 The	 particular	 accounting	 policies	 adopted,	 which	 have	 been	 applied	 consistently	 throughout	 the	 financial	 year	 and	 the	 prior	 financial	 year,	 are	 described	 below.
Accounting convention
The	 financial	 statements	 are	 prepared	 under	 the	 historical	 cost	 convention.
Basis of consolidation
The	 consolidated	 financial	 statements	 incorporate	 the	 financial	 statements	 of	 the	 Company	 and	 all	 its	 subsidiaries.
No	 profit	 and	 loss	 account	 has	 been	 presented	 for	 the	 parent	 Company	 as	 permitted	 by	 section	 230	 	 of	 the	 Companies	 Act	 1985.	 The	 loss	 attributable	 to	 members	 of	 the	 Company	 for	 the	 period	 is	 £7 ,929,000	 (2004:	 £5,990,000).
Presentation of financial instruments
The	 Company	 has	 adopted	 Financial	 Reporting	 Standard	 25	 during	 2005.	 The	 transitional	 provisions	 include	 an	 exemption	 from	 restating	 comparative	 information	 in	 the	 first	 year	 of	 adoption.	 Had	 FRS	 25	 been	 applied	 retrospectively	 to	 the	 results	 for	 the	 year-ended	 31	 December	 2004,	 convertible	 preference	 shares	 with	 a	 nominal	 value	 of	 £9,270,000	 would	 have	 been	 reclassified	 to	 include	 a	 proportion	 as	 a	 liability	 and	 a	 proportion	 (representing	 the	 value	 of	 the	 conversion	 feature)	 as	 equity.	 The	 preference	 shares	 were	 all	 converted	 to	 ordinary	 shares	 in	 May	 2005	 and,	 accordingly,	 the	 adoption	 of	 FRS	 25	 has	 no	 impact	 at	 31	 December	 2005.
Turnover
Turnover	 represents	 amounts	 derived	 from	 the	 Group’s	 principal	 activity,	 being	 that	 of	 software	 development,	 exclusive	 of	 value	 added	 tax.	 Revenue	 is	 recognised	 for	 each	 of	 the	 Group’s	 revenue	 streams	 as	 follows:
Revenue stream Recognition
Trials	 (the	 provision	 of	 software	 for	 a	 specified	 period)	 On 	 delivery
Software	 platform	 sales	 (licences)	 for	 live	 deployment	 On 	 delivery
Support	 and	 upgrades	 for	 a	 contracted	 period	 of	 time	 Spread 	 over	 the	 specified	 period
Professional	 services	 and	 training	 On	 provision	 of	 the	 service
Long-term	 software	 developments	 Over	 the	 period	 of	 the	 contract,	 in	 proportion	 	 	 to	 the	 amount	 of	 work	 done
In	 the	 case	 of	 minimum	 commitment	 reseller	 agreements,	 where	 the	 level	 of	 actual	 sales	 does	 not	 reach	 the	 minimum	 annual	 level,	 the	 minimum	 annual	 revenue	 provided	 for	 in	 the	 agreement	 is	 recognised	 evenly	 over	 the	 period	 covered	 by	 the	 agreement.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible	 fixed	 assets	 are	 stated	 at	 cost,	 net	 of	 depreciation	 and	 any	 provision	 for	 impairment.	 Depreciation	 is	 provided	 on	 all	 tangible	 fixed	 assets	 at	 rates	 calculated	 to	 write	 off	 the	 cost,	 less	 estimated	 residual	 value,	 of	 each	 asset	 on	 a	 straight-line	 basis	 over	 its	 expected	 useful	 life,	 as	 follows:
Fixtures	 and	 fittings	 –	 25%
Computer	 equipment	 –	 50%
Intangible fixed assets
Intangible	 fixed	 assets	 are	 stated	 at	 cost,	 net	 of	 depreciation	 and	 any	 provision	 for	 impairment.	 Depreciation	 is	 provided	 on	 all	 intangible	 fixed	 assets	 at	 rates	 calculated	 to	 write	 off	 the	 cost,	 less	 estimated	 residual	 value,	 of	 each	 asset	 on	 a	 straight-line	 basis	 over	 its	 expected	 useful	 life,	 as	 follows:
Trademarks	 –	 25%
Notes to the financial statements
Year-ended 31 December 2005 Ubiquity Software Corporation PLC Annual report and financial statements 2005 30 Ubiquity Software Corporation PLC Annual report and financial statements 2005
1. Accounting policies continued
Investments
Investments	 held	 as	 fixed	 assets	 are	 stated	 at	 cost	 less	 provision	 for	 impairment.
Taxation
Current	 tax	 is	 provided	 at	 amounts	 expected	 to	 be	 paid	 (or	 recovered)	 using	 the	 tax	 rates	 and	 laws	 that	 have	 been	 enacted	 or	 substantively	 enacted	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date.	 Deferred	 taxation	 is	 provided	 in	 full	 on	 timing	 differences	 that	 result	 in	 an	 obligation	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 	 date	 to	 pay	 more	 tax,	 or	 a	 right	 to	 pay	 less	 tax,	 at	 a	 future	 date,	 at	 rates	 expected	 to	 apply	 when	 they	 	 crystallise	 based	 on	 current	 tax	 rates	 and	 law.	 Timing	 differences	 arise	 from	 the	 inclusion	 of	 items	 of	 income	 and	 expenditure	 in	 taxation	 computations	 in	 periods	 different	 from	 those	 in	 which	 they	 are	 included	 in	 the	 financial	 statements.
Deferred	 tax	 assets	 are	 recognised	 to	 the	 extent	 that	 it	 is	 regarded	 as	 more	 likely	 than	 not	 that	 they	 will	 be	 recovered.	 Deferred	 tax	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 are	 not	 discounted.
Leases
Rentals	 under	 operating	 leases	 are	 charged	 to	 profit	 and	 loss	 in	 equal	 amounts	 over	 the	 lease	 term.	 A	 provision	 has	 been	 recognised	 for	 onerous	 lease	 based	 on	 the	 expected	 lease	 payments	 which	 will	 not	 be	 recovered	 by	 a	 sub-lease	 of	 the	 property.
Research and development
Research	 and	 development	 expenditure	 is	 charged	 to	 the	 profit	 and	 loss	 account	 as	 incurred.
Foreign currency
Transactions	 denominated	 in	 foreign	 currencies	 are	 translated	 into	 the	 functional	 currency	 at	 the	 rates	 ruling	 	 at	 the	 date	 of	 the	 transaction.	 Foreign	 currency	 balances	 are	 translated	 at	 the	 rate	 ruling	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date.	 These	 translation	 differences	 are	 dealt	 with	 in	 the	 profit	 and	 loss	 account.
The	 foreign	 subsidiaries	 are	 translated	 using	 the	 temporal	 method	 under	 SSAP	 20.
The	 balance	 sheets	 of	 the	 foreign	 subsidiaries	 are	 translated	 into	 sterling	 at	 the	 closing	 rates	 of	 exchange	 for	 each	 period	 whilst	 the	 profit	 and	 loss	 accounts	 are	 translated	 into	 sterling	 at	 the	 average	 rates	 of	 exchange	 	 for	 the	 period.	 The	 resulting	 translation	 differences	 are	 taken	 to	 the	 consolidated	 profit	 and	 loss	 account.
2. Analysis of turnover, loss before taxation, and net assets
The	 turnover,	 loss	 before	 taxation	 and	 net	 assets	 are	 attributable	 to	 the	 Group’s	 principal	 activity.
The	 geographical	 analysis	 by	 destination	 of	 the	 Group’s	 turnover	 is	 as	 follows:

	 	 	 	 	 As	 described	 in	 the	 Chief	 Financial	 Officer’s	 Statement,	 the	 basis	 for	 estimating	 the	 income	 receivable	 from	 research	 and	 development	 tax	 credits	 from	 recognition	 on	 a	 cash	 received	 basis	 to	 accruing	 income	 for	 	 claims	 submitted	 and	 expected	 to	 be	 submitted	 based	 on	 qualifying	 research	 and	 development	 costs	 incurred	 up	 to	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date.
Factors that may affect the future tax charge
A	 deferred	 tax	 asset	 has	 not	 been	 recognised	 in	 respect	 of	 timing	 differences	 relating	 to	 trading	 losses	 	 carried	 forward	 and	 accelerated	 depreciation,	 as	 there	 is	 currently	 insufficient	 evidence	 that	 the	 asset	 	 will	 be	 recovered	 in	 the	 short	 term.	 The	 amount	 of	 the	 asset	 not	 recognised	 is	 approximately	 £5,200,000	 	 (2004:	 £3,300,000).	 The	 asset	 would	 be	 recovered	 if	 sufficient	 trading	 profits	 were	 to	 arise	 in	 the	 future.

Currency exposures
As	 explained	 on	 page	 10	 in	 the	 Chief	 Financial	 Officer’s	 statement,	 the	 Group’s	 objectives	 in	 managing	 currency	 exposure	 arising	 from	 its	 overseas	 trade	 and	 operations	 are	 to	 minimise	 its	 exposure	 by	 firstly	 maintaining	 the	 majority	 of	 it’s	 short-term	 monetary	 assets	 in	 sterling,	 and	 secondly	 by	 pursuing	 a	 natural	 hedge	 between	 local	 currency	 receipts	 and	 payables	 whenever	 possible.
The	 Group	 consolidates	 foreign	 subsidiaries	 using	 the	 temporal	 method.	 Gains	 and	 losses	 arising	 from	 these	 structural	 currency	 exposures	 are	 recognised	 in	 the	 profit	 and	 loss	 account.
The	 table	 below	 shows	 the	 Group’s	 currency	 exposures;	 in	 other	 words,	 those	 transactional	 exposures	 described	 above	 that	 give	 rise	 to	 the	 net	 currency	 gains	 and	 losses	 recognised	 in	 the	 profit	 and	 loss	 account.	 Such	 exposures	 comprise	 monetary	 assets	 and	 monetary	 liabilities	 of	 the	 Group	 that	 are	 not	 denominated	 in	 the	 operating	 (or	 ‘functional’)	 currency	 of	 the	 Group.	 As	 at	 31	 December	 2005	 these	 exposures	 were	 as	 follows:	 Net foreign currency monetary assets/(liabilities) 
	 	 	 Euro	 US	 $	 Canadian 	 $	 Total	 Currency	 	 	 £000	 £000	 £000	 £000

Other	 current	 liabilities	 	 	 (5)	 (227)	 (97)	 (329)
For	 comparative	 purposes,	 as	 at	 31	 December	 2004	 these	 exposures	 were	 as	 follows:
Net foreign currency monetary assets/(liabilities)

As	 at	 31	 December	 2005,	 the	 Group	 held	 no	 currency	 swaps,	 forward	 contracts	 or	 other	 derivatives	 to	 	 manage	 these	 currency	 exposures.
As	 at	 31	 December	 2004,	 the	 Group	 had	 an	 outstanding	 financial	 commitment	 under	 a	 forward	 exchange	 contract	 to	 purchase	 US$1,500,000	 for	 £778,776.	 The	 contract	 matured	 on	 4	 January	 2005.

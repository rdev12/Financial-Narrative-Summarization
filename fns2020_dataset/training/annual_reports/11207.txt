2007 was another excellent year for the Norman
Hay Group with underlying operating profits up 16% 
on the previous year.
Our continuing success results from streamlining our
lower margin operating units in the UK, coupled with 
a drive to increase international revenues.
This focus has exposed the improved high margins we 
are able to achieve in the niche chemical businesses 
in which we specialise and which we are developing
around the world.
Dividends
A final dividend for the year of 2.6p is proposed 
(2006: 2.0p) making the total for the year 4.4p, an
increase of 33% on the preceding year’s total of 3.3p.
If approved at the Annual General Meeting to be held
on 18 June 2008, the dividend will be paid on 25 July
2008 to shareholders on the register on 20 June 2008.
Business Overview- a focus on 
chemical excellence
Norman Hay plc’s strength lies in our niche chemical
businesses. Their names and brands are recognised and
respected around the world. 
The Group comprises three main chemical divisions:
Surface Coatings — “Armourcote”
Automotive Sealants — “Ultraseal”
Construction Sealants — “TAM International”
These three primary divisions are supported by the
engineering operation, which manufactures specialist
process plant and equipment.
Business in the UK for our sub-contract surface coating
services has remained strong and we are reaching out
to service the requirements of our multi-national
customers by investing in operations overseas. 
In November 2007 we acquired Hi-Tech Coatings 
in Perth, Western Australia and in the second 
quarter of 2008 we announced the opening of our 
new Armourcote facility in Port Klang, Malaysia. 
These businesses will jointly service the growing
requirements of the oil and gas exploration industries
of the region.
International demand for our Ultraseal range of
recyclable impregnation sealants for the automotive
industry remains strong with new installations in
Europe, India and China.
Our acquisition of TAM International at the end of 2006
has allowed us to enter the construction industry, a
new and significant market place for the Group. 
During the year we have invested in strengthening
TAM’s technical, manufacturing and marketing
infrastructure so as to allow the business to expand
substantially over the next few years.
The engineering business, an amalgamation of all of
the Group’s historic plant manufacturing operations,
has performed well this year. 
Well known and respected for the quality of its
engineering design, the business has continued to
develop its strong customer base worldwide.
Staff
As the Group grows and we welcome new colleagues
from around the globe to our operations, I would like 
to thank all those working in our existing businesses.
Their hard work and dedication and, in many cases,
long service, has allowed us to build the strong base
upon which our international expansion is founded.

Current Position and Outlook
In April of this year, following the sale of our 
BK Engineering business to its management in 2006,
we sold the freehold site in Bedfordshire.
We are still working with Unite plc but, as yet, have 
not been able to secure an acceptable Planning
Consent for student accommodation on our Coventry
city centre site. 
As the City Council continues to review plans for the
renewal of Coventry, our site remains excellently
located for whatever shape that plan eventually takes.
In addition to our AIM listing, the Group’s ordinary
shares were also admitted to trading on PLUS markets
in March 2008, with the same ticker symbol (HNN) as
on AIM. 
This will, I believe, help bring increased liquidity for
shareholders as well as providing greater access to
investors. Norman Hay’s shares will continue to be
quoted and traded on AIM. 
I am pleased to say that the year has started well 
and current trading remains buoyant throughout
the Group. 
Peter L Hay
Chairman
20 May 2008 
The Group has
successfully executed
the initial stage of its 
re-focused strategy 
on specialist chemical
products. We are now
strongly positioned 
to realise the global
opportunities of these
value added growth
markets.

Chief Executive’ s Business Review
Norman Hay Group Review of 2007
I am pleased to report that the Norman Hay Group 
has continued to pursue successfully its strategy of
worldwide growth during 2007.
Financial Performance
The reported profit before tax for the year was £2.34m
representing an 8% increase over last year — another
record for the Group. The Group’s balance sheet remains
strong, with low gearing.
Operations
Our operations are divided into three primary divisions
and brands: 
Specialist surface coatings — “Armourcote”
Automotive sealants — “Ultraseal”
Construction industry sealants — “TAM”
The three primary divisions are supported by Norman
Hay Engineering, manufacturers of chemical process
plant and equipment. Each division contains various
respected sub-brands and products.
Our three World Leading
Chemical Brands are:
77354 Pre  19/5/08  18:41  Page 6 A NNUAL R EP ORT 20 07
Specialist Surface Coatings: Armourcote
Brand: Armourcote
Surface Coatings are designed to inhibit corrosion and
provide surface release for marine, petro-chemical,
general engineering and sterile food manufacturing
equipment. The Armourcote brand is one of the strongest
names in the market place. 
Leeds-based Armourcote was acquired in 1988 along
with surface finishing businesses in Coventry and East
Kilbride which now operate under the name of Surface
Technology plc.
Armourcote’s reputation is founded on consistent high
quality, attention to detail and the ability to handle
components of all sizes; this differentiates Armourcote
from the competition. It specialises in solving problems
and providing the technical expertise that our
customers have come to expect from us. 
As well as operating from our Leeds headquarters,
where the process development centre is located, the
Armourcote range of coatings is offered through a
growing number of sub-contract business locations.
These Surface Technology sub-contract centres operate
in the UK from sites in Scotland, Leeds, Coventry and
Slough, giving us the ability to respond rapidly to
customer needs throughout the Country. 
As our major oil tool customers expand their operations
in South East Asia, Armourcote’s strategic focus has
been on opportunities to provide process facilities on 
a global basis. 
In the second quarter of 2008, the new Armourcote
facility in Malaysia became operational. This facility
will complement Hi-Tech Coatings located in Perth,
Western Australia, which Norman Hay acquired in
November 2007. 
The Oil and Gas exploration and extraction industries
which we serve are becoming increasingly active in the
waters off the western coast of Australia, stretching up
to the Malaysian Peninsula. Together, our two new
operations will service the needs of our Oil Tool
customers in providing the range of Armourcote
coatings required to protect their components 
working in these hostile marine environments.
In December 2007 we acquired the remaining minority
shareholding of APC Ltd, and we are in the process of
relocating the operation from Bradford to a new facility
close to our Armourcote business in Leeds.
The Surface Coatings division continues to produce
excellent results. The integration of Hi-Tech Coatings
and the opening of the new Malaysian business give a
positive outlook for 2008 as we expand into promising
emerging markets.

Automotive Sealants: Ultraseal
Brands: Ultraseal/Rexeal/MX
Ultraseal International is a global leader in providing
practical solutions to the ubiquitous problem of micro
porosity in metal castings, using a process known as
resin impregnation. Norman Hay plc acquired Ultraseal 
in 1999.
Ultraseal is the acknowledged world leader in its field,
providing consumable sealant and capital vacuum
impregnation equipment to a global customer base
predominantly in the automotive sector.
The focus and commitment to the automotive industry
is demonstrated by the strategic location of a wholly
owned subsidiary in the Detroit area of USA, a sales 
and distribution office in Tokyo, a joint venture and
manufacturing facility in India and, more recently, 
by establishing licensee and joint venture companies 
in the rapidly expanding Chinese market. 
Ultraseal is also world renowned for the development
and supply of the only globally approved recycling
sealant. 
The Research and Development programme in its
Coventry laboratories continues to focus on advanced
products that are not only more environmentally
friendly but which also have less overall requirement
on energy consumption, thus reducing the carbon
footprint for this sector of industry.
Ultraseal has an excellent, technically supported, sales
and distribution network worldwide. A key part of its
strategy is to seek out additional companies whose
products could be added to its global offering to the
automotive industry. 
Ultraseal produced good profits in 2007 and the
demand for impregnation sealants remains strong.
Construction Industry Sealants: TAM
Brands: TamPur/TamAcryl/TamSil/
TamSeal/TamCrete
TAM International is a world leader in structural
waterproofing using specialist polymers and epoxies.
Norman Hay plc acquired 75% of TAM International in
December 2006.
TAM has manufactured and supplied specialist
chemicals and waterproofing products for the
construction and building industry for over 25 years.
It has sales, distribution and manufacturing activities
strategically located worldwide to serve the global
construction industry. The main manufacturing sites
are  in the UK and Australia, with smaller blending
facilities in Singapore and Hong Kong.
The world market for construction chemicals is
estimated to be in the region of $2.0bn. TAM operates
in niche product areas, bringing the opportunity to
grow substantially both organically and geographically.
TAM is currently in the process of reviewing a variety 
of manufacturing and distribution opportunities,
including joint ventures, in the Gulf States, India,
Taiwan and other emerging markets. 
Sales grew during 2007 as a strategic review of the
business was undertaken. TAM made a modest
contribution to overall Group profits in the year 
as we invested in a stronger sales and marketing
capability designed to support our high expectations
for the future.

Chemical Process Plant and Equipment:
Norman Hay Engineering
Norman Hay Engineering, our process plant operation,
manufactures capital plant and equipment under the

predominantly for the automotive industry. 
Plasticraft and PMD branded metal processing plants 
are designed for aerospace, automotive and general
engineering customers and are complemented by 
the Ardrox range of NDT (non-destructive testing) 
crack detection machines.
Summary
Norman Hay plc is sharply
focused on industries and
customers that value its
unique products, innovative
technologies and processes.
We will actively continue
to seek out opportunities
for acquisitions, joint
ventures, and new
partnerships with
distributors, to support
our worldwide growth.

Report of the Directors
11
The Directors have pleasure in submitting their annual
report and audited financial statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2007.
Results and dividends
The Group Income Statement is set out on page 16 
and shows revenue for the year of £24.0m and profits 
on ordinary activities before tax of £2.34m.
Revenue has risen 18% whilst pre tax profits are up 
by 7.7%.
Business review
The business information on pages 2 and 3 and the
Chairman’s Statement and Chief Executive’s Business
Review on pages 4-9, provide detailed information
relating to the Group and the operation and
development of the business for the year ended
31 December 2007.
Principal risks and uncertainties
During the last year, the Group has continued 
to execute strategies to optimise business
opportunities and minimise exposure to principal 
risks and uncertainties.
We have now established the Group framework 
built on three separate business divisions:- Surface
Coatings; Automotive Sealants; and Construction
Sealants, and have extended our global reach to
improve our geographical presence.
As the Group expands worldwide there is a potential
risk of financial loss or damage to our reputation
resulting from inadequate, or failed internal processes
and systems, or the actions of people or external
events. The Group manages these potential risks
through appropriate controls and loss mitigation
actions. Examples include:
taking sufficient insurance cover, including business
interruption;
maintaining disaster recovery plans for all 
major sites;
maintaining rigorous data backup procedures;
carrying out a regular review of the principal
suppliers and customers of the Group, and how
each impacts on the Group’s business;
regularly reviewing performance against budgets
and forecasts; and
establishing clearly defined procedures for the
authorisation of major new investments and
commitments.
The Board and management teams continue to
monitor potential risk areas and adjust tactical and
strategic plans accordingly to protect our businesses.
Another key element and principal risk of managing
the Group’s growth is our personnel. It is important
that the Group succeeds in attracting, developing and
retaining, qualified, experienced and motivated staff
worldwide.
The Board of Directors of Norman Hay accept their
collective responsibility in providing health and safety
leadership and regard the effective management of
health and safety risks as key to the fulfilment of the
Group’s business objectives.
Financial Instruments
Details of the use of Financial Instruments and

reasonably practicable, there is a working environment
which will minimise the risk to health and safety of its 
employees and those persons who are authorised 
to be on its premises.
The Group continues to give full and fair consideration
to applications for employment from disabled persons,
having regard to their particular aptitudes and abilities.
If an employee becomes disabled, the Group endeavours
to continue his or her employment if this is practicable
and, in appropriate cases, special training may be given.

Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper
accounting records which disclose with reasonable
accuracy at any time the financial position of the
Group, for safeguarding the assets of the Company, 
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and
detection of fraud and other irregularities and for the
preparation of a Directors’ Report which complies with
the requirements of the Companies Act 1985.
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual
report and the financial statements in accordance 
with the Companies Act 1985. The Directors are 
also required to prepare financial statements for the
Group in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European 
Union (IFRS) and the rules of the London Stock
Exchange for companies trading securities on the
Alternative Investment Market. The Directors have
chosen to prepare financial statements for the Group
holding company, Norman Hay plc (the Company), in
accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice (UK GAAP).
Group financial statements
International Accounting Standard 1 requires 
that financial statements present fairly for each
financial year the Group’s financial position, financial
performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful
representation of the effects of transactions, other
events and conditions in accordance with the
definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities,
income and expenses set out in the International
Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the
preparation and presentation of financial statements’.
In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will 
be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRS. 
A fair presentation also requires the  Directors to:
consistently select and apply appropriate
accounting policies;
present information, including accounting 
policies, in a manner that provides relevant, 
reliable, comparable and understandable
information; and
provide additional disclosures when compliance
with the specific requirements in IFRS is
insufficient to enable users to understand the
impact of particular transactions, other events and
conditions on the entity’s financial position and
financial performance. 
Parent Company financial statements
Company law requires the Directors to prepare
financial statements for each financial year which 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for
that period. In preparing these financial statements,
the Directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply
them consistently;
prepare the financial statements on a going concern
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
Company will continue in business; 
make judgments and estimates that are reasonable
and prudent; and
state whether applicable accounting standards have
been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the financial statements.
Financial statements are published on the Group’s
website in accordance with legislation in the United
Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination
of financial statements, which may vary from
legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance and
integrity of the Group’s website is the responsibility of
the Directors. The Directors’ responsibility also extends
to the ongoing integrity of the financial statements
contained therein.

Norman Hay plc for the year ended 31 December 2007,
which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement,

Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the Consolidated
Statement of Recognised Income and Expense, and the
related notes. These financial statements have been
prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual
Report and Accounts and Group Financial Statements 
in accordance with applicable law and International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by 
the European Union and for preparing the parent
Company financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting
Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice) are set out in the in the 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements 
in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the
financial statements give a true and fair view and 
have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985 and whether the information
given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with those
financial statements. We also report to you if, in our
opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting
records, if we have not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, or if information
specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and
other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the 
Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent
with the audited financial statements. The other
information comprises the Financial Highlights, the
Business Divisions, the Worldwide Presence, the
Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Business
Review, the Directors and Advisers and the Report
of the Directors. We consider the implications for 
our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the
financial statements. Our responsibilities do not
extend to any other information.
Our report has been prepared pursuant to the
requirements of the Companies Act 1985 and for no
other purpose. No person is entitled to rely on this

Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland)
issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence
relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. It also includes an assessment of the
significant estimates and judgments made by the
Directors in the preparation of the financial statements,
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate
to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all
the information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to
give reasonable assurance that the financial statements
are free from material misstatement, whether caused
by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our
opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
the Group financial statements give a true and fair
view, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the
European Union, of the state of the Group’s affairs
as at 31 December 2007 and of its profit for the
year then ended;
the parent Company financial statements give a
true and fair view, in accordance with United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice,
of the state of the parent Company’s affairs as at
31 December 2007;

1  Accounting policies
Accounting convention
The Group previously reported its financial statements under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (GAAP). From 
1 January 2007 the Group is required to prepare its financial statements in accordance with EU endorsed International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), International Accounting Standards (IAS) and Interpretations (IFRIC and SIC), (“Endorsed
IFRS”) and , with those parts of the Companies Act 198 to 5 companies preparing financial statements in accordance with IFRS.
The comparative data for year ended 31 December 2006 has been restated and reconciliations are included in Note 33 to
explain the changes. 
The parent Company has not adopted International Financial Reporting Standards. Its results are reported under UK GAAP 
on pages 48 to 56.
First time adoption of IFRS
The Group’s transition date to “Endorsed IFRS” was 1 January 2006, which is the beginning of the comparative period for the
year ended 31 December 2007. The Group has applied IFRS 1 for the first time adoption of Endorsed IFRS, and has elected to
use the following exemptions:
● IFRS 3 has not been applied retrospectively to business combinations that occurred before 1 January 2006.
● Cumulative translation differences for foreign operations have been deemed to be nil at 1 January 2006. Consequently 
any gain or loss arising on a subsequent disposal will exclude translation differences that arose before 1 January 2006.
● IFRS 2 has not been applied to options in issue, which were granted prior to 7 November 2002.
Standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards not yet effective
Certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for
the Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008 or later periods and which the Group has decided not to
adopt early. These are:
● IFRS 8, Operating Segments (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009). This standard sets out
requirements for the disclosure of information about an entity’s operating segments and also about the entity’s products
and services, the geographical areas in which it operates, and its major customers. It replaces IAS 14, Segmental Reporting.
The Group expects to apply this standard in the period beginning on 1 January 2009. As this is a disclosure standard, it will
not have any impact on the results or net assets of the Group.
● IFRS 3, Business combinations and complementary amendments to IAS 27, Consolidated and separate financial statements
(Both effective for accounting periods on or after 1 July 2009). This revised standard and amendments are still to be endorsed
by the EU. The revised IFRS 3 and amendments to IAS 27 arise from a joint project with the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB), the US standards setter, and result in IFRS being largely converged with the related, recently issued, US
requirements. There are very significant changes to the requirements of IFRS, and options available, if accounting for
business combinations. Management is currently assessing the impact of revised IFRS 3 and amendments to IAS 27 on 
the financial statements.
● IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements – a revised approach (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2009). As this is a disclosure standard, it will not have any impact on the results or net assets of the Group. 
It will impact the presentation and format of the primary statements and notes and these disclosures will be revised
accordingly in the 2009 financial statements.
77354 Accounts  19/5/08  20:05  Page 20 A NNUAL R EP ORT 20 07
21
1  Accounting policies (continued)
The following are also standards, interpretations and amendments to published statements not yet effective, but which are
not considered to be relevant to the Group.
● IAS 23, Borrowing costs (Revised) (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009);
● IFRIC 11, IFRS 2, Group and Treasury Share Transactions (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 March 2007);
● IFRIC 12, Service Concession Arrangements (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008);
● IFRIC 13, Customer Loyalty Programmes (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 July 2008);
● IFRIC 14, IAS 19, The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction (effective for
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008);
● Amendments to IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation and IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements – Puttable
Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after
1 January 2009).
The following principal accounting policies have been applied:
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists where the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to
govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The results of subsidiaries
are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Acquisitions are accounted for by the purchase method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value at the date of
exchange of the consideration provided plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Identifiable assets and liabilities of
the acquired business that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the date 
of acquisition. To the extent that the cost of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired the difference 
is recorded as goodwill. 
Transactions between and balances with Group companies are eliminated together with unrealised gains on inter-company
transactions. Accounting policies of acquired companies are changed where necessary to be consistent with those of the Group.
Revenue
Revenue is recognised when performance has occurred and a right to consideration has been obtained. This is normally
when goods have been delivered or services provided to the customer, title and risk of loss have been transferred and
collection of related receivables is probable. Revenue excludes value added and other sales taxes, trade discounts and
intra-group sales.
Long-term contracts are assessed on a contract-by-contract basis. Where the outcome of a long term contract can be estimated
reliably, contract revenue and contract costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity (the
percentage of completion method) at the balance sheet date and profit that is estimated to fairly reflect the profit arising up
to that date. When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised 
as an expense immediately.

N OR M A N H AY P L C

1  Accounting policies (continued)
Research and development
Expenditure on applied research and development is charged to the Income Statement in the year in which it is incurred,
unless such costs should be capitalised under the requirements of the applicable standard. No development projects met the
criteria for capitalisation.
Dividends
The final dividend is only recognised at the point it is declared and approved by the shareholders at the Annual General
Meeting. Interim dividends are recognised on payment.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on an acquisition of an undertaking is the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid 
and the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired. Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment
at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Income Statement and is not subsequently reversed. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units expected to benefit from
the synergies of combination. Cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or
more frequently where there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit
is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill
allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. 
On disposal of a subsidiary the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS (1 January 2006) has been retained at the previous UK
GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment as noted. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior 
to 1998 has not been re-instated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Other intangible assets
Separable intangible assets, such as trademarks, licences and brands are recognised separately from goodwill on all
acquisitions after the date of transition. Brands identified have been assessed as having an indefinite useful life when coupled
with continuing marketing spend to maintain the brand.
Under IFRS all intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is held at cost less accumulated depreciation, although some assets are carried at deemed cost,
being the carrying value of freehold land and buildings as at 31 December 1999. All additions since this date are stated at cost.
Depreciation is provided on property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land and plant in the course of construction, 
at rates calculated to write off the cost or deemed cost, less estimated residual value of each asset, evenly over its expected
useful life as follows:
Freehold buildings 45 years
Long leasehold property Over term of lease
Plant, vehicles and fixtures 3 to 10 years
Computer equipment 2 to 5 years
Impairment tests on the carrying value of property, plant and equipment are undertaken at the end of each year if events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

1  Accounting policies (continued)
Investments available for sale
Investments available for sale are recorded at fair value. Unrealised gains and losses arising on the re-measurement are recorded
in equity. On disposal or impairment of the investments, cumulative gains and losses previously recognised in equity are
transferred to the Income Statement.
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying value and the fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying value will be recovered through the sale transaction rather
than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available
for immediate sale in its present condition and management is committed to the sale, which is expected to qualify for
recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of recognition.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost on a first-in, first-out basis, and net realisable value. Costs incurred in bringing each
product to its present location and condition comprise:
● Raw materials – cost of purchase on a first-in, first-out basis.
● Work in progress and finished goods – cost of raw materials and labour plus attributable overheads based on the normal
level of activity.
● Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less further costs to completion and disposal.
● Provision is made for obsolete and slow moving items.
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are stated initially at fair value then measured at amortised cost less allowances for provisions. Provisions for
impairment are recognised when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to
the original terms of the receivable. Any impairment recorded is the difference between the carrying value of the receivables and
the estimated future cash flows discounted where appropriate. Any impairment required is recorded in the Income Statement.
Leased assets
Assets held under leasing agreements and hire purchase contracts, where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards
of ownership (“finance leases”), are treated as if they had been purchased outright. The amount capitalised is the present
value of the minimum lease payments payable during the lease term. The corresponding leasing commitments are shown as
borrowings. Depreciation over the shorter of the assets’ useful life and the lease term on the relevant assets is charged to the
Income Statement.
Lease payments are analysed between capital and interest components so that the interest element of the payment is 
charged to the Income Statement over the period of the lease and represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital
repayments outstanding. The capital part reduces the amount payable to the lessor.
All other leases are treated as operating leases. Their annual rentals are charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line
basis over the term of the lease.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at their fair value, net of the associated finance costs, and thereafter at amortised cost. 
The associated finance costs are amortised to the Income Statement over the life of the borrowings. Borrowings are classified
as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months
after the Balance Sheet date.

N OR M A N H AY P L C
24
1  Accounting policies (continued)
Provisions
Provision is made for onerous contracts and for product warranty claims when the Group has a present obligation as a result
of past events, and it is more likely than not that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, 
and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are discounted to present value where the impact is significant, using 
a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits at call with banks, and other short term highly liquid investments
that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are considered to be subject to insignificant risk of changes in
value. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings as current liabilities, but included within cash and cash equivalents 
in the Cash Flow Statement.
Foreign currency translation
Functional and presentation currency
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency.
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary
economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency).
Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency of the transacting entity at the foreign exchange
rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange difference arising are recognised in the Income Statement. Foreign
currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the Balance Sheet date.
Group companies
The results of foreign operations are translated into Sterling at the average rate of exchange in the accounting period, and the
assets and liabilities are translated into Sterling at the closing rate at the date of the Balance Sheet. On consolidation the
effect of variances in exchange rates between the beginning and end of the financial year on the opening net investment in
foreign undertakings are taken to the foreign exchange reserve, as are any exchange differences arising through the translation
of results using the average exchange rate.
Current and deferred taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable on the profit for the year, and the deferred tax. Provision 
for taxation is made using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date. 
Deferred tax is provided in full using the Balance Sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising between
the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Except for
differences arising on:
● the initial recognition of goodwill;
● the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the
transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit; and
● investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of
the difference and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred taxation is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply when the related deferred taxation asset is realised
or the related deferred taxation liability is settled.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no
longer probable that sufficient taxable profits are available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.

25
1  Accounting policies (continued)
Employee benefit costs
Share based payments
Where share options are awarded to employees, the fair value of the options at the date of grant is charged to the Income
Statement over the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number 
of equity instruments expected to vest at each Balance Sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised 
over the vesting period is based on the number of options that eventually vest. Market vesting conditions are factored into 
the fair value of the options granted. As long as all other vesting conditions are satisfied, a charge is made irrespective of
whether the market vesting conditions are satisfied. 
Pensions
Contributions to the Group’s defined contribution scheme and to State-managed retirement benefit schemes are charged 
to the Income Statement in the year in which they become payable. 
Critical accounting estimates and judgments
In applying the Group’s accounting policies set out above management is required to make certain estimates and judgments
concerning the future. These judgments are regularly reviewed and updated as necessary. The estimates and judgments that
have the most significant effect on the amounts included in these consolidated financial statements are as follows:
Intangible assets and impairment
The Group is required to test whether goodwill and brands have suffered any impairment. The recoverable amounts of cash
generating units connected to the recorded goodwill and brands have been determined based on value-in-use estimations. 
Revenue recognition – long term contracts
In applying the Group’s accounting policy set out above, if the outcome of a long term contract can be estimated reliably,
contract revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity. These are regularly reviewed
and updated, the actual result could vary from the value used in the Income Statement. However, as these are reviewed on a
monthly basis any difference is not expected to be significant.
Deferred consideration 
Included within assets is an amount of £135,000 (2006: £246,000) due in respect of deferred consideration following the
disposal of the sub-contract impregnation business in 2005. The deferred consideration is calculated based on a percentage
of future revenues of the business which was disposed of, and therefore cannot be estimated with certainty. The amount
recognised in the financial statements is the discounted value of estimated revenues based on a linear projection of
current revenues.
2  Segmental analysis
By primary segment — business group
For management purposes the Group is organised into four main operating divisions. These divisions are the basis on which
the Group reports its primary segment information. The principal activities are as follows:
Surface coating: Application of a range of surface coatings to customers’ products
Automotive sealants: Sealants for use in the engineering industry to counter micro-porosity
Construction sealants: Chemicals for use in the construction industry to prevent the ingress of water and to improve
structure integrity
Plant manufacture: Manufacture of a range of chemical processing plant and equipment

The Group considers its capital to comprise its ordinary share capital, share premium and accumulated retained earnings. In
managing its capital the Group’s primary objective is to ensure its continued ability to provide a consistent return for its equity
shareholders through a combination of capital growth and distributions. 
In order to achieve this objective, the Group monitors its gearing to balance risks and returns at an acceptable level and also 
to maintain a sufficient funding base to enable the Group to meet its working capital and strategic investment needs. In
making decisions to adjust its capital structure to achieve these aims, either through altering its dividend policy, new shares
issues, or the reduction of debt, the Group considers not only its short-term position but also its long-term operational and
strategic objectives.
At 31 December 2007, 266,282 shares were held by the Employee Norman Hay plc  Benefit Trust (2006: nil).
At 31 December 2007 the following options were outstanding, including those relating to Directors, as detailed on page 12
of this Annual Report:
(a)  On 289,850 ordinary shares; these approved options are exercisable between 5 July 2009 and 4 July 2016 at 69p per share.
(b)  On 1,040,150 ordinary shares; these unapproved options are exercisable between 5 July 2006 and 4 July 2016 at 69p per
share upon the share price achieving 250p or a change in control.

Notes
1. The Share premium account represents the difference between the amount paid by shareholders subscribing for new
shares and the nominal value of those shares.
2. The Capital redemption reserve relates to purchases by the Company of its own shares.
3. Other non-distributable reserve arises from elimination of share capital of acquired companies in excess of nominal 
value of shares issued.
4. Reserve for own shares is the sum paid for shares held by the Company’s long term incentive plan.
5. The Foreign exchange reserve arises from fluctuations in the value of net assets denominated in currencies other 
than Sterling.

28  Acquisitions
In November 2007 Surface Technology plc (a trading subsidiary of Norman Hay plc) acquired the entire share capital of Hi-Tech
Coatings Pty Ltd for £380,000.
This acquisition has provided the Group with the opportunity to expand the Armourcote sub-contract surface coatings service
into the Asia/Pacific region in order to support oil and gas customer operations.
It has not been possible to state the revenue and profit before tax of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2007, as
prior to the acquisition the Company’s financial year end was 30 June 2007.
At the time of acquisition the Company held the following net assets:

In addition to the above, a further £101,000 was paid to purchase the minority shareholding in APC Limited.
On 22 December 2006 Norman Hay plc acquired a 75% interest in TAM International Group Holdings Ltd, and its subsidiaries
TAM International UK Ltd, TAM International Hong Kong Ltd, TAM International Singapore Pte, TAM International Australia Pty
for a consideration of £1,816,000. The assets and liabilities are included in the consolidated balance sheet using the acquisition
method of accounting.
The addition of TAM International has strengthened the Group’s diversification by entering the construction and civil
engineering markets and extended our geographical presence through enhanced sales channels leading , to the consideration
paid being in excess of the fair value of the assets acquired.

31  Share-based payment
Norman Hay plc operates two equity-settled share based remuneration schemes for employees: a long term incentive scheme
and an unapproved scheme for Executive Directors and senior management. All UK employees are eligible to participate in 
the long term incentive scheme, the only vesting condition is that the employee remains an employee of the Group over the
savings period.
Under the unapproved scheme, the shares are only exercisable at a share price of 250p or a change in control.

32  Financial instruments – Risk Management
In common with all other businesses, the Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial instruments. This note
describes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks and the methods used to measure them.
Further quantitative information in respect of these risks is presented throughout these financial statements. There have been
no substantive changes in the Group’s exposure to financial instrument risks, its objectives, policies and processes for
managing those risks or the methods used to measure them from previous periods unless otherwise stated in this note.
Principal financial instruments
The principal financial instruments used by the Group, from which financial instrument risk arises, are as follows:
● trade receivables
● cash at bank
● bank overdrafts
● investments in unquoted equity securities (UK and overseas)
● trade and other payables
● floating-rate bank loans
● other loans 
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade receivables, trade and other payables and loans approximate to their
fair values.
The Group is exposed through its operations to the following financial risks:
● Credit risk
● Fair value or cash flow interest rate risk
● Foreign exchange risk
● Other market price risk
● Liquidity risk
General ,     objectives     policies      and    processes
The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Group’s risk management objectives and policies and, whilst
retaining ultimate responsibility for them, it has delegated the authority for designing and operating processes that ensure the
effective implementation of the objectives and policies to the Group’s finance function. The Board receives monthly reports
through which it reviews the effectiveness of the processes put in place and the appropriateness of the objectives and policies
it sets. The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting
the Group’s competitiveness and flexibility. Further details regarding these policies are set out below:
Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its
contractual obligations. The Group is mainly exposed to credit risk from credit sales. It is Group policy, implemented locally, 
to assess the credit risk of new customers before entering into contracts. Such credit ratings are taken into account by local
business practices.
The management of each operating business have established credit policies under which each new customer is analysed
individually for creditworthiness before the Group’s standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. Their
review includes external ratings, when available, and in some cases bank references. Purchase limits are established for each
customer, which represent the maximum open amount without requiring approval from senior management or the Group
Chief Executive if appropriate. These limits are reviewed regularly and customers that fail to meet the Group’s benchmark
creditworthiness may transact with the Group on a prepayment basis.
Credit risk also arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial instruments. Quantitative
disclosures of the credit risk exposure in relation to Trade and other receivables, are disclosed in Note 16.

32  Financial instruments – Risk Management (continued)
Fair value and cash flow interest rate risk 
The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk from long-term borrowings at variable rates. Local operations are not
permitted to borrow long-term from external sources without permission from the Group. During 2007 and 2006, the Group’s
borrowings at variable rate were denominated in Sterling, Hong Kong dollars and Australian dollars.
Foreign exchange risk 
Foreign exchange risk arises because the Group has operations located in various parts of the world whose functional currency
is not the same as the Group functional currency. Although its global market penetration reduces the Group’s operational risk
in that it has diversified into several markets, the Group’s net assets arising from such overseas operations are exposed to
currency risk resulting in gains or losses on retranslation into Sterling. Foreign exchange risk also arises when individual Group
entities enter into transactions denominated in a currency other than their functional currency.
The Group’s policy is, where possible, to allow Group entities to settle liabilities denominated in their functional currency with
the cash generated from their own operations in that currency.
Market risk
Market risk arises from the Group’s use of interest bearing, tradable and foreign currency financial instruments. It is the risk
that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in interest rates (interest
rate risk), foreign exchange rates (currency risk) or other market factors (other price risk).
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of working capital and the finance charges and principal repayments on its
debt instruments. It is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
At 31 December 2007 the Group had unused facilities of £1,249,000 (2006: £1,500,000) including the annual working capital
facility of £1,500,000 which was renewed on 2 January 2008.
The Group’s policy is to ensure that it will always have sufficient cash to allow it to meet its liabilities when they become due.
To achieve this aim, it reviews its forward cash requirement on a monthly basis for a minimum of three months ahead. 
The Board receives cash flow projections on a monthly basis as well as information regarding cash balances. At the Balance
Sheet date, these projections indicated that the Group expected to have sufficient liquid resources to meet its obligations
under all reasonably expected circumstances. The liquidity risk of each Group entity is managed centrally by the Group
treasury function. Each operation has a facility with Group treasury, the amount of the facility being based on budgets. The
budgets are set locally and agreed by the Board in advance, enabling the Group’s cash requirements to be anticipated. Where
facilities of Group entities need to be increased, approval must be sought from the Group Chief Executive. Where the amount
of the facility is above a certain level agreement of the Board is needed.

2 Intangible assets at 31 December 2006 included a sum of £500,000 relating to the value of the TAM brands.
3 Amortisation of goodwill of £50,000 per annum is not required under IFRS as this asset is subject to an annual impairment
review.
4 Under IFRS the revaluation reserve is now transferred to retained earnings.
5 The Bedfordshire site which was leased to the owners of BK Engineering Limited is treated as an ‘asset held for sale’. This
was subsequently sold in April 2008.
6 The revaluation of property gives rise to a liability for deferred tax of £161,000 which is recognised under IFRS.
7 The expense relating to share based payments is not tax deductible at the time of grant and this gives rise to deferred tax
adjustments.
8 The long term element of the debt due in relation to the sale of certain business and assets now is  shown as ‘Other
receivables’ in ‘Non-current assets’ (see Deferred consideration Note 1).
9 Foreign exchange differences arising on translation of overseas subsidiaries are now shown separately.

1  Basis of presentation
The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified to include the revaluation of certain assets, and 
in accordance with applicable UK GAAP and the Companies Act 1985.
2  Summary of significant accounting policies
Accounting convention
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of land 
and buildings and are in accordance with applicable accounting standards. The following principal accounting policies have 
been applied:
Land and buildings
The Company has continued to follow the transitional arrangements of FRS 15 ‘Tangible Fixed Assets’ to retain the carrying
value of freehold land and buildings as at 31 December 1999 as deemed cost. All additions since this date are stated at cost.
Where an asset that was previously revalued is disposed of, its book value is eliminated and an appropriate transfer made 
from the revaluation reserve to the profit and loss reserve.
Depreciation and amortisation
Depreciation and amortisation are provided at rates calculated to write-off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual value 
of each asset, except for freehold land, evenly over its expected useful life as follows:
Freehold buildings 45 years
Plant, vehicles and fixtures 3 to 10 years
Computer equipment 2 to 5 years
Impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill are undertaken at the end of the first full year following acquisition and in
other years if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Investments
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
Foreign currency translation
Where transactions are entered into by an operation, in a currency other than the operation’s functional currency, the
transactions are translated at the rates ruling when they occurred. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are
translated at the rates ruling at the Balance Sheet date. Any differences are taken to the profit and loss account for the year.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax balances are recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by Balance Sheet
date except that;
● deferred tax is not recognised on timing differences arising on revalued properties unless the Group has entered into 
a binding sale agreement and is not proposing to take advantage of rollover relief; and
● the recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to the extent that the Group anticipates making sufficient taxable profits
in the future to absorb the reversal of the underlying timing differences.
Deferred tax balances, arising from underlying timing differences in respect of tax allowances on industrial buildings are
reversed if and when all conditions for retaining those allowances have been met. Deferred tax balances are not discounted.

2  Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Financial Instruments
Financial Instruments are measured initially and subsequently at cost.
The Company’s exposure to credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade debtors and this risk is managed by running credit
checks on new customers and by monitoring payments against contractual agreements.
Our treasury function is carried out on a day to day basis, depositing any surplus funds on the short term money market.
The Company has maintained a long term loan with the Bank of Scotland in order to provide readily accessible cash for future
investments and acquisitions.
The Board considers cash flow projections on a monthly basis.
Share-based payment
Where share options are awarded to employees, the fair value of the options at the date of grant is charged to the profit
and loss account over the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number 
of equity instruments expected to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised 
over the vesting period is based on the number of options that eventually vest. Market vesting conditions are factored 
into the fair value of the options granted. As long as all other vesting conditions are satisfied, a charge is made irrespective 
of whether the market vesting conditions are satisfied. The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to achieve a market
vesting condition.

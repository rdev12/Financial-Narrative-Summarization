Governance
Chairman’s corporate governance report
The Board recognises that effective 
corporate governance is essential for 
delivering long-term value growth and 
for meeting shareholder expectations for 
leadership and oversight of the business. 
With this in mind it has adopted policies 
and procedures which reflect the principles 
of the QCA’s Corporate Governance 
Guidelines for Smaller Quoted Companies 
and the principles and appropriate 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. The Board’s practices reflect the 
Company’s culture and circumstances, 
including size, complexity and risk, and 
it is anticipated that practice in this area 
will continue to evolve as the business 
develops. For this reason, governance 
arrangements are kept under review.
The Board
The Board comprises two Executive 
Directors together with two Non-Executive 
Directors. Our Directors’ biographical 
details can be found on page 13. Both 
Non-Executive Directors are considered 
to be independent and free from any 
material business or other relationships 
which could materially interfere with the 
exercise of their independent judgement.
The Board is responsible for the overall 
strategy of the business and oversight 
of the Company’s performance, risks, 
financial matters and other significant 
issues. The Company’s strategy is 
articulated on pages 8–9.
Supported by the Company Secretary, the 
Board meets regularly and its agendas are 
set to focus on strategy and key decisions 
Board attendance
The Directors of the Company are committed to sound governance of the business and they each devote sufficient time to ensure 
this happens. The table below sets out the attendance statistics for each Director at Board and, where relevant, Committee meetings 
held during the financial year.

and to enable proper monitoring and 
oversight of the business to be undertaken. 
There is a schedule of matters which are 
reserved to the Board and documentation 
in place to clarify the nature and extent 
of delegations. In particular, the division of 
responsibility between the Chairman, who 
is responsible for leading the Board and 
its governance of the Company, and the 
Chief Executive Officer, who is responsible 
for management of the business and 
delivery of the Company’s strategy, is clear.
After a period of change in 2015, the Board 
intends to evaluate formally its performance 
and effectiveness during 2016.
Committees
The Board has established an Audit 
Committee comprising the Company’s 
two Non-Executive Directors, which 
is chaired by Chartered Accountant, 
Scott Christie. The Committee is responsible 
for oversight of the Company’s financial 
statements, risk management, audit and 
auditor relationship, and internal controls 
and procedures. The Audit Committee, 
supported by the Company Secretary, plans 
appropriately on an annual basis in order 
to enable it to discharge its duties as set 
out in its terms of reference. A more 
detailed report from the Audit Committee 
can be found on page 16.
The Board has also established a 
Remuneration Committee to oversee 
remuneration policy and determine 
the remuneration and benefits of the 
Company’s Executive Directors as well as 
other terms relevant to their appointment. 
This Committee also comprises the 
Company’s two Non-Executive Directors 
and is chaired by Scott Christie. Amongst 
other things, during the year the Committee 
has taken external advice on the Company’s 
share based incentive plans and has made 
recommendations to the Board to ensure 
that relevant performance targets are 
aligned with the Company’s strategy and 
are sufficiently stretching. Further details of 
the Remuneration Committee’s work and 
the Company’s remuneration arrangements 
can be found on pages 17–19. Approval 
of the remuneration report will be sought 
at the Company’s Annual General Meeting.
The Board has chosen not to establish 
a Nomination Committee and instead 
will deal with such matters, including 
succession planning and reviewing 
the balance of the Board, itself.
Shareholder relationships
As well as through formal events such as 
the AGM and presentation of the annual 
and half-year results, the Board, primarily 
through the Chief Executive Officer, seeks 
to build a constructive and transparent 
dialogue with the Company’s shareholders 
in order to appreciate better shareholders’ 
views and expectations and to enhance 
investors’ understanding of the Company’s 
strategy and how that strategy will be 
delivered and implemented.
Information on the Company’s investor 
relations website is kept updated and 
provides details of relevant developments, 
regulatory announcements and the 
results of general meetings. Governance Financial statements Strategic report

€3.3m security deposit and has been 
entirely released from any future step-in

Group had also entered into an agreement 
to lend the franchisee €850k in relation 
to the Brussels project. This amount was 
repaid in full during the financial year.

Governance
Audit Committee report
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee members are 
Scott Christie, who is its Chairman, 
and Jonathan Lane OBE. Scott is a 
Chartered Accountant.
The Committee is supported by the 
Company Secretary and held three 
meetings during the year ended 
30 September 2015. The Group’s 
external auditors and Executive Directors 
attend the Committee’s meetings as 
appropriate and the Committee ensures 
that the auditors also have an opportunity 
to speak to the Committee in the 
absence of management.
The Committee’s agendas are planned 
on an annual basis to ensure all the 
Committee’s duties are discharged in 
a timely manner in accordance with 
its terms of reference. As the Group has 
no separate Risk Committee, the Audit 
Committee also has responsibility for 
oversight of the Group’s risk management 
activities. These areas are reported on 
below, with a summary of the principal 
risks and uncertainties faced by the 
business provided on page 12.
Financial statements
The Committee met to review both the 
annual and half-year financial statements 
and to discuss with the external auditors 
the audit plan, including its scope, and the 
findings from their audit work. In particular, 
the auditors’ views on the Group’s results, 
accounting policies and the adequacy 
of financial controls, any unadjusted audit 
differences, post-year end events, 
management responses and materiality 
judgements were examined and deemed 
to be satisfactory.
Auditor objectivity
The Committee recognises the importance 
of auditor objectivity and independence in 
providing assurance to investors about the 
integrity of the Group’s financial statements. 
The Committee receives information in 
writing from the auditors on their fees 
(audit and non-audit) and the firm’s internal 
procedures to ensure that independence 
– both the firm’s and that of its relevant 
audit staff, audit manager and audit 
partner – are reviewed and properly 
assessed. The Committee has discussed 
and appropriately challenged such issues 
with the audit partner and deemed their 
responses to be satisfactory.
The firm’s audit partner is being 
rotated at the end of the 2014/15 audit. 
The Committee has considered whether 
an audit tender should be recommended 
to the Board but has concluded that to do 
so at this time would not be in easyHotel’s 
best interests. The Committee has therefore 
recommended to the Board that, subject 
to approval by the shareholders at the 
2016 annual general meeting, the 
appointment of BDO LLP as the Group’s 
auditor be renewed.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The Board has primary responsibility 
for ensuring the Group’s risks are properly 
understood, quantified and appropriately 
managed but it looks to the Audit 
Committee to provide assurance on risk 
management processes and controls. 
The Audit Committee has reviewed the 
Group’s risk register and the actions 
proposed and taken by management to 
mitigate risk and to reduce the likelihood 
and impact of the risks faced by the 
business and has deemed them satisfactory.
The principal risks and uncertainties of the 
business and how they are managed are 
set out on page 12 (see also note 3 to 
the financial statements – “Financial 
instruments – risk management”). Governance Financial statements Strategic report

Remuneration report
As an AIM company, easyHotel plc is 
not required to comply with Schedule 8 
of the Large and Medium-sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2008. However, in the interests 
of transparency, expanded disclosure has 
been provided on a voluntary basis in 
order to provide shareholders with an 
overview of our remuneration practices. 
The content of this report is unaudited 
unless stated.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is made 
up of Scott Christie (who became 
Chairman of the Committee on 2 July 2015) 
and Jonathan Lane OBE (who served 
as Chairman of the Committee until 
2 July 2015). The Committee reviews the 
performance of the Executive Directors 
and sets the scale and structure of their 
remuneration and the basis of their 
service agreements with due regard to 
the interests of shareholders and to the 
pay and conditions of other Group staff 
members. The Remuneration Committee 
also makes recommendations to the Board 
concerning the structure of the Group’s 
bonus and long-term incentive schemes, 
the awards made under such plans and 
the performance conditions attached to 
them. The Committee seeks support from 
external advisers as necessary and during 
the year, Deloitte were appointed to assist 
the Committee with their review of certain 
elements of the Group’s incentive 
arrangements. No other services were 
provided by Deloitte to the Group 
during the year.
During the year ended 30 September 2015, 
the Committee met four times.
Remuneration policy
The objective of the Group’s remuneration 
policy is to ensure that the overall 
remuneration of Executive Directors is 
aligned with the strategy, performance 
and risk tolerance of the Group, whilst 
preserving an appropriate balance of 
profit delivery and shareholder value. 
The overall arrangements are designed 
to support the delivery of the Company’s 
long-term strategic goals.
The remuneration arrangements for 
Executive Directors consist of basic salary, 
payment in lieu of pension contribution, 
annual performance-related bonuses 
and long-term performance share awards.
In determining the remuneration of 
Executive Directors, the Remuneration 
Committee seeks to enable the Group 
to attract, retain and motivate Executives 
of the highest calibre but without paying 
more than is necessary for this purpose. 
During the year, the Group recruited two 
Executive Directors and on each of these 
occasions the Committee applied these 
principles to determine the appropriate 
remuneration package offered.
Since listing, the Remuneration 
Committee has worked to establish 
performance-related incentives that 
support the delivery of easyHotel’s 
strategic goals ensuring that individual 
rewards are linked to clear and stretching 
corporate and individual targets. These 
performance-related elements of pay 
are intended to represent a significant 
proportion of each Executive Director’s 
overall remuneration.
When reviewing the basis for annual 
bonus awards, the Committee has 
determined that, at this stage in the 
Group’s development, an appropriate 
emphasis for the 2016 cash bonus 
targets would be delivery of EBITDA 
targets and measurable pipeline growth 
in both the owned and franchised hotel 
elements of the Group’s portfolio for the 
future in line with the Company’s medium 
term strategy. On-target performance will 
be rewarded with a cash bonus equivalent 
to 50% of base salary, with a 100% bonus 
being the maximum payable in the event 
that stretch targets are achieved.
The Committee undertook a review 
of the Company’s long-term incentive 
strategy, and determined that the easyHotel 
Share Option Plan established at the 
time of the IPO was not an appropriate 
long-term share based scheme for 
incentivising Executive Directors going 
forward. The Committee therefore 
recommended to the Board establishment 
of the easyHotel 2015 Performance 
Share Plan. This plan enables the grant 
of conditional share awards which are 
subject to achievement of performance 
criteria typically measured over a 
three-year performance period. Awards 
of up to 200% of salary can be granted 
under the plan, however it is expected 
that normal awards will be capped at 
100% of salary.
The current intention is for the first 
awards under the 2015 Performance 
Share Plan to be granted shortly after 
announcement of the Company’s 2015 
year end results. Initial awards to each of 
the Executive Directors will be equivalent 
to 200% of their base salary as agreed 
with them on recruitment. Thereafter, it 
is expected that normal awards in future 
years will be equivalent to 100% of salary. 
The performance criteria for the initial 
awards, based on performance over 
the 2016, 2017 and 2018 financial years, 
will be finalised by the Remuneration 
Committee prior to the grant of awards. 
The current intention is that the award 
will be linked to creation of shareholder 
value, growth in the rooms’ pipeline 
and achievement of robust financial 
performance. The majority of the award 
(80% of the total award) will be linked to 
delivery of total shareholder returns and 
growth in both the franchised and owned 
hotel rooms’ pipeline. These are lead 
measures of how effectively the Company 
delivers on the strategy and how this 
translates into returns for shareholders. 
The financial element of the plan (20% 
of the award) will be linked to delivery of 
ROCE (based on owned-hotels) and net 
EBITDA margin targets. The Committee 
will retain discretion to scale-back 
vesting from the financial element if 
performance against the lead targets 
falls below the threshold levels.
Targets for each element will be 
scaled so that threshold performance 
results in vesting of 30% of the award 
with full vesting requiring delivery of 
stretch targets across all measures. 
Further detail regarding the awards 
will be disclosed in due course after 
the exact performance criteria have 
been agreed and finalised.
Non-Executive Directors
Remuneration of the Non-Executive 
Directors is determined by the Board as 
a whole, with the relevant Non-Executive 
Director taking no part in the discussions 
or decision in relation to his own fees. 
The Non-Executive Directors are not 
entitled to annual bonuses or employee 
benefits. Each of the Non-Executive 
Directors has a letter of appointment 
stating, amongst other things, his annual 
fee and that his appointment may be 
terminated by either party giving one 
month’s prior written notice. easyHotel plc Annual report and accounts 2015 18

Governance
Statement of responsibilities
Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for the 
Group’s internal control systems and for 
reviewing the effectiveness of the systems, 
taking into account the size of the Group 
and the nature of its activities. Such systems 
are only designed to manage, rather than 
eliminate, the risk of failure and will only 
provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement 
or loss.
Going concern
In considering the going concern basis 
for preparing the financial statements, 
the Directors have considered the Group’s 
objectives and strategy, the risks and 
uncertainties to achieving the objectives 
and the review of the business performance, 
all of which are set out in the Strategic 
Report section of this report and accounts. 
The Group’s liquidity and funding 
arrangements are set out in notes 16 
and 18 to the financial statements. 
The Directors consider that the Group 
has significant cash and borrowing 
facilities for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, after reviewing the Group’s 
expenditure commitments, current financial 
projections and expected future cash flows, 
together with available cash resources and 
undrawn committed borrowing facilities, the 
Directors have considered that adequate 
resources exist for the Group to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. On this basis, the Directors continue 
to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements.
Directors’ responsibilities 
The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the annual report and the 
financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors 
to prepare financial statements for 
each financial year. Under that law the 
Directors have elected to prepare the 
Group and Company financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union. Under company 
law the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Group and Company 
and of the profit or loss of the Group and 
Company for that period. The Directors 
are also required to prepare financial 
statements in accordance with the rules 
of the London Stock Exchange for 
companies trading securities on the 
Alternative Investment Market.
In preparing these financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
•  select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;
•  make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
•  state whether they have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
•  prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for 
keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the requirements 
of the Companies Act 2006. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
Website publication
The Directors are responsible for 
ensuring the annual report and the 
financial statements are made available 
on a website. Financial statements are 
published on the Company’s website 
in accordance with legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements, 
which may vary from legislation in other 
jurisdictions. The maintenance and 
integrity of the Company’s website is 
the responsibility of the Directors. 
The Directors’ responsibility also extends 
to the ongoing integrity of the financial 
statements contained therein.

Independent auditors’ report

statement of cash flows, the consolidated and Company statement of changes in equity and the related notes. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to 
them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions 
we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s (FRC’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion: 
•  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and the parent company’s affairs as at 
30 September 2015 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

1 Statement of compliance
easyHotel plc (the “Company”) and its wholly owned subsidiary (easyHotel UK Limited) is an international owner, developer, operator 
and franchisor of “easyHotel” branded hotels. The Company is a public limited company whose shares are listed on the AIM exchange 
under the ticker symbol EZH and is incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of the registered office is 
80 Old Street, London EC1V 9AZ. 
The consolidated and parent company accounts are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 
as adopted by the European Union, taking into account International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations 
and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
2 Significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The accounts are prepared based on the historical cost convention. The accounting policies set out below have been applied 
consistently to all years presented in these accounts, unless otherwise stated. 
The Company has taken up its exemption for filing individual profit and loss account according to section 408 CA 2006. The Company’s 
profit or loss for the financial year has been approved by the Directors in accordance with section 414(1) (comprehensive loss for 
the year of £1,215,049).
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis. Details on going concern are provided in the Statement of Responsibilities 
on page 20.
All amounts are presented in Pound Sterling (GBP, £) except where otherwise indicated.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated accounts incorporate those of easyHotel plc and its subsidiaries for the years ended 30 September 2014 
and 2015. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent company, 
using consistent accounting policies. On acquisition of its subsidiary, easyHotel UK Ltd, merger accounting was the basis 
of consolidation.
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has 
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
Intragroup balances and transactions and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated 
in preparing the consolidated accounts. 
Investment in subsidiary
easyHotel plc has an investment in easyHotel UK Limited (a wholly owned subsidiary) of £3,825,683 (2014: £3,825,683). 
This investment is held at cost less any reasonable provisions for impairment against the investment of which there are currently none.
The investment eliminates out for the purpose of the consolidation.
Employee Benefit Trust
The EBT’s assets (other than investments in the Company’s shares), liabilities, income and expenses are included on a line-by-line 
basis in the consolidated financial statements and its investment in the Company’s shares is deducted from equity in the consolidated 
statement of financial position as if it were treasury shares.
The EBT is not consolidated in the Company’s own financial statements but the Company recognises any transactions between 
itself and the EBT in accordance with the relevant accounting policy.

2 Significant accounting policies (continued)
Foreign currency
The primary economic environment in which a subsidiary operates determines its functional currency. The consolidated accounts 
of easyHotel are presented in Sterling, which is the Company’s functional currency and the Group’s presentation currency.
Transactions arising in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet 
date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the transactions were effected.
System sales
System sales arises from the sale of goods and provision of services where these activities give rise to economic benefits received 
and receivable by the Company and its franchisees. System sales is the full amount that the customer pays for our owned and operated 
hotels, as well as franchisee owned and operated hotels (excluding VAT and similar taxes), including initial sign-on fees paid by 
franchisees to the Company.
Revenue
Revenue arises from the provision of services where these activities give rise to economic benefits received and receivable by the 
Company on its own account and result in increases in equity. Revenue is the full amount that the customer pays for our owned 
and operated hotels, plus fees that we charge to our franchisees (excluding VAT and similar taxes).
Provided the amount, if applicable, can be measured reliably and it is probable that the Company will receive the consideration, 
revenue for services is recognised as follows:
Owned – primarily derived from hotel operations, including the rental of rooms and ad hoc utility services sales from owned hotels 
operated under the easy brand name. Revenue is recognised when rooms are occupied and ad hoc utility services are provided.
Franchise fees – received in connection with the licence of the Company’s brand name, usually under long-term contracts with the 
hotel owner. The Company charges franchise royalty fees and processing fees as a percentage of room revenue and in some cases 
receives an upfront fee on the grant of a franchise. Revenue is earned and recognised when the customer has occupied the room 
at the franchisee’s operated hotel accommodation and for upfront fees revenue is recognised evenly over the term of the franchise 
or exclusivity period or over the period from signing to opening where fees relate to legal, contractual, initial marketing or other 
similar items.
Consideration received in advance for which the revenue recognition criteria above have not been satisfied is deferred until such 
time as the revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are initially recognised at cost and subsequently amortised on a straight line basis over the expected useful lives 
of the assets as follows:
Website development costs  – over 5 years
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are initially recognised at cost and subsequently stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and, where appropriate, provision for impairment in value.
Freehold land is not depreciated. Depreciation is provided on all other items of property, plant and equipment so as to write off 
their carrying value, less their residual value, over their expected useful economic lives. It is provided at the following rates:
Freehold building core  – over 50 years
Freehold building surface finishes – over 20 years
Plant and machinery  – over 8–15 years (5 years in 2014 financial year)
Furniture and equipment  – over 3–5 years
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period. easyHotel plc Annual report and accounts 2015 30

2 Significant accounting policies (continued)
Financial assets
The Company has not classified any of its financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, as available for sale or as held 
to maturity.
The Company’s accounting policy for loans and receivables is as follows:
The Company’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the statement 
of financial position. These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in 
an active market. They arise principally through the provision of goods and services to customers (e.g. trade receivables) but also 
incorporate other types of contractual monetary asset. They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly 
attributable to their acquisition or issue and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, 
less provision for impairment. 
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, cash in transit, restricted cash, deposits held at call with banks and other 
short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as significant financial difficulties on the part of the 
counterparty or default or significant delay in payment) that the Company will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under 
the terms receivable, the amount of such a provision being the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value 
of the future expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable. For trade receivables, which are reported net, such provisions 
are recorded in a separate allowance account with the loss being recognised within administrative expenses in the statement 
of comprehensive income. On confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset 
is written off against the associated provision.
Financial liabilities
The Group classifies its financial liabilities, depending on the purpose for which the liability was acquired. The Group has not 
classified any of its financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
The Group’s accounting policy for other financial liabilities is as follows:
Trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Taxation
The current tax is based upon the taxable profit for the period together with adjustments, where necessary, in respect of prior periods. 
The Group’s asset or liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the 
financial year-end date.
Current tax is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the statement of financial 
position differs from its tax base.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available against 
which the difference can be utilised.
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting 
date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities/(assets) are settled/(recovered).
Share capital
Financial instruments issued by the Group are classified as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the definition of a 
financial liability.
The Group’s ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. In the case of interim dividends to equity shareholders, this is when 
declared by the Directors. In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by the shareholders at the AGM. Governance Financial statements Strategic report
31 easyHotel plc Annual report and accounts 2015
2 Significant accounting policies (continued)
Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. 
The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Board of Directors.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that 
necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, 
until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings, if any, pending their expenditure on qualifying 
assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised for liabilities of uncertain timing or amounts that have arisen as a result of past transactions and are 
discounted at a pre-tax rate reflecting current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
Standards, amendments and interpretations to published standards not yet effective
The following standards, interpretations and amendments, have been published but have not been endorsed by the European Union, 
or are not effective for the periods presented and the Group has chosen not to early adopt. All standards listed have to be applied, 
at the latest, from financial years starting on or after 2 October 2014 unless otherwise stated.
No new standards in the year have had a material impact on the financial statements.
• IFRS 9: Financial Instruments (from 1 January 2018)
• IFRS 14: Regulatory Deferral Accounts
• IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (from 1 January 2018)
• IFRS 10 (Amendment): Consolidated Financial Statements
• IFRS 11 (Amendment): Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations
• IFRS 12 (Amendment): Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities
• IAS 1 (Amendment): Presentation of Financial Statements
• IAS 16 (Amendment): Property, Plant and Equipment 
• IAS 27 (Amendment): Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements
• IAS 28 (Amendment): Investments in Associations and Joint Ventures
• IAS 38 (Amendment): Intangible Assets 
• Annual improvements to IFRS
IFRS 9: Financial Instruments (from 1 January 2018). It is envisaged that this standard will replace IAS 39: Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement in its entirety. IFRS 9 (2010) deals with classification and measurement of financial assets and its 
requirements represent a significant change from the existing requirements in IAS 39 in respect of financial assets. The standard 
contains two primary measurement categories for financial assets: at amortised cost and fair value. A financial asset would be 
measured at amortised cost if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash 
flows, and the asset’s contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest 
on the principal outstanding. All other financial assets would be measured at fair value. The standard eliminates the existing IAS 39 
categories of held to maturity, available for sale and loans and receivables. IFRS 9 has not yet been endorsed by the European Union.
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on 
easyHotel’s accounts. Certain of these standards and interpretations will, when adopted, require addition to or amendment 
of disclosures in the accounts. easyHotel plc Annual report and accounts 2015 32

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Group makes certain estimates and assumptions regarding the future. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated 
based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under 
the circumstances. In the future, actual experience may differ from these estimates and assumptions. The estimates and assumptions 
that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial 
year are discussed below.
(a) Impairment of assets
The Group is required to consider assets for impairment where such indicators exist using value in use calculations or fair value 
estimates. The use of these methods may require the estimation of future cash flows and the choice of a discount rate in order 
to calculate the value in use or fair value.
(b) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated over their useful lives. Useful lives are based on the management’s estimates of the 
period that the assets will generate revenue, which along with their estimated residual values are periodically reviewed for continued 
appropriateness. Changes to estimates can result in significant variations in the carrying value and amounts charged to the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income in specific periods. More details including carrying values are included in note 13.
(c) Taxation
The Group is subject to income tax and significant judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes. During the 
ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, 
the Group recognises tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due. These tax liabilities are 
recognised when the Group believes that certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not be fully sustained upon review 
by tax authorities. The Group believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open audit years based on its assessment 
of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and 
may involve a series of complex judgements about future events. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different 
than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made.
3 Financial instruments – risk management
The Group and Company is exposed through its operations to the following financial risks:
• credit risk;
• fair value or cash flow interest rate risk;
• foreign exchange risk;
• other market price risk; and
• liquidity risk.
In common with all other businesses, the Group and Company is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial instruments. 
This note describes the Group and Company’s objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks and the methods used 
to measure them. Further quantitative information in respect of these risks is presented throughout these financial statements.
There have been no substantial changes in the Group and Company’s exposure to financial instrument risks, its objectives, 
policies and processes for managing those risks or the methods used to measure them from previous periods unless otherwise 
stated in this note.
Principal financial instruments
The principal financial instruments used by the Group and Company, from which financial instrument risk arises, are as follows:
• trade and other receivables; 
• cash and cash equivalents;
• trade and other payables; and
• loans and borrowings. Governance Financial statements Strategic report

General objectives, policies and processes
The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Group and Company’s financial instrument risk management 
objectives and policies and, whilst retaining ultimate responsibility for them, it has delegated the authority for designing and operating 
processes that ensure the effective implementation of the objectives and policies to the Group’s finance function. The Board receives 
reports from the Group’s finance function through which it reviews the effectiveness of the processes put in place and the appropriateness 
of the objectives and policies it sets.
The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the Group’s 
competitiveness and flexibility. Further details regarding these policies are set out below.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group and Company if a customer or a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to 
meet its contractual obligations. On the basis that customers primarily prepay for hotel occupancy, and after carefully reviewing 
the financial performance and forecasts of counterparties to financial instruments as well as holding security over their trading 
accounts, the Group and Company’s exposure to credit risk from trade and other receivables is considered insignificant.
Credit risk also arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions. For banks and financial 
institutions, only independently rated parties with minimum rating “A” are accepted.
The Group and Company does not enter into derivatives to manage credit risk.
Market risk
Market risk arises from the Group and Company’s use of interest bearing, tradable and foreign currency financial instruments. 
It is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in interest rates 
(interest rate risk), foreign exchange rates (currency risk) or other market factors (other price risk).
The Company has no fair value and cash flow interest rate risk to disclose.
Fair value and cash flow interest rate risk
The Group is partially funded through bank borrowings. The Group obtained a bank borrowing facility during the period 
ended 30 September 2014 for the amount of £8.7m. Any amount borrowed bears interest at 1.92% above UK base rate. 
At 30 September 2015 £7.2m of the facility had been utilised. A 50 basis point increase in the interest rate would, all other 
variables kept constant, have decreased the profit before tax by £36,000 for the period ended 30 September 2015, while 
a 50 basis point decrease would have increased profit before tax by the same amount. easyHotel plc Annual report and accounts 2015 34

Notes forming part of the financial statements (continued)

3 Financial instruments – risk management (continued)
Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk arises because the Group has franchisees located outside the UK whose functional currency is not the 
same as the functional currency of the Group, and the Group takes bookings on their behalf in foreign currencies. The Group 
maintains bank accounts in these currencies to provide a natural hedge.
Foreign exchange risk also arises when the Group enters into transactions denominated in a currency other than its functional 
currency. The volume of such transactions is not considered sufficient to warrant hedging the risk exposure.
The Group’s policy is, where possible, to settle liabilities denominated in foreign currency (primarily Euro) with the cash generated 
from its own operations in that currency.
The Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities were denominated in the following currencies:

The effect of a 5% strengthening of the Pound Sterling at the reporting date on the foreign denominated financial instruments 
carried at that date would, all variables held constant, have resulted in a decrease in total comprehensive income for the period 
and decrease of net assets of £139,363 (30 September 2014: £24,780). A 5% weakening in the exchange rate would, on the 
same basis, have increased total comprehensive income and net assets by £139,363 (2014: £24,780).
The Company has no foreign exchange risk to disclose.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises from the Group and Company’s management of working capital and the finance charges and principal 
repayments on its debt instruments. It is the risk that the Group and Company will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial 
obligations as they fall due.
The Group and Company’s policy is to ensure that it will always have sufficient cash to allow it to meet its liabilities when they become 
due. To achieve this aim, the Group and Company finances its operations through a mix of equity and borrowings. The Group 
and Company’s objective is to provide funding for future growth and achieve a balance between continuity and flexibility through 
its bank facilities and intergroup loans. The Group has an £8.7m bank facility in place, of which £7.2m has been drawn.
The Board receives cash flow projections on a regular basis as well as information regarding cash balances. At the end of the 
financial year, these projections indicated that the Group and Company expected to have sufficient liquid resources to meet its 
obligations under all reasonably expected circumstances. Governance Financial statements Strategic report

Capital disclosures
The Group and Company monitors capital, which comprises all components of equity (i.e. share capital, share premium 
and retained earnings). 
The Group and Company’s objectives when maintaining capital are:
•  to safeguard the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders 
and benefits for other stakeholders; and
• to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group and Company sets the amount of capital it requires in proportion to risk. The Group and Company manages its capital 
structure and makes adjustments to it in light of the changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying 
assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group and Company may adjust the amount of dividends paid to 
shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt. easyHotel plc Annual report and accounts 2015 36

7 Segment information (continued)
Factors that management used to identify the Group’s reportable segments
These segments are considered on the basis of different products and services. They are managed separately because each 
business requires different management strategies and poses different business risks. 
Measurement of operating segment profit or loss, assets and liabilities
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.
The Group evaluates performance on the basis of profit or loss from operations before tax not including non-recurring losses.
Segment assets exclude tax assets. Segment liabilities exclude tax liabilities. Even though loans and borrowings arise from finance 
activities rather than operating activities, they are allocated to the segments based on relevant factors (e.g. funding requirements). 
Details are provided in the reconciliation from segment assets and liabilities to the Group position.

24 Ultimate controlling party
easyGroup Holdings Limited, which is ultimately controlled by the Stelios Trust, a Cayman Islands trust established for the benefit 
of Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou and others, was the principal shareholder at 30 September 2015 and held 55.7% of issued share capital.
In accordance with the relationship agreement with easyGroup Holdings Limited and its related parties, easyHotel plc is able to 
operate independently of easyGroup Holdings Limited and its associates and hence there is no controlling party.
In addition, easyGroup Holdings Limited agrees that where it is deemed to be acting in concert with any other related parties such 
that the aggregate shareholding of easyGroup Holdings Limited together with such other parties exceeds 49.0% of the voting rights 
attaching to the Company’s issued share capital, then easyGroup Holdings Limited shall (save with prior written consent of the 
Company) limit the exercise of the voting rights attaching to the ordinary shares held by it to such number of ordinary shares that, 
when aggregated with the number of ordinary shares held by the other members of the concert party, does not exceed 49.0% 
of the Company’s issued share capital.
25 Contingencies and commitments
A contingent liability exists in relation to a Section 106 planning contribution levy at the Company’s Old Street hotel. The Group is 
seeking retrospective planning consent for rooms already added to the third and fourth floors of the hotel. The total of the Section 106 
liability remains under discussion. The Group expects a decision to be made about the application during 2016.
A contingent liability exists in relation to a claim from a previous franchisee in South Africa. The total claim is for the amount 
of £113,194 and we are currently uncertain of the validity of this claim. We are currently seeking legal advice on this matter.
A commitment to purchase a property in central Manchester for £2,750,000 exists subject to conditions and obtaining relevant

*  Weighted average exercise price is calculated by weighting the applicable exercise price with the corresponding number of options granted. 1,000,000 options 
have been granted with an exercise price of 100p; a further 625,000 options have been granted with an exercise price of 110p.
It was the Company’s intention that all options granted upon admission and any other options granted in the future pursuant to 
the Share Option Scheme would be satisfied using ordinary shares purchased by the trustee of the Employee Benefit Trust from 
time to time in the market.
The options ordinarily vest on a straight line basis over a three-year period beginning with the date of grant and ending on the 
third anniversary of the grant. Options granted conditional upon admission would have vested in full on the first anniversary of 
the date of grant, provided that, as at that date, the option holder had not given or received notice of termination of his employment 
with easyHotel.
In the ordinary course of business, an option will normally only be exercisable to the extent it has fully vested and any applicable 
performance conditions have been satisfied or waived. Options shall lapse to the extent unexercised on the tenth anniversary of 
the date of grant or such earlier date as specified by the Board at the date of grant. Options granted conditional upon admission 
would have lapsed on the fifth anniversary of the date of grant. easyHotel plc Annual report and accounts 2015 48

Annual Report 2012 05
Financial statements Governance Performance Overview Other information Chairman’s statement
In my statement last year I commented that I was very 
confident, given the quality of our management and 
our staff, that 2012 would demonstrate their capability 
and commitment to put the 2011 issue of higher than 
expected claims behind us and restore lost shareholder 
value. This confidence has, I believe, been fully justified 
with pre-tax profits 15% higher at £345m; reserve 
releases from the 2010 and 2011 years; and a share price 
that was 36% higher at the end of the year than the start.  
This level of profitability delivered a 60% return on capital 
employed and supported total dividends of 90.6 pence 
per share, which represents a distribution of 95% of 
our earnings. Our normal dividend, growing in line 
with our growth in profits based on a 45% pay-out ratio, 
amounted to 42.7 pence per share, whilst our available 
surplus, after taking into account our required solvency, 
provision for our overseas expansion plans, and a margin 
for contingencies, made possible a further special 
dividend of 47 .9 pence per share.
Our UK Business
UK motor insurance is cyclical. As rates harden and 
profitability improves so too interest in growth increases 
amongst insurers, raising marketing spend; developing 
new offerings; and, in turn, leading to lower prices to grow 
share. This phase continues until the market recognises 
that the new business it is attracting is unprofitable for 
most, leading to a further turn. It makes good economic 
sense to grow in the up-cycle and refrain from chasing 
the market down in the down-cycle. This is even more 
the case for a player such as Admiral that has a significant 
combined ratio advantage over the market as a whole and 
can, therefore, afford to raise rates less quickly than the 
market as a whole when the cycle turns up. The UK market 
reached its low point in 2009, a year that saw a totally 
unsustainable overall market combined ratio of 127%, 
and then raised rates significantly over the subsequent 
two years to reflect the increasing cost of claims, in 
particular those relating to bodily injury. By contrast, in 
2009 Admiral had achieved a combined ratio of 94% and 
was, therefore, able to take advantage of these market 
conditions to add material growth to its UK motor book, 
finishing 2011 almost 60% larger than two years previously. 
Similarly in 2012, as the second largest UK private motor 
insurer, we have not sought to add to the downward 
pressure on prices but have been content to hold our 
share broadly steady. 
Admiral has always had a low appetite for risk. This is 
demonstrated by the fact that we reinsure 75% of our 
book either through co-insurance or quota share; we 
only invest in the highest quality assets with no equity 
exposure; and when we enter new markets we do so 
slowly through organic growth, adopting a test and learn 
approach. Nowhere is this low risk appetite more evident 
than our approach to reserving against motor claims. We 
establish initial reserves at the prudent end of potential 
outcomes, reviewing how claims develop in subsequent 
years and releasing parts of the reserve to profit as and 
when justified. In our reserving we seek to reflect not only 
what we know but what may happen, such as potential 
changes to discount rates and increasing numbers of 
periodic payment orders. Our approach to reserving 
is conservative; how conservative will vary with our 
assessment of the level of uncertainty and volatility 
to which our business is exposed. 
Currently the UK motor market is undergoing significant 
change – the implementation of the EU gender directive;  
the OFT referral to the Competition Commission; the 
banning of referral fees; and the emergence of telematics 
offerings are all potentially disruptive events. Admiral  
has, however, built its business to embrace and profit 
from change, rather than fear it and we have been as 
transparent as we can as to the likely effects of these 
changes on our business. The management team has 
developed a flexible responsive, low-cost, data-rich 
business model that allows the effect of change to be 
identified quickly, measured accurately, and responded  
to effectively. By seeking to minimise bureaucracy, 
encourage individual managers to use their initiative,  
and avoid management by committee which leads to  
an absence of decision-taking and the abrogation of 
responsibility, we aim to react more quickly than our 
competitors to changes in our environment. Through our 
all-employee Free Share scheme we seek to motivate all 
of our people to work together to achieve the best 
outcome for what is their business, creating a total 
alignment between their interests and those of our

Institute in 2012.
The customer is at the centre of everything we do.  
We design our products and processes in order to  
meet their needs better than our competitors, and we 
are now pleased to be able to offer our UK customers 
household insurance alongside motor insurance. We seek 
feedback after every interaction in order to learn how we 
can improve our service. Last year we received over 
140,000 individual items of feedback – in the critical area 
of claims processing over 90% of those claiming under 
their policy said that they would take motor insurance 
from us again. All departments have quality scores 
against their relevant key performance indicators, and 
compete to win Quality Awards. For customer-facing 
departments these quality measures underpin the 
regulatory assessment of our compliance with the 
principles of Treating Customers Fairly. We fully support 
initiatives that can reduce the overall cost of providing 
motor insurance, in turn making possible a reduction in 
the premiums insurers have to charge their customers. 
Minimising the potential for fraudulent claims and 
reducing incidental claims costs both have their part  
to play. 
Admiral Overseas
We have continued to grow our overseas businesses  
at the measured pace dictated by a strategy of organic 
growth and within the constraints of the challenging 
economic environment, particularly as affects southern 
Europe. We are still very much at the stage of learning 
how best to compete in each of these markets and shall 
focus in the near term on building the businesses that we 
have established over the past six years. When each year  
I visit our international operations I always know that I am 
in Admiral, testament to the effectiveness with which our 
can-do culture, management ethos, and approach to our 
customers and employees have been exported. 
We are already seeing the results of investing in price 
comparison in new markets in order to kick start the 
process of change to more active switching of car 
insurance provider by consumers. Market data shows 
price comparison growth in Italy, Spain and France and 
we are delighted to see others being attracted by our 
initiative to establish their own price comparison sites in 
markets where we provide motor insurance – the launch 
of Les Furets in France is a case in point. The more impact 
price comparison can have the stronger the potential  
for direct insurance in these markets. 
Our Board 
Over the past couple of years we have added to our 
Board beyond its normal size in anticipation of three  
of our Non-Executive Directors reaching the end of the 
nine years following which they are no longer regarded 
as independent under the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. By structuring this overlap we aim to maintain the 
continuity of Board process and the strength of personal 
interaction which underlies the effectiveness of the Board 
as a team. The first of these, Keith James, stood down 
at our 2012 AGM although he continues to bring his 
knowledge of our business and his wise counsel to bear 
through his chairmanship of our principal UK-regulated 
operating subsidiaries. May I take this opportunity to 
thank Keith for everything that he added to our debate 
during his time on the Board. 
I would also like to extend this thanks more generally  
to all of our Non-Executives for the time they give and the 
commitment they make to our business. As our business 
expands and broadens, and against the backdrop of 
challenging economics and a demanding regulatory 
environment, what is expected of Non-Executives, and  
in particular Committee Chairs, bears little relation to  
the position that existed when Admiral floated in 2004. 
During 2012 all Non-Executives visited at least one of  
our overseas businesses in addition to the normal Board 
process. It is only by such active engagement with 
the business and the opportunity to spend time with 
management across many levels that Non-Executives 
can gain a real understanding of its underlying health 
and potential. In a business that has sustained profitable 
growth as its objective the depth and breadth of 
management is both the key enabler and the potential 
greatest inhibitor. Our Board, therefore, aims to assess 
not only the plans for immediate succession but, at least 
as, if not more, importantly, the emerging bench strength 
for five to 10 years time. Throughout 2012 we have had 
three senior managers join the Board in each of its 
meetings in order to broaden their understanding of  
the Group’s strategy and Board process and contribute 
actively to Board deliberations. 
Thank You
A business is only as good as its people and every 
individual has their particular contribution to the success 
of the whole. It is, therefore, everyone in Admiral across  
all the various markets and functions that now make up 
our Group that I must thank for what has been achieved  
in 2012. Whilst there are many elements to why Admiral  
is different, for me the most significant is that the 
management team has been successful in designing  
a business where the overwhelming majority of those I 
meet enjoy coming to work and through enjoying what 
they do, and the environment within which they work,  
are more successful in what they do. It is, therefore, 
no surprise that the average length of service of our 
20 most senior UK managers is 13 years in a company 
that is itself just 20 years old. I am confident that this 
depth of focused knowledge and commitment within 
a supportive environment will lead to a continued  
strong performance within our markets.

Annual Report 2012 07
Financial statements Governance Performance Overview Other information We’ve done the heavy lifting: the first 20 years. We’ve put 
the hole in the ground and we’ve got the cranes in place. 
All that’s left to do is to build the metaphorical skyscraper. 
We’ve had our ups and downs, good moments and, well, 
less good moments, over the first 7 ,304 days (we started 
on 2 January 1993 and there have been five leap years 
along the way, but who’s counting?). In 20 years, we’ve 
done a lot of car insurance (total turnover? £13 billion, our 
combined ratio over the first 20 years? 84%), we’ve had a 
lot of laughs, lost (quite) a few hairs and gained a few 
pounds. But the net result is my belief that the next 20 
years will make the first 20 seem downright pedestrian for 
Admiral Group. And if I do my job well, then when the next 
wave of management takes over, it will inherit a very strong 
foundation upon which to construct their skyscraper.  
Before we attack the next 20 years, let’s take a look at  
the 20th! 
In 2012 the return to form of the UK business was heart-
warming to all of us. We enjoyed substantial reductions  
in the actuarial view of best estimate for the back years, 
which has in turn allowed us to release some reserves  
and increase the reserve stock for the future. The upshot 
of all this is a 15% increase in profits at Group level. Nice.
In addition, we did not chase growth. A common 
misconception seems to surround the question of 
policyholder growth and profit growth. If one tries to 
make a simple link between these two it would  
Chief Executive’s  
statement
completely miss the third part of the triangle: margin. 
Prices in the market fell more than 10% in 2012. We chased 
it some of the way down but not all the way down. As a 
result we kept some integrity with regard to margin. 
We believe that to have chased the market further, such 
that we could present greater year-end policyholder 
growth, would have meant sacrificing profit in both the 
short- and long-term. 
The UK car insurance market has, historically, been 
violently cyclical: some profitable years followed by big 
losses. There is no reason to believe that the market will 
stop being cyclical, although the extent of the future 
violence is as yet unknown. Therefore there will be far 
better opportunities to grow at the next turn in the cycle,  
when rates begin going up faster than claims inflation. 
Admiral is in the enviable position of being profitable 
throughout the cycle. This allows us to choose when  
we grow and how much we grow and what margins  
we maintain. 
It was also a good sign that Confused.com, for the first 
time in four years, made more profit than the year before. 
However, the trading environment for Confused will be 
even more challenging in 2013. The rate of aggregator 
growth in the market is slowing. This isn’t a surprise for  
two reasons: first, so many people are already using  
price comparison that there aren’t that many new people 
left! Secondly, as rates tumble in the market consumers 
get renewal notices with premiums lower than last year. 
This only serves to dampen their enthusiasm for shopping. 
Confused is doing a lot of interesting things however to  
try and insulate itself from the vagaries of the car insurance 
market. It has, for example, a very sophisticated offering  
of credit cards and it has developed a very nifty app to 
help drivers find parking wherever they’re at in the UK. 
2012 saw Admiral take a big but small step. After 19 years, 
11 months and 16 days of having car insurance as the 
only stand-alone, underwritten product, we launched 
household insurance in the UK on 18 December, 2012. It’s 
a big step because we have, for the first time, diversified 
the product range which we underwrite. It’s a small step 
because the business is intended to be very small in the 
first year or two. Test and learn, test and learn…
The results outside the UK were mixed.
The insurance businesses made some strides towards 
being growing, profitable, sustainable businesses, 
however, these strides were not as long as anticipated. 
Overall the opportunities are well worth the investment 
but we do need to pick up our game and make more 
progress, more quickly. 
The non-UK price comparison businesses each had a 
good year. The results for Rastreator and LeLynx, in Spain 
and France respectively, were better than expected. 
These two businesses are poised for great things, but 
achieving greatness is never easy.

Annual Report 2012 08 Our business model 
1. Profitable
 Focused on delivering year on year growth.
2. Growing
  100% organic, long-term approach to growth  
that adjusts according to market conditions.
3. Low risk
  No debt, cash balances conservatively  
managed and loss protection through the  
use of co- and reinsurance.
4. Cash generative
 Strong cash flow and high dividend payout ratio.
5. Aligned interests
  Significant share distribution throughout  
the organisation.
6. High return on capital
 Enabled by a capital light strategy.
Our strategic priorities
1.  Grow profitably our share of the UK private motor  
insurance market.
2.   Exploit the knowledge, skills and resources 
attaching to our established UK businesses to 
promote our expansion overseas in both private 
motor and price comparison.
3.   Learn by taking relatively small and inexpensive 
steps to test different approaches and identify 
the best way forward.
4.  Operate a ‘capital-light’ business model 
transferring a significant proportion of our 
underwriting risk to reinsurance partners, 
which in turn allows Admiral to distribute 
the majority of our earnings as dividends.
5.   Give all our staff a stake in what they create by 
making them shareholders.
 6.  Recognise the responsibility we have to the 
communities of which we are a part.
Following on from the success of Rastreator and LeLynx, 
just after the end of the year we launched the beta version 
of a price comparison site in the US, Comparenow.com. 
Until now no one has done European-style price 
comparison in the US and so Comparenow will plough 
new ground. Comparenow is attempting to change 
normal shopping patterns on a big scale and success  
is sure to be challenging and exciting in equal parts. 
Admiral Group’s strategy is not complicated. Based on 
the premise that the internet is an irresistible force, our 
strategy is to continue to progress in the UK market while 
taking what we know and do well, which is internet and 
telephone delivery of car insurance, beyond the UK. 
Translation: keep doing what we’re doing but do it better 
than we did it last year. 
And that in itself will be challenging because the bar was 
raised again in 2012 with a new record for profits (which 
we’ve done every year since we went public in 2004 and 
actually a few years before) and a return on capital of 60%. 
Financial milestones are great but one of the most 
rewarding moments of the first 20 years came in 2012 
when we were named the best large company to work  
for in the UK and the 4th best multinational company to 
work for in Europe, by the Great Place to Work
®
 Institute. 
We have a simple philosophy at Admiral: if people like 
what they do, they’ll do it better. So we go out of our way 
to make this a good place to work. The result: happier 
staff, record profits. 
Finally, it was a year marked by a long-overdue action. In 
the last half of December David Stevens, co-founder and 
COO, several other senior managers and I went through 
an entry-level sales training course and then got on the 
phones with customers. So after 19 years and 50 weeks,  
I made my first sale! 
This experience was a real eye-opener. We all learned a 
great deal about our business doing this but the biggest 
learning point was first-hand knowledge of how great the 
people who work for us are. It was a pleasure to be trained 
by them, helped by them, play games with them and learn 
from them. We all came away with a huge respect for 
our staff’s ability to tackle the challenges created by a 
complicated product, systems, regulation, etc. and still 
give great customer service every day. We also came 
away reinforced in our belief that if you treat customers 
well they appreciate it and will treat you well too. 
In sum, 2012 was the year of the kangaroo: it bounced 
around a little bit but it turns out to be pretty big, 
strong and energetic with the babies protected in 
the mother’s pouch. 
Great. We‘re off to a good start. Let’s get on with the  
next 20 years.

Admiral Group plc 
Annual Report 2012 09
Performance Overview Other information Financial statements Governance Twenty years ago, Admiral launched on a grey Saturday 
in Wales – the seventh of what ultimately became 
a couple of dozen Direct Line ‘clones’; new players 
and subsidiaries of big, established insurers, copying 
the over-the-‘phone ‘cut out the middle man’ model. 
For such a superficially dull industry, those twenty years 
have seen an astonishing pace of change.
For a start, of the top five private car insurers in 1993, only 
one made it into the top five in 2011 (Royal, Sun Alliance, 
AGF, Eagle Star, Direct Line in 1993 – Direct Line, Admiral, 
Aviva, LV & AXA in 2011).
Back in 1993, one in five customers made a claim each 
year and almost all of those were for bent metal or car 
theft. Twenty years on, it’s heading towards one in ten 
making a claim, but most of the cost of those claims is 
now attributable to ‘bodily injury’. Of course, most 
strikingly, none of the business in 1993 came via the 
internet, and only a minority over the ‘phone. Now, 
almost three quarters of new customers start their 
journey on the internet.
But some things don’t change. The market average 
expense ratio in 1993 was 26%. Last year, after two 
decades of industry consolidation, I.T. investment, 
adaption of direct distribution, exploitation of the 
internet, the industry average expense ratio was 26%. 
Admiral’s was 13%; delivering an eighteenth year of 
better-than-industry average expense ratio, and a 
tenth year of beating it by over ten percentage points.
Our claims ratio has also bettered industry averages, at 
least since the millennium. Our rapid rise up the league 
tables to be the UK’s second largest car insurer, by 
vehicles covered, is all down to this sustained superior 
underwriting performance over many years.
But that’s history. What does the future hold? The 
headlines (unusually in the popular press, as well as the 
trade press) are dominated by the current slew of actual 
and potential legislative and regulatory change – the 
Competition Commission, hot on the heels of the OFT 
enquiry, the Jackson reforms, possible further changes 
to the administration of, and costs associated with bodily 
injury claims, the banning of gender-based rating, the 
newly-formed Financial Conduct Authority’s focus on 
value for money add-ons. But it’s not the ultimate 
outcome of this frenetic activity that will determine the 
health of Admiral’s core UK operation in twenty years’ 
time. Current and proposed changes, as long as they’re 
implemented and enforced even-handedly and universally 
across the market, don’t affect relative competitive 
strength, over anything but the very short-term. Nor do 
they affect overall industry profitability. It is, as it has 
always been, the ability to execute better than others 
in dozens of individually insignificant, but collectively 
important, ways, and to respond to fundamental 
underlying changes more quickly and more adeptly 
than competitors that will be the key to future success.
Late last year, we launched our first major product 
extension ever, with the launch of household insurance. 
One question we will be able to answer in twenty years, or 
possibly sooner, is whether we’ve developed an industry-
beating competence in a second £6 billion market without 
losing our edge in the ever more massive car insurance 
market.
In terms of concrete future guidance on household, all I 
can really say is ‘so far, so good’. Ten weeks in. For what 
that’s worth.

UK Car Insurance Review
Admiral Group plc 
Annual Report 2012 10 UK Car Insurance delivered a profit of £372.8 million – up 
19% on 2011’s result of £313.6 million, primarily driven by 
higher net insurance premium revenue and an improved 
combined ratio (along with associated profit commission). 
Turnover for this core business accounted for 87% of the 
Group total (2011: 90%) and 85% of customers (2011: 88%). 
Growth in the UK was moderated in 2012 in response to 
market conditions in the UK market.
Admiral’s international car insurance businesses continue 
to develop, with turnover rising 33% to £162.9 million 
(2011: £122.1 million) and customer numbers reaching 
435,900 – an increase of 42% on a year earlier. The 
combined loss from the operations was, however, 
higher, at £24.5 million (2011: loss of £9.5 million). This 
was predominantly a result of growth in the younger 
businesses and some strengthening of back year 
claims reserves in the more mature businesses. 
The Group’s UK price comparison business, Confused.com, 
delivered a pre-tax profit of £18.2 million – around 
£2 million higher than 2011’s result, on 7% higher revenue. 
Outside the UK, Admiral’s international price comparison 
businesses (Rastreator.com in Spain and LeLynx.fr in 
France) made a combined loss of only £0.2 million (2011: 
loss of £5.6 million) whilst combined revenue increased 
by nearly 70%. The Group sold its Italian price comparison 
business Chiarezza.it in April 2012.
Admiral’s capital-efficient and highly profitable business 
model led to return on capital employed of 60% (2011: 
59%). A key feature of the business model is the extensive 
use of co- and reinsurance across the Group. During the 
first half of 2012 Admiral announced extensions to its UK 
reinsurance arrangements until at least the end of 2014. 
Admiral’s long-term UK co-insurance agreement (covering 
40% of the business) runs to at least the end of 2016. 
Other Group key performance indicators include:
 Group loss ratio of 78.9%, in line with 2011  
(an improved UK loss ratio offsetting a higher 
international ratio).
 Group expense ratio 17 .7%, up from 16.8% in 2011 (an 
improved UK ratio offset by a higher international ratio).
 Group combined ratio at 96.6% (2011: 95.7%).
Total dividends paid and proposed for the financial 
year amount to 90.6 pence per share (£245 million), an 
increase of 20% on the previous year (2011: 75.6 pence; 
£203 million). The final dividend proposed is 45.5 pence 
per share (25% higher than the final 2011 dividend of  
36.5 pence).
The Group’s results are presented in three key segments 
– UK Car Insurance, International Car Insurance and Price 
Comparison. Other Group items are summarised in a 
fourth section.
Admiral Group grew pre-tax profits in 2012 by 15% 
to £344.6 million (2011: £299.1 million) and earnings per 
share by 16% to 95.1 pence (2011: 81.9 pence). 
Turnover increased slightly to £2,215.1 million 
(2011: £2,190.3 million), whilst net revenue rose 13% 
to £984.3 million (2011: £870.3 million). Customer numbers 
were 6% higher at the end of 2012 at 3.55 million (2011: 
3.36 million).

private car insurance in the UK through four brands – 
Admiral, Bell, Diamond and elephant.co.uk
 Policies are distributed through price comparison 
websites and direct channels (Admiral’s own websites

 Admiral accounts for around 11% of the UK private 
car insurance market in vehicle terms, insuring over 
three million cars at the end of 2012. Total UK premium 
in 2012 was over £1.7 billion. 
 Admiral’s main operations are in Cardiff, Swansea and 
Newport in South Wales; customers are also serviced 
from Nova Scotia, Canada and Bangalore, India.
UK Car Insurance Strategy
The strategy for Admiral’s UK business is unchanged 
and remains relevant and simple: 
 The Group aims to grow profitably its share of the UK 
private motor insurance market whilst maintaining 
a capital-efficient structure.
 At the same time, Admiral endeavours always to  
give excellent service to customers, whilst providing 
a positive environment in which staff can work  
and develop.

UK Car Insurance – Co-insurance and Reinsurance 
Admiral (in the UK and internationally) makes significant 
use of proportional risk sharing agreements, where 
insurers outside the Group underwrite a majority of the 
risk generated, either through co-insurance or quota 
share reinsurance contracts. These arrangements 
include profit commission terms which allow Admiral to 
retain a significant portion of the profit generated.
The two principal advantages of the arrangements are:
 Capital efficiency – The majority of the capital 
supporting the underwriting is held outside the 
Group. As Admiral is typically able to retain much 
of the profit generated via profit commission, 
the return on Group capital is higher than in an 
insurance company with a standard business model.
 Risk mitigation – Co-and reinsurers bear their 
proportional shares of claims expenses and  
hence provide protection should results  
worsen substantially.
Arrangements for 2012 to 2014
In early 2012 the Group was pleased to announce 
extensions to its arrangements such that capacity is 
fully placed until the end of 2014. The underwriting 
splits can be summarised as follows:
 20122013 2014 
Admiral
25.00% 25.00% 25.00%
Great Lakes (Munich Re)
40.00% 40.00% 40.00%
New Re 13.25% 13.25% 13.25%
Hannover Re 8.75% 8.75% 8.75%
Swiss Re 7 .50% 7 .50% 9.00%
Mapfre Re 3.00% 3.00% 4.00%
XL Re 2.50% 2.50% –
Total 100.00% 100.00% 100.00%
The proportion underwritten by Great Lakes (a UK 
subsidiary of Munich Re) is on a co-insurance basis, 
such that 40% of all motor premium and claims for the 
2012 year accrues directly to Great Lakes and does not 
appear in the Group’s income statement. Similarly, 
Great Lakes reimburses the Group for its proportional 
share of expenses incurred in acquiring and 
administering the motor business.
That contract will run until at least the end of 2016, and 
will see Great Lakes co-insure 40% of the UK business 
for the remaining period. Admiral has committed to 
retain at least 25% for the duration, whilst the allocation 
of the balance is at Admiral’s discretion.
All other agreements are quota share reinsurance.
The European and US arrangements are explained 
below in the International Car Insurance section.

UK Car Insurance Financial Performance
Commentary on Admiral’s UK Car Insurance business 
result and its market is contained in Chief Operating 
Officer David Stevens’ review on page 10.
As noted in the Group’s interim 2012 results, the UK  
Car Insurance market became substantially more price 
competitive in 2012 than it had been over 2010 and 2011, 
over which period Admiral grew its business significantly. 
Whilst the number of customers continued to grow, the 
rate of growth was slowed significantly as Admiral opted 
to preserve margin rather than chase growth.
Total premium written in 2012 was broadly flat compared 
to 2011 at just over £1.7 billion, whilst the number of 
customers rose 2% year-on-year to 3.02 million at 
31 December 2012. Vehicle count in the second half 
of the year was flat. Across new business and renewals, 
Admiral cut its rates by around 6% in 2012. Average 
written premium for the year was around £580, down 9% 
on 2011, due in part to rate cuts and in part to portfolio 
changes (notably a shift in favour of renewal business).
Profit from UK Car Insurance increased by 19% to 
£372.8 million (2011: £313.6 million).
UK Car Insurance Underwriting Result and 
Profit Commission
The UK combined ratio improved by around two 
percentage points in 2012 as follows:
UK Car Insurance Combined Ratio 2011 2012 
Loss ratio excluding 
reserve releases 79.8% 80.0%
Reserve releases 2.5% 3.9%
Loss ratio net of releases 77.3% 76.1%
Expense ratio 14.0% 13.6%
Combined ratio 91.3% 89.7%
The loss ratio before releases was broadly flat in the 
year, though larger reserve releases (3.9% of net earned 
premium compared to 2.5%) led to an improved net loss 
ratio of 76.1%.
The higher level of releases compared to 2011 reflected 
the positive development during the year in projected 
ultimate outcomes on prior underwriting years (notably 
2011 and 2010). Claims development in general during 
2012 was encouraging; with no repeat of the spike in 
large bodily injury claims that occurred during H2 2011. 
The projected ultimate combined ratio for Admiral for the 
2012 accident year is 83%, compared to 82% for the 2011 
year. The reported combined ratio for the UK market for 
2011 was 105%. 
Business Review continued
UK Car Insurance Review continued
Claims Reserving
Admiral’s reserving policy (both within the  
claims function and in the financial accounts) is 
initially to reserve conservatively, above internal  
and independent projections of ultimate loss ratios. 
This is designed to create a margin held in reserves  
to allow for unforeseen adverse development in  
open claims and typically results in Admiral making 
above industry average reserve releases. 
As profit commission income is recognised in the 
income statement in line with loss ratios accounted 
for on Admiral’s own claims reserves, the reserving 
policy also results in profit commission income being 
deferred and released over time.

(£18.6 million) from personal injury referral fees. 
In additional, in 2012 Admiral earned around £5 per 
vehicle in credit hire referral fees (£13.6 million). Admiral 
notes that the UK Competition Commission has recently 
embarked upon a review of the car insurance market 
and a potential outcome of the review is a further ban 
on credit hire referral fees. 
Regulatory Environment
The UK Car Insurance business operates predominantly 
under the regulation of the UK Financial Services 
Authority (FSA), and, through a Gibraltar based insurance 
company, under the Financial Services Commission (FSC) 
in that territory.
The FSA regulates two Group companies involved in the 
business – EUI Limited (an insurance intermediary) and 
Admiral Insurance Company Limited (an insurer); whilst 
the FSC regulates Admiral Insurance (Gibraltar) Limited 
(also an insurer).
All three companies are required to maintain capital at 
levels prescribed by their regulator, and all three maintain 
surpluses above those required levels at all times. 
Admiral generates other revenue from a portfolio 
of insurance products that complement the core car 
insurance product, and also fees generated over the life 
of the policy. There is also some (less significant) income 
from other products unconnected to car insurance.
The most material contributors to net other revenue are:
 Profit earned from motor policy upgrade products 
underwritten by Admiral, including breakdown, car 
hire and personal injury covers.
 Profit from other insurance products, not underwritten 
by Admiral.
 Vehicle Commission (see opposite).
 Fees – administration fees, waster leads and referral 
income (see below).
 Instalment income – interest charged to customers 
paying for cover in instalments.
Vehicle Commission
With effect from 1 April 2012, Admiral no longer earns 
Other Revenue from the sale of legal protection policies. 
In addition, the Group began charging its panel of  
co- and reinsurers a vehicle commission. Admiral’s car 
insurance policies will continue to include legal protection 
as an integral feature and there has been no impact on 
customers in the level of cover or cost of policies as a 
result of this change. The planned overall economic 
impact of these two changes is not significant. 
However, the accounting recognition and treatment of 
vehicle commission results in Other Revenue per vehicle 
in 2012 being reduced by approximately £6 (£16 million in 
total). Further detail on the intra-group element of vehicle 
commission is set out in note 3.

The Group has four direct car insurance businesses 
operating outside the UK:
 Admiral Seguros (Seville, Spain): The most mature of 
the Group’s international businesses, having traded 
since October 2006. The business trades via two 
brands – Balumba.es and Qualitas Auto.
 ConTe (Rome, Italy): Launched in May 2008,  
ConTe is the largest of the non-UK insurers  
within the Group.
 Elephant Auto (based in Richmond, Virginia, USA): 
Launched in October 2009 and provides car 
insurance in four US states (Virginia, Maryland, 
Illinois and Texas) with a market size greater than  
the UK.
 L’olivier Assurances (Paris, France): The Group’s 
youngest (and smallest) international insurance 
business, launched in December 2010.
International Car Insurance Strategy 
An important element of Group strategy is to exploit the 
knowledge, skills and resources attaching to Admiral’s 
established UK businesses in order to promote expansion 
overseas in both private car insurance and price 
comparison. Admiral’s objective is to create profitable, 
sustainable and growing businesses, aiming where 
possible to minimise any negative financial impact  
on the Group.
Admiral initially identified five markets into which 
expansion was desirable (based on, among other 
things, the size of the market and the nature of 
distribution and regulation), and having sold German 
insurer AdmiralDirekt.de in 2011, the Group has an 
active presence in the remaining four.
Overall business progress and performance is 
discussed in the following sections.
International Car Insurance
Business Review continued
Admiral Group plc 
Annual Report 2012 16 International Car Insurance Financial Performance
Admiral’s international insurance businesses (in aggregate 
and individually) continued to grow, adding 130,000 
customers and ending 2012 42% larger than a year earlier. 
Turnover grew 33% to £162.9 million (2011: £122.1 million). 
Growth in the younger businesses, along with some 
adverse prior year claims development in the more 
mature operations, led to a higher combined ratio 
however, which increased to 177% from 164%. The higher 
combined ratio, in conjunction with higher net insurance 
premium revenue led to a higher loss, of £24.5 million in 
2012, up from £9.5 million in 2011.
As the Group’s new insurance operations grow, it is 
expected that they will make losses until appropriate 
scale has been achieved. Although the 2012 loss was 
higher than anticipated, the Group is satisfied with 
the progress each business continues to make 
towards the goal of becoming a sustainable, 
growing, profitable operation.
Regulatory Environment
Admiral’s European insurance operations are subject 
to the same regulation as the UK car insurance business, 
details of which are summarised above.
The Group’s US insurer, Elephant Insurance Company is 
regulated by the Virginia State Corporation Commission’s 
Bureau of Insurance. The Company is required to maintain 
capital at levels prescribed by the regulator, and holds a 
surplus above these requirements at all times.
International Car Insurance Co-insurance  
and Reinsurance 
Reinsurance arrangements for the 2012 year remained 
the same as 2011 in all countries, with Admiral 
retaining 35% (Spain and Italy), 30% (France) and  
one third (USA) of the underwriting risk respectively.
The arrangements for 2013 will remain the same, other 
than in Spain, where Admiral will retain 30% of the 
risk, down from 35% in 2012. The balance of 70% will 
be shared equally between Munich Re and Swiss Re.
All contracts are subject to certain caps on the 
reinsurers’ exposures and all contracts have profit 
commission terms that allow Admiral to receive a 
proportion of the profit earned on the underwriting 
once the business reaches cumulative profitability. 
The contracts include proportional sharing 
of ancillary profits.

UK Price Comparison – Confused.com
Confused.com continues to operate in the very competitive 
UK price comparison market, which has been dominated 
by four businesses for a number of years. Media spend 
remained high, though growth in the number of car 
insurance policies distributed via the channel in 2012 
was lower than in prior years.
UK
Price Comparison
 Confused.com is an insurance and financial 
services comparison website.
 Operating in the UK, the site allows consumers 
to compare a range of general insurance and 
financial services products across price and  
policy benefits.
 Confused’s income is primarily generated from 
commissions paid by the product provider on the 
sale of an insurance policy or financial product.
 Confused is one of the UK’s leading car and home 
insurance comparison websites.
Price Comparison Strategy 
 Confused’s strategy is focused on car insurance 
comparison and is aimed at making Confused 
the most competitive car insurance price 
comparison website in the UK market.
International
Price Comparison
 At the end of 2012, the Group had two price 
comparison businesses operating outside the UK:
 – In Spain, Rastreator.com (launched in March 
2009) offers comparison on motor, home, 
motorcycle and life insurance.
 – LeLynx.fr in France (launched January 2010) 
offers comparison on a similar range of products.
Price Comparison Strategy 
 A key part of the Group’s overall strategy is to 
exploit UK expertise in insurance and price 
comparison and export this overseas.
 To date Admiral has targeted four markets 
(Spain, France, Italy and the USA).
 The Group disposed of its Italian operation 
(Chiarezza.it) in April 2012. 
 In early 2013, Admiral launched comparenow.com 
– a price comparison business based in the USA.
Success in delivering against the strategy for price 
comparison is measured against a large number of 
key performance indicators which are common across 
the UK and international businesses. These include 
market share, quote volumes, conversion rates, sales 
volumes, income per sale, revenue per customer and 
cost per sale. 
Price Comparison
Business review continued
Admiral Group plc 
Annual Report 2012 18 Against this backdrop, Confused.com delivered an 
improved result, with revenue 7% higher at £82.7 million 
(2011: £77 .6 million) and profit up £2.1 million to  
£18.2 million (2011: £16.1 million). Market share in 
car insurance price comparison was stable.
Revenue from non-car insurance comparison sources 
increased in actual terms and continued to represent 
around one fifth of total revenue. Confused.com’s 
operating margin improved slightly to 22% (2011: 21%).
International Price Comparison
Following the sale of the Italian price comparison 
operation (Chiarezza) during H1 2012 and the launch 
in Q1 2013 of a new operation in the USA, Admiral now 
operates three price comparison businesses outside 
the UK: in Spain (Rastreator), France (LeLynx) and the 
USA (comparenow.com).
The combined revenue from the operations in 2012 
(on a like-for-like basis) increased by 67% to £21 million, 
with 29% more quotes delivered. Both Rastreator and 
LeLynx have strong positions and brands in their 
respective markets.
The combined result for International Price Comparison 
was a loss of £0.2 million – notably improved from a  
£5.6 million loss in 2011. 
The disposal of Chiarezza had an insignificant impact on 
the income statement.
In March 2013, Admiral launched a new price comparison 
operation in the USA (based in Virginia), trading as 
comparenow.com. The initial investment in the new 
business is not expected to be material in the context 
of the Group. Pre-launch costs are included in Other 
Group Items, below.
Regulatory Environment
Confused.com is regulated by the UK FSA as an insurance 
intermediary and is subject to all relevant intermediation 
rules, including those on solvency capital. 
The European operations are all structured as branches 
of UK companies, with the UK insurance intermediary 
permission passported into Europe. Comparenow.com 
is a regulated insurance agency in Virginia, USA.

The van insurance broking market remained competitive

was lower at 20% and resulting operating profit fell to 
£2.5 million from £2.8 million.
Gladiator increased its customer base by around 8% 
to 94,800.
Share Scheme Charges
These costs relate to the Group’s two share schemes, 
further detail on which is set out in the notes to the financial 
statements. The increase in the charge relates to a higher 
number of shares awarded in 2012 compared to 2011 
(resulting from increased headcount across the Group).
UK Household Insurance
In December 2012, the Group launched a UK household 
insurance product, underwritten within the Group and 
based in the Group’s Cardiff offices. Common with other 
launches, initial plans are modest, and the business is 
supported by proportional reinsurance covering 70% of 
the underwriting risk (shared between Munich Re, 40% 
and Swiss Re, 30%).
Investments and Cash
Investment Strategy
Admiral maintained a low-risk investment strategy 
throughout the year, with a broadly consistent allocation 
of funds to the three main asset categories (cash at bank, 
cash deposits and money market funds) as in recent years. 
The key focus of the Group’s investment strategy is 
capital preservation, with additional priorities including 
low volatility of returns and high levels of liquidity. 
The Group’s Investment Committee continues to 
perform regular reviews of the strategy to ensure it 
remains appropriate.

Investment and interest income in 2012 was £15.9 million, 
up 16% on 2011 (£13.7 million). The rate of return was 
similar to 2011, at slightly less than 1%.
The Group continues to generate substantial amounts of 
cash, and its capital efficient business model enables the 
distribution of the majority of post-tax profits as dividends.

The key features to note are:
 Total cash plus investments increased by £435 million 
or 31% (2011: £474 million, 52%), the lower rate of 
growth resulted from lower growth in the UK business; 
somewhat offset by higher growth internationally.
 The net change in actual cash balances was small, 
as funds were transferred into investments.
Other Financial Items
Taxation
The taxation charge in the income statement is 
£86.2 million (2011: £77 .8 million), which equates to 
25.0% (2011: 26.0%) of profit before tax. The average 
rate of UK Corporation Tax in 2012 was 24.5%.
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share rose by 16% to 95.1 pence from 
81.9 pence. The change is in line with profit growth. 
Dividends
The Directors have proposed a final dividend for the 
financial year of 45.5 pence per share. Total dividends 
for the year amount to 90.6 pence per share, 20% higher 
than the 75.6 pence per share distributed in respect 
of 2011.
The final dividend is made up of a 21.4 pence normal 
element based on the stated dividend policy of 
distributing 45% of post-tax profits, and a further special 
element of 24.1 pence. The special dividend is calculated 
with reference to distributable reserves after considering 
capital that is required to be held a) for regulatory 
purposes; b) to fund expansion activities; and c) as 
a further prudent buffer against unforeseen events.
The payment date is 24 May 2013, ex-dividend date 
1 May and record date 3 May.
Capital Structure, Financial Position
The Group continues to manage its capital to ensure 
that all entities within the Group are able to continue as 
going concerns and also to ensure that regulated entities 
comfortably meet regulatory capital requirements. Excess 
capital above these levels within subsidiaries is paid up to 
the Group holding company in the form of dividends on a 
regular basis. 
Capital continues to be held in equity form, with no debt.
The majority of the Group’s capital requirement is derived 
from its European insurance operations, Admiral Insurance 
(Gibraltar) Limited (AIGL) and Admiral Insurance Company 
Limited (AICL). The minimum capital requirements and 
surplus position at the end of the 2012 for those companies, 
along with the overall Group position was as follows:
£m AIGL AICL Group
Net assets less goodwill £170m £85m £395m
Minimum capital 
requirement £78m £25m £122m
Surplus over minimum 
requirement £92m £60m £273m
Total regulatory capital 
requirement £240m
Surplus over regulatory 
capital requirement £155m
The Directors note the delay in the progress towards 
implementing the Solvency II regulatory regime in the 
EU. As previously noted, the Directors do not believe, 
based on current guidance, that there will be a material 
change in the level of the Group’s capital surplus under 
the new regime.
Other than as stated below, as far as the Company is 
aware, there are no persons with significant direct or 
indirect holdings in the Company. Information provided 
to the Company pursuant to the Financial Services 
Authority’s (FSA) Disclosure and Transparency Rules 
(DTRs) is published on a Regulatory Information Service

surance liabilities 
et change in 
es and 
 incom Principal Risks and Uncertainties
Risk Impact Mitigating Factors
1.  UK Car Insurance – erosion of  
competitive advantage 
Admiral has typically been able to produce 
a significant combined ratio advantage 
over the UK market as a whole. There is a 
risk that this advantage and/or the level 
of underwriting profit (and associated 
profit commission) generated by Admiral 
could erode. 
An example of how this risk might arise 
is a failure to successfully adapt to the EU 
Gender Directive which came into effect 
in December 2012.
The impact on the business would be a 
worse UK Car Insurance result and lower 
return on capital employed.
A sustained and uncorrected erosion of 
competitive advantage could affect the 
ability of the Group to extend its reinsurance 
arrangements, which might in turn mean the 
Group having to hold more capital.
A wide range of factors contribute 
to Admiral’s combined ratio outperformance  
of the UK market. These include:

management and teams in key business 
areas including pricing, claims management, 
operations, IT and marketing

approach to business decisions

in staff, systems and processes
 
to react quickly to market conditions  
and developments

infrastructure and efficient acquisition costs.
2.  UK & International Car Insurance – 
claims shocks
The Group is exposed to underwriting  
risk through its underwriting of motor  
insurance policies. 
The impact on the Group would be that 
claims costs could rise significantly above 
historic or expected levels, reducing the 
Group’s profitability. This might be for a 
number of reasons, including:

periodic payment orders, Ogden 
discount rate changes, the EU 
Gender Directive)

catastrophe events (for example 
severe storm or flood)
 
individual claims
 
claimant behaviour
 
injury claims cost inflation.
Many of the potential causes of claims shocks 
are outside the control of the Group and the 
focus is, therefore, generally on how to prepare 
for and react to the occurrence of such events.
For very large claims (catastrophe and 
otherwise) the Group purchases excess of loss 
reinsurance, which mitigates the loss to the 
selected deductible amount (typically between 
£5 million and £7 million at the total claim level).
The current economic environment has led 
management to have an increased focus on  
the identification and prevention of claims 
fraud, including material investment in  
systems and staff.
In the case of legislative changes impacting 
existing claims, the Group holds a buffer in 
booked reserves to cover significant changes.
To cover other potential claims shocks, the 
Group continues to hold an additional buffer  
in its reserves in excess of the projected 
ultimate outcomes.
3.  Geographic and product expansion –  
risk of failure
The Group has launched eight new 
operations outside the UK in the past six 
years, and launched a UK Household 
insurance product in December 2012. 
There is an ongoing risk that one or more of 
the operations fail to become a sustainable 
long-term business.
The impact on the Group could be higher 
than planned losses (and potentially closure 
costs) and distraction of key management. 
A collective failure of these businesses would 
threaten the Group’s objective to diversify its 
earnings by expanding in overseas locations.
The Group’s approach to expansion is cautious. 
The overseas insurance businesses start small 
and are all backed by proportional reinsurance 
support which provides substantial mitigation 
against start-up losses in the early years.
New price comparison businesses also focus  
on modest starts with low set-up costs and 
relatively small initial media spend budgets.  
This tends to mean that the losses a new 
operation can incur are minimised whilst 
management assess the likelihood of the 
business succeeding.
The Directors are mindful of management 
stretch and regularly assess the suitability of the 
management structure in place for the Group’s 
international operations. 
The table below sets out the principal risks currently faced by the Group, with further 
significant risks noted below. The report on Corporate Governance later in the Annual 
Report describes the risk management framework in place throughout the Group.
Admiral Group plc 
Annual Report 2012 22 Risk Impact Mitigating Factors
4.  Other revenue – potential diminution
There is a risk that the level of ancillary  
profit earned per customer will diminish.  
This might be due to regulatory or legal 
changes, or customer or market behaviour.
The impact on the Group would be less 
profit earned on the car insurance portfolios 
and a lower return on capital employed.
The most immediate risk to ancillary profits 
arises from regulatory intervention and most 
notably the referral of UK motor insurance to 
the Competition Commission. Whilst there 
are a range of possible outcomes from this 
study, Admiral is supportive of any changes 
that are likely to lead to lower claims costs. 
Admiral earns other revenue from a portfolio  
of products and seeks to minimise reliance on 
any single item. This would mitigate the impact 
of a regulatory change which might affect a 
particular product or income stream. Admiral 
continuously assesses the value of the products 
it offers, and makes changes to ensure the 
products continue to offer value to 
policyholders. 
5.  UK Price Comparison – effects of 
continued competition 
There is a highly competitive UK market with 
four main businesses currently attempting to 
increase their market share through 
aggressive media activity. 
Admiral is dependent on the four main UK 
price comparison websites as an important 
source of new business and growth. The 
growth in this distribution channel could 
slow, cease or reverse, or Admiral could  
lose one or more of the websites as a  
source of leads.
The impact on Confused.com of higher 
levels of competition in the price comparison 
market, either through the aggressive 
activities of existing players or the entry of 
significant new participants would be to 
lower profits. However, a more competitive 
market might benefit the car insurance 
business through lower acquisition costs.
The impact on the UK Car Insurance 
business of losing one or more of the 
websites would be a potentially material 
reduction in new business volumes.
The Group’s ownership of Confused.com, which 
is one of the leading UK price comparison 
websites and operates independently of the UK 
car insurance business, helps to mitigate the risk 
of over-reliance on this distribution channel. 
Admiral also contributes materially to the 
revenues of the other price comparison 
businesses and therefore it is not considered 
probable that a material source of new business 
would be lost.

6.  Co-insurance and reinsurance 
arrangements
Admiral uses proportional co-insurance 
and reinsurance across its insurance 
businesses to reduce its own capital 
needs (and increase return on the capital 
it does hold) and to mitigate the cost and 
risk of establishing new operations.
There is a risk that such support will not be 
available in the future if the results of either 
the UK business or (more realistically) one or 
more of the international operations are not 
satisfactory to the co- and/or reinsurers.
The impact on the Group would be the need 
to raise additional capital to support 
underwriting. This could be in the form of 
equity or debt. Return on capital would likely 
be lower than current levels.
Admiral mitigates risks to its reinsurance 
arrangements by ensuring that it has a strongly 
rated and diverse range of partners. Admiral has 
enjoyed a long-term relationship with one of the 
world’s strongest reinsurers, Munich Re, which 
has supported Admiral since 2000. The Group 
also has strong relationships with a number of 
other reinsurers, including Amlin, Hannover Re, 
Mapfre Re, New Re, Swiss Re and XL Re 
(avoiding reliance on a single partner).
In the UK, co- and reinsurance arrangements 
have been agreed up to the end of 2014, 
reflecting confidence in the Admiral UK car 
insurance business. Pricing on these deals was 
in line with existing arrangements. The long-
term co-insurance agreement with Munich  
Re will remain in place (at 40% of the business) 
until at least the end of 2016. 
7.  Credit risk 
Admiral is primarily exposed to credit risk in 
the form of a) default of reinsurer; b) failure  
of banking or investment counterparty.
The impact of the materialisation of a major 
credit event on the Group may, dependent 
on its nature and severity, require additional 
capital to be raised. The Group would also 
need to ensure that it had sufficient liquid 
assets to meet its claims and other liabilities 
as they fell due.  
The mitigation of these risks is discussed in 
note 5c of the financial statements.
The Board also considers the following risks to be significant:
 Operational risk – for example, major fraud (considered to be relatively low impact, and  
mitigated by a wide range of internal controls) and the resilience of IT systems.
 IT Development risk – failure to invest in appropriate technology to support the Group’s future business 
development, mitigated by regular review of the effectiveness of the Group’s IT capability by executive 
management and the Board.
 People risk – failure to recruit, develop and retain suitable talent. Further detail on how Admiral interacts 
with its employees is set out in the Corporate Responsibility section following.

Corporate
Responsibility
Corporate Responsibility at Admiral encompasses four 
key areas:
 Employees 
 Customers
 Charity and Community 
 Environment.
Employees
‘If people like what they do, they will do  
it better.’
This simple philosophy runs throughout the Group,  
in both our UK and overseas offices – and it works! 
In order to understand why our approach works so 
well, it is useful to understand the key characteristics 
of working life at Admiral:
i) Communication ii) Equality
iii) Reward and Recognition iv) Fun
Communication at Admiral is open, transparent and 
two-way. Employees are provided with a wide range 
of communication tools to assist in understanding our 
goals and objectives. We work to communicate these 
in as many ways as possible. For example, everyone 
is invited to participate in online chats with senior 
management. This year we have held three online chats 
featuring our CEO Henry Engelhardt, and one featuring 
our COO David Stevens. Other communication tools 
include our annual Staff General Meeting (SGM), internal 
newsletters, team briefings, suggestion schemes and 
staff forums. 
We have a really simple approach to Equality. Everyone 
should be treated the same. There are no executive 
dining rooms, no company cars, no dress code, and 
everyone has their own desk. 
Fundamental to equality, and also important for  
Reward and Recognition, is our performance-related  
pay structure and share ownership scheme. At Admiral  
we like to reward and recognise our employees for  
both their own personal achievement, and the overall 
performance of the Group. 
We reward and recognise our employees for the overall 
success of the Group through the share ownership 
scheme, a key feature of the remuneration of employees. 
Further details of our salary structure and our share 
schemes are available in the Remuneration Report on 
page 47 .

This year, eight of our senior managers visited our 
New Business call centre for two weeks of intensive 
sales training before taking live telephone calls from 
our customers. The team included Henry Engelhardt 
(CEO) and David Stevens (COO).
None of the managers have worked in our contact 
centres previously, but after gaining hands-on-
experience on the ‘frontline’ of our business they 
have an increased understanding of the needs  
of our customers and the day-to-day challenges  
faced by our staff. 
Admiral Group plc 
Annual Report 2012 24 As of 31 December 2012 an employee who joined us  
on 1 January 2005 would have received a total of 2,496 
shares, of which 1,821 would now be matured and 1,184 
could be sold free of income tax and national insurance.  
If none of the matured shares had been sold, these shares 
would be worth £21,124 (based on the share price of 
£11.60 on 31 December 2012). 
The Board firmly believes that share ownership motivates 
employees, decreases attrition and makes it easier to 
recruit successfully. According to our staff survey 79% 
of employees say they are more likely to stay with 
Admiral because of the share schemes.
Fun plays a vital role in helping us to ensure that 
our employees enjoy their work, encouraging each and 
every individual to produce excellent results. Organised 
activities for our staff are often weird, wild and wonderful, 
but they are also a great tool for motivation. 
So how do we know our approach works? Our staff  
tell us. One of the most important tools we use to 
measure employee satisfaction is an anonymous survey 
that collects views on what it is like to work for Admiral. 
The survey results are analysed by department and each 
department manager shares the findings with their  
team, exploring any issues and concerns before 
making improvements. 
The key results concerning morale, and whether 
employees feel that their opinions are important, 
are provided in the table on the previous page. There 
are no specific targets with respect to the survey results 
as the Executive team use the data to identify trends 
in employee perception, rather than absolute values.
This year we are pleased to announce that more 
employees than ever before would recommend Admiral 
as a good place to work – 96% of employees answered 
positively to this question – the highest number since the 
survey began in 1999. Likewise, the number of employees 
who believe that Admiral strives to understand the 
thoughts and opinions of its employees is higher than 
ever before, at 91%.

All singing,

Admiral’s Talent 
Show brought our 
staff together.
This year we organised a new event in the form of an 
Admiral Talent Show, a contest open to all of our UK 
and overseas employees. The aim was to showcase 
the most talented performers from across the Group 
in a variety of acts including singing, dancing and 
comedy. Auditions were held in our offices in South 
Wales as well as in the USA, Canada, France, Italy, 
Spain and India. The response was fantastic, and all 
of the judges were impressed by the standard of 
performing talent. 
The finalists from each country were invited to 
compete against each other at the Wales Millennium 
Centre in Cardiff, performing in front of a group of 
senior managers from each of the countries in which 
we operate. The event was won by French band, 
Lollipop, with second and third places going to 
singers Lewis Cook from Cardiff and Niki Lester 
from the USA, respectively. 
The event enabled us to unite our international and 
UK employees, giving them a chance to get to know 
each other. This is just one way in which we have 
encouraged our staff to have fun this year, upholding 
the vibrant culture of working life at Admiral.

Customers
Ensuring that we give a great service to our customers 
is essential to the future growth of our business, both 
in the UK and overseas. 
There are many initiatives in place to ensure that 
customers are treated fairly, efficiently and with  
respect including:
 Customer-focused measures programme.
 Treating Customers Fairly (TCF) reporting.
 Comment form analysis.
 Complaints analysis.
Every department has its own set of customer-focused 
measures to gauge performance. The measures are 
updated each year to challenge departments to make 
continual improvements. The programme is reported 
every month in our internal magazine and intranet, and 
the best departments are rewarded at our prestigious 
Quality Awards. 
We work within the regulatory framework of the Financial 
Services Authority (FSA) in the UK. One of the FSA’s 
statutory objectives is to help customers get a fair deal. 
There is a comprehensive monthly Treating Customers 
Fairly (TCF) Management Information pack, pulling 
together specific measures that demonstrate we are 
consistently treating our customers fairly. Over 150 
individual TCF measures have now been adopted.
A report is produced each month and discussed at the 
UK Risk Management Committee (RMC), with process or 
behavioural changes agreed where appropriate. Please 
refer to the Corporate Governance section of this report 
for further details of the Risk Governance framework.
The TCF management information is embedded in 
our culture. If either a red or amber grade occurs the 
department manager investigates the issues and provides 
information on the reason for the score, along with a plan 
to improve the results. The table below displays some of 
the key measures from the TCF report.

During 2012 the percentage of Financial Ombudsman 
Service complaints found in favour of Admiral was 69%, 
whereas the target is >75%. This is an area that has been 
below target for a number of years and the details of 
the decisions are closely reviewed to help identify 
further improvements to Admiral’s products, services 
and processes.
We encourage our customers to provide us with feedback 
on our services. The main way in which we do this is 
through our Customer Comment Form, which is a key 
measure of the TCF report. The Customer Comment 
Form enables our customers to rate the service of our  
call centre staff on a scale of one to ten in four key areas 
including ‘helpfulness’, ‘efficiency’, ‘communication’ or 
‘knowledge’, and ‘politeness’. 
The annual Quality Awards celebrate achievements  
from across the Group in our customer-focused  
measures programme. 
Awards include, ‘Best Measures Performance’, 
‘Treating Customers Fairly Winner’ and ‘Best 
Complaint Prevention Winner’, amongst others. 
Our Quality Awards encourage employees to 
perform well in quality measures throughout the year 
in order to increase both their own individual quality 
score, and that of their department. This helps to 
ensure that we are compliant with TCF requirements 
and that our customers are treated fairly. 
Celebrating star  
performance
Our Quality Awards 
reward those who 
provide excellent 
customer service.
Admiral Group plc 
Annual Report 2012 26 We are currently trialling a new way of obtaining customer 
feedback via SMS text messaging, with a view to 
increasing the level of direct feedback that we receive. 
Our Claims department are now gathering most of their 
customer feedback via SMS, and we plan to introduce this 
method to other departments in the future. 
The feedback gained from our Customer Comment Form 
analysis and SMS feedback allows us to pinpoint areas in 
need of improvement, and to identify employees who 
could benefit from further training. This enables us to 
continue to provide excellent customer service as the 
business continues to grow.
Charity and Community
Admiral plays a positive role in the community through 
charitable giving and sponsorship of local community 
partnerships. We promote payroll giving and provide 
matched funding for eligible employee initiatives. In 
2012, we donated £141,000 to various local and national 
charities (2011: £194,000) and £285,000 (2011: £232,000) 
to subsidise local events for the public. The amount the 
Group donates fluctuates annually due to changes in 
sponsorship initiatives and employee demand for 
matched funding.
No journey too tough
One team completed  
a sponsored walk  
to the top of Pen-y-Fan 
mountain – the highest 
peak in South Wales.
90-Day Challenge
Since 2008 we have had a close relationship with  
the Prince’s Trust, the UK’s leading youth charity 
dedicated to helping disadvantaged young people 
to enter into work, education or training. We have 
won the Prince’s Trust Cymru (Wales) regional 
fundraising competition each of the last three years. 
This year, we built upon this achievement by 
raising even more money! In September our CEO, 
Henry Engelhardt, set our UK employees an exciting 
objective in the form of the 90-Day Challenge. Each 
department had to compete against each other to 
raise the most money within 90 days, through any 
means they could think of. Fundraising activities 
included cake sales, sponsored walks, raffles and 
online auctions. 
Through the hard work and generosity of our 
employees we managed to raise just over £50,000  
for the Prince’s Trust through our 90-Day Challenge, 
bringing the total raised for the charity in 2012 to  
well over £100,000.
We would like to thank all of our staff for their 
commitment in supporting the Prince’s Trust, and  
we look forward to further supporting the charity  
in 2013.

Performance Overview Financial statements Governance Other information SEAT Young Driver Scheme
We have been dedicated sponsors of the SEAT 
Young Driver scheme since its launch in October 
2009. This nationwide scheme enables 11 to 17-year-
olds to complete driving lessons with fully-qualified 
driving instructors long before they can even sit their 
test, using simulated road systems set up on private 
ground and featuring obstacles like traffic lights, 
junctions and roundabouts. 
The objective of the scheme is to help reduce the 
death toll amongst young, inexperienced, drivers.  
In 2010, we found that 17 and 18-year-old motorists 
are twice as likely to have a road accident as someone 
in their 30s, three times as likely as someone in their 
40s and six times as likely as someone aged over 50. 
However, Swedish research shows that young driver 
accident rates can be reduced by learning to drive 
over a longer time period and at a younger age 
(OECD and the European Conference of Ministers  
of Transport, 2006). 
With 20 venues now open and 10 more due to open 
by March 2013, the Young Driver programme has 
delivered over 75,000 lessons, with plans for a further 
75,000 in 2013. The scheme is proven to work; only 
9% of Young Driver participants experience a crash 
within the first 6 months of passing their test, 
compared to the national average of 20%.
We support the Young Driver scheme because it 
enables us to play a role in increasing the number of 
well-trained, responsible young drivers on UK roads, 
resulting in fewer accidents amongst this traditionally 
high-risk group. This will help us to provide low-cost 
car insurance for young drivers. 
Making young 
drivers safer
Admiral is a key 
sponsor of SEAT’s 
Young Driver Scheme.
Environment 
We are committed to:
 Raising and maintaining employee awareness of,  
and ensuring that everyone is actively engaged in, 
activities to reduce our environmental impact.
 Measuring and monitoring key aspects of our 
environmental performance and regularly reviewing 
progress to reduce the amount of resources consumed 
per employee.
 Complying with the requirement, expected to be 
effective from October 2013, to report annual levels  
of greenhouse gas emissions in line with guidance 
provided by the Department for Environment, 
Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) in partnership with the 
Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC).
The main source of our carbon emissions is the 
consumption of electricity and gas in our offices. At 
present we lease buildings rather than owning them 
outright, which means that we are largely dependent 
upon the managing agents of our properties to make 
changes which reduce water and energy consumption. 
We encourage our employees to recycle wherever 
possible, and our Facilities department continue to 
discuss ways to reduce our UK energy consumption  
with the Carbon Trust.
Full details of our Corporate Responsibility  
strategy are available on our corporate website,  
www.admiralgroup.co.uk, including further examples  
of what we do for our employees, our customers,  
charity and community and the environment.

Admiral Group plc 
Annual Report 2012 28 Introduction from the Chairman
The Board is committed to maintaining the highest 
standards of corporate governance. We believe that 
having a sound corporate governance framework enables 
effective and efficient decision making and ensures that 
there is there is the right balance of skills and experience 
to assess and manage the risks in the markets in which 
the Group operates. However we also believe that good 
governance should be proportionate and that individual 
responsibility and accountability should not be lost 
within a multi-layered committee structure that distances 
senior management from the day-to-day reality of 
operational activity.
This Report sets out the governance framework 
and the approach that it has taken in 2012 to achieve 
the standards of good corporate governance for 
which it is accountable to the Group’s shareholders. 
It describes how the principles set out in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’) have 
been applied, and details the extent to which 
the Group has complied with the principles and 
provisions of the Code during the year under review.
This Report is structured in order to demonstrate 
to shareholders that the Group has considered and 
complied with each section of the Code: Leadership; 
Effectiveness; Accountability and Relations with 
Shareholders. Remuneration is dealt with in the 
separate Remuneration Report.

Admiral Group plc 
Annual Report 2012 31 The UK Corporate Governance Code
The Board complied with the Code in all respects 
during 2012 except for Code E.1.1, which requires that 
the Senior Independent Director should attend meetings 
with a range of shareholders. The Company has a 
comprehensive programme of meetings and dialogue 
with institutional investors and the Chairman makes 
himself available for meetings with the largest 10 such 
investors. The views of investors expressed through this 
dialogue are communicated to the Board as a whole on 
a regular basis through the Investor Relations report. 
All Directors can, therefore, develop an understanding 
of issues or concerns of major shareholders should any be 
raised. Feedback from shareholders suggests that these 
arrangements for communication between the Company 
and its shareholders continue to be viewed by them as 
effective. The Senior Independent Director is always 
available to meet with individual shareholders on 
request to ensure the Board is aware of any shareholder 
concerns that cannot be resolved through the routine 
mechanisms for investor communications.
The Admiral Group Board
The Board is the principal decision-making forum for the 
Group providing entrepreneurial leadership, both directly 
and through its committees, and by delegating authority 
to the Executive team. The Board is responsible for 
organising and directing the affairs of the Group in a 
manner that is most likely to promote its success for 
the benefit of its members as a whole. The Board is 
accountable to shareholders for setting and achieving 
the Group’s strategic objectives, for the creation and 
delivery of strong sustainable financial and operational 
performance, for ensuring that in carrying out its duties 
the Group’s legal and regulatory obligations are being 
met, and for ensuring that it operates within appropriately 
established risk parameters. The Group’s UK regulated 
Corporate Governance continued
entities are responsible to the Financial Services Authority 
(FSA) for ensuring compliance with the Group’s UK 
regulatory obligations and that dealings with the FSA are 
handled in a constructive, cooperative and transparent 
manner. Similar provisions apply in respect of the Group’s 
international businesses with regard to the relevant 
regulatory authorities in those overseas jurisdictions 
in which the Group also operates.
The Board has adopted a formal schedule of matters 
reserved for the Board’s consideration which is monitored 
by the Company Secretary and reviewed by the Board on 
an annual basis. Specific matters reserved to the Board 
include the approval of:
 The Group’s long term objectives and 
corporate strategy; 
 Operating and capital budgets, financial results, 
and any significant changes to accounting practices 
or policies;
 The Group’s capital structure;
 Results and financial reporting;
 The system of internal control and risk management;
 The Group’s overall risk appetite;
 Changes to the structure, size and composition 
of the Board, including new appointments;
 Succession plans for the Board and senior 
management;
 Annual review of its own performance and that 
of its Board Committees; 
 Dividend policy and proposals for dividend payments; 
 Major acquisitions, disposals, and other 
transactions outside delegated limits;
 Review of the Group’s overall corporate 
governance arrangements. 
Admiral Group plc 
Annual Report 2012 32 The Board met on seven occasions in 2012 with five of 
these meetings being held over two days. The Board 
also held a strategy day devoted entirely to analysis 
and challenge by the Directors, and particularly the Non-
Executive Directors, of the strategic objectives of the 
Group’s UK and international businesses. The Chairman 
visits each of the Group’s overseas operations every year 
and Non-Executive Directors are invited to join either him 
or the Chief Executive on one or more of their overseas 
visits each year. In addition, the Non-Executive Directors 
and the Chairman met during the year without the 
Executive Directors being present. In order to increase 
their understanding of the operation of the Group 
below Board level, the Non-Executive Directors and 
the Chairman also attended two dinners with members 
of the Group’s senior management team without the 
Executive Directors being present. 
Directors are expected to attend all meetings of the 
Board and the Committees on which they serve and 
to devote sufficient time to the Group to perform their 
duties. Where Directors are unable to attend meetings 
they receive papers for that meeting giving them the 
opportunity to raise any issues with the Chairman in 
advance of the meeting. The number of scheduled 
Board meetings and Committee meetings of which 
they are a member attended by each Director during 
2012 is provided in the table below.

Financial statements Governance Performance Overview Other information
Admiral Group plc 
Annual Report 2012 33 Corporate Governance continued
Agendas and papers are circulated to the Board in a 
timely manner in preparation for Board and Committee 
meetings. These papers are supplemented by information 
specifically requested by the Directors from time to time. 
All Board and Committee meetings during the year 
were held in an open atmosphere with their Chairmen 
encouraging robust and constructive challenge and 
debate. All Directors have, therefore, been able to bring 
independent judgement to bear on issues such as 
strategy, risk management, performance, and resources. 
Additional meetings are called when required and there 
is contact between meetings, where necessary, to 
progress the Group’s business.
The Company Secretary
All the Directors have access to the advice and services of 
the Company Secretary. He has responsibility for ensuring 
that Board procedures are followed and for advising the 
Board, through the Chairman, on governance matters. 
The Company Secretary provides updates to the Board 
on regulatory and corporate governance issues, new 
legislation, and Directors’ duties and obligations. The 
appointment and removal of the Company Secretary 
is one of the matters reserved for the Board.
Board Effectiveness
The performance and effectiveness of the Board and 
its Committees is fundamental to the success of the 
Group and there is a rigorous evaluation each year to 
assess how well the Board, its Committees, the Directors 
and the Chairman are performing. It is the Group’s policy 
that every three years an external consultant, who has 
no connection with the Company, carries out a formal 
review of the Board’s performance and such an evaluation 
process took place in 2010. The Board will undergo an 
external review in 2013 as the Group seeks to further 
enhance the effectiveness of the Board.
The evaluation process in 2012 was led by the Chairman 
with support from the Company Secretary. The process 
consisted of the completion, by all Directors, of a 
comprehensive questionnaire evaluating the performance 
of the Board and its Committees. The questionnaire 
considered board processes and their effectiveness, 
Board composition, Board objectives, Board support, and 
content of discussion and focus at Board meetings and 
invited Directors to indicate where specific improvements 
could be made. Completion of the questionnaire by each 
Director was followed by one-to-one discussions between 
each Director and the Chairman where the Board’s role 
and structure, process, relationships, and any emerging 
issues were discussed. 
The overall results of the evaluation were considered 
by the Chairman and the principal recommendations 
presented by him for review and discussion by the 
Board in January 2013. The evaluation concluded that 
good progress had been achieved in most of the areas 
identified for action in the last Board evaluation and that 
the Board and its Committees had continued to work very 
effectively in relation to most dimensions. Improvements 
have been seen in many of the areas of focus identified 
in the evaluation undertaken in 2011. These included 
the process of individual Non-Executive Directors 
accompanying the Chairman and Chief Executive on 
at least one of their overseas visits made during the 
year with such visits enabling Non-Executive Directors 
to get a more in-depth understanding of the operational 
and strategic challenges faced by the business. The 
importance of effective succession planning and 
identifying talented individuals across the Group who 
have senior management potential has continued to be 
a particular area of focus during the year. The Board has 
been mindful that several Non-Executive Directors will 
shortly reach nine years’ service on the Board.
In addition, the Chairman has concluded that each 
Director contributes effectively and demonstrates 
full commitment to his/her duties. As a result of the 
evaluation undertaken in 2012, the following emerged 
as areas of particular focus:
 Recognising that over the next three to four years there 
was likely to be succession of a number of Directors, 
the importance was stressed of having a structured 
succession plan that delivered the competencies and 
experience required amongst Directors, in particular 
where Committee Chairs were involved, and ensured 
that these various moves took place in the right order;
 Greater utilisation to be made by the Group of the 
competencies and experience of Non-Executive 
Directors in order that they could be available for 
informal input into topics, if helpful, for Executive 
Directors and other senior managers between 
Board meetings;
 To alter the process of business review so as to review 
each Group business in-depth once a year, combining 
an assessment of what had been achieved since last 
review against what had been planned; how the 
prior year’s actual and planned performance sit in 
comparison with those for earlier years; and to agree 
what might be expected to be achieved over the next 
12 months, identifying the KPIs against which progress 
would be measured.
In addition to the annual Board Effectiveness Review 
and in order to provide regular information as to the 
effective functioning of the Board and its meeting 
processes, following each Board meeting the Directors 
provide feedback, via the completion of an online 
questionnaire, as to the effectiveness of each Board 
meeting including the efficacy of the presentation of 
discussion topics and whether time available for the 
meeting was used effectively. 
Admiral Group plc 
Annual Report 2012 34 The Chief Executive, to whom they report, appraises 
annually the performance of the individual Executive 
Directors. The Chairman, taking into account the views of 
the other Directors, reviews the performance of the Chief 
Executive. The performance of the Chairman is reviewed 
by the Board led by the Senior Independent Director 
(‘SID’). Following the latest review, the SID considered  
and discussed with the Chairman the comments and 
feedback that had been received from the Directors 
as part of the Chairman’s evaluation questionnaire. 
Following these discussions with the Chairman, the  
SID was able to confirm that the performance of the 
Chairman continues to be effective, and that he continues 
to demonstrate appropriate commitment to his role. 
The Roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive
The Board has approved a statement that sets out the 
clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman 
and the Chief Executive. The Chairman is primarily 
responsible for the leadership and workings of the 
Board, setting its agenda, and monitoring its 
effectiveness. The Chairman is not involved in the day-
to-day management of the business. Save for matters 
reserved for decision by the Board, the Chief Executive, 
with the support of the other Executive Directors, is 
responsible for proposing the strategy to be adopted by 
the Group; running the business in accordance with the 
strategy agreed by the Board; and implementing specific 
Board decisions relating to the operation of the Group. 
The statements of division of responsibilities and matters 
reserved for decision by the Board are reviewed annually.
Board Balance and Independence
The Board continues to give careful consideration to its 
structure and balance in the context of the need to refresh 
Board and committee membership in an orderly manner 
so as to maintain the continuity of Board process and 
the strength of personal interaction which underlies the 
effectiveness of the Board as a team. The Board remains 
satisfied that it has the appropriate balance of skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge of the Group 
to enable it and its Committees to discharge its duties 
and responsibilities effectively, as required by the Code.
The Board currently comprises twelve Directors, the 
Chairman (who was independent on appointment), three 
Executive Directors, seven independent Non-Executive 
Directors, and one Non-Executive Director, Manfred 
Aldag, who is employed by a significant shareholder 
and is not, therefore, considered independent. There 
is no requirement that the significant shareholder has 
representation on the Board and, accordingly, Mr. Aldag’s 
appointment is subject to the same appointment and 
removal process as the other Board Directors. As can 
be seen from the Directors’ biographies on page 30, 
the Directors have a broad range of skills and experience 
and can bring independent judgement to bear on issues 
of strategy, performance, resources and standards of 
conduct which are integral to the success of the Group.
Although Colin Holmes holds, with Alastair Lyons, a cross-
directorship in Bovis Homes Group PLC, the Board has 
determined that Colin Holmes remains independent in 
character and judgement and that his holding of a cross-
directorship does not affect his ability to present an 
objective, rigorous and constructive challenge to the 
assumptions and viewpoints presented by management 
and the Board.
The Board, having given thorough consideration to the 
matter, considers seven of the Non-Executive Directors 
to be independent and is not aware of any relationships 
or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could 
appear to affect, the judgement of any of them. It is the 
view of the Board that the independent Non-Executive 
Directors are of sufficient calibre and number that their 
views carry significant weight in the Board’s decision 
making, and that they are free from any relationship 
or circumstance that could affect, or appear to affect, 
their independent judgement. 
Independent Non-Executive Directors are currently 
appointed for fixed periods of three years, subject to 
election by shareholders. The initial three-year period 
may be extended for two further three-year periods 
subject to re-election by shareholders. Their letters 
of appointment may be inspected at the Company’s 
registered office or can be obtained on request from 
the Company Secretary.

Admiral Group plc 
Annual Report 2012 35 Corporate Governance continued
Although the Chairman has served in that role since 
June 2000 the Board remains of the view that he should 
continue in office and the Company’s leading institutional 
investors have also confirmed their support for the 
Board’s express intent. The Chairman, along with all 
the Directors, seeks election by shareholders annually. 
The Chairman performs a number of other non-executive 
roles outside the Group and details of these are included 
in the Chairman’s biography. The Board continues to be 
satisfied that these other commitments are not such as 
to interfere with the performance of his duties within 
the Group and will not impact on his ability to allocate 
sufficient time to discharge effectively his responsibilities 
to the Group. 
John Sussens has been appointed as the Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director. He is available to 
shareholders if they have concerns that contact through 
the normal channels of Chairman, Chief Executive, 
or Group Chief Financial Officer has failed to resolve 
or for which such contact is inappropriate. He is also 
responsible for leading the Board’s discussion on the 
Chairman’s performance and the appointment of a new 
Chairman, when appropriate.
In accordance with the requirement under the Code 
for annual election of Directors, all directors will be 
submitting themselves for re-election by shareholders 
at the forthcoming AGM. The Board is satisfied that all 
are properly qualified for their reappointment by virtue 
of their skills and experience and their contribution to 
the Board and its Committees.
The Directors are given access to independent 
professional advice at the Group’s expense, should 
they deem it necessary, to carry out their responsibilities.
Professional Development
On appointment, Directors take part in a comprehensive 
induction programme where they receive financial and 
operational information about the Group; details 
concerning their responsibilities and duties; as well as 
an introduction to the Group’s governance, regulatory 
and control environment.
This induction is supplemented by visits to the Group’s 
head office in Cardiff, overseas offices, and meetings 
with members of the senior management team and their 
departments. Development and training of Directors is 
an ongoing process. Throughout their period in office the 
Directors are regularly updated on the Group’s business; 
legal matters concerning their role and duties; the 
competitive environments in which the Group operates; 
and any other significant changes affecting the Group 
and the industry of which it is a part. All Board members 
are also encouraged to attend relevant training courses 
at the Company’s expense.
The Board receives presentations from senior managers 
within the Group on a regular basis and Non-Executive 
Directors are encouraged to make informal visits 
to different parts of the Group to meet with 
local management.
Relations with Shareholders
The Company attaches considerable importance to 
communications with shareholders and engages with 
them on a variety of issues. The Investor Relations team 
has day-to-day primary responsibility for managing 
communications with institutional shareholders through 
a combination of briefings to analysts and institutional 
shareholders, both at the half-year and full year results. 
A number of analysts and investors visited the Group’s 
Cardiff office during the year to meet with the Executive 
Directors and senior management in order to get a 
better understanding of how the Group operates and 
how it intends to achieve its strategic and operational 
objectives. Senior executives from the Group’s overseas 
businesses also visit the UK in order to present to, and 
meet with, analysts and investors. Site visits and individual 
discussions with the Executive Directors are also arranged 
throughout the year with individual shareholders. Regular 
dialogue with shareholders helps to ensure that the 
Company’s strategy is understood and that any issues 
are addressed in a constructive way. 
Admiral Group plc 
Annual Report 2012 36 In addition the Chairman had individual meetings during 
the year with major shareholders, and reported to the 
Board on issues raised with him. 
This is supplemented by feedback to the Board on 
meetings between management and investors. External 
analysts’ reports are circulated to all Directors. In 
addition, the Investor Relations team produces a quarterly 
Investor Relations Report that is circulated to the Board. 
The Report contains an analysis of share price 
performance; a summary of analyst reports received 
during the month and of meetings that have been held 
with investors and analysts; together with details of any 
significant changes to the shareholders’ register.
All shareholders are invited to attend the Company’s 
Annual General Meeting (AGM). The Chairmen of the 
Audit, Remuneration, Nomination and Group Risk 
Committees attend the AGM along with the other 
Directors and are available to answer shareholders’ 
questions on the activities of the Committees they  
chair. Shareholders are also invited to ask questions 
during the meeting and have an opportunity to meet  
with Directors after the formal business of the meeting 
has been concluded. Details of proxy voting by 
shareholders, including votes withheld, are made 
available on request and are placed on the Company’s 
website following the meeting.
The Group maintains a corporate website  
(www.admiralgroup.co.uk) containing a wide  
range of information of interest to institutional  
and private investors. 
Conflicts of Interest
In compliance with the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006 regarding Directors’ duties in relation to 
conflicts of interest, the Group’s Articles of Association 
allow the Board to authorise potential conflicts of interest 
that may arise and to impose such limits as it thinks fit. 
The Company has put in place procedures to deal with 
conflicts of interest. These procedures include each 
Board member completing, annually, a conflict of interest 
questionnaire that sets out any situation in which they, or 
their connected persons have, or could have, a direct 
or indirect interest that could conflict with the interests 
of the Company. Any current directorships that they, 
or their connected persons hold, any advisory roles or 
trusteeships held, together with any companies in which 
they hold more than 1% of the issued share capital are 
also disclosed. These procedures were reviewed by the 
Board in January 2013 and it was concluded that they 
had operated effectively in 2012.
Board Committees
The Board has delegated authority to a number of 
permanent Committees to deal with matters in accordance 
with written terms of reference. The principal Committees 
of the Board – Audit, Remuneration, Risk and Nomination 
– all comply fully with the requirements of the Code. 
All Committees are chaired by an independent Director, 
except the Nomination Committee which is chaired by 
the Chairman of the Board, and comprise a majority of 
independent Directors. Appointments to the Committees 
are made on the recommendation of the Nomination 
Committee and are for a period of up to three years, 
which may be extended for two further three year periods, 
provided the Director remains independent. The 
Committees are constituted with written terms of 
reference that are reviewed annually to ensure that they 
remain appropriate and reflect any changes in good 
practice and governance. These terms of reference  
are available on request from the Company Secretary  
and can also be found on the Company’s website:  
www.admiralgroup.co.uk. Directors are fully informed  
of all Committee matters by the Committee Chairmen 
reporting on the proceedings of their Committee at 
the subsequent Board meeting. Copies of Committee 
minutes are also distributed to the Board. Committees 
are authorised to obtain outside legal or other 
independent professional advice if they consider it 
necessary. The Chairman of each Committee attends 
the Annual General Meeting to respond to any 
shareholder questions that might be raised on the 
Committee’s activities.

Admiral Group plc 
Annual Report 2012 37 The membership at the end of the year was: Colin 
Holmes (Chair), Margaret Johnson and Annette Court. 
The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the 
Committee. The Committee usually meets four times 
per year and has an agenda linked to events in the 
Company’s financial calendar.
The Board considers that the members of the 
Committee have the appropriate competence 
and experience to carry out their duties and further 
considers that Colin Holmes (Committee Chair), 
as a Chartered Management Accountant, has the 
appropriate recent and relevant financial experience 
having previously been the UK Finance Director for 
Tesco plc, and until 2010 a member of its Group 
Executive Committee. 
The Committee is kept up to date with changes to 
Accounting Standards and relevant developments 
in financial reporting, company law, and the various 
regulatory frameworks through presentations from 
the Group’s external auditors, Deputy Chief Financial 
Officer, and Company Secretary. In addition members 
are provided with information on seminars and 
conferences provided by external bodies. The Terms 
of Reference of the Audit Committee include all the 
matters required under the Code.
Other individuals such as the Chief Financial Officer, 
Chief Operating Officer, Chief Executive, Chairman of 
the Board, the heads of Risk, Compliance, and Internal 
Audit and representatives of different parts of the 
Group may be invited to attend all or part of any 
meeting as and when appropriate. The external 
auditors were invited to attend all of the Committee’s 
meetings held in 2012, excepting when their own 
performance was to be reviewed.
The Audit Committee’s primary responsibilities are:
 To monitor the integrity of the Group’s financial 
statements and any formal announcement relating 
to the Group’s financial performance, reviewing 
any significant financial reporting judgements 
which they contain;
 To keep under review the effectiveness of the 
Company’s internal financial controls, internal 
control and risk management systems;
 To review the Group’s procedures for handling 
allegations from whistleblowers and for 
detecting fraud;
 To monitor and assess the role and effectiveness 
of the Group’s internal audit functions in the context 
of the Group’s overall internal control and risk 
management systems;
 To consider and make recommendations to the Board, 
to be put to shareholders for their approval at the 
AGM, in relation to the appointment, re-appointment 
and removal of the Group’s external auditor;
 To review the external auditor’s independence and 
objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit process; 
and
 To review the policy on the engagement of the 
external auditor to provide non-audit services, 
considering the relevant regulatory guidance 
regarding the provision of non-audit services by 
the external auditor.
Summary of Key Activities During 2012
During the year the Committee reviewed the following:
 The Annual Report and interim results;
 Reports from the internal audit departments within 
the Group on the effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control procedures, 
details of key audit findings, and actions taken by 
management to manage and reduce the impact of 
the risks identified;
 Reports from the external auditors on the principal 
findings from their review of the Company’s systems 
and controls, and on their key issues and conclusions 
on the half and full year reporting;
 Reports from the Chair of the Group Risk Committee 
on the principal risks faced by the Group and the 
work undertaken by the Committee to ensure risk 
is appropriately managed;
 Presentations from independent actuaries to assist 
the Committee in concluding on the adequacy of the 
Group’s reserves;
 Reports from the external auditors on their proposed 
audit scope, fees, audit, and auditor independence;
 Performance and effectiveness of the internal 
audit department;
 All reports from internal audit including management

 The Committee also had presentations and 
discussions on a range of important issues including 
the approach to reserving within the Group, a review 
of large claims and a review of the control environment 
in the Group’s Italian business;
 Its own terms of reference; and
 Its own effectiveness.

Corporate Governance continued
Admiral Group plc 
Annual Report 2012 38 During the year the Committee reviewed its policy 
on non-audit services that sets out the procedure for 
approval, by the Committee, of expenditure with the 
Group’s auditors of over £30,000, including the process 
where it is necessary for approval of such work to be 
given outside of the normal Committee meeting 
timetable. Such circumstances will require the approval 
of the Audit Committee Chair who will consider and 
approve such fees on behalf of the Committee. Such 
approval of fees in excess of £30,000 will then be notified 
by the Committee Chair to the next Committee meeting 
following approval. The Group’s auditors, KPMG Audit 
plc, provide some non-audit services, the majority of 
which comprise compliance services related to various 
taxation issues within the Group, and which are not 
considered by the Committee to compromise their 
independence as auditors. The level of non-audit fees 
is reviewed at each Committee meeting and details 
are included in note 6 to the financial statements.
The Committee undertakes an annual review to assess 
the independence and objectivity of the external auditors 
and the effectiveness of the audit process, taking into 
consideration relevant professional and regulatory 
requirements, the progress achieved against the agreed 
audit plan, and the competence with which the auditors 
handled the key accounting and audit judgements. 
Following this review the Committee concluded that the 
auditor, KPMG, remained independent and provided a 
service that was robust and fit for purpose. There are no 
contractual obligations that restrict the Group’s choice of 
external auditor. It was agreed that a decision on whether 
to re-tender the external audit should be made at least 
every five years. The last such tender was carried out in 
2006. In view of the high quality of service received by 
the Group; the fresh perspective provided by the recent 
rotation of the audit engagement partner in 2011; and 
the continued competitiveness of their audit fee, the 
Committee recommended that a re-tender process 
should not be undertaken in 2012 but that the relationship 
with and effectiveness of KPMG should be kept under 
review. A resolution for the reappointment of KPMG as 
auditors will, therefore, be proposed at the forthcoming 
AGM. The Company is mindful of the September 2012 
Corporate Governance Code, which applies to its next 
reporting period and includes a provision to put the 
external audit out to tender at least every ten years.
In accordance with agreed parameters, the overseas 
operations in Spain and Italy have their own locally based 
internal auditors, who report to their respective country 
heads. All reports are evaluated by the Head of Internal 
Audit to ensure the quality and effectiveness of the 
reported findings. In addition, the UK internal audit 
department carries out high level governance reviews 
of all foreign operations, assessing the internal control 
frameworks and system of risk management.
The Head of Internal Audit in the UK attends all 
Audit Committee meetings and provides a range of 
presentations and papers to the Committee, through 
which the Committee monitors the effectiveness of the 
Group’s internal controls. Members of the Committee 
also receive all issued audit reports, enabling them 
to challenge the reports’ content and related 
recommendations. The overseas internal auditors 
attend Committee meetings periodically. The Committee 
approves the internal audit programmes at the start of 
each calendar year whilst the effectiveness and workload 
of the internal audit functions, and the adequacy of 
available resources are monitored throughout the year. 
The Audit Committee has unrestricted access to the 
Group’s documents and information, as well as to its 
employees and external professional advisers.
As part of the Committee’s detailed annual review 
of its performance and processes, each Committee 
member completed a comprehensive online 
questionnaire designed to provide objective 
assessment of the Committee’s performance, 
including its effectiveness in monitoring internal 
and external audit. The Committee discussed the 
results of the review and it was concluded that the 
Committee and the audit process were effective and 
that the Committee had full access to all the information 
it required; that the Committee had appropriate terms 
of reference; and that it had achieved its remit.

Summary of Key Activities in 2012
During the year the Committee:
 Reviewed the Group’s risk appetite and profile of 
material risks;
 Considered the adequacy of risk mitigation measures 
and contingency plans;
 Reviewed the Group’s risk strategy in the context 
of the Group’s agreed strategic objectives;
 Monitored the Group’s progress towards

 Approved the design and reviewed the results of 
the stress and scenario testing programme;
 Received an external presentation on Enterprise-wide 
Risk Management benchmarking;
 Reviewed in-depth analysis of a number of the Group’s 
most significant risk areas, including insurance risk in 
the UK car insurance operation;
 Reviewed management information on conduct 
risk within the Group;
 Reviewed its own terms of reference;
 Reviewed its own effectiveness and sought to 
identify potential improvements that could be made 
to the Committee’s oversight of risk management in 
the Group.
The work of the Committee is supported by more 
detailed work undertaken by Risk Management 
Committees in each of the Group’s operational entities. 
Membership of each of these Committees includes 
the Managing Director of the operation. In the UK, 
membership of the Risk Management Committee 
includes the Group Chief Executive and the Chief 
Operating Officer. At each meeting, the Risk 
Management Committees consider significant 
movements in the operation’s risk profile, any risks that 
have arisen and any emerging risks. Risk Management 
Committees also assess and monitor any regulatory 
issues, ensuring that their resolution and the action 
taken are appropriately recorded. In the UK, the Risk 
Management Committee received regular information 
on Conduct Risk, such as complaint handling reports and 
TCF (Treating Customers Fairly) management information.
The Committee Chairman reports formally to the Board 
on its proceedings after each meeting on all matters 
within its duties and responsibilities, as set out in 
previously circulated minutes to the Board. The 
Committee Chairman also reports on the activities 
of the Committee in a formal written report that is 
submitted to and discussed by the Board every 
six months.

Admiral Group plc 
Annual Report 2012 40 The membership at the year-end was Alastair Lyons 
(Chairman), Colin Holmes and Lucy Kellaway. The 
Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee. 
The Committee invites the Chief Executive to attend 
meetings when it deems appropriate. The Committee 
met on one occasion during 2012.
The Committee leads the process for making 
appointments to the Board or where the appointee 
is likely to become a Board member. The Committee 
ensures there is a formal, rigorous and transparent 
procedure for the appointment of new Directors to 
the Board through a full evaluation of the skills, 
knowledge and experience required of Directors. 
The Committee also ensures plans are in place for 
orderly succession for appointments to the Board, 
and reviews the succession plans for other senior 
management positions. Responsibility for making 
senior management appointments rests with the 
Chief Executive. 
Non-Executive Directors Roger Abravanel and Annette 
Court joined the Board in March 2012, following a 
formal, rigorous and transparent recruitment process led 
by external consultants, instructed by the Committee, 
who identified and shortlisted potential candidates. 
Following this process, and separate interviews with 
Committee and Board members, the Committee 
unanimously recommended to the Board that Roger 
and Annette should be appointed to the Board.
During the year, the Committee kept under review the 
size of the Board and the balance of its composition 
particularly in the context of the continuing need to 
assess the balance of skills, knowledge, independence, 
diversity and experience on the Board and the 
impending retirement, over the next five years, of a 
number of current Non-Executive Directors who are 
approaching nine years’ service. 
The Board, at their meeting in December 2012, 
considered the Group’s current Succession Plan 
which considered the senior roles within the Group 
and identified whether there was emergency short- 
term cover in place in the event that the individual left 
the organisation, and whether there was a permanent 
replacement available within the organisation, or whether 
the position would need to be filled externally. It also 
identified where there were individuals who, with further 
experience and guidance, would be capable of moving 
into particular senior management roles. 
At this meeting the emerging talent across the Group 
was discussed in detail with the Executive team 
identifying key individuals within the organisation who 
had impressed in their current roles and who had the 
potential to contribute to the business by working on 
projects in other areas of the Group. Such exposure 
would also assist with their development in order that, 
at the appropriate time, they might be in a position to 
succeed to senior management positions.
The Committee remains satisfied that succession plans 
for Directors and senior management are in place to 
ensure the continued ability of the Group to implement 
strategy and compete effectively in the markets in which 
it operates.
The Group remains strongly supportive of the principle 
of boardroom diversity, of which gender is an important, 
but not the only aspect. What is important is diversity 
of thought, experience, and approach and each new 
appointment must complement what already exists at 
the Board table. Accordingly, appointments will always 
be made on merit against objective criteria, including 
diversity, and not just to achieve an externally 
prescribed number.
The Group already has strong female representation in 
both management and at Board level. On our Executive 
Committees women comprise 33% of that for the UK 
and 41% for our International operations. In addition, 
of the total employees across the Group in the UK, 49% 
are women. Given women already constitute 25% of 
our plc Board the Group has already met the target set 
for 2015 by Lord Davies in his report: Women on Boards. 
The Group remains committed to providing equal 
opportunities, eliminating discrimination and 
encouraging diversity amongst its workforce both 
in the UK and overseas.

Annual Report 2012 41 Corporate Governance continued
Internal Control and Risk Management 
The Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s 
system of internal control and, through the Audit 
Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of these 
systems. The systems of internal control over business, 
operational, financial, and compliance risks are designed 
to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives and can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. 
The Board is of the view that there is an ongoing process 
for identifying, evaluating and managing the Group’s 
internal controls; that it has been in place for the year 
ended 31 December 2012; and that, up to the date of 
approval of the Annual Report and Accounts, it is regularly 
reviewed by the Board and accords with the internal 
control guidance for Directors provided in the Code. 
A key element of the control system is that the Board 
meets regularly with a formal schedule of matters 
reserved to it for decision and has put in place an 
organisational structure with clearly defined lines of 
responsibility. As described above, in order to ensure 
these responsibilities are properly discharged, the  
Board has delegated the task of supervision of risk 
management and internal control to the Group Risk 
Committee (GRC). 
There are several key elements to the risk management 
environment throughout the Group. These include the 
setting of risk management strategy, risk appetite and risk 
policy by the GRC; enforcement of that policy by the Chief 
Executive; delivery of the policy by the Risk Management 
Committee and the Group’s other UK and overseas 
entities by the application of the Group’s systems of 
internal control and risk management; and the overall 
assurance provided by internal audit to the Audit 
Committee that the systems operate effectively. The 
Board recognises that the day-to-day responsibility for 
implementing these policies must lie with the Senior 
Management whose operational decisions must take into 
account risk and how this can be controlled effectively. 
The GRC will report on its activities to the Audit 
Committee in support of the overall assurance 
provided by the Audit Committee that the Group’s risk 
management and compliance systems operate effectively.
The Risk Department defines and prescribes the financial 
and operational risk assessment processes for the 
business; maintains the risk registers, undertakes regular 
reviews of these risks in conjunction with line management 
and records any actual losses or near misses that occur as 
a consequence of the realisation of risk. The Head of the 
Risk Department has responsibility for ensuring that 
managers are aware of their risk management obligations, 
providing them with support and advice, and ensuring 
that the risk management strategy is properly 
communicated. Reports are produced showing the 
most significant risks identified and the controls in place. 
Internal Audit uses the risk registers to plan and inform 
their programme of audits around the most significant 
risks to the Group to ensure that the prescribed controls 
are in place and are operating effectively.
The GRC, UK RMC and other UK and overseas 
committees receive reports setting out key performance 
and risk indicators and consider possible control issues 
brought to their attention by early warning mechanisms 
that are embedded within the operational units. The UK 
RMC, the Group’s other UK and overseas committees 
and the Audit Committee also receive regular reports 
from the relevant Internal Audit functions, which include 
recommendations for improvement of the control and 
operational environment. Twice a year the Chairman of 
the Group Risk Committee provides a comprehensive 
report to the Board on the Group’s risk appetite, risk 
strategy and risk management policy with focus on a 
consideration of the principal assessed exposures and 
the effectiveness of the mitigation strategies adopted. 
In addition, the Board receives reports from the Chairman 
of the Audit Committee as to its activities, together with 
copies of the minutes of the UK RMC and the GRC and 
Audit Committees. 
Admiral Group plc 
Annual Report 2012 42 The Audit Committee’s ability to provide the appropriate 
assurance to the Board depends on the provision 
of periodic and independent confirmation, primarily 
by Internal Audit, that the controls established by 
management are operating effectively and where 
appropriate provides a high-level challenge to the 
steps being taken by the GRC to implement the risk 
management strategy. The Internal Audit functions 
undertake regular reviews of internal control systems 
and business processes, identifying control weaknesses 
and making recommendations to management on 
improvements where necessary.
In March 2013 the Board carried out the annual review 
of the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal 
controls for the 2012 year, also taking account of events 
since 31 December 2012, by considering documentation 
from the Audit Committee including the Internal Audit 
Annual Report prepared by the Group’s Head of 
Internal Audit.
The Board confirms that there were no significant issues 
arising during the year under review. However, the Board 
continues to review the adequacy of the risk management 
and control framework. As the Group’s operations grow, 
the Board looks for opportunities to make improvements 
and add appropriate resources when necessary.
Going Concern
The financial statements have been prepared on a 
going concern basis. In considering the appropriateness 
of this assumption, the Board has reviewed the Group’s 
projections for the next twelve months, including cash 
flow forecasts and regulatory capital surpluses. The 
Group has no debt. 
As a result of this review the Directors have satisfied 
themselves that it is appropriate to prepare the financial 
statements on a going concern basis.

Directors’ Report
Admiral Group plc 
Annual Report 2012 44 There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary  
shares in the Company other than:
 certain restrictions may from time to time be imposed 
by laws and regulations (for example, insider trading 
laws); and
 pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services 
Authority whereby certain employees of the Company 
require the approval of the Company to deal in the 
Company’s securities.
The Company has not purchased any of its own shares 
during the period. 
There are no agreements between the Company and 
its Directors or employees providing for compensation 
for loss of office or employment (whether through 
resignation, purported redundancy or otherwise) 
that occurs because of a takeover bid. 
There are a number of agreements that alter or terminate 
upon a change of control of the Company following a 
takeover bid, such as commercial contracts. None is 
considered to be significant in terms of their impact on 
the business of the Group as a whole except for the long-
term co-insurance agreement in place with Great Lakes 
Reinsurance (UK) Plc. Details relating to this agreement 
are contained in the Business review.
Power to Issue Shares
At the last Annual General Meeting, held on 26 April 2012, 
authority was given to the Directors to allot unissued 
relevant securities in the Company up to a maximum of 
£89,535, equivalent to one third of the issued share capital 
as at 21 March 2012. This authority expires on the date of 
the Annual General Meeting to be held on 25 April 2013 
and the Directors will seek to renew this authority for the 
following year. 
A further special resolution passed at that meeting 
granted authority to the Directors to allot equity 
securities in the Company (up to a maximum of 5% of the 
issued share capital of the Company) for cash, without 
regard to the pre-emption provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006. This authority also expires on the date of the 
Annual General Meeting to be held on 25 April 2013 and 
the Directors will seek to renew this authority for the 
following year.
Appointments of Directors
The Company’s Articles of Association (‘the Articles’)  
give the Directors power to appoint and replace 
Directors. Under the terms of reference of the Nomination 
Committee, any appointment must be recommended by 
the Nomination Committee for approval by the Board of 
Directors. The Articles also require Directors to retire and 
submit themselves for election at the first Annual General 
Meeting following appointment and all Directors who 
held office at the time of the two preceding Annual 
General Meetings, to submit themselves for re-election. 
However, in accordance with the requirement under 
the UK Corporate Governance Code for annual election 
of Directors all Directors will submit themselves for 
re-election at the Group’s Annual General Meeting 
on 25 April 2013. 
Articles of Association
The Articles may only be amended by special resolution 
of the shareholders.
Power of the Directors
The Directors are responsible for managing the business 
of the Company and may exercise all powers of the 
Company subject to the provisions of relevant statutes, 
to any directions given by special resolution and to the 
Company’s Memorandum and Articles. The Articles for 
example, contain specific provisions and restrictions 
concerning the Company’s power to borrow money. 
Powers relating to the issuing of new shares are also 
included in the Articles and such authorities are renewed 
by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting each year. 
Annual General Meeting
It is proposed that the next AGM be held at Cardiff City 
Hall, Cathays Park, Cardiff CF10 3ND on Thursday 25 April 
2013 at 2.00pm, notice of which will be sent to

Directors’ Responsibilities 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report and the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements, in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group 
and Parent Company financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law they are required to prepare 
the Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as 
adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected 
to prepare the Parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable 
law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). 
Under company law the Directors must not approve 
the financial statements unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of 
the Group and Parent Company and of their profit or 
loss for that period. 
In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company 
financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently; 
 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; 
 for the Group financial statements, state whether 
they have been prepared in accordance with IFRS 
as adopted by the EU; 
 for the Parent Company financial statements, state 
whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have 
been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the Parent Company 
financial statements; and 
 prepare the financial statements on the going 
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume 
that the Group and the Parent Company will continue 
in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper 
accounting records that disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Parent Company and enable them to ensure that its 
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They have general responsibility for taking such 
steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the 
assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud 
and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors 
are also responsible for preparing a Directors’ report, 
Directors’ Remuneration report and Corporate 
Governance statement that comply with that law 
and those regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the Company’s website. Legislation in the 
UK governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
Responsibility Statement
The Directors confirm that to the best of their knowledge:
 The financial statements, prepared in accordance 
with the applicable set of accounting standards, give 
a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial 
position and profit or loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole; and
 The Directors’ report includes a fair view of the 
development and performance of the business and 
the position of the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face.
Disclosure of Information to Auditors
The Directors who held office at the date of approval 
of this Directors’ report confirm that, so far as they are 
each aware, there is no relevant audit information of 
which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and each 
Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have 
taken as a Director to make himself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditor is aware of that information. 
Auditor
The Company’s auditor, KPMG Audit Plc, has indicated 
willingness to continue in office and resolutions to 
reappoint it and to authorise the Directors to fix 
its remuneration will be proposed at the Annual 
General Meeting.

Annual Report 2012 46 A Statement to Shareholders  
from the Chairman of the  
Remuneration Committee
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to introduce the Directors’ Remuneration 
report (the ‘Report’) for the year ended 31 December 
2012, which has been prepared by the Remuneration 
Committee (the ‘Committee’) and approved by  
the Board.
This Report covers the reporting period from 1 January 
2012 to 31 December 2012 and provides details of the 
activities of the Committee and remuneration policy 
of the Company. 
The UK Government Department of Business Innovation 
& Skills (BIS) is currently proposing changes to the 
structure and contents of Directors’ Remuneration 
Reports (DRRs). The Committee has decided to adopt 
a number of these proposed changes early; therefore 
after this brief introduction, the Report is divided into 
three sections:
 A Policy Report which will detail Admiral’s 
remuneration policies and links to Group strategy;
 An Implementation Report, which will focus on the 
remuneration arrangements and outcomes for the  
year under review; and
 A third section containing information required this 
year under the existing regulations.
2012 has been another strong year for the Group 
despite a challenging external environment. The Group 
increased profits in the year by 15% to £344.6 million 
with a return  
on capital employed of 60% which supported total 
dividends for the financial year of 90.6 pence per share, 
and represents a distribution of 95% of our earnings.  
The Group’s strategy remains to continue to maximise  
our position in the UK while taking what we know and  
do well, which is internet and telephone delivery of  
car insurance and price comparison, to our overseas 
insurance and price comparison businesses. 
During the year ended 31 December 2012, the 
Committee met on five separate occasions. The key 
matters considered included:
 Reviewing salary and fee proposals for the Executive 
Directors, the Chairman and Senior Management;
 Reviewing the appropriateness of the performance 
conditions for both the Discretionary Free Share 
Scheme (DFSS) and Free Share Incentive Plan  
(SIP) awards;
 Reviewing the Company’s performance against the 
performance conditions applicable to the DFSS and 
SIP awards and where appropriate authorising the 
vesting of awards;
 Reviewing and authorising the grant of awards under 
both DFSS and SIP plans;
 Reviewing the Committee’s terms of reference and 
recommending amendments to the Board  
for approval; and
 Reviewing the efficiency of DFSS awards for  
overseas businesses.

Remu Directors’ Remuneration Report 
Compliance Statement
This Remuneration report has been prepared according 
to the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 (the Act), 
the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority and under 
Regulation 11 of and Schedule 8 to the Large and 
Medium Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) Regulations 2008 (the Regulations). In addition, 
the Board has applied the principles of good corporate 
governance set out in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the ‘Governance Code’), and has considered the 
guidelines issued by its leading shareholders and bodies 
such as the Association of British Insurers and the 
National Association of Pension Funds. 
In accordance with Section 439 of the Companies Act,  
an advisory resolution to approve this report will be 
proposed at the Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) of the 
Company to be held on 25 April 2013. The detail in this 
report sets out how the remuneration principles have 
been applied in 2012.
Key Principles of Admiral Remuneration Arrangements
The Group is committed to the primary objective of 
maximising shareholder value over time and ensuring that 
there is a strong link between performance and reward. 
This is reflected in the Group’s stated remuneration 
policy of paying competitive, performance-linked and 
shareholder-aligned remuneration packages comprising 
basic salaries coupled with participation in performance-
based share schemes to generate competitive total 
reward packages for superior performance. The Board 
is satisfied that the adoption of this policy continues to 
meet the objectives of attracting and retaining executives 
of the highest quality across the Group.
The Committee reviews the framework and remuneration 
packages of the Executive Directors and the most senior 
managers and recognises the need to ensure that the 
remuneration policy is firmly linked to the Group’s 
strategy including its risk management approach. In 
setting the policy and making remuneration decisions, 
the Committee takes into account pay and conditions 
elsewhere in the Group. The main principles underlying 
the remuneration policy are:
Competitive – the Group aims to combine salaries 
with attractive performance-related incentives, 
which provide the potential for competitive total 
reward packages for the achievement of superior 
performance. Base salaries reflect the role, job 
size and responsibility together with individual 
performance and effectiveness. Prevailing market 
and economic conditions and developments in 
governance are also considered, as are general 
salary levels throughout the organisation. In 
considering total remuneration for the Executive 
Directors, the Committee is aware of remuneration 
in companies of a similar size in the Financial 
Services sector.
 Performance-linked – a significant part of the 
Executive Directors’ (excluding the founding Directors) 
and senior managers’ reward remains shareholder-
aligned given that it is determined by the Group’s 
earnings growth vs. LIBOR (see Policy Table opposite).
 Transparent – all aspects of the remuneration 
structure are clear to employees and openly 
communicated. 
Policy Report
Admiral Group plc 
Annual Report 2012 48 Remuneration Policy Table
This section of our report describes the key components of the remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors 
and Non-Executive Directors for 2013 and beyond. No changes to the structure of remuneration are proposed for 2013.
Purpose and link  
to strategy
Operation Opportunity and  
performance metrics
Base salary
To attract and retain talent by setting 
base salaries at levels appropriate for 
the business
Salaries are reviewed annually
Salary levels/increases take account of:

 and experience of the individual in the role;

 
the Group
Henry Engelhardt: £381,425 (increase of 4.5% 
from 1 July 2012)
Kevin Chidwick: £438,900 (increase of 4.5% 
from 1 October 2012)
David Stevens: £360,535 (increase of 4.5% 
from 1 September 2012)
Pension
To provide retirement benefits
The Group operates a Personal Pension Plan, 
a Defined Contribution scheme
This is available to all employees following 
completion of their probationary period
The Group matches employee contributions 
up to a maximum of 6% of base salary with 
maximum employer contribution of £9,000
Henry Engelhardt and David Stevens have 
declined to be included in the plan
Other benefits
To provide market-competitive benefits
Includes:



All benefits are non-pensionable
Henry Engelhardt: £547
Kevin Chidwick: £512
David Stevens: £512
Discretionary Free Share  
Scheme (DFSS)
To motivate and reward longer-term 
performance, grow market share profitably, 
reduce staff attrition, and further strengthen  
the alignment of the interests of 
shareholders and staff
Kevin Chidwick participates in the DFSS (the 
other Executive Directors have declined to 
participate given their significant 
shareholdings). Grants are made at the 
discretion of the Committee
Awards, generally made as a specific number 
of shares, vest after three years subject to 
performance and continued employment
Maximum opportunity: £1,000,000 or 600% of 
base salary if lower
Award size for 2012: 52,250 shares, with a value 
on the date of award of £560,643
Awards vest by reference to growth in the 
Group’s EPS in excess of a risk-free return, 
defined as average three-month LIBOR, over a 
three-year period (10% of shares vest for matching 
LIBOR; full vesting for outperforming LIBOR by 
10% p.a.; straight-line vesting in between)
The Committee feels EPS vs. LIBOR is a strong 
indicator of long-term shareholder return
DFSS bonus
To further align incentive structures with 
shareholder interests through the delivery 
of dividend equivalents
Bonus is calculated to be equivalent to 
dividends that would have been payable 
during the year on DFSS shares awarded  
but not vested
Linked to Admiral dividend
Approved Free Share Incentive  
Plan (SIP)
All UK staff participate in the SIP (except 
Henry Engelhardt and David Stevens who 
have declined to participate). Grants are 
made twice a year based on the results  
of each half-year
Maximum opportunity: £3,000 per annum
Executive shareholding policy
To support shareholder alignment
Executive Directors have agreed to (acquire 
and) retain a beneficial shareholding equal 
to at least 100% of base salary, which can be 
built up over a period of five years from the 
date of appointment
100% of base salary
Fees
To remunerate Non-Executive Directors
The Chairman fee is determined by the 
Committee after consultation with  
the Executive Directors. The Chairman, as 
with the founding Directors, holds a 
significant shareholding in the Group and 
this is reflected in the size of his fee, which is 
materially below that of Chairmen of 
organisations of similar size and complexity. 
The non-executive directors’ fees are 
determined by the Chairman together with 
the Executive Directors.
Fees take into account the time 
commitment, responsibilities, and the  
skills and experience required
Non-Executive Chairman: £218,000
Non-Executive Director base fee: £50,000
Senior independent Director: £5,000

Admiral Group plc 
Annual Report 2012 49 Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Note:
Approximately 1,800 employees from across the Group, as well as Kevin Chidwick, participate in the DFSS. The 
Committee recommends for approval by the Board awards to the CFO and other employees under the DFSS. For 
the CFO, all share awards are subject to the above performance criterion. For staff below Group Board level awards 
will be split. 50% of the award will be subject to the above performance criterion, and the other 50% will have no 
performance criteria attached other than the requirement that the recipient remains an employee of the Group 
at the date of vesting. Award sizes vary by organisational level. All holders of DFSS awards receive the DFSS bonus.
Remuneration Arrangements for Founding Directors
Two of the three Executive Directors (Henry Engelhardt and David Stevens) are founding Directors. They and 
the Committee continue to hold the view that the significant shareholdings held by them provide a sufficient 
alignment of their interest in the performance of the Group with the interests of other shareholders. In light of this, 
their remuneration packages consist only of a below market rate salary and benefits such as private medical cover, 
permanent health insurance and death in service cover. The Group does not contribute to any pension arrangements 
on behalf of these Executive Directors, and they have not participated, nor is it intended that they participate, in any 
Group share schemes.
Details of Directors’ Service Contracts
The following table summarises the notice periods relating to the service contracts of the Executive Directors serving 
at March 2013.
Notice –
Director
 (months)
Notice – 
Company 
(months) 
Henry Engelhardt 12 12
Kevin Chidwick 12 12
David Stevens 12 12
There is no provision in the Executive Directors’ contracts for compensation to be payable on early termination of their 
contract over and above the notice period element.
The Company has entered into letters of appointment with its Non-Executive Directors. Summary details of terms and 
notice periods are included below. 
Term Commencement date Notice period
Alastair Lyons 3 years 1 July 2010 Three months’ written notice
Roger Abravanel 3 years 6 March 2012 One month’s written notice
Manfred Aldag Indefinite n/a Terminable on one month’s notice from either 
party – automatically terminates should he 
cease employment with Munich Re
Annette Court 3 years 21 March 2012 One month’s written notice
Colin Holmes 3 years 3 December 2010 One month’s written notice
Martin Jackson 1 year 1 December 2012 One month’s written notice
Margaret Johnson 3 years 4 September 2012 One month’s written notice
Lucy Kellaway 3 years 4 September 2012 One month’s written notice
John Sussens 1 years 1 December 2012 One month’s written notice
Given the short notice periods applicable, mitigation issues are unlikely to arise.
Termination Payments
The Company’s policy is to limit severance payments on termination to pre-established contractual arrangements. 
In the event that the employment of an Executive Director is terminated, any compensation payable will be determined 
in accordance with the terms of the service contract between the Company and the employee, as well as the rules 
of any incentive plans.
Under normal circumstances, good leavers are entitled to receive termination payments in lieu of notice based on 
base salary and compensation for loss of benefits. The notice period for all Executive Directors is one year.
In the event an Executive leaves for reasons of death, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement, or any other reason 
which the Remuneration Committee in its absolute discretion permits, any outstanding long-term incentive awards 
will be pro-rated for time and performance and will vest after the end of the performance period. Upon a change 
of control of the Company, awards will be pro-rated for time and vest immediately based on the extent to which 
the Committee determines that the performance conditions have been met or are likely to be met.
Admiral Group plc 
Annual Report 2012 50 For all other leavers, outstanding awards will lapse. The Committee retains discretion to alter these provisions (as 
permitted by the relevant Plan Rules) on a case-by-case basis following a review of circumstances and to ensure 
fairness for both shareholders and participants. 
Pay-for-Performance: Scenario Analysis
The following chart shows the potential split between the different elements of the Executive Directors’ total 
remuneration under two different performance scenarios: ‘Zero vesting’, and ‘Maximum vesting’. The Company 
is unable to provide a ‘target’ scenario as it does not operate an annual performance-related bonus scheme with 
threshold targets and maximum payment levels.

Considerations of Conditions Elsewhere in the Group 
In making remuneration decisions, the Committee also considers the pay and employment conditions elsewhere 
in the Group.
The increase to the CEO, CFO and COO’s base salary for 2012 of 4.5%, is in line with the average increase across 
the Group of 4.5%. 
Financial statements Governance Performance Overview Other information
Admiral Group plc 
Annual Report 2012 51 Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Remuneration Committee Membership in 2012
The Board sets the Group’s remuneration policy and, 
through the authority delegated to it by the Board, the 
Committee is responsible for making recommendations 
to the Board on the structure and implementation of the 
remuneration policy across the Group with consideration 
to the prevailing economic climate within the economies 
in which the Group operates. Its remit includes 
recommending the remuneration of the Chairman, 
the Executive Directors and the Company Secretary; 
reviewing the remuneration of senior management; 
and reviewing the composition of and awards made 
under the performance-related incentive schemes.
At the end of 2012 the Committee consisted of Martin 
Jackson, Margaret Johnson, and Roger Abravanel 
under the Chairmanship of John Sussens, the Senior 
Independent Director. Colin Holmes stepped down 
from the Committee in March 2012 and Roger Abravanel 
joined the Committee with effect from that date. The 
Committee met five times during the year.
The Chairman and CEO are invited to meetings where 
the Committee considers it appropriate to obtain their 
advice on Group strategy and performance and Senior 
Executive pay strategy. The members of the Committee 
do not have any personal financial interests (other than 
shareholdings), or any conflicts, that relate to the business 
of the Committee. During the year under review, the 
Committee was aware of the cross-directorships held by 
Colin Holmes and Alastair Lyons, who are both Directors 
of Bovis Homes Group plc. Although not applicable given 
Colin Holmes is no longer a member of the Committee, 
the Committee had satisfied itself as to the independence 
of Colin Holmes. However, he had chosen to take no 
part in decisions on the Chairman’s remuneration. 
The Committee members do not have any day-to-day 
involvement in the running of the Group.
Adviser to the Committee
During the year, in order to enable the Committee 
to reach informed decisions on executive remuneration, 
advice on market data and trends was obtained 
from independent consultants, Kepler Associates. 
Kepler reports directly to the Committee Chairman 
and is a signatory to the Code of Conduct for 
Remuneration Consultants (which can be found at  
www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com). Kepler does 
not provide any other services to the Group. The fees 
paid to Kepler in respect of work carried out in 2012 
(based on time and materials) totalled £4,500.
In addition, the Committee received advice on 
the structure of the Group’s share schemes from 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC). The fees paid 
to PwC totalled £15,360. The Company Secretary also 
circulates market survey results as appropriate.
Total Actual Remuneration
To aid transparency for our shareholders, the table below 
sets out the total actual remuneration received by each 
Executive Director for the year to 31 December 2012, in

Margaret Johnson £62,000 £62,000
Lucy Kellaway £50,000 £50,000

The figures have been calculated as follows:
1. Base salary/fee: amount earned for the year.
2. Benefits: the taxable value of annual benefits received in the year.
3. Pension: the value of the Company’s contribution during the year.
4.  DFSS: the value at vesting of shares vesting on performance over the three-year period ending 31 December 2012. Given that vesting occurs in April, after the 
Remuneration Report is finalised, the DFSS element of the single figure is based upon the average share price in the last three months of the calendar year in question. 
5. DFSS bonus: the value at grant of bonus equivalent to dividends that would have been payable during the year on DFSS shares awarded but not yet vested.
6.  Kevin Chidwick was paid £260,000 in January 2012 to reimburse him for expenses incurred in relation to his relocation to the USA after taking on CEO, responsibility 
for the Group’s US Insurer Elephant Auto.

The Committee approved the following base salaries for the Executive Directors in 2012:
Director 2011 salary 2012 salary % change Effective date
Henry Engelhardt £365,000 £381,425 4.5% 1 July 2012

David Stevens £345,000 £360,525 4.5% 1 September 2012
Pensions
The Company operates a Group Personal Pension Plan, where employee contributions are matched up to a maximum 
6% of base salary with maximum employer contribution of £9,000. This is available to all employees following 
completion of their probationary period.
Kevin Chidwick is included in the plan and is subject to the maximum employer contribution limit of £9,000. The 
Company contributed £9,000 in 2012. Henry Engelhardt and David Stevens have declined to be included in the plan.
Discretionary Free Share Scheme (DFSS)
Awards made during the year
Kevin Chidwick and many members of the management team participate in this plan. Awards are generally made 
as over a specific number of shares, and vest after a three-year performance period with vesting determined by 
performance targets and employment conditions. Of the Group’s current Executive Directors, only Kevin Chidwick 
participates in this scheme, as Henry Engelhardt and David Stevens have declined to be included given their 
significant shareholdings.
Awards made up to 2012 vest based on growth in EPS in excess of a risk-free return, defined as average three-month 
LIBOR, over a three-year period. 10% of shares vest for matching LIBOR, full vesting occurs for outperforming LIBOR 
by 10% p.a., with straight-line vesting in between. No vesting occurs for EPS growth below LIBOR.
Type of award Discretionary Free Share Scheme
Face value of awards granted in 2012 CEO: n/a
CFO: 52,250 shares on 11 October 2012 with  
a value at the date of award of £560,643

1 Calculated based on number of shares vesting in April 2012 (45,009) multiplied by the share price at the vesting date (£11.79).
2 Calculated based on the number of shares vesting in April (and December) 2013 (48,010) multiplied by the average share price over the final three months of 2012 (£11.11).
DFSS bonus
The Group pays a bonus to all holders of DFSS shares. The bonus equates to the dividend payable on an equivalent 
number of the ordinary shares of the Group. The Committee continues to feel that having a Group-wide bonus 
equivalent to the dividend flow received by investors further aligns the incentive structure with shareholders.
In 2012, Kevin Chidwick received a DFSS bonus of £122,612 (2011: £106,692).
Free Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
The SIP is available to all UK staff (Henry Engelhardt and David Stevens have declined to be included in the plan).  
The maximum annual award under the SIP is £3,000 per employee. Shares awarded under the SIP are forfeited if 
the employee leaves within three years of the award. Awards are made twice a year, based on the results of each 
half-year. Overseas staff receive an award under the Discretionary Free Share Scheme equivalent to the SIP award 
made to UK employees.
Dilution
The Company has controls in place to ensure that shares awarded under the schemes operated by the Company 
within any rolling ten year period do not exceed 10% of the number of ordinary shares in the capital of the Company  
in issue at the time of each award.
Total Shareholdings of Directors
Executive Directors have agreed to (acquire and) retain a beneficial shareholding equal to at least 100% of base salary, 
which can be built up over a period of five years from the date of appointment.
As at March 2013, the Directors have the following shareholdings:

Other Directorships
Executive directors are permitted to, although none currently do, accept appointments as Non-Executive Directors of 
companies with prior approval of the Chairman. Approval will only be given where the appointment does not present 
a conflict of interest with the Group’s activities and the wider exposure gained will be beneficial to the development 
of the individual. Where fees are payable in respect of such appointments, these would be passed to the Company.

Admiral Group plc 
Annual Report 2012 1. General information and basis of preparation
General information
Admiral Group plc is a Company incorporated in 
England and Wales. Its registered office is at Capital 
Tower, Greyfriars Road, Cardiff CF10 3AZ and its shares 
are listed on the London Stock Exchange. 
The consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 
as adopted by the European Union (EU). The Company 
has elected to prepare its Parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (GAAP).
Adoption of new and revised standards
The Group has applied all adopted IFRS and 
interpretations endorsed by the EU at 31 December 2012, 
including all amendments to extant standards that are not 
effective until later accounting periods.
There are a number of standards, amendments to 
standards and interpretations that were issued by 
31 December 2012 but have either yet to be endorsed 
by the EU, or were endorsed shortly after the year end. 
These are as follows: 
 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
 Government Loans (Amendments to IFRS 1)
 Improvements to IFRSs 2009-2011
 Transition guidance (Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 11 
and IFRS 12)
 Investment entities (Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 
and IAS 27).
None of these standards, amendments to standards 
or interpretations of current standards above will have 
a material impact on the Group’s financial statements 
in future periods.
In addition, none of the standards or interpretations 
adopted for the first time in the year have had a material 
impact on the consolidated financial results or position 
of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2012.
Basis of preparation
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern 
basis. In considering the appropriateness of this 
assumption, the Board have reviewed the Group’s 
projections for the next twelve months and beyond, 
including cash flow forecasts and regulatory capital 
surpluses. The Group has no debt. 
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that 
the company has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the annual financial statements.
Further information regarding the company’s business 
activities, together with the factors likely to affect its 
future development, performance and position, is set 
out in the Business Review on pages 11 to 21 Further 
information regarding the financial position of the 
company, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing 
facilities are described in the Business Review on pages 20 
to 21. In addition notes 5 and 10 to the financial statements 
include the company’s objectives, policies and processes 
for managing its capital; its financial risk management 
objectives; details of its financial instruments; and its 
exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The accounting policies set out in the notes to the financial 
statements have, unless otherwise stated, been applied 
consistently to all periods presented in these Group 
financial statements. 
The financial statements are prepared on the historical 
cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial assets 
classified as at fair value through profit or loss.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. 
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or 
indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies 
of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In 
assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently 
exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The 
financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the 
consolidated financial statements from the date that 
control commences until the date that control ceases.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with 
adopted IFRS requires management to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of 
policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expenses. The estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical experience and 
various other factors that are believed to be reasonable 
under the circumstances, the results of which form the 
basis of making the judgements about carrying values 
of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent 
from other sources. The estimates and underlying 
assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions 
to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in 
which the estimate is reviewed if this revision affects only 
that year, or in the year of the revision and future years if 
the revision affects both current and future years. To the 
extent that a change in an accounting estimate gives 
rise to changes in assets and liabilities, it is recognised 
by adjusting the carrying amount of the related asset or 
liability in the period of the change.
Notes to the  
Financial Statements
Admiral Group plc 
Annual Report 2012 63
Overview Financial statements Governance Performance Overview Other information 2. Critical accounting judgements and estimates
Judgements:
In applying the Group’s accounting policies as described 
in the notes to the financial statements, management 
has primarily applied judgement in the classification of the 
Group’s contracts with reinsurers as reinsurance contracts. 
A contract is required to transfer significant insurance risk 
in order to be classified as such. Management reviews 
all terms and conditions of each such contract, and 
if necessary obtains the opinion of an independent 
expert at the negotiation stage in order to be able 
to make this judgement.
Estimation techniques used in calculation of 
claims provisions:
Estimation techniques are used in the calculation of 
the provisions for claims outstanding, which represent 
a projection of the ultimate cost of settling claims that 
have occurred prior to the balance sheet date and 
remain unsettled at the balance sheet date.
The key area where these techniques are used relates 
to the ultimate cost of reported claims. A secondary 
area relates to the emergence of claims that occurred 
prior to the balance sheet date, but had not been 
reported at that date.
The estimates of the ultimate cost of reported claims are 
based on the setting of claim provisions on a case-by-
case basis, for all but the simplest of claims.
The sum of these provisions are compared with projected 
ultimate costs using a variety of different projection 
techniques (including incurred and paid chain ladder and 
an average cost of claim approach) to allow an actuarial 
assessment of their likely accuracy. They include 
allowance for unreported claims.
The most significant sensitivity in the use of the projection 
techniques arises from any future step change in claims 
costs, which would cause future claim cost inflation to 
deviate from historic trends. This is most likely to arise 
from a change in the regulatory or judicial regime that 
leads to an increase in awards or legal costs for bodily 
injury claims that is significantly above or below the 
historical trend.
The claims reserves are subject to independent review 
by the Group’s actuarial advisors. Management’s 
reserving policy is to reserve at a level above best 
estimate assumptions to allow for unforeseen adverse 
claims development. For further detail on objectives, 
policies and procedures for managing insurance risk, 
refer to note 4 of the financial statements.
Future changes in claims reserves also impact profit 
commission income, as the recognition of this income 
is dependent on the loss ratio booked in the financial 
statements, and cash receivable is dependent on 
actuarial projections of ultimate loss ratios.
3. Group consolidation and operating segments
3a Accounting policies
(i) Group consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the 
results and balances of the Company and its subsidiaries 
(together referred to as the Group) for the year ended 
31 December 2012 and comparative figures for the year 
ended 31 December 2011. The financial statements of the 
Company’s subsidiaries are consolidated in the Group 
financial statements. The Company controls 100% of the 
voting share capital of all its principal subsidiaries, except 
Rastreator.com Limited and Inspop USA LLC. The Parent 
Company financial statements present information about 
the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group. 
In accordance with International Accounting Standard (IAS) 
24, transactions or balances between Group companies 
that have been eliminated on consolidation are not 
reported as related party transactions in the consolidated 
financial statements.
(ii) Foreign currency translation:
Items included in the financial statements of each of 
the Group’s entities are measured using the currency 
of the primary economic environment in which the entity 
operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated 
financial statements are presented in millions of pounds 
sterling, which is the Group’s presentation currency. 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the 
functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at 
the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and 
losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, 
and from the translation at year end exchange rates of 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are recognised in the income statement.
Translation differences on non-monetary items, such 
as equities held at fair value through profit or loss, are 
reported as part of the fair value gain or loss. 
The financial statements of foreign operations whose 
functional currency is not pounds sterling are translated 
into the Group presentation currency (sterling) as follows:
 Assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented 
are translated at the closing rate at the date of that 
balance sheet;
 Income and expenses for each income statement 
are translated at average exchange rates (unless this 
average is not a reasonable approximation of the 
cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the 
transaction dates, in which case income and expenses 
are translated at the date of the transaction); and
 All resulting exchange differences are recognised 
in other comprehensive income and in a separate 
component of equity. 
On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative 
amount recognised in equity relating to that particular 
operation is recognised in the income statement.

Admiral Group plc 
Annual Report 2012 3b Segment reporting
The Group has four reportable segments, as described below. These segments represent the principal split of 
business that is regularly reported to the Group’s Board of Directors, which is considered to be the Group’s chief 
operating decision maker in line with IFRS 8, Operating Segments. 
UK Car Insurance:
The segment consists of the underwriting of car insurance and other products that supplement the car insurance 
policy. It also includes the generation of ancillary income from underwriting car insurance in the UK. The Directors 
consider the results of these activities to be reportable as one segment as the activities carried out in generating 
the income are not independent of each other and are performed as one business. This mirrors the approach taken 
in management reporting.
International Car Insurance:
The segment consists of the underwriting of car insurance and the generation of ancillary income from underwriting 
car insurance outside of the UK. It specifically covers the Group operations Admiral Seguros in Spain, ConTe in Italy, 
L’olivier Assurances in France and Elephant Auto in the USA. None of these operations are reportable on an individual 
basis, based on the threshold requirements in IFRS 8.
Price Comparison:
The segment relates to the Group’s price comparison websites Confused in the UK, Rastreator in Spain and LeLynx 
in France. The Group’s price comparison operation in Italy, Chiarezza was sold in 2012. Each of the Price Comparison 
businesses are operating in individual geographical segments but are grouped into one reporting segment as 
LeLynx and Rastreator do not individually meet the threshold requirements in IFRS 8.
Other:
The ‘other’ segment is designed to be comprised of all other operating segments that do not meet the threshold 
requirements for individual reporting. Currently there is only one such segment, the Gladiator commercial van 
insurance broking operation, and so it is the results and balances of this operation comprises the ‘other’ segment. 
The Group launched a UK Household insurance product at the end of 2012. There are no transactions relating to 
household insurance within any of the segments reported below.
Taxes are not allocated across the segments and, as with the corporate activities, are included in the reconciliation 
to the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
An analysis of the Group’s revenue and results for the year ended 31 December 2012, by reportable segment are 
shown below. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are consistent with those presented in the notes 
to the financial statements for the Group.

Segment revenues
The UK and International Car Insurance reportable segments derive all insurance premium income from external 
policyholders. Revenue within these segments is not derived from an individual policyholder that represents 10% 
or more of the Group’s total revenue.
The total of Price Comparison revenues from transactions with other reportable segments is £13.0m (2011: £14.9m). 
These amounts have not been eliminated on consolidation as the Directors consider that not doing so results in a 
better overall presentation of the financial statements. The impact on the financial statements in the current and 
prior period is not material. There are no other transactions between reportable segments.
Within the UK Car Insurance segment, transactions between the Group’s intermediary and the Group’s insurance 
companies relating to vehicle commission totalling £7 .0m have not been eliminated (from the insurance expenses and 
other revenue lines in the income statement) in order to ensure consistency between the financial statements and key 
performance indicators quoted in the business review. There is no profit impact of the non-elimination. 
Revenues from external customers for products and services is consistent with the split of reportable segment 
revenues as shown above.
Information about geographical locations
All material revenues from external customers, and net assets attributed to a foreign country are shown within the 
International Car Insurance reportable segment shown above. The revenue and results of the two International Price 
Comparison businesses, Rastreator and LeLynx are not yet material enough to be presented as a separate segment.

Unallocated assets and liabilities consist of other central assets and liabilities, plus deferred and current corporation

segment format.
There is an asymmetrical allocation of assets and income to the reportable segments, in that the interest earned on 
cash and cash equivalent assets deployed in the UK Car Insurance, Price Comparison and International Car Insurance 
segments is not allocated in arriving at segment profits. This is consistent with regular management reporting.

Overview Financial statements Governance Performance Overview Other information 4. Premium, Claims and Profit Commissions 
4a Accounting policies
(i) Revenue recognition – premiums:
Premiums relating to insurance contracts are recognised 
as revenue proportionally over the period of cover. 
Premiums with an inception date after the end of 
the period are held in the statement of financial 
position as deferred revenue. Outstanding 
collections from policyholders are recognised 
within policyholder receivables.
(ii) Revenue recognition – profit commission:
Under some of the co-insurance and reinsurance 
contracts under which motor premiums are shared or 
ceded, profit commission may be earned on a particular 
year of account, which is usually subject to performance 
criteria such as loss ratios and expense ratios. The 
commission is dependent on the ultimate outcome of 
any year, with revenue being recognised when loss and 
expense ratios used in the preparation of the financial 
statements, move below an agreed threshold.
(iii) Insurance contracts and reinsurance assets:
 Premiums 
The proportion of premium receivable on in-force 
policies relating to unexpired risks is reported in 
insurance contract liabilities and reinsurance assets 
as the unearned premium provision – gross and 
reinsurers’ share respectively. 
 Claims 
Claims and claims handling expenses are charged 
as incurred, based on the estimated direct and 
indirect costs of settling all liabilities arising on 
events occurring up to the balance sheet date. 
The provision for claims outstanding comprises provisions 
for the estimated cost of settling all claims incurred but 
unpaid at the balance sheet date, whether reported or 
not. Anticipated reinsurance recoveries are disclosed 
separately as assets.
Whilst the Directors consider that the gross provisions 
for claims and the related reinsurance recoveries are fairly 
stated on the basis of the information currently available 
to them, the ultimate liability will vary as a result of 
subsequent information and events and may result in 
significant adjustments to the amounts provided. 
Adjustments to the amounts of claims provisions 
established in prior years are reflected in the income 
statement for the period in which the adjustments are 
made and disclosed separately if material. The methods 
used, and the estimates made, are reviewed regularly.
Provision for unexpired risks is made where necessary for 
the estimated amount required over and above unearned 
premiums (net of deferred acquisition costs) to meet 
future claims and related expenses. 
 Co-insurance 
The Group has entered into certain co-insurance 
contracts under which insurance risks are shared on 
a proportional basis, with the co-insurer taking a 
specific percentage of premium written and being 
responsible for the same proportion of each claim. 
As the contractual liability is several and not joint, 
neither the premiums nor claims relating to the 
co-insurance are included in the income statement. 
Under the terms of these agreements the co-insurers 
reimburse the Group for the same proportionate 
share of the costs of acquiring and administering 
the business.
 Reinsurance assets 
Contracts entered into by the Group with reinsurers 
under which the Group is compensated for losses 
on the insurance contracts issued by the Group are 
classified as reinsurance contracts. A contract is only 
accounted for as a reinsurance contract where there is 
significant insurance risk transfer between the insured 
and the insurer.  
 
The benefits to which the Group is entitled under 
these contracts are held as reinsurance assets.  
 
The Group assesses its reinsurance assets for 
impairment on a regular basis, and in detail every 
six months. If there is objective evidence that the 
asset is impaired, then the carrying value will be 
written down to its recoverable amount.

4d Reinsurance assets and insurance contract liabilities 
(i) Objectives, policies and procedures for the management of insurance risk:
The Group is involved in issuing motor insurance contracts that transfer risk from policyholders to the Group and 
its underwriting partners. 
Insurance risk primarily involves uncertainty over the occurrence, amount or timing of claims arising on insurance 
contracts issued. 
The key reserving risk is that the frequency and/or value of the claims arising exceeds expectation and the value 
of insurance liabilities established.
The Board of Directors is responsible for the management of insurance risk, although as mentioned in note 5, 
it has delegated the task of supervising risk management to the Group Risk Committee.
The Board implements certain policies in order to mitigate and control the level of insurance risk accepted 
by the Group. These include underwriting partnership arrangements, pricing policies and claims management 
and administration policies.
Admiral Group plc 
Annual Report 2012 69
Overview Financial statements Governance Performance Overview Other information Notes to the Financial Statements continued
A number of the key elements of these policies and procedures are detailed below:
 Co-insurance and reinsurance:
As noted in the business review, the Group cedes a significant amount of the motor insurance business generated 
to external underwriters. In 2012, 40% of the UK risk was shared under a co-insurance contract, under which the 
primary risk is borne by the co-insurer. A further 35% of the UK risk was ceded under quota share reinsurance 
contracts. Co-insurance and reinsurance contracts are also used in the International car insurance businesses. 
Further detail can be found in the business review on page 13 and 17. 
 As well as these proportional arrangements, an excess of loss reinsurance programme is also purchased to protect 
the Group against very large individual claims and catastrophe losses.
 Data driven pricing:
The Group’s underwriting philosophy is focused on a sophisticated data-driven approach to pricing and underwriting 
and on exploiting the competitive advantages direct insurers enjoy over traditional insurers through:
– Collating and analysing more comprehensive data from customers;
– Tight control over the pricing guidelines in order to target profitable business sectors; and
– Fast and flexible responsiveness to data analysis and market trends.
The Group is committed to establishing premium rates that appropriately price the underwriting risk and exposure. 
Rates are set utilising a larger than average number of underwriting criteria. 
The Directors believe that there is a strong link between the increase in depth of data that the Group has been able 
to collate over time and the lower than average historic reported loss ratios enjoyed by the Group.
 Effective claims management:
The Group adopts various claims management strategies designed to ensure that claims are paid at an appropriate 
level and to minimise the expenses associated with claims management. These include:
–  An effective, computerised workflow system (which along with the appropriate level of resources employed helps 
reduce the scope for error and avoids significant backlogs);
–  Use of an outbound telephone team to contact third parties aiming to minimise the potential claims costs and to 
ensure that more third parties utilise the Group approved repairers; and
– Use of sophisticated and innovative methods to check for fraudulent claims.
Concentration of insurance risk:
The Directors do not believe there are significant concentrations of insurance risk. This is because, although the Group 
has historically written only one line of insurance business, the risks are spread across a large number of people and a 
wide regional base.

5a Accounting policies
(i) Investment income:
Investment income from financial assets comprises interest income and net gains (both realised and unrealised) 
on financial assets classified as fair value through profit and loss and interest income on held to maturity deposits.
(ii) Financial assets – investments and receivables:
 Initial recognition
Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans 
and receivables or held to maturity investments. At initial recognition assets are recognised at fair value and 
classified according to the purpose for which they were acquired. 
The Group’s investments in money market liquidity funds are designated as financial assets at fair value through 
profit or loss (FVTPL) at inception. 
This designation is permitted under IAS 39, as the investments in money market funds are managed as a group 
of assets and internal performance evaluation of this group is conducted on a fair value basis. 
The Group’s deposits with credit institutions are classified as held to maturity investments, which is consistent 
with the intention for which they were purchased.
 Subsequent measurement
Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised through the 
income statement.
Deposits with fixed maturities, classified as held to maturity investments are measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method. Movements in the amortised cost are recognised through the income statement, 
as are any impairment losses.
Loans and receivables are stated at their amortised cost less impairment using the effective interest method. 
Impairment losses are recognised through the income statement.
Admiral Group plc 
Annual Report 2012 73
Overview Financial statements Governance Performance Overview Other information Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether any financial assets or groups of financial assets held 
at amortised cost, are impaired. Financial assets are impaired where there is evidence that one or more events 
occurring after the initial recognition of the asset, may lead to a reduction in the estimated future cash flows 
arising from the asset. 
Objective evidence of impairment may include default on cash flows due from the asset and reported financial 
difficulty of the issuer or counterparty. 
 Derecognition of financial assets
A financial asset is derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from that asset have expired or when the 
Group transfers the asset and all the attaching substantial risks and rewards relating to the asset, to a third party.
(iii)  Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, and other short-term deposits 
with original maturities of three months or less. All cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortised cost.

The approximate fair value of held to maturity deposits plus short dated debt securities is £562.8m (2011: £280.8m) 
based on a calculation to discount expected cashflows arising at the Group’s weighted average cost of capital 
(WACC). The amortised cost carrying amount of receivables is a reasonable approximation of fair value.

Objectives, policies and procedures for managing financial assets and liabilities
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to financial risks of credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign 
exchange risk. The Board of Directors has delegated the task of supervising risk management and internal control 
to the Risk Committee. There is also an Investment Committee that makes recommendations to the Board on the 
Group’s investment strategy. 
There are several key elements to the risk management environment throughout the Group. These are detailed in 
full in the Corporate Governance statement. Specific considerations for the risks arising from financial assets and 
liabilities are detailed below. 
 Credit risk
The Group defines credit risk as the risk of loss if another party fails to perform its obligations. The key areas of 
exposure to credit risk for the Group result through its reinsurance programme, investments, bank deposits and 
policyholder receivables. 
Economic and financial market conditions have led the Directors to consider counterparty exposure more frequently 
and in significant detail. The Directors consider that the policies and procedures in place to manage credit exposure 
continue to be appropriate for the Group’s risk appetite, and during 2012 and historically no material credit losses 
have been experienced by the Group. 
There are no specific concentrations of credit risk with respect to investment counterparties due to the structure 
of the liquidity funds which invest in a wide range of very short duration, high quality securities. Cash balances and 
deposits are placed only with highly rated credit institutions. The detailed holdings are reviewed regularly by the 
Investment Committee. 
Admiral Group plc 
Annual Report 2012 75
Overview Financial statements Governance Performance Overview Other information Notes to the Financial Statements continued
To mitigate the risk arising from exposure to reinsurers (in the form of reinsurance recoveries and profit commissions), 
the Group only conducts business with companies of appropriate financial strength. In addition, most reinsurance 
contracts are operated on a funds withheld basis, which substantially reduces credit risk, as the Group holds the 
cash received as collateral.
The other principal form of credit risk is in respect of amounts due from policyholders, largely due to the potential 
for default by instalment payers. The impact of this is mitigated by the large customer base and low average level 
of balance recoverable. There is also mitigation by the operation of numerous high- and low- level controls in this area, 
including payment on policy acceptance as opposed to inception and automated cancellation procedures for policies 
in default.
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2012 is £2,221.7m (2011: £1,807 .6m) being the carrying 
value of financial assets and cash. The Group does not use credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate 
exposure. The amount of bad debt expense relating to policyholder debt charged to the income statement in 
2011 and 2012 is insignificant.
There were no significant financial assets that were past due at the close of either 2012 or 2011.
The Group’s credit risk exposure to assets with external ratings is as follows:

 Interest rate risk 
The Group considers interest rate risk to be the risk that unfavourable movements in interest rates could adversely 
impact on the capital values of financial assets and liabilities. This relates primarily to investments held at fair value. 
As noted above, the Group invests in money market liquidity funds, which in turn invest in a mixture of very short 
dated fixed and variable rate securities, such as cash deposits, certificates of deposits, floating rate notes and other 
commercial paper. 
The funds are not permitted to have an average maturity greater than 60 days and hence are not subject to large 
movements in yield and value resulting from changes in market interest rates (as longer duration fixed income 
portfolios can experience). Returns are likely to closely track the LIBID benchmark and hence while the Group’s 
investment return will vary according to market interest rates, the capital value of these investment funds will not 
be impacted by rate movements. The interest rate risk arising is therefore considered to be minimal. 
During the year the Group has placed funds into two segregated mandates. The guidelines of the investments 
retain the credit quality of the money market liquidity funds, whilst holding the securities on a hold to maturity 
basis. As the duration of the securities is short there is no material interest rate risk relating to these investments.
The Group also holds a number of fixed rate, longer-term deposits with strongly rated credit institutions. These are 
classified as held to maturity and valued at amortised cost. Therefore neither the capital value of the deposits, or the 
interest return will be impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. 
No sensitivity analysis to interest rates has been presented on the grounds of materiality.

Admiral Group plc 
Annual Report 2012 Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group does not have sufficient, available, financial resources to enable it 
to meet its obligations as they fall due, or can only secure them at excessive cost. 
The Group is strongly cash-generative due to the large proportion of revenue arising from non-underwriting activity. 
Further, as noted above, a significant portion of insurance funds are invested in money market liquidity funds with 
same day liquidity, meaning that a large proportion of the Group cash and investments are immediately available. 
A breakdown of the Group’s financial liabilities – trade and other payables is shown in note 9. In terms of the maturity 
profile of these liabilities, all amounts will mature within 3 – 6 months of the balance sheet date. (Refer to the maturity 
profile at the start of this note for further detail.)
In practice, the Group’s Directors expect actual cash flows to be consistent with this maturity profile except for 
amounts owed to co-insurers and reinsurers. Of the total amounts owed to co-insurers and reinsurers of £723.5m 
(2011: £579.4m), £609.6m (2011: £432.9m) is held under funds withheld arrangements and therefore not expected 
to be settled within 12 months.
A maturity analysis for insurance contract liabilities is included in note 4.
The maturity profile for financial assets is included at the start of this note. The Group’s Directors believe that the 
cash flows arising from these assets will be consistent with this profile.
Liquidity risk is not, therefore considered to be significant.
 Foreign exchange risks
Foreign exchange risks arise from unfavourable movements in foreign exchange rates that could adversely impact 
the valuation of overseas assets. 
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk through its expanding operations overseas. Although the relative 
size of the European and International operations means that the risks are relatively small, increasingly volatile foreign 
exchange rates could result in larger potential gains or losses. Assets held to fund insurance liabilities are held in the 
currency of the liabilities, however surplus assets held as regulatory capital in foreign currencies remain exposed.
The Group’s exposures to net assets held in euros and dollars at the balance sheet date were £13.3m and 
£46.7m respectively. 
Fair value
For cash at bank and cash deposits, the fair value approximates to the book value due to their short maturity. 
For assets held at fair value through profit and loss, their value equates to level 1 (quoted prices in active markets) 
of the fair value hierarchy.

6. Other Revenue
6a Accounting policy
(i) Ancillary and other revenue:
Ancillary and other revenue includes revenue earned on the sale of ancillary products, administration and other 
charges paid by the policyholder, referral fees, revenue from policies paid by instalments and vehicle commission 
charges paid by co- and reinsurers. Revenue is credited to the income statement over the period matching the 
Group’s obligations to provide services. Where the Group has no remaining contractual obligations, the revenue is 
recognised immediately. An allowance is made for expected cancellations where the customer may be entitled to a 
refund of ancillary amounts charged.
Commission from price comparison activities and earned by Gladiator is credited to revenue on the sale of the 
underlying insurance policy.

7. Expenses
7a Accounting policies
(i) Acquisition costs, reinsurer vehicle commission and operating expenses:
Acquisition costs incurred in obtaining new and renewal business are charged to the income statement over he period 
in which those premiums are earned. Vehicle commissions relating to new and renewal business is also recognised 
over the period in which those premiums are earned. All other operating expenses are charged to the income 
statement in the period that they are incurred. 
Insurance contract expenses, which comprise of the acquisition costs, vehicle commissions and operating expenses 
referred to above are included in the income statement net of recoveries from co-insurers and reinsurers. 
(ii) Employee benefits:
Pensions
The Group contributes to defined contribution personal pension plans for its employees. The contributions payable 
to these schemes are charged in the accounting period to which they relate.
Employee share schemes
The Group operates a number of equity settled compensation schemes for its employees. For schemes commencing 
1 January 2004 and after, the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of free shares 
under the schemes is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in equity. 
The total charge expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the free shares 
granted as determined at the grant date (excluding the impact of non-market vesting conditions). Non-market 
conditions such as profitability targets as well as staff attrition rates are included in assumptions over the number 
of free shares to vest under the applicable scheme. 
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its assumptions on the number of shares to be granted with the impact 
of any change in the assumptions recognised through income.
Refer to note 7e for further details on share schemes.

consolidated statement of changes in equity (2012: £23.7m, 2011: £23.6m).
The consolidated cash flow statement also shows the gross charge in the reconciliation between ‘profit after tax’ 
and ‘cash flows from operating activities’. The co-insurance share of the charge is included in the ‘change in trade 
and other payables’ line. 
(i) The Approved Share Incentive Plan (the SIP)
Eligible employees qualify for awards under the SIP based upon the performance of the Group in each half-year 
period. The current maximum award for each year is £3,000 per employee. 
The awards are made with reference to the Group’s performance against prior year profit before tax. Employees must 
remain in employment for the holding period (three years from the date of award) otherwise the shares are forfeited. 
The fair value of shares awarded is either the share price at the date of award, or is estimated at the latest share price 
available when drawing up the financial statements for awards not yet made (and later adjusted to reflect the actual 
share price on the award date). Awards under the SIP are entitled to receive dividends, and hence no adjustment has 
been made to this fair value. 
(ii) The Discretionary Free Share Scheme (the DFSS)
Under the DFSS, details of which are contained in the remuneration policy section of the remuneration report, 
individuals receive an award of free shares at no charge. Staff must remain in employment until the vesting date 
in order to receive shares. The maximum number of shares that can vest relating to the 2012 scheme is 2,149,566 
(2011 scheme: 1,791,234). 
Individual awards are calculated based on the growth in the Company’s earnings per share (EPS) relative to a risk 
free return (RFR), for which LIBOR has been selected as a benchmark. This performance is measured over the same 
three-year period. 
Notes to the Financial Statements continued

Admiral Group plc 
Annual Report 2012 For the 2011 and 2010 schemes, 50% of the shares awarded at the start of the three year vesting period are subject 
to these performance conditions. 
The range of awards is as follows:
 If the growth in EPS is less than the RFR, no awards vest
 EPS growth is equal to RFR – 10% of maximum award vests
 To achieve the maximum award, EPS growth has to be 36 points higher than RFR over the three year period.
Between 10% and 100% of the maximum awards, a linear relationship exists.
Awards under the DFSS are not eligible for dividends (although a discretionary bonus is currently paid equivalent to 
the dividend that would have been paid on the respective shareholding) and hence the fair value of free shares to be 
awarded under this scheme has been revised downwards to take account of these distributions. The unadjusted fair 
value is based on the share price at the date on which awards were made (as stated in the Remuneration report).

Overview Financial statements Governance Performance Overview Other information 8. Taxation
8a Accounting policy
Income tax on the profit or loss for the periods presented comprises current and deferred tax. 
(i) Current tax:
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, and includes any adjustment to tax payable in 
respect of previous periods. 
Current tax related to items recognised in other comprehensive income is also recognised in other comprehensive 
income and not in the income statement.
(ii) Deferred tax:
Deferred tax is provided in full using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences arising 
between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes, and the amounts used for taxation 
purposes. It is calculated at the tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date, 
or that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available 
against which the asset can be utilised.
The principal temporary differences arise from depreciation of property and equipment and share scheme charges. 
The resulting deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except in relation to share scheme charges 
where the amount of tax benefit credited to the income statement is limited to an equivalent credit calculated on the 
accounting charge. Any excess is recognised directly in equity.

The UK corporation tax rate reduced from 26% to 24% on 1 April 2012. The average effective rate of tax for 2012 is 24.5% 
(2011: 26.5%). It will fall to 23% in April 2013, and is expected to fall to 22% in April 2014 although this change has not yet 
been substantively enacted. Deferred tax has therefore been calculated at 23% where the temporary difference is 
expected to reverse after this date.

Admiral Group plc 
Annual Report 2012 83
Overview Financial statements Governance Performance Overview Other information 9. Other assets and other liabilities
9a Accounting policy
(i) Property and equipment, and depreciation
All property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the 
straight-line method to write off the cost less residual values of the assets over their useful economic lives. These 
useful economic lives are as follows:
Motor vehicles – 4 years 
Fixtures, fittings and equipment – 4 years
Computer equipment – 2 to 4 years
Improvements to short leasehold properties – 4 years
(ii) Impairment of property and equipment:
In the case of property and equipment, carrying values are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether 
there are any indications of impairment. If any such indications exist, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated and 
compared to the carrying value. The carrying value is the higher of the fair value of the asset, less costs to sell and the 
asset’s value in use. Impairment losses are recognised through the income statement.
(iii) Leased assets:
The rental costs relating to assets held under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the life of the lease. 
Leases under the terms of which the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are 
classed as finance leases. Assets acquired under finance leases are included in property and equipment at fair value 
on acquisition and are depreciated in the same manner as equivalent owned assets. Finance lease and hire purchase 
obligations are included in creditors, and the finance costs are spread over the periods of the agreements based on 
the net amount outstanding.
(iv) Intangible assets:
Goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method. Goodwill has been recognised in 
acquisitions of subsidiaries, and represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value 
of the net identifiable assets acquired. 
The classification and accounting treatment of acquisitions occurring before 1 January 2004 have not been 
reconsidered in preparing the Group’s opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2004 due to the exemption available 
in IFRS 1 (First time adoption). In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill is included at the transition 
date on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under UK GAAP , which was tested for 
impairment at the transition date. On transition, amortisation of goodwill has ceased as required by IAS 38.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units 
(CGU’s) according to business segment and is reviewed annually for impairment. 
The Goodwill held on the balance sheet at 31 December 2012 is allocated solely to the UK car insurance segment. 
Impairment of goodwill
The annual impairment review involves comparing the carrying amount to the estimated recoverable amount 
(by allocating the goodwill to CGUs) and recognising an impairment loss if the recoverable amount is lower. 
Impairment losses are recognised through the income statement and are not subsequently reversed. 
The recoverable amount is the greater of the fair value of the asset less costs to sell and the value in use of the CGU.
The value in use calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering 
a three year period. Cash flows beyond this period are considered, but not included in the calculation. The discount 
rate applied to the cash flow projections in the value in use calculations is 9.0% (2011: 11.3%), based on the Group’s 
weighted average cost of capital, which is in line with the market (source: Bloomberg).
Notes to the Financial Statements continued
84
Admiral Group plc 
Annual Report 2012 The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations are those regarding growth rates and expected changes in 
pricing and expenses incurred during the period. Management estimates growth rates and changes in pricing based 
on past practices and expected future changes in the market. 
The headroom above the goodwill carrying value is very significant, and there is no foreseeable event that would 
eliminate this margin.
Deferred acquisition costs:
Acquisition costs comprise all direct and indirect costs arising from the conclusion of insurance contracts. Deferred 
acquisition costs represent the proportion of acquisition costs incurred that corresponds to the unearned premiums 
provision at the balance sheet date. This balance is held as an intangible asset. It is amortised over the term of the 
contract as premium is earned. 
Software:
Purchased software is recognised as an intangible asset and amortised over its expected useful life (generally 
between two and four years). The carrying value is reviewed every six months for evidence of impairment, with the 
value being written down if any impairment exists. Impairment may be reversed if conditions subsequently improve.

Goodwill relates to the acquisition of Group subsidiary EUI Limited (formerly Admiral Insurance Services Limited) in 
November 1999. It is allocated solely to the UK Car Insurance segment. As described in the accounting policies, the 
amortisation of this asset ceased on transition to IFRS on 1 January 2004. All annual impairment reviews since the 
transition date have indicated that the estimated recoverable value of the asset is greater than the carrying amount and 
therefore no impairment losses have been recognised. Refer to the accounting policy for goodwill for further information.

10e Objectives, policies and procedures for managing capital
The Group manages its capital to ensure that all entities within the Group are able to continue as going concerns 
and also to ensure that regulated entities comfortably meet regulatory requirements. Excess capital above these 
levels within subsidiaries is paid up to the Group holding company in the form of dividends on a regular basis. 
The Group’s dividend policy is to make distributions after taking into account capital that is required to be held a) 
for regulatory purposes; b) to fund expansion activities; and c) as a further prudent buffer against unforeseen events. 
This policy gives the Directors flexibility in managing the Group’s capital.
Capital continues to be held in equity form, with no debt.

Admiral Group plc 
Annual Report 2012 Parent Company accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material 
in relation to the financial statements:
1. Basis of preparation
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis. In considering the appropriateness of this assumption, 
the Board have reviewed the Company’s projections for the next twelve months and beyond, including cash flow 
forecasts and regulatory capital surpluses. The Company has no debt. 
As a result of this review the Directors have satisfied themselves that it is appropriate to prepare these financial 
statements on a going concern basis.
The adoption of new accounting standards during the year has not had a material impact on either the current year 
or comparative figures.
The Admiral Group plc Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting 
standards, under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the provisions of Section 396 to the 
Companies Act 2006.
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the profit and loss account of the Parent Company is not 
presented. Under FRS 1 (Cash flow statements) the Company is exempt from having to present a cash flow statement 
on the grounds that its cash flows are included in the Group’s published consolidated financial statements.
The Parent Company audit fee is not disclosed in these accounts as it is disclosed in the Consolidated financial 
statements for Admiral Group plc, which precede them at note 7 .
Refer to note 10 of the Consolidated financial statements for disclosure of related party transactions.
2. Investments
Shares in Group undertakings are valued at cost less any provision for impairment in value.
3. Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of 
timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable. They are regarded as 
recoverable to the extent that, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not 
that there will be sufficient taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can 
be deducted.
4. Employee share schemes:
The Group operates a number of equity settled compensation schemes for its employees. For schemes commencing 
1 January 2004 and after, the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of free shares 
under the schemes is recognised as an expense in the parent Company’s subsidiaries, with a corresponding increase 
in equity in the parent Company. 
Refer to note 7 of the consolidated financial statements for further details on share schemes.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Strategic report | Chairman’s statement | 
A STRONG 
PERFORMANCE BY 
ALL BUSINESSES 
DESPITE 
CURRENCY AND 
COMMODITY 
CHALLENGES
This financial year has been 
characterised by continuing 
investment in businesses  
with growth opportunities and  
a relentless drive for improved 
efficiencies and cost reduction.
The two major challenges facing the group 
have been well flagged – food commodity 
deflation and substantial movements in  
currency markets.
A key influence on our food businesses 
has been deflation in many of our major 
commodities, making growth in revenues 
difficult to achieve. The most notable 
examples are the substantial declines  
in both the EU and world sugar prices.  
We have also experienced significant 
movements in exchange rates with  
a strengthening of sterling and the  
US dollar, and a weakening of the euro  
and emerging market currencies. These 
movements had a negative effect on the 
translation of overseas results but also, 
and increasingly as the year progressed, 
on transactional exposures.
Against this background a 2% decline in 
adjusted earnings per share is all the more 
creditable and the group continued to 
generate strong cash flows and reduce 
net debt significantly as a result.
This year has seen growth for a number  
of our businesses. Primark expanded its 
retail selling space by 9% this year  
with a major increase in its presence in 
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands 
and at the end of the year it opened its  
first store in the US. Brand development  
at our Grocery businesses included a 
major relaunch of Twinings black teas  
in the UK, growth for Mazola, driven  
by strong advertising of its cholesterol 
lowering benefits, and commercial 
success for the Don meat brand in 
Australia. Our enzyme business went 
from strength to strength and was a  
key contributor to the profit increase  
in Agriculture and Ingredients. We 
continue to position our businesses  
to enable them to maximise revenue 
growth opportunities.
The EU sugar price has stabilised in  
the latter part of the year. However, the 
significant fall both in EU and world sugar 
prices has put considerable strain on the 
world sugar industry and has sharpened 
our focus on securing the long term 
profitability of our business. As one of the 
lowest cost producers we have always 
sought to reduce costs and maximise 
production efficiency and significantly,   Strategic report
Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
5 Strategic report | Chairman’s statement | 
this year, we have secured lower future 
beet costs for our EU sugar businesses 
and closed two uneconomic factories  
in Heilongjiang, China.
Cost reduction was not confined to our 
Sugar businesses. The substantial profit 
and margin recovery in Ingredients and 
margin improvement in Grocery were  
also driven by wide ranging initiatives  
in these businesses.
We continued to invest for the long  
term with gross capital expenditure  
on property, plant, equipment and 
intangible assets of £613m. Over half  
of this was spent on Primark’s expansion 
where, this year, we added 20 new stores 
and almost one million square feet to the 
estate. We expect next year’s increase  
to be even greater. We also increased  
the scale of Primark’s distribution 
infrastructure to support this growth by 
extending existing warehouse capacity 
and opening new facilities in the Czech 
Republic and the US. The focus of our 
capital expenditure within the food 
businesses was directed at expansion  
of capacity-constrained facilities and  
on improving production efficiency.
Cash flow was again strong this year 
despite a working capital outflow driven  
by higher sugar stocks. Net debt at the 
year end was £252m lower than last  
year at £194m. With the group’s cash 
generating ability, the lower net debt  
and the committed borrowing facilities 
available, we have the capacity to  
meet our growth ambitions.
Corporate responsibility
At the heart of our group is the very simple 
philosophy that helping to feed and  
clothe people is a virtuous and valuable 
endeavour. Our approach to ensuring  
that we provide our customers with  
high-quality, ethically sourced products  
in a responsible manner is described  
in our latest Corporate Responsibility  
Update which is published today and  
is available on the group’s website at  
www.abf.co.uk/responsibility.
The board
The Senior Independent Director,  
Tim Clarke, was appointed to the board  
in 2004 and, in accordance with the  
UK Corporate Governance Code, having 
completed nine years’ service in 2013,  
the rest of the board must now confirm  
his independence annually. This having 
been done, we are delighted that Tim  
has agreed to continue as a member  
of the board and as the Senior 
Independent Director.
Javier Ferrán completed nine years on the 
board at the beginning of November 2015 
and has agreed to continue as a director 
but retired from the Audit committee at the 
conclusion of its meeting on 26 October. 
The rest of the board has considered, and 
subsequently confirmed, his continuing 
independence. Lord Jay has also 
completed nine years on the board and 
will retire at the end of November. We 
have benefited greatly from the breadth  
of Michael’s experience and I would like  
to record my thanks to him for his wise 
counsel and highly valued contribution  
to the board over the years.
In January we welcomed Wolfhart Hauser 
to the board as a non-executive director 
and he was appointed to the Audit 
committee in April. Dr Hauser was chief 
executive officer of Intertek Group plc until 
his retirement in May 2015, and during his 
career he led a broad range of successful 
international service industry businesses. 
He is currently a non-executive director of 
RELX Group plc, formerly Reed Elsevier, 
and chairman of FirstGroup plc.
Employees
This year’s success is testament to  
the resilience and resourcefulness of  
our employees who, in many of our 
businesses, and particularly in Sugar,  
have been operating in difficult market 
conditions. I would like to thank them all 
for their valuable contribution, particularly 
to the various continuous improvement 
initiatives that have led to substantial  
cost reduction across the group this  
year. These required a robust challenge  
to historic practices, innovation and 
creativity, and an absolute determination  
to succeed, all of which underpinned 
delivery of this year’s result.
Auditors
KPMG or one of its predecessor firms  
has been our auditor since the Company 
was incorporated in 1935. In light of the 
new requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the external audit  
of the group financial statements was  
put out to tender during the year and the 
board has now appointed Ernst & Young 
LLP as the Company’s new auditor with 
effect from 4 November 2015, subject  
to approval by shareholders at the annual 
general meeting. I would like to take  
this opportunity to thank KPMG for their 
unstinting professionalism, for the insight 
that they have brought and the value  
that they have added to our businesses 
during their 80 year tenure.
Dividends
I am pleased to report that a final dividend 
of 25.0p is proposed, to be paid on  
8 January 2016 to shareholders on the 
register on 11 December 2015. Together 
with the interim dividend of 10.0p paid  
on 3 July 2015, this will make a total of 
35.0p for the year, an increase of 3%.
Outlook
The good underlying trading achieved  
by our businesses in 2015 is expected  
to continue.
We intend to maintain investment in 
expansion opportunities, most notably for 
Primark. After three years of large profit 
declines for AB Sugar, we expect greater 
stability in profit next year ahead of EU 
quota removal in 2017. However, the 
substantial moves in exchange rates last 
year, notably the weakening of the euro 
and emerging market currencies, will  
have a significant influence on the results 
for the coming year. At current rates the 
translation impact would be at a similar 
level to last year but the transactional 
impact would be greater and will be seen 
primarily in Primark and British Sugar.
At this early stage we expect the currency 
pressures to lead to a modest decline  
in adjusted operating profit and adjusted 
earnings for the group for the coming year.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
WE DELIVERED A STRONG 
OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE  
THIS YEAR
I am pleased with the  
trading performance and  
the progress made by each  
of our businesses this year.
Grocery, Agriculture, Ingredients and 
Retail all increased their profits. Sugar 
profit was, as expected, substantially 
lower than last year as a result of much 
weaker euro-denominated EU sugar 
prices, but the business made great 
strides in reducing operating costs.
Group revenue declined by 1 % to £12.8bn 
but was 2% higher at constant currency. 
Adjusted operating profit was 6%  
lower at £1,092m, and 4% lower at 
constant currency.
The international diversity of the group 
means that our businesses operate  
and transact in many currencies and are 
therefore subject to both translational and 
transactional currency exposures. During 
the financial year, against a basket of 
currencies, the euro and emerging market 
currencies weakened significantly and the 
US dollar and sterling both strengthened. 
The full year impact of these movements 
in exchange rates on the translation of 
overseas results into sterling was £31m.   OPEN FOR BUSINESS IN BOSTON!

The development of our Grocery 
businesses this year was reflected in  
the improvement in the overall operating 
margin to 9%. The acquisition of Dorset 
Cereals has brought us a strong consumer 
brand with exciting growth potential  
that complements Jordans and Ryvita. 
Twinings Ovaltine had yet another year of 
excellent profit growth with much activity 
promoting the premium qualities of the 
Twinings brand. After a difficult first half  
of the year which was affected by higher 
cost and poor quality raw materials, I am 
very encouraged by the progress made by 
our Australian meat business, Don KRC, 
both in volume gains and improved factory 
efficiency. Pricing became tougher for our 
bread businesses in the UK and Australia. 
Volumes for the UK business increased 
steadily during the year leading to high 
utilisation of our well-invested bakeries.
Profit in Ingredients recovered even more 
strongly this year as the new management 
team at AB Mauri, our yeast and bakery 
ingredients business, made further 
progress in reducing its cost base and 
restructuring its operations in China and 
Europe. A major contribution was also 
made by our enzymes business which  
had a highly successful year with growth 
in a number of its markets.
In order to understand the underlying 
operating performance of each of our 
businesses, in the operating review we 
have referred to year-on-year changes  
at constant currency.
Food commodity price deflation was the 
primary reason for the decline in revenues 
in each of our food businesses this year 
and was also the major driver of the big 
decline in profit at AB Sugar.
This is the third year of significant profit 
decline for AB Sugar as a consequence  
of falling EU and world sugar prices. It is 
encouraging that EU prices have now 
stabilised and the steps we have taken, 
and continue to take, to reduce our cost 
base, are aimed at creating a profitable 
business at these price levels and in a 
post-quota environment in the EU.
We took the opportunity to increase  
our ownership of Vivergo Fuels this year.  
This is a well-invested, cost-competitive 
asset, with a promising longer-term 
outlook. As the existing supplier of  
grain to the business through Frontier 
Agriculture and as the seller of its distillers’ 
grains through AB Connect, we are well 
placed to maximise the returns from  
this business.
Strategic report | Chief Executive’s statement |
AB Agri delivered another great result and 
deserves credit for its consistently strong 
performance over the last five years  
driven by innovation, diversification and 
geographic expansion.
The exciting expansion of Primark is  
very much on track with the addition of 
nearly one million square feet of selling 
space, the opening of our first store in  
the US at the end of the year, and the 
announcement that we will be opening in 
Italy next year. Trading in France was very 
strong and built on the highly successful 
market entry in 2014. Like-for-like sales 
growth was good at 1%, albeit held back 
by the effects of a strong store opening 
programme in the Netherlands and 
Germany. Following Primark’s exceptional 
trading last year, we saw a return to  
a more normal level of markdowns this  
year and margin was lower as a result.
George Weston
Chief Executive
On 10 September 2015 Primark  
planted its first flag on US soil with  
the opening of a 77,000 sq ft store  
at Downtown Crossing in Boston.

and sustainable positions through a 
combination of organic growth, acquisition

efficiency. We provide high-quality,  
value-for-money food and clothing that  
are central to people’s lives.

BUSINESS STRUCTURE
Our businesses are organised so  
that they are close to the markets  
and customers that they serve. 
They are managed as five business 
segments that bring together common 
industry expertise, operational capability 
and market intelligence. Operational 
decisions are made locally because,  
in our experience, they are most 
successful when made by the people 
who have the best understanding  
of their markets and who have  
to implement them. The corporate  
centre aims to provide a framework  
in which our business leaders have  
the freedom and decision-making 
authority to pursue opportunities  
with entrepreneurial flair. The  
centre is small and uses short  
lines of communication to ensure  
prompt, incisive and unambiguous 
decision-making. It seeks to  
ensure that business activities  
are appropriately monitored 
and supported.
Pages 12 to 45 Operating review
STRATEGY
The corporate centre agrees strategy 
and budgets with the businesses and 
monitors their performance closely.
The group balance sheet is managed 
to ensure long-term financial stability, 
regardless of the state of capital 
markets, and capital funding is made 
available to all of our businesses  
where returns meet or exceed clearly 
defined criteria. The centre provides 
selected services where the scale  
of its operations enables a more 
cost-effective or efficient delivery, 
where expertise that might not be 
available at a business level can  
be retained by the group, or where  
the provision of such services  
would otherwise distract business 
executives. Such services include 
investor relations, pensions, insurance, 
legal support, tax and treasury 
management, where specialist 
expertise is brought together in one 
place for the benefit of the group as  
a whole. The centre also co-ordinates 
selected value-added capabilities to 
support the businesses in their local 
markets such as talent management 
and development, procurement,  
and the sharing of best practice in,  
for example, health and safety or 
engineering risk management. We 
operate to high ethical standards as  
an organisation and expect the same  
of our employees. We encourage  
an open and honest culture in all our 
dealings and ensure that our core 
values are fully implemented 
throughout the group.
Pages 10 and 11 Business strategies
ORGANIC GROWTH
Organic growth is achieved through 
investment in marketing, in the 
development of existing and new 
products and technologies and  
in targeted capital expenditure  
to improve efficiency and  
expand capacity.
We are committed to innovation, the 
continuous pursuit of improvement  
and the maintenance of our efficient 
manufacturing capability.
We aim to operate in a sustainable, 
ethical, efficient and safe manner. 
We have a strong culture of continuing 
operational improvement and focus 
on delivering exceptional quality and 
customer service. The group takes a 
long-term approach to investment and 
is committed to increasing shareholder 
value through sound commercial, 
responsible and sustainable business 
decisions that deliver steady growth 
in earnings and dividends.
Acquisitions are made to complement 
existing business activities and to  
exploit opportunities in adjacent  
markets or geographies. Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015

BUSINESS STRATEGIES
Five business segments  
that bring together common 
industry expertise,

GROCERY
An enviable portfolio of leading  
food brands
Each of our Grocery businesses pursues 
an independent strategy, appropriate to  
its particular market position and stage  
of development. As examples, Jordans 
Ryvita is focused on developing its brands 
in its core markets, whilst AB World Foods 
has had considerable success extending 
its reach into new and emerging markets.
All of these businesses are committed  
to the consistent development of their 
brands, and consumer research is 
conducted locally and internationally to 
establish consumer needs and ensure 
appropriately targeted investment. Our 
production facilities are well maintained 
and we take a long-term approach to 
capital investment, recognising the merits 
of building for the future. Acquisitions  
are undertaken when opportunities are 
presented to either strengthen or 
complement existing businesses.

SUGAR
A world-leading sugar business

AGRICULTURE
Driving value for businesses along  
the food supply chain 
As a unique community of leading 
agricultural businesses, AB Agri’s goal 
is to improve the sustainability of food 
production. We work in partnership with 
customers to continually explore new 
ways of making agri-food production  
more efficient. AB Agri operates through 
individual, entrepreneurial businesses 
empowered to grow their interests 
independently, and through a strong 
network of contacts across the entire 
food supply chain. 
Organic growth is achieved through 
innovative product development and 
through extending the business’s  
already broad geographic reach into new 
territories. Using the diverse breadth 
of products, services and people within 
the AB Agri community, the business 
develops bespoke solutions tailored to  
its customers’ needs. Extending this into 
new geographies and into new areas that 
are adjacent to its core capabilities affords 
further growth opportunities. AB Agri will 
continue its successful strategy of seeking 
to make complementary acquisitions to 
strengthen its portfolio of businesses and 
its technical capability. It will also continue 
to collaborate with other businesses in 
the ABF group to harness new contacts 
and technologies.

RETAIL
Up-to-the-minute fashion  
at amazing prices
Primark offers great value for money 
which it achieves by: incurring no 
advertising costs, instead relying on its 
customers ‘doing the talking’ about its 
products; buying in vast quantities and 
passing on the cost savings to customers; 
keeping overheads to a minimum but 
investing in state-of-the-art logistics  
to enable its stores to replenish stocks 
quickly; and by not compromising  
its high-quality standards, rigorously  
testing products at the various stages  
of production.
In the world of fashion it is critical that 
once a style is seen on the fashion show 
catwalk it reaches the stores as quickly as 
possible. It can take as little as six weeks 
from initial design concept to being 
available on shelf, and merchandise is 
sourced from all corners of the globe. 
Although Primark does not own the 
companies or factories that produce  
its merchandise, it recognises its 
responsibility to the workers in those 
factories, and to its customers, to ensure 
that its products are made in good 
working conditions.

FROM TWININGS TEAS TO 
DORSET CEREALS – WE HAVE  
AN ENVIABLE PORTFOLIO  
OF LEADING FOOD BRANDS
Grocery operating profit increased  
by 5% at constant currency with 
Twinings Ovaltine and our US 
vegetable oils business well ahead  
of last year. Revenues were 3% lower, 
held back by commodity price 
deflation, leading to an increase  
in margin.
Twinings Ovaltine grew market share  
in a number of regions and generated a 
strong profit increase. In the UK, where 
the market for mainstream teas saw some 
contraction, Twinings’ sales of premium 
teas grew. Black tea packaging formats 
were relaunched, including a premium, 
loose-leaf, mesh teabag range, driving UK 
market share to an all-time high. Australia 
also had another successful year with the 
relaunch of the English Breakfast range 
supported by advertising and in-store 
promotion. Ovaltine sales in Thailand, one 
of its most important markets, were lower 
than last year on the back of economic 
weakness, although margins improved  
as less volume was sold on promotion. 
Growth was achieved in Ovaltine’s 
developing markets, particularly south 
east Asia and Nigeria. Strong factory 
performances across the business 
delivered lower manufacturing conversion 
costs, and overheads were also lower 
benefiting from cost reduction initiatives.

DORSET CEREALS
In October last year we acquired  
Dorset Cereals, a leading muesli  
brand in the UK that has generated 
significant market growth over the  
past ten years with a range of stylish 
packaging designs and recipes made 
with delicious natural ingredients like 
‘luscious berries & cherries muesli’.
The Dorset Cereals brand is a perfect  
fit for Jordans, Dorset & Ryvita (as the 
business is now known) given their 
expertise in creating cereals made  
from wholegrains; as well as their 
obvious association with the beautiful 
county of Dorset, which has been 
home to Ryvita since 1948. 
Dorset Cereals continues to be based  
at its home village of Poundbury in 
Dorset, and now benefits from the 
increased scale and cumulative 
expertise of the wider Jordans,  
Dorset & Ryvita business community. 
The acquisition has helped to create 
one of the most innovative and  
dynamic wholegrain cereal businesses 
in the UK that is perfectly positioned  
to benefit from long-term consumer 
trends towards more healthy, 
premium foods.

Sales volumes at Allied Bakeries increased 
over the financial year although the  
UK bread market continued to be very 
challenging and lower bread prices 
resulted in a reduction in profitability.  
The Kingsmill brand was relaunched in 
May with new packaging across the range. 
Following last year’s highly successful 
launch, revenues from Sandwich Thins 
continued to build and benefited from  
the addition of a wholemeal variant to the 
range. We completed our major capital 
investment programme during the year, 
introduced a variety of initiatives which 
reduced waste and further streamlined 
production, and delivered products of  
a consistently high quality throughout  
the year.
Silver Spoon substantially improved 
operational efficiency this year and 
achieved commercial success with 
increased volumes to the major UK 
retailers. In the home baking sector, 
Allinson maintained its position as  
the leading bread flour brand. Since  
its acquisition in October 2014, Dorset 
Cereals has traded ahead of our business 
plan and its integration with Jordans 
Ryvita went smoothly. The business 
gained market share and three products 
won 2015 Great Taste awards. Jordans 
continued to perform well, also gaining 
market share in the UK and launching  
very successfully in Australia. It also 
launched its Jordans Farm partnership  
in conjunction with LEAF (Linking 
Environment and Farming) and the Wildlife 
Trust ensuring improved sustainability  
and biodiversity on the farms of our oat 
suppliers. Ryvita had a more difficult  
year with lower crispbread sales in a 
competitive market. The introduction  
of a second sweet crispbread variety, 
Apple & Cinnamon, was well received and  
Ryvita Thins continued to grow strongly.
THE STRENGTH OF THE DON BRAND
The last few years have been challenging 
for the George Weston Foods meat 
business in Australia but in the last  
12 months the DON brand has achieved a 
substantial improvement in performance. 
A key element of the turnaround has 
been the development of strategies,  
in partnership with our key retailers,  
to optimise the deli and chilled cabinet 
fixtures in store. Sales growth and 
margin improvement have been delivered 
through a focus on quality, by increasing 
the range of products on offer, and by 
highlighting the brand’s key attributes.
The retail chiller aisle in Australian 
supermarkets is an area where 
prepacked smallgoods (ham, bacon, 
frankfurters, salami etc.) have historically 
underperformed against global 
benchmarks. Shopper research 
confirmed that the aisle was difficult  
to shop and the range lacked breadth, 
appeal and inspiration. As Australia’s 
best known and preferred smallgoods 
brand, DON took the lead in transforming 
the shopping experience. Strategies  
to drive increased volume included: 
redesigning the way products are 
presented on shelf; improving the value  
of everyday ham; creating a premium 
quality tier; expansion into new 
categories; and increasing marketing  
and media investment.
In pre-pack ham, where DON continues 
to be the market leader, we launched  
a ‘premium tier’ with the addition of  
a Smokehouse Deli Style product to  
the range. We also gave the consumer 
more choice by introducing a wider 
range of pack sizes. Category staples 
such as frankfurters were reinvigorated 
with improved pack formats, new beef 
varieties and innovation through DON 
Kransky Slims. The move to gas flushed 
packaging and shelf-ready shippers  
for bacon significantly improved  
DON’s presence on shelf as well as 
improving the overall appearance  
of the bacon category.
We have also taken the DON brand  
into new segments with a range of 
cooking ingredients, including diced 
bacon, ham and chorizo; and the launch  
of DONSKI salami sticks for anytime 
convenient snacking.
The results have seen a resurgence in 
DON brand awareness and increased 
consumer preference. DON smallgoods 
sales grew by 10% over the prior year 
with an increased retail market share, 
and there are more opportunities still  
to pursue. Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015

ENGAGING THE 
SENSES WITH 
OUR PREMIUM 
BLENDS
Twinings is about creating 
brands people love –  
winning hearts and minds  
by delivering inspiring  
tea experiences.
Central to our strategy is the continual 
refinement of our products and packs 
– developing teas and infusions that truly 
delight. In so doing, we are capitalising 
on an accelerating trend in consumer 
tastes across many markets, away  
from standard, traditional products 
towards more rewarding, premium 
brands and formats.
This year, both within the UK and 
internationally, Twinings launched new 
premium ranges of large leaf teas  
in transparent mesh bags, housed in 
striking and original packaging. Our 
master blenders have drawn on their 
expertise, and inspiration from their 
travels, to craft a range which engages 
the senses; beautiful, arresting teas  
and infusions, combined with uplifting 
aromas that create a taste adventure  
in every sip. 
We use all our skill and experience to 
conjure up wonderful worlds, telling 
stories about our teas that fire the 
imagination and leave people eager to 
explore further. We have successfully 
attracted tea consumers who are 
seeking something more fulfilling than 
their usual cup, and those inspired to  
try tea, perhaps, for the first time.
It’s part of how we redefine what tea  
can be, and as a result, inspire a new 
generation of tea drinkers.  Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015

EXPANDING THE LUNCH OCCASION
In response to market trends, 
Kingsmill extended its range in 
Sandwich Alternatives with the launch  
of Kingsmill ‘Sandwich Thins’ in 
September 2014. This is a light-textured, 
pre-sliced bakery product that offers 
consumers something different to  
liven up their lunch.
The Sandwich Thins sector is currently 
the fastest growing part of the bakery 
category, with sales growth of  
45% year-on-year. Already worth  
an impressive £65m per annum,  
the sector is expected to achieve  
significant further growth.
Kingsmill Sandwich Thins are  
produced at Allied Bakeries’ Glasgow 
bakery, following an investment in a 
completely new manufacturing facility. 
Three variants are currently available; 
White, Wholemeal and 50/50 –  
made from a blend of white and 
wholemeal flour.
Loyal Kingsmill shoppers were 
encouraged into this growing product 
area and, to support the product 
launch, a TV advertising campaign  
ran over January and February 2015. 
This proved successful in driving trial 
and repeat purchase and just nine 
months after launch, Kingsmill 
achieved a share of the Sandwich  
Thins sector of over 25%. 
The introduction of Kingsmill Sandwich 
Thins has also had a positive impact  
on the overall bakery market, helping 
retailers to stimulate interest in the 
category and adding value to the  
bakery aisle in store.

At AB World Foods, Patak’s and Blue 
Dragon maintained their positions as the 
leading Indian and Oriental ambient brands 
in the UK. An improved sales mix drove  
an overall margin increase and operating 
profit was ahead of last year. The business 
achieved further growth in its export 
markets with particular success for 
Patak’s in Australia and Canada. The UK 
ethnic restaurant and takeaway market 
has seen some improvement after several 
years of decline, with increased consumer 
expenditure on out-of-home eating. 
Westmill achieved margin improvement 
with its Chinese catering brands 
performing particularly well driven  
by strong commercial activity.
Revenue and operating profit at George 
Weston Foods in Australia were in line 
with last year. Tip Top bread volumes 
increased but margins fell as retailers 
featured bread in their drive for lower 
prices with heavy price promotion activity 
more than offsetting the benefits of cost 
reduction and productivity improvements 
across all bakery sites. Margins in the  
Don KRC meat business were affected  
by the high cost of bought-in raw materials 
in the first half, but improved substantially 
in the second driven by higher volumes, 
lower-cost raw materials and improved 
production efficiency. The management 
team remains focused on driving 
continued improvement in sales and 
factory performance.
At ACH in North America, Mazola 
achieved good volume growth following 
increased investment in advertising  
and marketing which highlighted the 
cholesterol-lowering benefits of corn oil.  
A better sales mix saw margins improve  
in the Flavours business, and Foodservice 
continued its steady growth driven by  
an improved economic climate.
LUCKY BOAT NOODLES
Westmill Foods is a specialist food 
company, serving the chefs and 
owners of Chinese and Indian 
restaurants and takeaways, as well  
as a diverse range of Indian, Pakistani, 
Bangladeshi, Chinese, African and 
Caribbean consumers.
One of its leading brands is Lucky 
Boat, a wheat noodle used by Chinese 
chefs and noodle bars. Lucky Boat 
sales have grown each year since  
2007 and it is now the UK’s number  
one noodle with a brand share of 64% 
within the Chinese restaurant market. 
Over this period Westmill has made  
a considerable investment in its 
manufacturing site in Manchester,  
to improve product quality, production 
efficiency and capacity, ensuring  
that Lucky Boat delivers consistency  
for chefs. Working with Chinese 
customers and chefs alike, Westmill 
has demonstrated that because they 
are easier to prepare and cook, there  
are considerable savings to be made 
by using Lucky Boat noodles. This has 
made the brand particularly popular 
with noodle bars where there is less 
time to prepare dishes.
Westmill now has a dedicated team 
working in communities with restaurant 
and takeaway owners to help develop 
new recipes and to market their 
businesses at a local level. CEMENTING OUR

About Sugar: AB Sugar is a leading 
business in the expanding international 
markets for sugar and sugar-derived 
co-products.
In the EU, Azucarera is the major  
producer in Iberia and British Sugar is  
the sole processor of the UK sugar beet 
crop and is one of Europe’s most efficient 
processors. Illovo Sugar, in which the 
group has a 51% stake, is the largest  
sugar processor in Africa and is one of  
the world’s foremost low-cost producers. 
We also have substantial businesses  
in China producing cane sugar in the  
south and beet sugar in the north-east. 
The group currently operates in ten 
countries and has 29 plants with the 
capacity to produce over 5 million 
tonnes of sugar and 600 million litres  
of ethanol annually.
We also have the capacity to generate 
power sufficient to meet most of  
our internal needs and, in a number  
of locations, we export power into  
the local grid.
As a consumer of a large quantity of 
agricultural inputs, we have a number  
of programmes to maximise crop  
yields whilst also minimising the usage  
of herbicides, pesticides and water.  
This applies equally to our out-grower 
estates, funded jointly with our growers, 
as well as our own farms. We seek to 
ensure the early transfer of technology 
and best practice across AB Sugar. 
We are a significant employer in each 
of our countries of operation, some of 
which are among the least developed 
in the world. AB Sugar seeks to ensure 
the wellbeing of all its employees, their 
families and the wider community and 
in the developing countries we provide 
more wide-ranging social support 
including the provision of hospitals, 
schooling, housing and healthy  
living programmes. Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015

THE CHANGING WORLD OF SUGAR
2006 REFORM – THE START  
OF THE PROCESS
The first round of changes moved 
the EU sugar market from surplus to 
structural deficit with the aim of providing 
increased access for exports from the 
world’s least developed countries (LDCs) 
and the Africa, Caribbean and Pacific 
(ACP) countries associated with the 
EU. By reducing support prices for both 
sugar and sugar beet, the changes also 
sought to increase competition amongst 
EU producers. To facilitate the process, 
a self-financing restructuring scheme  
was introduced to encourage high cost 
businesses to rationalise and to reduce 
surplus capacity. When the structural 
changes were complete, however, the 
EU market experienced major price shifts 
the like of which had not been anticipated. 
First, the reduction in EU production and 
exports reduced sugar availability on a 
global scale as non-EU countries were 
unable to increase production to fill the 
gap. World prices subsequently rose to 
30-year highs reducing the attractiveness 
of sales to the EU and hence, supplies 
for the EU market. The Commission  
then applied exceptional measures in  
an attempt to fill the EU supply deficit  
and check price increases.
However, the level of bids for additional 
supplies meant that EU prices did not 
reduce as much as expected. As a result, 
the exceptional measures were extended 
even when supplies had been restored

European Farm Ministers  
have agreed to the final 
abolition of the system of EU 
sugar production quotas from 
1 October 2017 and many 
commentators have described 
the situation that will likely 
prevail thereafter. The 
consequences of these 
changes can, to some extent, 
be informed by what happened 
during the last round of 
regulatory changes. 55% 45%

to more normal levels, then resulting  
in over-supply in the EU. Following four  
years of global surpluses coupled, more 
recently, with the dramatic weakening  
of the Brazilian real against the US dollar, 
world sugar prices weakened substantially 
and EU sugar prices plummeted to the 
levels that we see today.
All suppliers to the European market have 
been affected by these changes including 
beet growers, processors, preferential 
exporting countries and refiners. Across 
the industry substantial restructuring  
and investment programmes have been 
implemented to improve efficiency  
and meet these challenges.
So what then of the 2017 changes?
AFTER 2017 – ‘A SUBSTANTIALLY 
DEREGULATED SECTOR’
The final round of changes to the 
EU sugar regime in 2017 will abandon 
production quotas, remove minimum 
beet prices and abolish the artificial 
distinction between sugar sold for food  
and industrial applications in the EU. 
Furthermore, World Trade Organization 
(WTO) export constraints will no longer 
be applicable to European producers 
following the abolition of quotas.
In short, the EU sugar market will become 
more volatile. However, it should be noted  
that WTO-governed import duties for 
non-preferential sugars into the EU 
will remain in place. Sugar companies  
will be free to increase production, and  
so too will starch producers be able to 
increase production of caloric sweeteners, 
further increasing EU supplies.
When world market prices are high,  
EU sugar can be exported and when  
low, supply will exceed demand. As a 
consequence, sugar prices in the EU are 
likely to move more in line with world 
prices than has previously been the case.
In such a dynamic market, increased 
pressure will be placed on the 
competitiveness of the total EU sugar 
supply chain. Growers, processors, 
haulage companies and other key 
stakeholders will need to ensure the 
competitiveness of their component 
offerings in order to maintain the ability 
of the sugar industry as a whole 
to compete.

2 China 12% 
3 Spain 16% 
4 UK 34%
In such a scenario a number of key 
features are likely:
Beet sugar processors
• suppliers to the European market 
will need to further improve their 
efficiency and competitiveness. 
This will include energy efficiency, 
process technology and co-product 
development. Well-targeted and 
effective investments will be key;
• with inflation in other major world 
market suppliers outstripping that  
in the EU, we have already seen EU  
beet sugar producers improve their 
position in world league tables for  
cost of production. With the exception  
of distortions generated by movements 
in currency exchange rates, such as 
we are currently seeing between 
the Brazilian real and the US dollar,  
it is anticipated that this trend will 
be maintained;
Beet growers
• continuing growth in beet sugar 
productivity will be essential to 
support these changes. This has 
already led to EU white sugar yields, 
expressed on a per-hectare basis, 
exceeding those of Brazil;
• the relative profitability of alternative 
crops will become even more of a 
key determinant of production scale 
in the EU, as growers look to 
maximise total farm profitability;
Raw sugar refiners
• EU refiners may need to take a more 
opportunistic view of refining, for 
example, by focusing on periods 
where world sugar prices are 
sufficiently below EU prices to 
generate attractive returns; and
Global trade
• global trade flows will adjust to 
accommodate EU exports and sales 
into regions outside Europe, some 
of which may be new markets.
The above analysis leads us to expect  
that the EU will experience significant 
turbulence through the years of transition, 
during which we will likely see some 
further consolidation of the industry.  
We believe that, with continued emphasis 
on total supply chain efficiency, and access 
to global markets, the long-term future  
for the EU sugar industry, and the UK 
industry in particular, can remain strong.

A WORLD-LEADING  
SUGAR BUSINESS FOCUSED 
ON EXCELLENCE
Revenue and adjusted operating profit 
for AB Sugar were substantially lower 
than the previous year primarily driven 
by the further decline in EU sugar 
prices, and the underlying decline  
in profit was even greater given the 
non-repeat of last year’s restructuring 
charge. In light of the structural 
changes in the world’s sugar industry, 
we remained focused on delivering 
significant cost reduction across  
all of our businesses through our 
ongoing performance improvement 
programme. This will reduce our cost 
base but the reductions in the year 
could not compensate for the impact  
of lower prices.
Sugar prices in the EU stabilised towards 
the end of the financial year and with 
quota stock levels expected to reduce 
back towards historic norms during 
2015/16, we have seen some price 
recovery for the 2015/16 marketing year. 
Prices in China increased during the year  
as a consequence of lower domestic 
production and reduced imports, although 
they remain at a premium to import prices. 
World sugar prices remained under 
pressure declining to below 11.0 cents  
per pound at one point, thereby holding 
back domestic prices in some regions.
UK sugar production of 1.45 million tonnes 
was driven by very high beet yields and 
excellent factory performances. The UK 
crop for the 2015/16 season has made 
good progress but, with a reduction  
for that year in the contracted area  
under cultivation in excess of 25%, and  
a return to more typical beet yields, sugar 
production is expected to be just short  
of 1.0 million tonnes. This will lead to a 
welcome fall in our stock levels following 
this year’s high sugar production. 
SUGAR
AZUCARERA
Historically, sugar produced by our 
factories in Spain has been stored  
in factory silos and transported as 
required to customers’ plants via road 
tanker. Although this transportation 
complies with strict food and safety 
regulations, some customers 
increasingly require a further level  
of compliance such as product 
exclusivity, meaning that a tanker 
cannot transport anything other than 
sugar. This can result in a costly 
challenge for manufacturers as it 
means that tankers cannot be used on 
return trips. It also adds considerable 
complexity to supply chain logistics, 
particularly where customers are  
some distance from our factories or  
are close to competitors. A flexible 
approach is therefore vital. 
During sugar beet production, 
Azucarera, our Iberian sugar business, 
now uses big-bag packaging as  
well as tankers to transport sugar. 
Many of these big-bags are stored  
in warehouses local to customers  
and once an order is received, the bags 
are ‘ripped and tipped’ into a tanker for 
the short journey from the distribution 
point to the customer’s final destination. 
By storing and transporting sugar  
in this way, Azucarera has improved  
order fulfilment and delivery times,  
as well as creating logistics savings. 
Compared to typical tanker haulage, 
this approach can reduce costs by  
as much as 40%.

Delivered beet costs for the 2015/16 
campaign will be some 20% lower than 
the current year with a further substantial 
cost reduction now secured for the 
2016/17 campaign.
In Spain, all factories performed well.  
Total production was ahead of last year at 
709,000 tonnes of which 414,000 tonnes 
was from beet and 295,000 tonnes  
from refined raw sugars. The area under 
cultivation for 2015/16 is expected to be 
similar to this year.
Illovo produced 1.64 million tonnes in the 
year to September, marginally less than 
last year. The effect of drought on cane 
growth in South Africa was largely offset 
by strong production volumes across  
all other countries of operation. Zambia 
achieved record sugar production and 
further development at the factory is  
now planned which will increase sugar 
refining capacity and create new sugar 
conditioning and storage facilities to 
enable the supply of higher-quality  
sugars to the region. The Malawi sugar 
market has been seriously disrupted  
by the country’s continued economic 
difficulties and sales volumes and prices 
were lower as a result. In Tanzania,  
sugar production increased with the 
benefit of better growing conditions  
and an improved factory performance. 
Some improvement in the local trading 
conditions enabled an increase in 
domestic pricing and an improved  
sales mix, with pre-packed sugar taking  
an increasing share of the domestic 
market. Illovo continued its focus on the 
development of domestic and regional 
sales, which have become increasingly 
important as world and EU prices  
become less attractive.
Recognising an opportunity  
to establish a partnership 
with one of the largest organic 
vegetable growers in the US, 
Germains set about creating  
a new product for organic 
Swiss chard using an approach 
that disinfected various  
seed-borne diseases leading 
to a better yielding crop.
Already established as one of the world’s 
leading seed technology suppliers, 
Germains realised that it could also 
support key growers in developing 
enhanced sustainable products for the 
expanding organic vegetable market 
(currently growing at over 20% pa). This 
had the merits of improving its product 
differentiation and extending its expertise 
in research and development to become 
more technically-based and 
consumer-solution orientated.
Collaboration with an existing client, one 
of the largest organic growers in the US, 
led to a deeper understanding of the key 
challenge – primarily that the pathogen 
problems associated with seeds during  
a short growth cycle put the crop at risk. 
Joint research led to a review of protocols 
and techniques for removing disease  
from seeds in an economically viable and 
large-scale way. Germains’ knowledge 
and experience of successful 
manufacturing processes in their sugar 
beet business unit, coupled with their 
knowledge of seed disinfection in key 
horticultural markets, resulted in a similar 
approach for organic Swiss chard.
Following successful field trials and 
modest additional capital investment, 
Germains utilised existing manufacturing 
assets to deliver all of its client’s 
requirements for that planting season.  
The process from the initial client meeting 
to placing an order took just six months.
By putting the customer at the heart of 
their business, Germains has created a 
partnership based on mutual trust which 
has resulted in both crop and commercial 
success. It has also cemented Germains’ 
reputation as an innovator, leading the agri 
industry in large-volume, organic solutions 
and new product development.
CEMENTING OUR REPUTATION FOR 
INNOVATION AND BETTER YIELDS Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015

We have now commenced the relocation 
of most of our management team from 
the head office in Beijing to our remaining  
operating sites.
Vivergo Fuels
This business was formed in 2007 as  
a joint venture between ABF, BP and 
DuPont, which built a world-scale, 
wheat-fed, bioethanol plant at Saltend  
in Hull. In May, we assumed BP’s share  
in the business thereby increasing  
our interest to 94%. In recent years the 
European market for bioethanol has been 
weaker than expected and we foresee 
that we may need to run this plant at a 
small loss in the short term. However,  
as the percentage of ethanol inclusion  
in gasoline increases in line with EU 
mandated targets by 2020, this market  
is forecast to move from surplus to  
deficit which we expect to lead to a  
price increase. Further operational 
improvements were made at Vivergo 
Fuels this year but continuing low prices 
resulted in the business sustaining an 
operating loss.
China saw some recovery in market  
prices and profitability improved as a 
result. In the south, cane volumes were 
some 30% below the previous year due  
to a combination of a lower planted area 
and poorer yields due to adverse weather 
conditions. Sugar production reduced 
from 560,000 tonnes to 413,000 tonnes  
in the year, benefiting from good factory 
extraction rates. The campaigns at  
our remaining northern beet factories,  
Qianqi and Zhangbei, were excellent  
with good factory throughput and better 
beet availability following our success in 
working with the growers over a number  
of years. Together, these two factories 
produced 94,000 tonnes of sugar  
in 2014/15.
In January, we announced our decision  
to cease sugar operations in Heilongjiang. 
Achieving beet yields sufficient to provide 
our factories in this region with an adequate 
supply of raw materials, at a competitive 
cost, has been particularly challenging for 
a number of years, even with the benefit 
of significant advances made both in 
agricultural and factory operations. We 
concluded that our factories at Yi’an and 
BoCheng were likely to remain uneconomic 
for the foreseeable future. We have now 
sold both factories and the final cost of 
ceasing these operations was £100m  
all of which was a non-cash charge.

SUGAR
ILLOVO-KILOMBERO SUGAR
Kilombero Sugar, Illovo’s business in 
Tanzania, is re-launching its pre-packed 
sugar proposition to provide better 
alignment with local consumer needs. 
After investing in local market research 
to understand the preferences and 
shopping habits of Tanzanian consumers, 
the business has expanded its Bwana 
Sukari (which means ‘Mr Sugar’ in  
the Kiswahili language) range. This now 
includes 1kg and 500g pre-packed sugar 
in improved packaging that reflects the 
brand proposition more appropriately  
and highlights the local sourcing and 
proud heritage that are so important  
to local consumers.
In a market that has historically been 
dominated by bulk 50kg and 25kg bags 
that are then on-sold in scoop format  
in a traditional and fragmented retail 
marketplace, this pre-packed offering 
provides an affordable, hygienic and 
guaranteed pack weight solution that 
meets the needs of local, cash-poor 
consumers. All packaging and point  
of sale communication will be updated 
from English to Kiswahili and the 
domestic market sales team are  
working with local distribution partners  
to expand the availability across the  
retail marketplace. 
With the importance of domestic 
markets to the Illovo business, this  
kind of insight-led product development  
is shaping the marketing plans across  
the group, with research work now  
also underway in Malawi and Zambia. 
China’s urbanisation policy is 
driving demographic change, 
and rural migration is 
changing the agricultural 
landscape. Both are creating 
opportunities for land 
consolidation and  
production efficiency.
Now celebrating its 20th anniversary  
in the region, AB Sugar China embraces 
these changes and new ways of working 
which are reflected in the annual plan for 
its north China operations.
This plan has three strategic objectives 
that firmly put growers at the centre  
of our business. The first, to ensure 
sustainable beet supply, helps  
growers increase their crop yield and 
profitability. Growers are provided with 
mechanised solutions appropriate to their 
requirements, and levels of service and 
support have been enhanced, thereby 
improving the crop attractiveness and thus 
supply stability. The second objective, to 
drive cost efficiency, is aimed at improving 
upstream supply chain efficiencies and 
reducing the cost of sucrose delivered  
to the factory. With greater insight into  
the capabilities of the grower base and  
the quality of their land we are able to 
prioritise geographic areas that deliver the 
highest-quality sugar beet at the lowest 
cost. The third objective is to increase beet 
quality by enhancing sugar content and 
reducing impurities. This is achieved,  
for example, through R&D investment in 
seed development, and the management  
of water and fertiliser. 
One of AB Sugar China’s agricultural 
priorities is to extend grower engagement  
in order to develop closer links with  
the upstream agricultural industry and 
establish long-lasting relationships with

the most progressive growers. A major 
success has been working with a diverse 
group of growers, collectively identifying 
problems and developing solutions  
based on partnership, and the sharing  
of knowledge and good practice. 
Value-added services, such as enhanced 
communications, have been introduced to 
support engagement with large growers. 
A mobile phone application that sends 
daily updates to growers on real-time 
pertinent topics, and enables interactivity 
between growers and experts, helps 
growers improve crop productivity.  
Loyalty schemes, incentive programmes 
and training also play a central role in 
maintaining a contented grower base 
which, in turn, contributes towards  
a stable and sustainable beet supply. 
Early indications are that AB Sugar’s  
north China operations will increase the 
crop planting area in 2015/16 by more  
than 30%, reversing two years of crop 
area regression. This will be a direct result 
of embracing a grower-centric business 
strategy, adopting a customer orientated 
mindset when working with growers  
and developing the supply chain for 
mutual benefit.

GROWTH THROUGH 
COLLABORATION 
AB AGRI CHINA
AB Agri in China is playing a significant 
part in improving the safety and 
efficiency of meat production  
in the country by supplying safe, 
high-performance animal nutrition  
and services to feed producers, 
livestock farms and food processors. 
Feed and food safety, and commodity 
cost management are currently  
the subject of much focus in China  
and represent a key challenge to the 
livestock industry. These are no different 
to the challenges faced by livestock 
producers globally, but the step changes 
in how food is produced i.e. away from 
small farm holdings, are bringing a unique 
set of challenges and opportunities to  
all businesses that operate within the 
food supply chain in China. 
Since our first investment in China  
in 1996 our vision and ambition has 
been to build a Chinese business that 
benefits Chinese people by leading 
improvements in food safety  
and efficiency.
A constant element of this approach 
has been to invest in local people and, 
through consistent training and a wide 
range of support mechanisms, ensure 
that the business is founded on loyalty 
and highly responsible technology  
and practices.
AB Agri China has an enviable record  
of staff loyalty, the majority of the 
General Managers having been with 
the business for more than ten years. 
This is significant because it underpins 
the building of key relationships and 
trust which provides a strong platform 
to facilitate effective and relevant 
knowledge transfer. It gives us the 
opportunity to take western learnings 
and technologies and adapt and  
apply them into the local market.  
By opening up dialogue and building 
trust a consistent pipeline of 
improvement practices have been,  
and continue to be, channelled into  
the fast-changing China food industry. 
This is the foundation of AB Agri 
China’s success – well trained local 
people who are close to, and have  
a good understanding of, their  
market but who also have access to 
world-class nutrition and management 
practices via established links into  
the wider AB Agri network.  Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015

AB Agri had another record year  
with strong performances across all 
businesses. Adjusted operating profit 
was 18% ahead of last year at constant 
currency but revenues were 8% lower 
than last year as a result of softer 
commodity prices. Importantly, cash 
margins in the UK feed business  
were maintained.
UK feed volumes held up well despite 
continued pressure on the UK dairy sector 
where AB Connect’s range of ruminant 
feed products offered a cost-effective way 
of maintaining or improving milk yields  
and quality. It was a year of recovering 
volumes in the poultry sector following  
a difficult period, whilst in the pig sector, 
feed volumes were slightly ahead of last 
year. Market concerns remain over the 
relative cost of British pork compared with 
euro-denominated imports, but consumers 
have continued to support British produce. 
In Speciality Nutrition, the recent expansion 
DRIVING VALUE FOR  
BUSINESSES ALONG THE  
FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN
and modernisation of the UK premix plant 
at Rugeley enabled the business to meet 
higher domestic demand and this year  
has also seen the further extension of its 
European operations into the strategically 
important Spanish swine market. 
In response to the UK government’s 
commitment to reducing the country’s 
greenhouse gas emissions, AB Agri  
has now gained accreditation for its 
energy management system which  
has been deployed across all of its UK 
manufacturing sites and major offices. 
This will result in better measurement  
and management of energy use in the 
business and will increasingly inform  
its strategic investment decisions.
Frontier Agriculture, our joint venture 
arable operation, celebrated its 10th 
anniversary this year. Formed in April 
2005, the business has since doubled in 
size and now serves 10,000 customers. 
Over this decade the income from the 
supply of crop inputs such as fertilisers, 
seeds and agronomy services has grown 
significantly and now exceeds that from  
its original grain marketing business.  
This year, the business traded at similar 
levels to last year with added complexity  
in its grain trading operations, and lower 
than normal protein levels in domestic 
wheat which increased the demand  
for quality wheat imports.
AB Agri China delivered a strong result 
driven by good procurement and a 
favourable product mix. The new feed 
mills are performing well with Zhenlai 
delivering substantial cost savings to its 
major customer and Rudong, which was 
built to supply feed exclusively to a major 
international processor, already 
performing to plan. 
AB Vista, our international feed ingredients 
business, continued to deliver strong 
growth in both sales and profit, driven by 
further success for Quantum Blue which 
achieved significant market share gains  
in the phytase market. Encouragingly,  
we see further growth opportunities in 
new applications and geographies where 
AB Vista currently has a lower presence, 
and planned expansion of AB Enzyme’s 
fermentation plant in Finland will ensure 
supply can match our growth expectations.

THE FIRST AGRICULTURE 
ACCREDITED CARBON MODEL  
AB SUSTAIN
In the early 2000s a growing awareness 
of the impact that carbon emissions 
were having on climate change led to a 
spotlight on agriculture and, in particular, 
methane emissions from animals and 
nitrous oxide emissions from fertiliser.  
At this time, little was known about 
carbon emissions in agriculture and no 
large-scale or practical models existed  
to capture data and insights. 
Insight from AB Agri’s on-farm data 
capture and improvement programmes 
provided an opportunity for the business 
to lead the way in this emerging 
landscape. Recognising that a scalable 
model which measured greenhouse 
gases could be an attractive proposition, 
both for retailers and brand owners, an 
outline concept was presented to Dairy 
Crest in 2006 who in turn shared the  
idea with one of their largest retail milk 
customers – Sainsbury’s. Their positive 
response inspired the business to turn 
this concept into reality. 
With no blueprint from which to operate 
and with limited information from factory 
carbon processes, AB Agri brought 
together a team with expertise in farm 
metrics, agricultural management 
systems, data modelling and nutrition. 
Information about the levels of carbon 
dioxide emitted by the growing of  
most crops and their manufacture into 
feedstuffs, or about the levels of methane 
emitted by different species or breeds  
of animal and variations attributable to 
size, age and diet, was either very limited, 
incomplete or non-existent. Nor was  
there any guidance on how to develop a 
methodology to create calculations where 
none existed. Using the team’s agri-science 
expertise, methodologies, calculations and 
formulae were systematically designed and 
built for each missing element to create  
a workable model. This included a unique 
methane equation which made the model 
the most advanced and accurate of its  
kind in the world. 
Imperial College London and the  
Carbon Trust, were engaged to provide 
independent validation of the model 
which, today, would be routine but then 
there was no relevant certification 
standard. AB Agri was invited to join  
a UK cross-sector working group to 
create such a standard. The result was 
PAS2050 which provides a consistent, 
internationally applicable, method for 
quantifying product carbon footprints. 
The AB Agri models are the only ones  
in agriculture to receive PAS2050 Tier 3 
certification (the highest available). 
In 2009, Sainsbury’s, having recognised 
the potential contribution that on-farm 
data collection and benchmarking could 
make to improve their supply chains, 
contracted with AB Agri exclusively to go 
beyond dairy and build carbon models for 
their other UK farm categories. In 2010,  
a three-year contract was agreed to 
include beef, lamb, pork, egg and broiler 
farms. This was extended to include 
other UK-based agri-food producer 
groups and today we are providing more 
than 2,000 UK farm carbon assessments 
a year. We also undertake a range of 
ad-hoc agri supply chain data/information 
consultancy projects and have gone 
beyond UK shores with carbon modelling 
of more than 100 New Zealand sheep 
farms and the measurement of 
Sainsbury’s Maldivian tuna supply chain. VFA

‘MAKING LIGHT WORK’  
AUNIR: HANDHELD NIR
Aunir is our globally recognised, independent, near infrared 
reflectance (NIR) calibration development and delivery 
business. It delivers NIR analysis for customers internationally 
through the use of Ingot – the biggest NIR calibration 
database in the world.
With over 30 years’ experience, Aunir is totally focused  
on NIR spectroscopy. It sits at the centre of the NIR industry  
and works with all major NIR platforms. Its software packages 
are used in a wide range of markets where organic materials 
need to be measured and controlled, such as animal feed 
and ingredients, forages, cotton production, sugar 
production, and plant breeding.
The business started life as an integral part of our UK feed 
business and the majority of users were laboratory-based 
quality control departments of feed manufacturing sites.  
In 2011, the Aunir team worked closely with our emerging 
micro ingredients business, AB Vista, as well as the  
AB Agri strategy team to conduct an in-depth review  
of the business including:
• its historical roots and its position in the market;
• its core strengths;
• where it created real value for customers;
• the direction of travel of the world of NIR, its hot prospects 
and where it should be targeting its efforts; and
• the identification of opportunities to develop new products, 
services or delivery methods, and/or enter new markets.
One of several key trends identified was a move towards 
miniaturisation – the software being operated on smaller, 
more portable machines. In line with its strategy of 
‘delivering world-class calibrations via multiple channels 
within its chosen industries’ Aunir has forged strategic 
partnerships with a number of companies developing micro 
NIR hardware to provide gold-standard Ingot calibrations  
on portable NIR platforms.
Aunir’s reputation as a leader in the application of NIR 
solutions within agricultural supply chains means that a 
number of businesses are keen to partner with them. One 
example is JDSU who first introduced themselves to Aunir  
in 2011. A legal framework was put in place to allow for an 
open dialogue and sharing of knowledge. The combination of 
their technology advances and Aunir’s expertise in calibration 
development represented an opportunity for a step change  
in NIR analysis. Continued investment and learning 
highlighted the commercial value of the offering and  
a full-time team was established.
The subsequent journey was typical of boundary-pushing 
technologies: developing prototypes, testing, sourcing 
components, redesigning products, and yet more testing.  
In April 2015, NIR4 Farm was formally launched into the  
UK and Ireland dairy market, providing a unique hand-held, 
real-time-result delivery device for farmers and their advisors 
to predict accurately the nutritional content of forage on farm, 
at an accessible price. Following an overwhelming amount  
of interest for the technology to be applied to other industries, 
work is already underway to expand into new applications 
and new geographies.

Since 2005, when ABF began developing 
its then recently acquired AB Mauri 
business, it has sought to expand the 
geographies in which the business 
operates and to focus on the particular 
needs of each market. One such was 
Mexico and management resources were 
committed to the country to research the 
market and begin the process of building  
a broader-based, commercial operation.
The relevance of the Mexican yeast 
market and the competitiveness of the 
country as an export platform were very 
evident and, in December 2010, capital 
investment was approved to build a new 
yeast production facility. Commissioning 
of the plant took place just over two years 
later in early 2013.
This new Mexican plant was located  
in Veracruz where raw materials are 
abundant and proximity to the Gulf of 
Mexico and the country’s capital made  
it the perfect gateway to all major local  
and export markets.
By establishing a material interest in the 
country, the business was able to achieve 
greater market penetration with distributors 
and customers alike. This has led to not 
only an increased market share, but also  
a more profound understanding of the  
local bakery industry, and craft bakers in 
particular. There are some 30,000 craft 
bakers in Mexico – small businesses that 
support 80% of all bread consumed in  
the country but, over the years, these 
businesses have lost their competitive 
edge to a more aggressive and cash-rich 
bread and food service industry. 
AB Mauri identified a number of ways  
in which the business models and 
competitiveness of craft bakers could  
be improved and a project was conceived 
to work with a small number of these 
artisanal bakers to re-engineer their 
business models and improve their 
profitability. The project was named  
El Faro (The Lighthouse) to convey the 
message that it was designed to shine a 
light on just how much could be achieved 
and to show the way forward to other  
craft bakers across the country. 
During 2014 and 2015 AB Mauri has 
invested $1m, working alongside 15 craft 
bakery owners and in conjunction with  
La Salle University, to perfect a craft 
bakery business model and to develop  
a range of education and training 
programmes for professional and home 
bakers. La Salle University is located  
on the outskirts of Mexico City where  
it provides elementary and entry level 
education to lower income populations. 
AB Mauri and La Salle shared the cost  
and manpower required to set up and run 
a bakery school at the university campus 
and engaged a team of more than 250 
professional bakers, technicians from  
our distributors and home bakers to 
support the programme. 
By enhancing the craft bakers’ business 
model, AB Mauri and La Salle are 
underpinning the sustainability of the craft 
baking industry; by providing vision and 
practical knowhow AB Mauri is quickly 
establishing itself as the baker’s partner; 
and by providing vocational education, 
subsistence bakers are being turned into 
thriving entrepreneurial businesses. The 
bakery school also serves as an in-country 
product development laboratory, providing 
AB Mauri with opportunities to develop  
its product range. It is hoped that this 
initiative will not only revitalise the craft 
baking industry in Mexico but it will also 
build brand equity for the AB Mauri 
business and its Fleischmann brand. 
Historically Mexico has been 
a dry yeast export market  
for AB Mauri North America, 
reached through one or  
two local distributors. The 
business was quite limited 
because Mexico was,  
and still is, predominantly  
a fresh yeast market and  
local yeast producers were 
well established.

Ingredients’ revenues were 3% ahead 
of last year at constant currency  
and for the second successive year  
the increase in operating profit was 
substantial, driven by stronger  
trading across all businesses and  
a focus on overhead reduction.  
As a consequence, margin was  
much improved.
AB Mauri, our bakery ingredients and 
yeast business delivered a second year  
of significant profit recovery in a market 
that remains very challenging. This was 
driven by its operations in the US and 
Canada and, despite difficult economic 
conditions, Brazil and HispanoAmerica 
also made good progress. We were the 
first to launch a successful liquid yeast 
product in Argentina, re-enforcing our 
technical and market leadership position  
in this region. Cost reduction and 
improved plant utilisation resulted in  
a better operating result from our facility  
at Veracruz in Mexico which is now 
exporting high-quality yeast products to 
customers in 34 countries. Our newly 
integrated milling and bakery ingredients

LEADING-EDGE  
BIOTECH SOLUTIONS
Behind the success of AB Vista and 
AB Enzymes is the leading-edge 
biotechnology of our Roal joint venture 
in Finland. Across these businesses, 
we develop, produce and market 
industrial enzymes derived from highly 
developed microbial cell factories.  
AB Enzymes and AB Vista both  
market and distribute the joint  
venture’s products.
Trichoderma reesei, originally isolated 
for production of cellulose breaking 
enzymes, has been developed over 
decades to produce virtually any 
enzyme at low cost and with high 
quality. Roal’s proprietary strain 
collection of superior cell lineages  
is one of the key assets of our  
enzyme business, which has hugely 
benefited AB Enzymes and AB Vista  
as distributors. 
Development of these technological 
platforms involves modern molecular 
biology, process engineering and 
application research. Operating from 
a modern, well-invested facility, the 
team of world-class scientists have  
a track record of keeping ahead of  
the competition with a continuous  
flow of innovative products that  
have consistently improved yields.  
The co-operation between research, 
manufacturing, marketing and 
distribution allows the production  
of tailored enzyme products to  
meet customer needs.
The business has provided enabling 
technology, not only for AB Vista’s 
Quantum Blue, but for other feed 
enzymes and for the flagship molecules 
distributed by our detergent, pulp & 
paper and textile enzyme businesses.
AB MAURI NORTH AMERICA 
BAKINGHUB
™
AB Mauri North America recently 
unveiled a new, state-of-the-art 
bakingHUB
™
 in St. Louis, Missouri,  
to enhance business operations and 
provide better support to its customers 
across the baking industry. 
Located within a new regional head 
office, the bakingHUB
™
 stands as  
a leading research space in an 
immersive, creative district called the 
Cortex Innovation Community with 
neighbours include Boeing, Purina, 
Washington University and Cambridge 
Innovation Center, among others. 
Access to a large pool of innovative 
thinkers, outside the core baking 
business, is a key benefit provided  
by this new facility.
The 5,000 sq ft bakingHUB
™
 includes a 
pilot fermentation laboratory making it 
the perfect environment for AB Mauri’s 
food scientists to develop better yeast 
and baking ingredient solutions and to 
create a wide range of finished baked 
goods for trial and testing purposes. 
The facility is capable of producing  
pan breads, artisan baguettes, various 
sweet goods, pizza, flour and corn 
tortillas, doughnuts, bagels and more.
achieved volume growth and a good  
result despite a difficult market with 
competitor price pressure.
The successful integration of our  
recently acquired European bakery 
ingredients business has broadened our 
product offering, strengthened our market 
position and delivered significant cost 
synergies. The UK business introduced  
a gluten-free bread and cake range of 
bakery ingredients, developed to meet  
the rising demand for such products,  
as well as a range of natural-based  
cereal fermentation products, suitable  
for application in all bread types, which 
help to deliver flavour and texture to  
the product. 
AB Mauri’s smaller, speciality yeast 
business which operates in non-bakery 
markets achieved significant growth. 
Good progress was made in Europe 
where our attractive product portfolio and 
capability in ethanol process optimisation 
are increasingly being recognised in the 
market. In the alcoholic beverages market, 
we maintained our status as a leading 
supplier of distillers’ yeast to the UK’s 
whisky industry and grew sales in the 
wine sector with new product launches 
and expansion into new geographies.
ABF Ingredients delivered excellent 
growth in sales and operating profit  
with all businesses making progress.  
This was a highly successful year for 
enzymes driven by continued growth  
in feed enzymes, which are distributed  
by AB Agri, a number of successful new 
product introductions in the baking and  
pulp & paper sectors, and increased 
market penetration in detergents.  
The preparatory work to expand the 
enzymes factory in Finland is now  
well under way.
Yeast extracts and speciality powders 
advanced with a focus on higher value 
products and improved plant utilisation. 
Further development of our extrusion  
and granulation operations in North 
America saw the speciality cereals 
business achieve growth in its animal  
feed and health bar markets. Our 
speciality lipids business progressed  
well, particularly in health and nutrition  
and personal care applications. Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015

About Retail: Primark is one of the 
largest clothing retailers in Europe. It 
has 293 stores and employs 61,000 
people in the UK, Republic of Ireland, 
Spain, Portugal, Germany, the 
Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, France 
and the USA. It was founded in June 
1969 in the Republic of Ireland where 
it continues to trade as Penneys.
Primark’s organic growth has been 
achieved through a combination of 
like-for-like growth and increasing 
selling space. The like-for-like growth 
reflects investment in buying, 
merchandising and our success in 
constantly refreshing the stores to 
ensure they remain exciting places to 
shop. The increase in selling space 
has been driven by capital investment 
in freehold and leasehold properties 
as they have become available, first 
on the high streets of the UK and 
Ireland, and more recently on the high 
streets and in the shopping centres 
of continental Europe and the USA. 
2006 saw Primark’s first foray into 
continental Europe with the opening 
of a store in Madrid and it now 
operates from over 11 million sq ft of 
selling space across ten countries.
With a unique combination of the 
latest fashion and lean operations, 
Primark offers customers quality, 
up-to-the-minute designs at 
value-for-money prices. Buying and 
merchandising teams travel 
internationally to source and buy 
garments that best reflect each 
season’s key fashion trends. 
Primark’s range includes 
womenswear, lingerie, childrenswear, 
menswear, footwear, accessories, 
hosiery and homeware. Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015

C’EST
MAGNIFIQUE!
Primark’s star performer  
in 2015 was its business in 
France where we have five 
stores, all of which opened 
in 2013/14. 
Collectively these stores marked 
Primark’s most successful entry into  
a new country and now that we have 
been open more than a year, we 
continue to deliver very strong growth. 
The French stores incorporate a 
number of new initiatives, for example: 
streamlining our till procedures; 
speeding up check out times; enhancing 
the fitting room experience; improving 
store navigation; widening the aisles; 
and delivering a more consistent 
in-store experience especially in areas 
where customers require assistance.
With exciting new stores scheduled  
to open in Lyon, Nice and Toulon in  
the coming financial year, and several 
more stores in the pipeline for the  
next two years, the future of our  
French business is bright. Strategic report
Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015

Sales at Primark were 13% ahead of 
last year at constant currency mainly 
driven by an increase in retail selling 
space of 9%. Like-for-like sales were 
1% ahead of last year reflecting a 
strong performance across a number 
of countries. Very high sales densities 
were achieved by stores opened in  
the last 18 months and especially by 
our stores in France, which has been 
our most successful new market  
entry to date.
Like-for-like sales in the early part of  
the financial year were impacted by the 
unseasonably warm autumn followed  
by strong trading across the important 
Christmas period. Spring trading was  
held back by cool weather followed  
by strong trading in the fourth quarter  
of our financial year. Spain, Portugal and 
Ireland all performed very well throughout 
the year and the UK delivered a positive 
like-for-like performance. The success  
in these markets was partly offset by the 
impact that the opening of new stores  
in the Netherlands and Germany had on 
existing stores in that region, albeit that 
this effect reduced in the fourth quarter. 
As new stores opened, sales in existing 
stores declined as customers chose to 
shop more locally rather than travelling  
the long distances that we saw in the  
early days of trading in these countries.
Our very successful trading in 2013/14  
led to an unusually low level of markdown 
in that year. As anticipated, markdowns 
returned to more normal levels this year 
with a consequent reduction in operating 
margin. To a lesser extent, margin was 
also reduced by the effect of the stronger 
US dollar, at the end of the financial year, 
on purchases for the new autumn/winter 
range. Primark sources much of its 
merchandise in US dollars and its strength, 
particularly against the euro, will have  
a further adverse effect on margins in the 
new financial year, especially in the first 
half. However, more than half of the 
potential impact has been successfully 
mitigated by our buying teams as they 
have placed orders for next year.
During this financial year we opened 
almost one million sq ft of selling space 
bringing the total estate to 293 stores  
and 11.2 million sq ft at the financial  
year end. 20 new stores were opened 
including relocations to larger premises  
in Northampton and Murcia, Spain.  
We closed our store on The Headrow in 
Leeds, following the success of the much 
bigger store opened in the nearby Trinity 
shopping centre in December 2013, and 
we also closed two very small stores,  
one in Margate and another in Naas in  
the Republic of Ireland, bringing the net 
additions in the year to 15. These new 
stores included 77 ,000 sq ft at Downtown 
Crossing in Boston, our first store in the 
US, which opened on 10 September. 
Significant new space was added in the 
Netherlands, Belgium and in Germany 
where an additional six stores were 
opened, the largest of which were 
Dresden, Braunschweig, Krefeld  
and Weiterstadt.

We have an extensive pipeline of  
new stores to be opened over the next  
few years with some 1.5 million sq ft 
scheduled for the new financial year,  
the major elements of which will be  
in the north-east US, the UK, Spain and 
France. In the US we will add seven 
stores, totalling 0.4 million sq ft, most  
of which will open later next year; Spain 
includes a flagship, 133,000 sq ft, store  
on Gran Via in central Madrid which 
opened this October; and, following our 
success in France this year, we will open  
in Lyon, Nice and Toulon. We will also 
open our first Italian store at a new 
shopping centre in Arese, north-west  
of Milan, early next summer. 
We have made a significant investment  
in our warehouse infrastructure and 
further expenditure is planned for next 
year. In total we will have doubled our 
warehouse capacity since 2013. Our 
existing warehouse in Torija in northern 
Spain was doubled in size at the  
beginning of this year, the facility at 
Mönchengladbach in Germany was 
increased by 60% and a new warehouse  
in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania was fully 
operational in time for the opening of the 
Boston store. In September, we opened  
a new warehouse in Bor, on the western 
border of the Czech Republic. Next year 
will see the relocation of our Magna Park, 
UK warehouse to a larger site at Islip in 
Northamptonshire, close to our existing 
warehouse at Thrapston. This will  
give rise to some dual running costs  
for a short period. Another distribution  
centre is currently under construction  
at Roosendaal in the Netherlands  
which will come on stream late next  
year. Located in one of Europe’s prime 
logistics hubs between Rotterdam  
and Antwerp, this facility will service  
our expanding network of stores in  
continental Europe.

New category product developments 
have helped drive our sales in the past 
year with the following departments 
at the forefront of our fashion offering:
Home has become more contemporary 
with the introduction of Home Accessory 
products including scented candles, 
novelty LED lighting and decorative wall 
items. This range followed the seasonal 
colour palettes of our fashion categories, 
creating a more cohesive offering. 
Improved visual merchandising helped  
to create a more inspiring in-store 
environment, helping our customers  
to shop this area.
Accessories are becoming more  
of a focal point and are leading the way  
in completing many of our key looks. 
Some great examples from the Autumn/
Winter ‘15 season include oversized tartan 
scarves, ponchos, large bags and Fedora 
hats. Our Accessories range has developed 
beyond Womenswear and we have  
seen strong demand from Childrenswear 
customers for ‘mini-me’ products in a lot 
of these categories. Menswear too has 
seen strong demand for the season’s key 
accessories which, this year, also include 
watches, which have launched with a 
promising commercial response at very 
competitive price points.
Accessories have also expanded to create 
a new mini-department, aptly named 
‘Primarket’ which had an extremely 
encouraging launch this year focusing 
primarily on travel and technology 
accessories as well as stationery.

Sportswear: The ‘Athleisure’  
(Athletic Leisurewear) trend and the 
growth of the performance apparel 
market can be attributed to emerging 
changes in consumer lifestyle. 
Sportswear/Activewear has now 
become an everyday must-have fashion 
item as consumers pay increasing 
attention to personal health and  
fitness. Innovative and functional fabric

We strive to provide an outstanding 
experience in every new store we 
open through meticulous attention  
to the design process. Over the last  
few years we have made significant 
advances in window presentation, visual 
merchandising, digital communication, 
and the look and feel of each department 
– notably the introduction of new denim, 
footwear and beauty departments. We 
have also sought to provide an enhanced 
customer experience in a number of key 
stores in prime locations such as Berlin 
Alexanderplatz and Northampton.
Berlin Alexanderplatz
Situated on one of Berlin’s most historic 
and iconic squares, Primark occupies 
premises of 56,000 sq ft. The brutalist 
concrete shell provided a backdrop for  
us to create a store that reflects Berlin’s 
culture and feel. Concrete has been left 
exposed, lifts climb through the space in 
open steel shafts and a local graffiti artist 
decorated the store with floor directories 
and local narrative. An outstanding  
digital experience is delivered by a 
three-dimensional projected map wall  
that rises up three floors through the 
escalator atrium. Overall the store gives 
our customers the excitement of shopping 
in a contemporary fashionable environment 
while enjoying a real Berlin experience.
Northampton
Primark continuously reviews expansion 
and relocation opportunities in its core 
markets and identified an opportunity  
to relocate its small 10,300 sq ft store in 
Northampton into a new, purpose-built, 
location which, at 34,300 sq ft, was more 
appropriate for the market opportunity. 
Ideally located in the redeveloped 
Grosvenor shopping centre, Primark 
opened for trade in December 2014 and, 
trading from two floors, immediately 
enjoyed significantly enhanced trading. 
The store was fitted out in the latest  
store design including improved visual 
merchandising and windows, light boxes, 
LED screens, enhanced lighting and a new 
denim and footwear concept. A relocated 
store provides an excellent opportunity  
not only to provide many new jobs but also 
to motivate the staff who relocate from 
the old store by providing them with a new 
working environment, not just on the shop 
floor, but also back of house. Northampton 
was fitted with a new, open plan, fun and 
fashionable environment in which staff 
can relax. The new back of house concept 
has been incorporated into all new and 
refitted stores since the end of 2013 and 
has had a direct positive impact on the 
morale of our people.
Store environment plays an 
important part in inspiring  
our customers and engaging 
them in the fun and fashion  
of Primark.

ANOTHER YEAR  
OF STRONG CASH 
GENERATION 
Group performance 
Group revenue increased by 2%  
at constant exchange rates, but the 
strengthening of sterling against our  
major trading currencies, particularly in  
the second half of the year, resulted in a 
decline in revenues of 1% at actual rates, 
to £12.8bn. Adjusted operating profit  
of £1,092m was 4% below last year at 
constant rates but 6% lower at actual 
rates. In calculating adjusted operating 
profit, the amortisation charge on 
non-operating intangibles, profits or  
losses on disposal of non-current assets 
and any exceptional items are excluded. 
On an unadjusted basis, operating profit 
was 12% below last year at £947m.
An exceptional non-cash operating charge 
of £98m was taken in February to impair 
the group’s shareholder loans to Vivergo 
Fuels following the decline in the price  
of fuel, and particularly biofuel, earlier in 
the year.
The income statement includes a charge 
of £172m for the net loss on the sale and 
closure of businesses primarily in respect 
Strategic report | Financial review |
of two items. In May, we assumed  
BP’s 47% interest in Vivergo Fuels at 
which time a non-cash charge of £75m 
was recognised to account for the 
effective disposal of the group’s original 
equity-accounted stake in the joint  
venture prior to its immediate repurchase  
at fair value. This charge also includes  
a £100m non-cash loss on sale of the  
two uneconomic sugar factories  
in Heilongjiang.
Finance expense less finance income  
of £53m was lower than last year’s  
net charge of £58m reflecting a lower  
average level of debt during the year.
Profit before tax fell from £1,020m to 
£717m. On an adjusted basis, where the 
amortisation of non-operating intangible 
assets, any profits or losses on the sale  
of non-current assets or on the sale and 
closure of businesses, and exceptional 
items are excluded, profit before tax  
fell by 6% to £1,034m.
Taxation
We recognise the importance of complying 
fully with all applicable tax laws as well  
as paying and collecting the right amount 
of tax in every country in which the group 
operates. We have had a board-adopted 
tax policy for many years which is based 
on seven tax principles that are embedded 
in the financial and non-financial processes 
and controls of the group. Our tax 
principles are included in the appendix  
to our Corporate Responsibility Report  
(www.abf.co.uk).
As a substantial UK tax payer, the group 
will benefit from the future reductions in 
the UK corporation tax rate to 19% from  
1 April 2017 and 18% from 1 April 2020. 
Following substantive enactment of  
these rates since the balance sheet date, 
the effect of these reductions on our UK 
deferred tax liability will be reflected in 
2015/16 and in our current tax charge  
in the year in which the reductions apply.
This year’s tax charge of £193m included 
an underlying charge of £220m at an 
effective rate of 21.3% (2014 – 23.3%)  
on the adjusted profit before tax. The 
reduction in the effective rate is a result  
of the mix of profits earned in different  
tax jurisdictions, the reduction in the  
UK corporation tax rate from 21 % to 20% 
with effect from 1 April 2015 and the 
conclusion of tax audits in a number  
of businesses. With profit increasing in 
businesses subject to a corporate tax  
rate higher than the UK, we expect the 
group’s effective tax rate to increase  
from this level.
The overall tax charge for the year benefited 
from a credit of £8m (2014 – £21m) for tax 
relief on the amortisation of non-operating 
intangible assets and goodwill arising  
from previous acquisitions. A tax credit  
of £22m arose on the exceptional item  
and the net profit on the sale of fixed 
assets gave rise to a tax charge of £3m. 
No tax credit is recognised on the loss  
on disposal of businesses as no relief  
is available.

OUR GROUP  
STRATEGY AND 
BUSINESS MODEL
Our businesses are organised so that  
they are close to the markets and 
customers that they serve. 
Pages 8 and 9 Group business model and strategy
Earnings and dividends
Earnings attributable to equity 
shareholders were £532m and the 
weighted average number of shares  
in issue during the year, which is used  
to calculate earnings per share, was  
790 million (2014 – 790 million). Earnings 
per ordinary share were 30% lower  
than last year at 67.3p as a result of the 
exceptional charge and the losses on  
sale of businesses. Adjusted earnings  
per share, which provides a more 
consistent measure of trading 
performance, fell by 2% from 104.1p  
to 102.0p.
The interim dividend was increased  
by 3% to 10.0p and a final dividend has 
been proposed at 25.0p which represents  
an overall increase of 3% for the year.  
The proposed dividend is expected to  
cost £198m and will be charged next  
year. Dividend cover, on an adjusted  
basis, is 2.9 times.
Balance sheet
Non-current assets of £6.4bn were 
£0.4bn lower than last year. Although 
capital expenditure was again higher than 
depreciation and amortisation charges  
this year, this was more than offset by 
foreign exchange translation losses and 
assets disposed, with the result that  
the carrying value of intangible assets  
and property, plant and equipment fell  
by £100m and £177m respectively.
Working capital at the year end was 
£101m lower than last year reflecting 
lower food commodity prices and 
although inventories were higher driven  
by year end European sugar stock levels 
and higher new-season inventory at 
Primark, this was more than offset by 
lower trade receivables and higher trade 
payables. Average working capital as  
a percentage of sales was broadly level  
with last year at 9.4%. Net borrowings  
at the year end were £252m lower than 
last year at £194m as a consequence of 
another strong cash flow performance.
A currency loss of £432m arose on the 
translation into sterling of the group’s 
foreign currency denominated net assets. 
The group’s net assets fell by £202m  
to £6,551m.
Return on capital employed for the group, 
which is calculated by expressing adjusted 
operating profit as a percentage of the 
average capital employed for the year,  
was 17.6% compared with 18.9% last 
year. The primary reason for the decline 
was the reduction in sugar profits although 
there was also a small dilution of Primark’s 
high return which reduced from 33.2%  
to 31.1 % reflecting the impact of a higher 
level of markdown on its profit margin.  
The other three business segments all 
delivered an increase on last year largely 
driven by profit improvement, with little 
change in average capital employed.
Cash flow
The group generated a net cash flow  
from operating activities of £1, 166m this 
year with a working capital outflow of 
£66m, driven by the higher level of sugar 
stocks and Primark inventory, compared  
to last year’s inflow of £100m.
Gross expenditure on property, plant and 
equipment and intangibles amounted to 
£613m compared with £708m last year. 
Primark spent £306m on the acquisition  
of new stores, the fit-out of new and 
existing stores and on the expansion  
of warehouse capacity including new 
facilities in the Czech Republic and the  
US. Expenditure in the food businesses 
was lower than last year which saw  
the completion of our programme to 
modernise our UK bakeries. £72m was 
realised this year from the sale of property, 
plant and equipment, the major elements 
of which were the sale of former Primark 
sites and the redevelopment of a former 
factory site in Western Australia which  
is progressing well with a number of lots 
sold for housing development during  
the year.
The purchase of Dorset Cereals 
comprised the majority of the £52m 
invested in business acquisitions.
Financing
The financing of the group is managed by  
a central treasury department. The group 
has total committed borrowing facilities 
amounting to £2.1bn, which comprise: 
£0.6bn of US private placement notes 
maturing between 2016 and 2024, with  
an average fixed rate coupon of 5.1%, 
£78m of which is payable in March 2016; 
£1.2bn provided under a syndicated, 
revolving credit facility which matures  
in July 2020 with an option to extend  
by a further year; and £0.3bn of local 
committed facilities in Africa and Spain. 
During the financial year we repaid,  
from existing cash resources, a £120m 
loan from the European Investment Bank.  
At the year end, £728m was drawn  
down under these committed facilities. 
The group also had access to £0.7bn of 
uncommitted credit lines under which 
£156m was drawn at the year end.  
Cash and cash equivalents totalled  
£702m at the year end.
The financial strength and flexibility of  
the group is enhanced by diversifying our 
sources of funding and having certainty  
of finance over a long period. The strength 
and breadth of the 12 banks in the syndicate 
reflect the scale and international presence 
of the group and particularly our increasing 
activities in continental Europe through 
Primark’s expansion.
Pensions
Pension liabilities in the group’s defined 
benefit pension schemes exceeded 
employee benefit assets at the year end 
by £16m compared with last year’s deficit 
of £43m. The UK scheme accounted for 
92% of the group’s total pension assets 
and the increase in the market value of 
these assets during the year exceeded the 
increase in the present value of scheme 
liabilities. Total contributions to defined 
benefit plans in the year amounted to  
£39m (2014 – £41m). A triennial valuation 
of the UK scheme was undertaken as  
at 5 April 2014 which was agreed by the 
trustees in December 2014, and revealed 
a surplus of £79m. As a result there was 
no requirement to agree a recovery plan 
with the trustees. 
The charge for the year for the group’s 
defined contribution schemes, which  
was equal to the contributions made, 
amounted to £76m (2014 – £76m)  
which was substantially greater than the  
cash contribution made to the defined 
benefit schemes reflecting the changing 
shape of pension provision in the group.

In our 80 year history we have 
succeeded by empowering 
and trusting those who run 
our businesses to make 
ethical decisions.
We have structures and policies which 
support our employees to make good 
decisions but it is our culture which 
establishes our expectations and shapes 
how we operate. We call this culture  
the Essence of Associated British Foods. 
For more information see our 2015  
CR Update at www.abf.co.uk.
An ethical business
At Associated British Foods we believe 
that an ethical business is primarily built  
by its people.
We nurture ethical business practices 
through the actions we undertake every 
day and if we observe something is not 
right we act quickly to correct it.
A decentralised business
We match our high moral expectations 
with the autonomy that we give to each 
business and the individuals employed 
within them.
Although we have a highly decentralised

our decentralised structure.
Assuring our ethical culture involves  
a robust and rigorous process of  
internal verification.
A focused business
Since our 2013 CR report, each business 
has been engaged in a process to prioritise 
the CR issues upon which they will focus.
By aggregating these business-by-
business priorities, we have identified  
our groupwide priorities. This approach 
creates focus whilst remaining true to  
our culture of decentralisation.
The groupwide priorities of our CR 
programme are categorised into four 
groups, or pillars, which you will see 
reflected throughout our communications: Strategic report
Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
49 Strategic report | Corporate responsibility |
We integrate responsible 
stewardship of our environment 
into operational decisions by 
investing in technology and 
efficient equipment, employing 
and training people with  
the right skills, sharing best 
practice across our businesses 
and constantly developing  
our approach to measurement 
and reporting.
We take an active approach to managing 
and reducing our environmental impact. 
We are mindful that the success of many 
of our businesses is dependent on a range 
of sustainable environmental assets.  
With the demand for food and clothing 
increasing as the global population grows, 
combined with climate change, regulatory 
uncertainty and increased pressure for 
healthy farming land, we have a moral  
and commercial responsibility to  
conserve and, where possible, enhance 
the environment in which we operate.
The areas where we have greatest 
environmental impact and risk are:
• the use of energy and the resultant 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions;
• the abstraction of water and  
discharge of effluent; and
• the generation and disposal  
of waste.
As we have been addressing these  
issues for a number of years, we are able  
to report trend data that demonstrates  
our commitment to managing our 
environmental footprint effectively. We 
continue to refine our measurement and 
reporting of these issues. We analyse  
our environmental data to help us identify 
opportunities to generate operational 
efficiencies, integrate processes and 
minimise our environmental impact.
Our challenges and  
achievements this year
This year a number of our businesses  
have responded to localised environmental 
issues including drought, flooding and 
harsher winters. These events have had 
varying degrees of impact on our direct 
operations and suppliers, and have been 
particularly evident in our agricultural and 
sugar businesses. Despite these difficulties 
and recognising that we have increased 
production output by 3% since last year, 
we are pleased with our groupwide 
progress this year. Highlights include:
• 76% of our waste was recycled;
• 50% of energy used was from 
renewable sources; and
• 96% of our sites operated without  
an environmental complaint.
Environmental compliance
During 2015, we received four fines 
totalling £1,000 for environmental matters 
including the handling of construction 
waste and a pipe leak. All issues have 
been addressed and rectified.
We received 50 complaints, down  
32% from 74 in 2014. The majority  
were related to noise, dust and odour.  
We regret any inconvenience caused  
to the communities in which we are 
located and continue to seek ways to 
eliminate the cause of such incidents.
Our sites are often visited by 
environmental regulators for routine 
sampling and inspection visits or as a 
result of incidents. In 2015, we received 
580 visits which is 7% fewer than in 2014.  
We always fully engage with national  
and local regulators to help us meet  
or exceed regulatory standards.
Energy
In 2015, our absolute use of energy was 
25,002 GWh compared to 25,416 GWh  
in 2014. This is a 2% reduction which  
is the result of energy efficiency 
improvements and a reduction in the 
amount of renewable fuel used at  
some of our sugar operations.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
50% of our energy consumption is from 
renewable fuel sources, reducing from 
13,736 GWh in 2014 to 12,493 GWh  
this year. The majority of our renewable 
energy comes from bagasse which is  
the residual fibre that remains after the 
extraction of juice from the crushed  
stalks of sugar cane.
A number of our sites generate their  
own energy and often make more than  
is needed; exporting surplus electricity  
to the national grid or other organisations. 
In 2015, we exported 830 GWh which is  
a 5% increase on last year due to longer 
sugar campaigns in Europe and the 
outcome of energy efficiencies across  
our African sites.
Greenhouse gas emissions
Last year we reported our greenhouse  
gas emissions for the first time. Again,  
we are reporting our total emissions from 
the operational and agricultural activities  
of our businesses for which we are 
directly responsible.
In 2015, our total greenhouse gas emissions 
amounted to 9,607 ,000 tonnes of carbon 
dioxide equivalent (CO
2
e), which is 
consistent with the gross amount emitted 
last year despite our increased production 
output. Our intensity ratio for 2015 was 
751 tonnes per £1m of revenue. This  
is a small increase on last year due to  
a 1% decline in the group’s revenue.
The majority of our gross emissions are 
from the energy we use in our premises. 
We generate a large proportion of our 
energy either through our on-site power 
stations or from the burning of fuels.  
The remainder of our energy requirement  
is from purchased electricity and steam 
contributing 1,081,000 tonnes of CO
2
e  
to our gross emissions.
Of the 6,802,000 tonnes of CO
2
e emitted  
by our Sugar businesses, two-thirds  
was generated from the use of bagasse.  
The combustion of sugar cane biomass  
is regarded as carbon neutral and is  
therefore included in our calculations  
of total net emissions.
This year we are reporting separately  
the emissions from the generation and 
use of renewable energy on our sites.  
As described above, the majority of our 
renewable energy is steam and electricity 
generated from bagasse. The steam is 
used to provide the heating requirements 
of the sugar production process and then 
to generate renewable electricity through 
cogeneration. As sugar cane grows it 
absorbs carbon dioxide from the air which 
is then released during cogeneration.  
As such we have reported emissions  
from the generation and use of renewable 
energy as having a net zero effect on our 
total emissions.
For 2015, our total net emissions are 
5,246,000 tonnes CO
2
e. This is 8%  
higher than last year’s total net emissions 
primarily due to less bagasse being used 
across our sugar businesses in Africa  
and China.
We developed detailed reporting guidance 
for our companies including estimation 
methodologies and assumptions which 
have taken into account guidance from 
ISO 14064/1 and the Greenhouse Gas 
Protocol. See ‘Our CR Reporting Guidance 
2015’ at www.abf.co.uk for our GHG 
methodology and more detail about how 
we quantify our emissions including 
emission scopes.
Water
Water management has been a priority  
for the group over the last five years,  
with a focus on measuring and reporting 
performance data which appropriately 
reflects all the water we abstract,  
use and discharge.
Previously we have reported the water 
used in our premises which are primarily 
factories although smaller amounts are 
used in offices, stores, warehouses and 
accommodation. For the first time we are 
reporting the total water abstracted for 
use in our premises and for agricultural 
purposes. This is in recognition of the  
fact that we rely on the availability of 
quality water to grow raw ingredients  
as well as process finished goods.

51 Strategic report | Corporate responsibility |
Over 700,000 tonnes, which is 76%  
of the total waste generated this year,  
was diverted from landfill and reused  
or recovered for a beneficial purpose.  
This is a 24% reduction in the recycled 
waste we reported last year due to the 
introduction of a new key performance 
indicator to separate the amount of  
water reused in order to demonstrate  
our holistic approach to waste and  
waste water management. We intend  
to report this when all relevant sites  
have finished implementing their 
monitoring processes.
31% of our production sites have  
achieved zero waste to landfill this year 
with other sites continuing to work  
towards this target.
Product and packaging
The quantity of packaging used for  
the containment, protection and safety  
of our products in 2015 was 238,000 
tonnes which is an increase of 3%  
since 2014. This increase is in line with  
our manufacturing production and 
increasing Primark sales.
Since 2011, the tonnes of packaging  
per tonne of product has reduced by  
21% demonstrating our sustained  
focus on reducing packaging.
Responsible sourcing of palm oil
The group’s commitment to sourcing  
only RSPO certified sustainable palm oil 
products by 2015 applies across all of  
our businesses. We aim to buy as much 
physically certified sustainable products as 
possible. However, as 70% of the volume 
we procure is in products in which palm  
oil or its derivatives are an ingredient, this 
is not always feasible. We therefore met 
our target by utilising the RSPO-approved 
Book&Claim supply chain scheme.
ILLOVO’S RESPONSE  
TO CLIMATE CHANGE
Illovo’s operations are exposed  
to variable climate conditions in 
sub-Saharan Africa. 
As a result, focus has been placed  
on increasing the resilience of our 
operations to drought and rainfall 
variability. Mechanisms to achieve this 
include the selection and cultivation  
of resilient cane varieties and soil 
moisture management techniques 
aimed at water conservation. Illovo 
continues to cultivate varieties that are 
only developed through conventional 
processes and to mitigate the risk of  
the spread of pests and diseases by 
having a policy which allows for no  
more than 30% of the growing area  
to consist of one cane variety.
The total amount of water abstracted  
for our use in 2015 was 1.1 billion m
3
.  
Of this amount, 29% was used in  
our premises and 71% was used for 
agricultural purposes, primarily to  
irrigate our extensive sugar beet  
and cane fields.
Many of our businesses are focused  
on reusing water throughout their 
operations before it is discharged or  
used to supplement irrigation water. 
Waste water discharged to the local 
catchment is treated on site to comply  
with local standards or taken away  
and managed by local authorities.
As reported last year, Illovo has  
been reviewing its approach to water 
management, culminating in a new 
strategy for the next five years. Through 
tighter operational performance 
standards, the strategy aims to reduce 
unnecessary water losses, maximise 
reused water and implement better 
monitoring and reporting. As Illovo’s  
water footprint methodology continues  
to mature and as the rest of our 
businesses continue to invest in water 
management, the data we report in  
future years is expected to reflect  
these developments.
Waste management
In 2015, we generated 219,000 tonnes  
of non-hazardous waste which is an 
annual increase of 33%. This increase  
can mainly be attributed to the closure  
of two sugar beet factories in China. 
These sites reported larger quantities  
of waste which were generated during  
the process of emptying, cleaning and 
closing the factories. Without these 
disposals, the group’s non-hazardous 
waste would have increased by 6%,  
most of which is a consequence of  
increasing production.
We recognise that during the year there 
have been limitations to the monitoring  
of non-hazardous waste removed  
from sites in northern China. As such,  
the sites have estimated the weight  
of regularly generated waste based on 
assumptions and experience which we 
believe provides a good approximation  
of tonnage of waste disposed. Further 
work will be carried out to improve 
measurement of waste at these sites.
This year, we have generated 6,000 
tonnes of hazardous waste which is  
a 40% reduction on the previous year.  
The high level last year was unusual 
due to the one-off safe removal of 
asbestos from one site in Australia.
GREENPEACE DETOX CAMPAIGN
Primark has a robust process in place  
to manage chemicals, and we recognise 
the importance of continuing to evolve 
this in line with industry best practice.  
In February 2015, we signed up to 
Greenpeace’s global Detox campaign 
and committed to phase out the use  
of certain chemicals within the supply 
chain by 2020.
In 2014, we worked with chemical 
experts and three key suppliers in  
China to look closely at how chemicals 
are used during production of textiles 
and to conduct waste water testing.  
We did this in order to gain an in-depth 
understanding of current chemical 
management practices within dyeing 
mills and washing units. As our  
first pilot in China comes to a close,  
we are expanding the programme  
to include more suppliers in China  
and Bangladesh. In response to 
Greenpeace’s Detox campaign other 
retailers facing similar challenges  
came together to found the Zero 
Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals 
(ZDHC) working group, of which  
Primark is a member.
In 2015, Greenpeace ranked Primark  
as a leader as part of its annual Detox 
Catwalk. Primark is pleased to be 
recognised as a leader on this issue,  
one that is particularly important to  
its customers, and the people that  
work in its supply chain. Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
Maintaining safe working 
environments with strong 
ethical labour standards for 
our people and all who work 
with us is core to the way  
we operate.
Health and safety
As our businesses strive to achieve 
injury-free workplaces, maintaining  
a strong culture of safety with clear 
leadership is of fundamental importance. 
Over recent years, there has been 
increased engagement with employees 
on their own responsibility for reducing 
risks to themselves and colleagues. We 
also expect our people and contractors  
to go home from work as healthy as when 
they arrived, unaffected by their tasks or 
working environment. Occupational health 
specialists monitor the working practices 
across our sites to ensure they are  
healthy places to work.
We have made significant improvements 
to our safety performance over the past 
five years but continue to face challenges. 
One of our largest challenges is maintaining 
safety performance whilst our businesses 
continue to grow. We incorporate our 
established safety practices and ways  
of working into all new sites.
During 2015, our businesses invested  
£33m in health and safety including over 
£13m spent on major safety projects and 
operational improvements.
This year over 20,000 contractors worked 
across our sites. We treat our people and 
on-site contractors in the same way, and 
in return expect the same high workplace 
safety standards from all who work in  
our operations. We do, however, recognise  
that more work is required to ensure on-site 
contractors adopt the same level of safety 
that we expect from our people. In parallel, 
our businesses have a duty of care to  
keep contractors safe. During the year we 
published our contractor management 
guidance which is now being 
implemented across the group.
Fatal injuries
The prevention of fatalities and serious 
accidents in the workplace is an absolute 
priority throughout the group. We have 
robust procedures to minimise risks 
including safety communications, training, 
regular audits and embedded monitoring 
and reporting of working practices.
We deeply regret one work-related fatality 
this year which occurred in Africa. Despite 
clear safety instructions by the vehicle 
conductor, a contract agricultural worker 
attempted to board a reversing people 
carrier. He slipped and fell sustaining fatal 
head injuries. A full investigation identified 
opportunities to further strengthen our 
controls and these have been implemented 
at all relevant sites. All work-related deaths 
are reported to the Associated British 
Foods board and local management  
is held to account.
Injuries to employees
During 2015, we recorded 465 employee 
reportable injuries resulting in our reportable 
injury rate increasing by 0.48%. Although 
there has been an increase overall in 
reportable injuries, there have been 
significant and sustained efforts to  
prevent injuries. Our operations in Africa, 
Australasia and North America have all 
continued a downward trend in reportable 
injuries over the last five years.
We also recorded an increase in employee 
Lost Time Injuries (LTIs) partly due to 
growth in the business and partly due  
to how injuries are treated in specific 
countries. Despite this increase, 61%  
of our sites recorded zero LTIs this year  
and 36 of our high risk manufacturing  
sites achieved at least five years

Health and safety compliance
During 2015, we received four safety  
fines for breaches of safety regulations. 
The number of safety fines is the same  
as last year even though the number of 
operational sites has increased. The total 
cost of the fines was £19,000. Fines  
were received for issues around machine 
guarding, electrical safety, machine 
isolation during cleaning and as a result  
of contractor injuries from a vehicle. For 
more information see our 2015 CR Update  
at www.abf.co.uk/responsibility.
All businesses are required to report  
to the Group Safety and Environment 
Manager the details of their remedial 
actions. These incidents are also shared 
with the safety managers across the 
group so that each business can learn 
how to mitigate similar risks.
We recognise that despite having  
a high safety culture there are always 
opportunities to improve and a need  
continuously to review our approach  
to safety management.

PROJECT SAFE
Project SAFE is AB Mauri’s new  
global approach to health and safety 
which aims to embed a safe working 
environment that sustains zero injuries 
and zero work-related ill health. The 
project has seen the development of a 
business-wide framework of standards, 
processes and a Health and Safety 
Management System all aimed at 
changing behaviours and improving 
health and safety outcomes. 
Project SAFE is centred on four areas:
1 People
Supporting the development of the  
right behaviours in employees including 
communications, engagement and 
empowerment, to ultimately enable 
culture change within the businesses.
2 Procedures
Discipline to ensure that optimal 
processes and procedures exist and 
are followed. 
3 Places 
Ensuring that assets and working 
environment, including new and existing 
facilities, are safe to operate and well 
maintained in order to remove any 
potential obstacle to safe behaviours.
4 Continuous improvement
Performance assessments and feedback 
are used to monitor progress and secure 
continuous improvement.
Project SAFE was piloted at AB Mauri’s 
manufacturing site in Casteggio, Italy.  
The experience at this site has formed the 
basis for regional and global engagement 
of all AB Mauri manufacturing, distribution 
and office facilities. It has already been 
implemented in a number of beacon sites 
including in Brazil, China, India and the 
US, and will now be rolled out globally.
With monthly tracking of key performance 
indicators, regular internal reporting  
and transparency across the business, 
and visible leadership sponsorship  
for the programme, AB Mauri is  
already seeing positive changes in  
its safety performance.

Human rights
Associated British Foods promotes  
human rights and dignity through the 
employment we create, both directly  
and indirectly in our global supply chains, 
and through the positive contribution  
our products make to people’s lives.  
Our commitment to respect human rights 
is founded on a strong ethos of workplace 
safety and employee wellbeing, and is 
supported by our commitment to ensure 
compliance with the UN Declaration on 
Human Rights. We value our ongoing 
engagement and collaboration with a 
broad range of interested and concerned 
stakeholder groups. We are active in our 
collaborative approach, seeking to remain 
sensitive to the risk of breaching human 
rights resulting from our products, 
services and operations.
As a matter of good practice, we 
risk-assess the impact that our operations 
may have on the protection and respect  
of human rights. We ensure a greater 
focus on operations under the jurisdiction  
of governments that have a lesser 
commitment to the protection of human 
rights. This year we have focused on 
identifying the salient human rights risks 
which we would need to tackle as a  
group, and the best way to manage  
the issues identified.
A more detailed explanation of our 
approach to respecting human rights and 
the focus areas over the next few years  
can be found within the 2015 CR Update  
at www.abf.co.uk/responsibility.
Diversity and inclusion
We are committed to promoting and 
developing diverse talent across all of  
our businesses. We aim to run businesses 
which attract and retain the best talent  
by creating a culture that is welcoming  
to everyone. In common with many 
companies, our businesses vary in the 
proportion of women in the workplace.  
As such we have a number of initiatives 
focused on gender diversity in particular. 
Our objective is not forced uniformity, 
rather a uniform culture where women  
are respected as colleagues and leaders.
Since 2011, we have implemented  
a number of initiatives including 
unconscious bias training, mentoring,  
women’s development programmes  
and a gender diversity task force.
We know that women are under- 
represented at the most senior 
management levels in some of our 
businesses. However, we have a 
long-term commitment towards gender 
equality and the promotion of women  
to create a positive change.
Our health, safety and diversity  
reporting definitions can be found

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
RESPECTING LAND RIGHTS
As an agricultural business, the issue  
of land rights is important to AB Sugar. 
This is a particular concern for Illovo 
since it operates in countries still 
struggling to repair the damage done  
by years of legislated racial segregation.
In South Africa, Illovo has sold and 
transferred 52% of its agricultural land 
holdings to historically disadvantaged 
communities. It works proactively  
with black farmers, holding training 
programmes that offer assistance to 
new cane growers, thereby supporting 
the long-term commercial sustainability  
of their farms.
In 2014, Illovo released its Group 
Guidelines on Land and Land Rights 
(available at www.illovosugar.co.za)  
for its operations and supply chain.  
The guidelines articulate the business’s 
position on land, land rights, land 
acquisitions and sustainable farming 
practices and establishes its zero 
tolerance to land grabs.
Illovo is now working with local 
stakeholders to embark on a process  
of identifying the key land-related issues 
affecting the business, and prioritising 
initiatives to address these. Oxfam  
called Illovo’s approach to land rights 
‘bold’ and noted the business’s ‘genuine 
interest in using their influence to protect 
the land rights of the communities in 
which it operates’.
PRIMARK’S CHARITY 
PARTNERSHIP WITH NEWLIFE
Primark’s partnership with the  
Newlife Foundation in the UK and 
Ireland started in 2010. Any items that 
are returned to our stores by customers 
or not required by the organisation  
are donated to the charity. The Newlife 
Foundation will then recycle all of these 
products in an environmentally-friendly 
manner and use the profits to support 
their work with disabled children.
These profits go towards purchasing 
equipment such as wheelchairs, 
pain-relieving beds, communication 
aids, nurse services, medical  
research, and campaigning and 
awareness activities. 
Last year this partnership was 
implemented in all stores across 
Europe and it has so far generated 
almost €3m in funding for Newlife.
GIVING YOUNG PEOPLE AN INSIGHT INTO MANUFACTURING
AB Agri supports ‘See Inside 
Manufacturing’, a national flagship 
programme devised by the Department 
for Business, Innovation and Skills to give 
young people an insight into modern 
manufacturing, showcasing opportunities 
in technology, engineering and science. 
Its Walsingham feed mill hosted a  
group of school pupils, giving them the 
opportunity to learn more about how  
the business works. 
The business also encourages school 
pupils to think about engineering through 
a growing partnership between Fair Oak 
Academy and the Rugeley site team. 
Staff have been supporting a group  
of students with their ‘Green Car 
Challenge’. The scheme aims to get 
more young people excited in STEM 
subjects by involving them in designing, 
engineering and manufacturing a  
car from scratch. The business has  
also provided financial support for 
performance analysis software and  
radio communication equipment. 
Thulas Ngidi is living 
his late father’s dream, 
having acquired his first 
farm from Illovo on the 
KwaZulu-Natal South 
Coast, and later going 
on to purchase two 
further adjacent farms.
With funding raised, Newlife  
can provide essential equipment  
like Andrew’s specialist  
powered wheelchair. Strategic report

RESPONSIBLE  
FOR PROMOTING 
GOOD HEALTH
PROMOTING GOOD HEALTH IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES 
Twinings Ovaltine relies on suppliers in 
India and China to source the majority of 
its tea. These developing countries face 
numerous challenging health issues and 
the business has formed partnerships 
with three major international NGOs  
to play a part in mitigating them.
Protecting girls on tea estates  
in Assam, India
Twinings Ovaltine is currently working 
with UNICEF on 63 tea estates to support 
34,000 girls who live on the tea estates 
where their parents work. The project 
aims to empower and protect the girls 
through the formation and strengthening 
of adolescent girls’ groups and child 
protection committees and nutrition- 
related activities such as setting up 
health food shops, kitchen gardens, 
cooking demonstrations and  
nutrition sessions. 
Supporting child and maternal  
health in Yunnan, China
Since 2011, Twinings Ovaltine has 
worked with Save the Children in  
Yunnan to train healthcare providers  
in this remote and mountainous area 
where there is limited access to health 
services and a lack of knowledge  
about child health. To date, 107 village 
healthcare providers and 15,000 
caregivers have been trained, and  
there has been a 26% reduction in  
the mortality rate of children through 
training healthcare workers and 
educating communities.
REFORMULATION FOR  
HEALTHIER PRODUCTS
All our food businesses are engaged  
in a continual process of product review 
and reformulation. Our priority is to 
respond to consumers’ needs and 
provide products that help them  
lead healthy lives.
Our UK Grocery businesses are all 
signatories to the UK government’s 
Responsibility Deal on Public Health  
and, over recent years, they have made 
adjustments to many of their products 
to reduce the sugar, salt and fat content 
while maintaining taste. For example, 
Jordans, Dorset & Ryvita uses some 
added sugar in its granola and cluster 
cereals to add flavour and hold the 
ingredients together. Over the past  
18 months, it has made incremental 
reductions and has achieved an 
average 12% cut in added sugar  
across the range.
Our Ingredients businesses  
are well positioned to use their  
scientific research and development  
to make essential ingredients healthier.  
AB Mauri has created a way to reduce 
the sodium content of certain 
ingredients and is working on new 
lower-sodium baking powders.
EDUCATING CONSUMERS ABOUT SUGAR
As a responsible business, AB Sugar  
is actively contributing to the debate 
about the role that sugar can play as  
part of a healthy, balanced diet. Launched 
in September 2014, the Making Sense  
of Sugar education campaign  
(www.makingsenseofsugar.com)  
aims to help inform and educate people  
about sugar and the role it can play  
as part of a healthy balanced diet. The 
content is based on robust science and 
informed dialogue, with information 
about sugar provided in a way which  
is straightforward and informative.
The consumer-friendly website tackles 
myths about sugar as well as offering 
films, guides, recipes and interactive 
quizzes. The website is continually 
evolving to reflect the latest scientific 
consensus, UK dietary guidelines, 
consumer questions and feedback. 
It now hosts a regular guest blog 
written by leading experts plus 
a Guide to Sugars that helps 
consumers understand the calories 
and sugars in some everyday kitchen 
and seasonal favourites.
Promoting good health is  
a principle our businesses  
put into action every day. 
At the most direct level, this means 
striving for the highest standards on  
food safety and improving the nutritional 
content of our food and ingredients. 
Where we have less control, we aim to 
use our influence to improve the health  
of the people around us by implementing 
employee wellbeing programmes and 
supporting the health of workers in 
developing countries. Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015

Risk management
The board views effective risk management 
as part of its role in providing strategic 
oversight and stewardship of the group. 
In order to deliver our strategic plans, we 
believe we must understand and respond 
appropriately to risks and also consider 
whether additional business opportunities 
can be realised through effective risk 
management.
We require all of our businesses to 
implement appropriate levels of risk 
management to ensure compliance 
with relevant legislation, our overriding 
business principles and group policies 
relating to them.
We have embedded a process for 
identifying risks and put in place activities  
to mitigate them. Our decentralised 
business model empowers the 
management of our businesses to 
identify, evaluate and manage the risks 
they face on a timely basis. The collated 
risks from each business are shared with 
the respective divisional chief executives 
who present their divisional risks to the 
group executive.
The group’s Director of Financial Control 
receives the risk assessments on an 
annual basis and, with the Group Finance 
Director, reviews them with the divisional 
chief executives. These reviews include 
questioning the approach taken to risk 
management in the businesses, reviewing 
the detailed risk logs and supporting 
materials, checking how well processes 
are embedded, and questioning how 
effectively risk management has driven 
business decisions. These risks and  
their impact on business performance  
are reported during the year and are 
considered as part of the monthly 
management review process.
Group functional heads including Legal, 
Treasury, Tax, IT, Pensions, HR and 
Insurance also provide input to this 
process, sharing with the Director of 
Financial Control their view of key risks 
and what activities are in place or planned 
to mitigate them.
A summary of these risk assessments is 
then shared and discussed with the Group 
Finance Director and Chief Executive.
The board undertakes an annual review 
of the material risks facing our businesses 
together with the internal control 
procedures and resources devoted to 
them. It also monitors the group’s 
exposure to these risks as part of the 
performance reviews undertaken at  
each board meeting. Financial risks are 
reviewed by the Audit Committee and all 
other risks are reviewed by the board.
The Director of Financial Control holds 
meetings with each of the non-executive 
directors seeking their feedback on  
the reviews performed and discussing  
the key risks and mitigating activities. 
Once all non-executive directors have 
been consulted, a board report is  
prepared summarising the full process  
and providing an assessment of the  
status of risk management across the 
group. The key risks, mitigating controls 
and relevant policies are summarised.  
This report also details when formal 
updates, relating to the key risks, will  
be provided to the board throughout  
the year.
Reporting our principal risks  
and uncertainties
The group’s principal risks and 
uncertainties identified by the above 
process during 2015 are detailed in the 
following tables. They are grouped into 
external risks, which may occur in the 
markets or environment in which we 
operate, and operational risks, which are 
related to internal activity linked to our 
own operations and internal controls.
The ‘Changes since 2014’ highlight the 
significant variations in the profile of our 
principal risks or describe our experience 
and activity over the last year.
These are the principal risks of the group  
as a whole and are not in any order of 
priority. The operational and product 
diversity of the group reduces the impact 
that any one business risk can have on  
the group’s results. Risks such as the loss 
of a major site or water use and availability 
have been reported in previous years and, 
although we remain exposed to them  
and continue to take action to mitigate 
them, we no longer consider them likely  
to have a material impact.

MOVEMENT IN EXCHANGE RATES 
AND INFLATION
Associated British Foods is a multinational 
group with operations and transactions  
in many currencies.
Changes in exchange rates give rise  
to transactional exposures within the 
businesses and to translation exposures 
when the assets, liabilities and results  
of overseas entities are translated into 
sterling upon consolidation.
Exchange rates between some of our  
major trading currencies have changed 
markedly this year.
Businesses impacted by exchange  
rate volatility, specifically those 
manufacturing or purchasing in one 
currency and selling in another, 
constantly review their currency  
related exposures.
Board approved policies require 
businesses to hedge, using foreign 
exchange forward contracts, all 
transactional currency exposures, and 
long-term supply or purchase contracts 
which give rise to currency exposures.
Borrowings are largely maintained in the 
functional currency of the local operations.
Cross currency swaps are used to  
align borrowings with the underlying 
currencies of the group’s net assets.
(Refer to note 24 to the financial 
statements for more information.)
The US dollar appreciated and the euro 
weakened over the last 12 months  
with the effect that the average US 
dollar/euro exchange rate moved by  
15% over that period.
The impact on adjusted operating profit 
for 2014/15 from the translation of 
overseas results into sterling was a loss 
of £31m compared with the prior year.
Towards the end of the financial year, 
emerging market currencies weakened 
significantly against sterling.
FLUCTUATIONS IN COMMODITY  
AND ENERGY PRICES
Changes in commodity and energy prices 
can have a material impact on the group’s 
operating results, asset values and 
cash flows.
We constantly monitor the markets in 
which we operate and manage certain 
of these exposures through the use  
of exchange traded contracts and 
hedging instruments.
The commercial implications of 
commodity price movements are 
continuously assessed and, where 
appropriate, are reflected in the  
pricing of our products.
Our businesses have been affected by 
the global trends in commodity prices, 
the most significant of which have  
been low EU and world sugar prices  
that had a substantial effect on the 
profitability of our sugar businesses,  
and a fall in cereal prices which 
contributed to lower revenues for  
AB Agri’s UK feed business.
OPERATING IN GLOBAL MARKETS
Operating in 48 countries with a supply 
chain covering even more, we are exposed 
to global market forces, fluctuations in 
national economies, societal and political 
changes, a range of consumer concerns 
and evolving legislation.
Failure to recognise and respond to any  
of these factors could directly impact  
the profitability and even the viability  
of our operations.
Entering new markets is a risk to  
any business.
Our approach to risk management 
incorporates potential short-term market 
volatility and evaluates longer-term 
socio-economic and political scenarios.
The group’s financial control framework 
and board adopted tax and treasury 
policies require all businesses to comply 
fully with relevant local laws. Provision 
is made for known issues based 
on management’s interpretation of 
country-specific tax law and the 
likely outcome.
We engage with governments, local 
regulators and community organisations 
to contribute to, and anticipate important 
changes in, public policy.
Extensive research is conducted into 
each new market that Primark enters, 
and, in the case of its entry into the  
US where there is no existing local 
infrastructure, care has been taken to 
limit capital investment to a minimum. 
Expansion into new markets in Europe  
is supported by our existing business 
which has extensive experience of 
developing a successful retail business 
model across Western Europe.
AB Sugar is addressing the 
consequences of the abolition of  
EU sugar quotas in 2017 and the 
performance improvement programme 
is substantially reducing the cost base 
and enhancing production efficiency.
No significant regulatory developments 
have impacted our group during 2015 
although our businesses are subject  
to increased enforcement activities  
in relation to existing regulations in,  
for example, China and India.
Activity continued over the last 12 
months in preparation for the opening,  
in September 2015, of Primark’s  
first store in the US, supported by 
dedicated warehousing.

HEALTH AND NUTRITION
Failure to respond appropriately to health 
and nutrition concerns in the formulation  
of our products could result in adverse 
consumer reaction.
We must also act responsibly across  
the spectrum of food poverty and 
malnutrition to obesity.
Recipes are regularly reviewed and 
reformulated to improve the nutritional 
value of our grocery products, all of 
which are labelled with nutritional 
information.
We develop partnerships with  
other organisations to help educate 
consumers about making healthy 
choices.
Our businesses continued to review 
their products and to partner with  
others to enable a swift and innovative 
response to changing consumer needs. 
As examples: across the Jordans range 
of granola and cluster cereals we have 
reduced the sugar content by 12% and, 
using scientific research, AB Mauri  
has been developing a way to reduce 
high sodium ingredients such as 
lower-sodium baking powders.
British Sugar and Azucarera both 
launched or supported websites aimed 
at helping people make informed 
decisions about their food.
OPERATIONAL RISKS
Risk trend Context and potential impact Mitigation Changes since 2014
WORKPLACE HEALTH AND SAFETY
Many of our operations, by their nature, 
have the potential for injuries and fatal 
accidents to employees, contractors  
and visitors.
Safety continues to be the number one 
priority for our businesses with active 
endorsement and accountability from 
the chief executives of each business.
Our Health and Safety Policy and 
practices are firmly embedded in each 
business, supporting a strong ethos of 
workplace safety. Independent audits 
are conducted to verify implementation 
and support continuous improvement.
Best practice safety and occupational 
health training and guidance are shared 
across the businesses, co-ordinated 
from the corporate centre, to supplement 
the delivery of their own training 
programmes.
Sadly we had one fatality this year  
which occurred in our operations  
in Africa.
Our group reportable injury rate 
increased slightly this year from 0.40%  
to 0.48%. However, our operations 
across Africa, Australasia and North 
America continued their downward 
trend in reportable injuries.
We have introduced contractor  
safety guidance across the group.
PRODUCT SAFETY AND QUALITY
As a leading food manufacturer and  
retailer it is fundamental that we manage 
the safety and integrity of our products 
throughout the supply chain.
Across the group, product safety is  
put before economic considerations.
Our businesses employ quality control 
specialists and operate strict policies 
within an organisational culture of 
hygiene and product safety to ensure 
that consistently high standards are 
maintained in our operations and in the 
sourcing and handling of raw materials 
and garments.
We monitor the regulatory environment 
and emerging scientific research while 
reviewing our food safety systems for 
efficacy and legal compliance.
A programme of independent food 
quality and safety audits is undertaken 
across all of our manufacturing sites  
and a due diligence programme is in 
place to ensure the safety of our  
retail products.

OUR USE OF NATURAL  
RESOURCES AND MANAGING  
OUR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
Our businesses rely on a stable supply  
of natural resources some of which  
are vulnerable to external factors such  
as natural disasters and climate change.
Our operations give rise to a range of 
emissions including dust, waste water  
and waste which, if not controlled,  
could lead to a risk to the environment  
and our local communities.
We aim to go beyond environmental 
compliance. Our businesses employ 
environmental specialists who  
use the best available technologies  
and techniques to reduce our use  
of consumables, adapt operations  
to climate change and reduce our 
environmental footprint.
We report group environmental 
performance every year in our  
Corporate Responsibility and Annual 
Reports as well as the voluntary  
CDP disclosure (formerly Carbon 
Disclosure Project).
The environmental performance of  
the group, with updates by division,  
is reported in the 2015 Corporate 
Responsibility Update at  
www.abf.co.uk/responsibility.
OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND  
ETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICES
Our suppliers are essential to the 
successful operation of the group.  
We therefore work with them to ensure 
reliability and to help them meet acceptable 
standards of product quality and safety, 
financial stability, ethics, technical 
competence and people safety.
Potential supply chain and ethical business 
practice risks include:
• reputational damage through supply  
chain weaknesses e.g. poor conditions 
for workers;
• unacceptable and unethical behaviour, 
including bribery and corruption;
• impact on reliability of supply and 
business continuity due to unforeseen 
incidents e.g. natural disasters; and
• long-term sustainability of key suppliers. 
Our Supplier Code of Conduct  
is designed to ensure suppliers, 
representatives and all with whom  
we deal, adhere to our values and 
standards. The full Code is available  
at www.abf.co.uk/supplier_code_ 
of_conduct.
Adherence to the Code is verified 
through ABF’s supplier audit system 
with our procurement and operational 
teams establishing strong working 
relationships with suppliers to help  
them meet our standards.
All businesses are required to comply 
with the group’s Business Principles 
including its Anti-Bribery and  
Corruption Policy.
Over the year, our businesses have 
continued to engage with key suppliers 
on a range of shared issues such as 
maximising environmental and cost 
efficiencies, maintaining safe workplaces, 
supporting steady employment and 
increasing transparency across  
the wider supply chain.
We have increased our ethical trade 
resources, both on-the-ground and 
centrally, to monitor suppliers.
Primark signed up to Greenpeace’s 
Detox campaign and has committed to 
phase out the use of certain chemicals 
within the supply chain by 2020.
BREACHES OF IT AND  
INFORMATION SECURITY
Our delivery of efficient and effective 
operations is enhanced by the use of 
relevant technologies and the sharing  
of information. We are therefore subject  
to potential internal and external cyber 
threats such as computer viruses and  
the loss or theft of data.
There is also the potential for disruption  
to operations from unforeseen IT and 
system malfunctions or external attack.
We seek to understand the changing 
cyber risks faced by our businesses  
and take appropriate action.
We have well established processes, 
group IT security policies and 
technologies in place all of which  
are subject to regular internal audit.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Dear fellow shareholders
I am pleased to present the Associated British Foods corporate governance report for the year ended 12 September 2015.
One of the key responsibilities in my role as Chairman is to promote good corporate governance, which is a vital element in ensuring  
our future as a successful and sustainable company. Good governance requires the right leadership. While the current board is  
made up of directors from a variety of international backgrounds and sectors, we continue to assess its composition with the aim  
of maintaining an effective balance and diversity of skills and experience to meet the Company’s present needs but with a view  
to refreshing board membership over the coming years so that it evolves along with the group.
As I have highlighted in my Chairman’s statement on page 5, in January 2015, we were delighted to welcome Wolfhart Hauser  
to the board as an independent non-executive director. Wolfhart brings a strong track record of driving profitable growth and value 
creation in a large international organisation, as well as having extensive board experience of several major UK listed companies.  
We report on the formal process by which Wolfhart was appointed in the Nomination committee report on page 68.
In May 2014, the Financial Conduct Authority introduced changes to the listing regime as part of a series of measures to strengthen 
minority shareholder protection in companies such as ours with a controlling shareholder. During the year under review, in compliance 
with the provisions, we entered into a relationship agreement with the Company’s controlling shareholders. Details about the relationship 
agreement can be found on page 91 of the Directors’ report. Following the introduction of these measures, the board undertook  
a detailed review of its corporate governance framework and has updated and enhanced, where necessary, its processes  
and documentation.
I am pleased to report that we made good progress against a number of actions agreed following the 2014 board performance 
evaluation exercise and which we identified in last year’s report. Our 2015 board evaluation was externally facilitated by consultants  
from Bvalco Limited and this provided both positive and constructive feedback. The board evaluation process and a summary  
of the key outcomes are described on page 66.
In the following pages, we explain in greater detail our approach to governance – how the board and its committees have fulfilled their 
governance responsibilities during the year to ensure that robust governance practices are embedded across the group. As always, we 
welcome questions or comments from shareholders either via our website www.abf.co.uk or in person at the annual general meeting.
Charles Sinclair
Chairman
Compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code
As a premium listed company on the 
London Stock Exchange, the Company  
is reporting in accordance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code published in 
September 2012 (the ‘Code’) which sets 
out standards of good practice in relation 
to board leadership and effectiveness, 
remuneration, accountability and relations 
with shareholders. The Code is published 
by the UK Financial Reporting Council 
(‘FRC’) and a copy of the Code is available 
from the FRC website (www.frc.org.uk).
An updated version of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code was published in 
September 2014 and first applies to 
companies with financial years commencing 
on or after 1 October 2014 (the ‘2014 Code’). 
The Company will therefore report in 
accordance with the 2014 Code in its  
2016 annual report.
The board considers that the Company has, 
throughout the year ended 12 September 
2015, applied the main principles and 
complied with the provisions set out in  
the Code, with the exception of the 
chairmanship of the Remuneration 
committee (see below).
Leadership
The board
The board of directors is collectively 
responsible to the Company’s shareholders 
for the direction and oversight of the 
Company to ensure its long-term success. 
The board met regularly throughout the 
year to approve the group’s strategic 
objectives, to lead the group within a 
framework of effective controls which 
enable risk to be assessed and managed 
and to ensure that sufficient resources  
are available to meet the objectives set.
There are a number of matters which  
are specifically reserved for the board’s 
approval. These are set out in a clearly 
defined schedule, which includes: matters 
relating to the group’s strategic plan; 
approving the annual business strategy 
and objectives; the nature and extent of 
principal risks to be taken to achieve the 
strategic objectives; changes relating to 
structure and capital; approval of trading 
statements, interim results, final results  
and annual report and accounts; declaring 
interim dividends and recommending final 
dividends; the group’s policies and systems 
of internal control and risk management, 
approving capital projects, acquisitions 
and disposals valued at over £30m; 
provision of adequate succession planning, 
approving major group policies and matters 
relating to the compliance with the terms 
of the Relationship Agreement between 
the Company and its controlling 
shareholders dated 14 November 2014. 
Code provision Status Explanation
D.2.1 – The Chairman 
should not chair  
the Remuneration 
committee
Charles Sinclair is 
both Chairman of  
the Company and 
chairman of the 
Remuneration 
committee.
The board of Associated British Foods plc 
continues to consider that Charles Sinclair,  
due to his experience, is best suited to  
chair this committee. No director has any 
involvement in the determination of his own 
remuneration. The board believes that the 
Company has maintained robust governance 
while at the same time benefiting from 
having Charles Sinclair as the chairman  
of the Remuneration committee. Governance

  Wolfhart Hauser was appointed as a director and member of the Remuneration committee on  
14 January 2015, and as a member of the Audit Committee from 13 April 2015. He was unable  
to attend the additional, unscheduled, board meeting that was held during the year. However,  
he reviewed the relevant information and provided comments as appropriate to the Chairman.
The schedule of matters reserved for the 
board was reviewed during the year and 
an updated version of the document was 
approved and adopted at the September 
2015 board meeting. The schedule can be 
found on the corporate governance section 
of the Company’s website (abf.co.uk).
Certain specific responsibilities are 
delegated to the board committees, 
notably the Audit, Remuneration and 
Nomination committees, which operate 
within clearly defined terms of reference 
and report regularly to the board. For 
further details, please see ‘Board 
committees’ section below.
Authority for the operational management 
of the group’s business has been delegated 
to the Chief Executive for execution or 
further delegation by him for the effective 
day-to-day running and management of 
the group. The chief executive of each 
business within the group has authority  
for that business and reports directly  
to the Chief Executive.
Chairman and Chief Executive
The roles of the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive are separately held and the 
division of their responsibilities is clearly 
established, set out in writing, and agreed 
by the board to ensure that no one has 
unfettered powers of decision. The 
Chairman, Charles Sinclair, is responsible for 
the operation and leadership of the board, 
ensuring its effectiveness and setting its 
agenda. The Chief Executive, George 
Weston, is responsible for leading and 
managing the group’s business within a set 
of authorities delegated by the board and the 
implementation of board strategy and policy.
Senior Independent Director
Tim Clarke is the Company’s recognised 
Senior Independent Director. The role  
of the Senior Independent Director is to 
act as a sounding board for the Chairman 
and to serve as an intermediary for other 
directors where necessary. He is also 
available to shareholders should a need 
arise to convey concerns to the board 
which they have been unable to convey 
through the Chairman or through the 
executive directors. During the year, led  
by the Senior Independent Director, the 
non-executive directors have met without 
the presence of the Chairman (including  
to appraise the Chairman’s performance).
The non-executive directors
In addition to their responsibilities for 
strategy and business results, the 
non-executive directors play a key role  
in providing a solid foundation for good 
corporate governance and ensure that no 
individual or group dominates the board’s 
decision-making. They each occupy, or 
have occupied, senior positions in industry 
or public life, bringing valuable external 
perspective to the board’s deliberations 
through their experience and insight from 
other sectors enabling them to contribute 
significantly to board decision-making.  
The formal letters of appointment of 
non-executive directors are available  
for inspection at the Company’s  
registered office.
Election and re-election of directors
In accordance with the Code’s 
recommendations, all directors will be 
proposed for election or re-election at the 
2015 annual general meeting to be held  
in December with the exception of Lord 
Jay who, as indicated in the Chairman’s 
statement on page 5 will be retiring as  
a non-executive director with effect  
from 30 November 2015.
Board meetings
The board held a total of nine meetings 
during the year, eight scheduled and one 
additional meeting. Periodically, board 
meetings take place away from the 
corporate centre in London. During the 
year under review, one of the meetings 
was held in Berlin where the board visited 
the two Primark stores located there, 
providing the non-executive directors in 
particular with the opportunity to meet 
local management and other employees. 
The board also held one of its meetings  
in Hampshire and visited the Jordans  
& Ryvita premises in Poole for a site  
tour and business presentation from  
local management.
Senior executives below board level are 
invited, when appropriate, to attend board 
meetings and to make presentations on 
the results and strategies of their business 
units. Papers for board and committee 
meetings are generally provided to 
directors for board and committee 
meetings a week in advance.
The attendance of the directors at board 
and committee meetings during the year 
to 12 September 2015 is shown in the 
table below. Where a director is unable  
to participate in a meeting either in person 
or remotely, the Chairman solicited their 
views on key items of business in advance 
of the relevant meeting, so that these  
could be shared with the meeting and 
contribute to the debate.
Board committees
The board has established three principal 
board committees, to which it has delegated 
certain of its responsibilities. These are  
the Audit committee, the Nomination 
committee, and the Remuneration 
committee. The membership, 
responsibilities and activities of these 
committees are described later in this 
corporate governance report and, in the 
case of the Remuneration committee,  
in the Remuneration report on page 88. 
Membership of these committees is 
reviewed annually. Minutes of committee 
meetings are made available to all 
directors on a timely basis.
The chairman of the Audit, Nomination 
and Remuneration committees intend to 
be present at the annual general meeting 
to answer questions on the work of their 
respective committees. Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
64 Governance | Corporate governance |
The written terms of reference for the 
Nomination, Audit and Remuneration 
committees, all of which were reviewed 
and updated during the year, are  
available on the Company’s website 
(www.abf.co.uk) and hard copies are 
available on request.
Directors’ insurance
The Company has in place appropriate 
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance 
cover in respect of legal action against  
its executive and non-executive directors, 
amongst others.

Effectiveness
Board composition
At the date of this report, the board 
comprises the following directors:
Chairman
Charles Sinclair
Executive directors
George Weston (Chief Executive)
John Bason (Finance Director)
Non-executive directors
Emma Adamo
Ruth Cairnie 
Tim Clarke
Javier Ferrán
Lord Jay
Wolfhart Hauser (appointed on  
14 January 2015)
Peter Smith
Emma Adamo is not considered to  
be independent by the board in view  
of her relationship with Wittington 
Investments Limited, the Company’s 
majority shareholder. She was appointed  
in December 2011 to represent this 
shareholding on the board of the 
Company. The board considers that the 
other six non-executive directors are 
independent in character and judgement 
and that they are each free from any 
business or other relationships which 
would materially interfere with the 
exercise of their independent judgement.
The Code requires that, if a director  
has served on the board for more than 
nine years, the board should state the 
reasons why it considers the director, 
notwithstanding his or her length of 
service, to be independent. Accordingly, 
the board has considered the independence 
of Tim Clarke and Javier Ferrán as follows:
• as at 3 November 2015, Tim Clarke  
has served 11 years as a director of the 
Company. The board has continued to 
keep Tim’s independence under close 
review given his length of service. 
Having given careful consideration to 
the matter, the board is satisfied that 
Tim Clarke continues to demonstrate 
the qualities of independence in carrying 
out his role as a non-executive director 
and Senior Independent Director, 
supporting the team in an objective  
and independent manner. The board 
considers that he continues to be 
independent in character and judgement 
and that there are no relationships or 
circumstances which are likely to affect, 
or could appear to affect, his judgement. 
Tim retains his role as Senior Independent 
Director and will offer himself for 
re-election at this year’s annual general 
meeting. The board will continue to 
keep his independence under review.
• as at 1 November 2015, Javier Ferrán 
has served nine years as a director  
of the Company. Javier’s service and 
consequent knowledge and experience 
of the group, together with the invaluable 
retail experience he brings to the role, 
are highly regarded by the board.  
In recognition of this length of service, 
however, he stepped down from the 
Audit committee on 26 October 2015. 
Notwithstanding his length of service 
and, having given due deliberation to  
the matter, the board is satisfied that 
Javier Ferrán continues to demonstrate 
the qualities of independence and 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Governance
Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015

objectivity in carrying out his role as  
a non-executive director. The board 
considers that he continues to  
be independent in character and 
judgement and that there are no 
relationships or circumstances which  
are likely to affect, or could appear  
to affect, his judgement. Javier will  
offer himself for re-election at this  
year’s annual general meeting and  
the board will continue to keep his 
independence under review.
Following the retirement of Lord Jay as  
a non-executive director on 30 November 
2015, the board will comprise the 
Chairman, Chief Executive, Finance 
Director and six non-executive directors.
Biographical and related information  
about the directors is set out on pages  
60 and 61.
Appointments to the board
There is a formal, rigorous and transparent 
procedure for the appointment of new 
directors to the board. Details are available 
in the Nomination committee report  
set out on page 69 which also provides 
details of the committee’s role  
and activities.
Commitment
The letters of appointment for the 
Chairman and the non-executive directors 
set out the expected time commitment 
required of them and are available for 
inspection by any person during normal 
business hours at the Company’s 
registered office and at the annual general 
meeting. Other significant commitments 
of the Chairman and non-executive 
directors are disclosed on appointment 
and require approval thereafter.
Board development
The Chairman, with the support of the 
Company Secretary, is responsible for  
the induction of new directors and the 
continuing development of directors.
Board induction
Wolfhart Hauser joined the board as a  
non-executive director on 14 January 2015 
and undertook a formal, tailored programme 
of induction. This was facilitated by the 
Chairman and the Company Secretary. 
The induction programme aimed to 
familiarise Wolfhart with the way the 
group operates through its five strategic 
business segments and with its 
governance arrangements. The 
programme took into account his 
experience and business perspectives, 
and the committees on which he  
serves. New directors are encouraged  
to accelerate their knowledge of the  
group by visiting a number of its 
businesses and operations.

obligations under the Company’s share 
dealing policy as well as regular updates 
on other developments on matters of 
corporate governance.
Information flow

provision of information to the board at 
appropriate times in consultation with the 
Chairman and Chief Executive. In addition 
to formal meetings, the Chairman and 
Chief Executive maintain regular contact 
with all directors. The Chairman also holds 
informal meetings with non-executive 
directors, without any of the executives 
being present, to discuss any issues 
affecting the group, if this is thought 
necessary. Regular management  
updates are sent to directors to keep the 
non-executive directors informed of 
events throughout the group between 
board meetings and to ensure that  
they are kept fully advised of the latest 
issues affecting the group. Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015

A list of action points arising from  
the 2015 review on how the board can 
become even more effective was offered 
by Bvalco and subsequently agreed by  
the board. These agreed action points  
in the form of a board development plan 
are being implemented under the direction 
of the Chairman and include actions 
identified in the table below.
2015 Objectives
Role of the board 
Following acknowledgement that board 
strategy sessions had continued to develop 
very positively, it is proposed that in future 
there should be a greater emphasis on 
‘portfolio management’ of the group and 
development of a longer-term financial 
plan, with a similar approach to be adopted 
on considerations of group risk.
Engagement with divisional 
level executive
The regular programme of presentations  
by divisional heads to be made more 
dynamic by a number of means, including 
prior disclosure of the presentation to  
the board, more time at the board being  
set aside to be spent discussing issues  
and strategic choices arising from  
the presentation.
Succession and resource
Various actions identified, to be actioned 
through the Nomination committee,  
to enhance the formal succession  
planning process in the group.
Board support
Use of electronic board papers  
to be trialled.
Conflicts of interest procedure
The Company has procedures in place, 
which were reviewed and updated  
during the year, to deal with the situation 
where a director has a conflict of interest. 
As part of this process, the board:
• considers each conflict situation 
separately on its particular facts;
• considers the conflict situation  
in conjunction with the rest of the 
conflicted directors’ duties under  
the 2006 Act;
• keeps records and board minutes as  
to authorisations granted by directors 
and the scope of any approvals  
given; and
• regularly reviews conflict authorisation.
Board performance evaluation
An evaluation to assess the performance  
of the board as a whole, its committees 
and that of the individual directors  
is conducted annually with the aim  
of improving the effectiveness of  
the board and its members and the 
performance of the group.
In accordance with the Code requirement 
that the evaluation should be conducted  
by an external facilitator at least every 
three years, Bvalco Limited (Bvalco)  
was engaged to undertake a review of  
the board. The review took place in the  
final quarter of the financial year. Bvalco  
is independent with no other connection 
with the Company.
Following a scoping exercise with the 
Chairman and the Senior Independent 
Director to agree the priority areas and 
issues to be addressed in the review, 
Bvalco undertook a confidential interview 
with each of the directors and a number  
of senior executives including the 
Company Secretary. The discussion in 
each case centred on key themes and, 
among the topics discussed, were  
the strengths and values of the board,  
the quality of succession planning,  
the interaction of the board members  
with the group’s various businesses,  
the process of managing strategic 
planning and the management of risk.
Following the conclusion of the  
interviews, Bvalco produced a written 
report, which was discussed with  
the Chairman, the Chief Executive,  
and the Senior Independent Director  
before being sent to board members  
and was discussed at the following  
board meeting.
During the year, implementation of  
a number of recommended action  
points arising from the 2014 evaluation 
was overseen by the Chairman and 
included the actions set out in the  
table below.
2014 Objectives
Board impact
There was an increased focus by the  
board on Primark at each board meeting 
including fuller details of Primark’s 
performance metrics and the progress  
of Primark’s expansion into the US.
Particular board focus was given to the 
Sugar division in light of the forthcoming 
EU sugar regime reform.
More structured discussion took place  
at the board, after each divisional 
presentation, to discuss the performance  
of that division and to allow comparison 
with the performance of other divisions 
within the group.
Divisional presentations to the board have 
provided an increased level of information 
on respective key competitors and  
market demand.
Regular ‘one to one’ discussions have 
taken place between board members,  
and separately, with the Chairman and  
the Chief Executive.
Risk management
The handling of risk continued to be a 
priority for the Audit committee and the 
board, and each business division has  
been encouraged to cover risk routinely  
in their presentations to the board.
Corporate responsibility
Given the growing importance of 
environmental issues to the group,  
the annual report to the board on the 
environment was separated from  
the report on health and safety.
Based on the outcome of the 2015  
review, it was concluded that the board 
continues to work very effectively  
as a cohesive body with a good balance  
of support, challenge and mutual trust 
between the executives and the 
non-executives. 
It was also the board’s view that, overall, 
the principal committees continued  
to function efficiently and effectively.  
Each of the directors was considered  
to be making a valuable contribution  
and with proper commitment, including  
of time, to their respective roles.

Accountability
Financial and business reporting
The board is required by the Code to 
present a fair, balanced and understandable 
assessment of the Company’s position 
and prospects. In relation to this 
requirement, reference is made to the 
statement of directors’ responsibilities  
for preparing the financial statements set 
out on page 93 of this annual report and 
accounts. The board recognises that its 
responsibility to present a fair, balanced 
and understandable assessment extends 
to interim and other price-sensitive  
public reports, reports to regulators, and 
information required to be presented by 
statutory requests.
Business model
A description of the Company’s business 
model for sustainable growth is set out  
in the group business model and strategy 
section on pages 8 and 9 and in the 
business strategies section on pages  
10 and 11. These sections provide an 
explanation of the basis on which the 
group generates value and preserves it 
over the long term and its strategy for 
delivering its objectives.
Going concern
After making enquiries the directors have 
a reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the group have adequate resources  
to continue in operational existence for  
the foreseeable future. Accordingly, and 
consistent with the guidance contained  
in the document titled ‘Going Concern  
and Liquidity Risk: Guidance for Directors 
of UK Companies 2009’ published by the 
FRC, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the annual 
financial statements.
Internal control and risk management
The board acknowledges its responsibilities 
for the group’s system of internal control 
to facilitate the identification, assessment 
and management of risk, the protection of 
shareholders’ investments and the group’s 
assets. The directors recognise that they 
are responsible for providing a return to 
shareholders, which is consistent with  
the responsible assessment and mitigation 
of risks.
Effective controls ensure that the group’s 
exposure to avoidable risk is minimised, 
that proper accounting records are 
maintained, that the financial information 
used within the business is reliable and 
that the consolidated accounts preparation 
and financial reporting processes comply 
with all relevant regulatory reporting 
requirements. The dynamics of the group 
and the environment within which it 
operates are continually evolving together 
with its exposure to risk. The system is 
designed to manage, rather than eliminate, 
the risk of assets being unprotected and  
to guard against their unauthorised use and 
the failure to achieve business objectives. 
Internal controls can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
The directors confirm that there is a 
process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the risks faced by the group  
and the operational effectiveness of the 
related controls, which has been in place 
for the year under review and up to the 
date of approval of the annual report and 
accounts. They also confirm that they 
have regularly reviewed the system  
of internal controls utilising the review 
process set out below.
Standards
There are guidelines on the minimum 
groupwide requirements for health and 
safety and environmental standards. 
There are also guidelines on the minimum 
level of internal control that each of the 
divisions should exercise over specified 
processes. Each business has developed 
and documented policies and procedures 
to comply with the minimum control 
standards established, including 
procedures for monitoring compliance  
and taking corrective action. The board  
of each business is required to confirm 
twice yearly that it has complied with 
these policies and procedures.
High level controls
All businesses prepare annual operating 
plans and budgets which are updated 
regularly. Performance against budget  
is monitored at operational level and 
centrally, with variances being reported 
promptly. The cash position at group and 
operational level is monitored constantly 
and variances from expected levels are 
investigated thoroughly.
Clearly defined guidelines have been 
established for capital expenditure and 
investment decisions. These include  
the preparation of budgets, appraisal  
and review procedures, and delegated 
authority levels.
Financial reporting
Detailed management accounts are 
prepared every four weeks, consolidated 
in a single system and reviewed by senior 
management and the board. They include 
a comprehensive set of financial reports 
and key performance indicators covering 
commercial, operational, environmental 
and people issues. Performance against 
budgets and forecasts is discussed 
regularly at board meetings and at 
meetings between operational and  
group management. The adequacy and 
suitability of key performance indicators  
is reviewed regularly. All chief executives 
and finance directors of the group’s 
operations are asked to sign an annual 
confirmation that their business has 
complied with the Group Accounting 
Manual in the preparation of consolidated 
financial statements and specifically  
to confirm the adequacy and accuracy  
of accounting provisions.
Internal audit
The group’s businesses employ internal 
auditors (both employees and resources 
provided by Ernst & Young where 
appropriate) with skills and experience 
relevant to the operation of each business. 
These arrangements are currently under 
review in light of the selection of Ernst & 
Young LLP as the Company’s new auditor, 
following a formal tender process, details  
of which are set out in the Audit committee 
report on page 73. All of the internal audit 
activities are co-ordinated centrally by the 
group’s Director of Financial Control, who 
is accountable to the Audit committee.
All group businesses are required to 
comply with the group’s financial control 
framework that sets out minimum control 
standards. A key function of the group’s 
internal audit resources is to undertake 
audits to ensure compliance with the 
financial control framework and make 
recommendations for improvement in 
controls where appropriate. Internal  
audit also conducts regular reviews to 
ensure that risk management procedures 
and controls are observed. The Audit 
committee receives regular reports on  
the results of internal audit’s work and 
monitors the status of recommendations 
arising. The committee reviews annually 
the adequacy, qualifications and 
experience of the group’s internal audit 
resources and the nature and scope of 
internal audit activity in the overall context

amongst the directors of the Company,  
in consultation with the Chairman. The 
committee comprises a minimum of three 
members at any time, a majority of whom 
are independent non-executive directors.

Relations with shareholders
Engaging with shareholders
The board works to engage effectively  
with the Company’s shareholders  
so that both its objectives and those  
of shareholders are understood. 
The Company announces its achievements 
and prospects to shareholders by way  
of the interim results and annual report 
and accounts. Significant matters  
relating to the trading or development  
of the business are disseminated to  
the market by way of Stock Exchange 
announcements and by press release  
and postings on the Company’s website.
The board continues to promote effective 
engagement with its shareholders.  
The Chairman invites larger institutional 
shareholders each year to discuss their 
views on the group’s approach on 
governance, strategy and remuneration. 
The Chief Executive and Finance Director 
have met institutional shareholders  
and financial analysts on a regular basis 
throughout the year to discuss the 
Company’s business strategy and current 
performance. At each board meeting,  
the directors are briefed on shareholder 
meetings that have taken place and on  
the feedback received.
The Senior Independent Director is 
available to shareholders in the event  
that communication with the Chairman, 
Chief Executive or Finance Director  
has failed to resolve concerns or  
where such contact is inappropriate.  
The Senior Independent Director  
attended sufficient meetings with a  
range of major shareholders to listen  
to their views in order to help develop  
a balanced understanding of their  
issues and concerns.
The Company Secretary acts as a  
focal point for communications on  
matters of corporate governance  
and corporate responsibility.
Annual general meeting (AGM)
The AGM will be held on Friday,  
4 December 2015 at 11.00 am at the 
Congress Centre in London. The board 
views the AGM as a valuable opportunity 
to communicate with private shareholders 
in particular, for whom it provides the 
opportunity to hear about the general 
development of the business and to ask 
questions of the Chairman and, through 
him, the chairmen of the key committees 
and other directors.
The practice has been for a short film  
to be shown at the meeting explaining  
a particular area of the group’s business.  
At this year’s AGM, the film will focus  
on Primark and the lengths to which  
the business goes in preparing to enter 
new markets. For its arrival in the  
north-east of the USA, this approach  
has been raised to another level with  
local research, high attention to detail  
and tailored execution.
The Notice of AGM, which sets out in  
full the resolutions for consideration by 
shareholders together with explanatory 
notes, has been sent to shareholders  
and is also available on the Investors 
section of the Company’s website  
(www.abf.co.uk).

Only members of the committee  
have the right to attend committee 
meetings. Other individuals such as the 
Chief Executive, members of senior 
management, head of human resources 
and external advisors may be invited to 
attend meetings as and when appropriate.
The Chairman does not chair the 
Nomination committee when it is dealing 
with the appointment of his successor.  
In these circumstances the committee is 
chaired by an independent non-executive 
director elected by the remaining members.
The committee may take independent 
professional advice on any matters 
covered by its terms of reference at  
the Company’s expense.
The committee chairman reports the 
outcome of meetings to the board.
The terms of reference of the Nomination 
committee, which were reviewed and 
updated during the year, are available on 
the Investors’ section of the Company’s 
website (www.abf.co.uk).
Board appointments process
The process for making new 
appointments is led by the Chairman. 
Where appropriate, external, independent 
consultants are engaged to conduct a 
search for potential candidates, who are 
considered on the basis of their skills, 
experience and fit with the existing 
members of the board. The Nomination 
committee has procedures for appointing 
a non-executive or an executive director 
and these are set out in its terms  
of reference.
Meetings
The committee met once during the year 
under review.
Committee activities during the year
Appointment of new independent 
non-executive director
The Nomination committee and the board 
adhere to the principle that appointments 
to the board should be made on the basis 
of merit.
During the year, the Chairman led the 
process for the appointment of a new 
independent non-executive director as 
part of an ongoing programme for the 
progressive refreshing of the board.
The services of external executive  
search consulting firm, Spencer Stuart, 
were retained to help identify potential 
candidates. Spencer Stuart is independent, 
with no other connection to the Company, 
and is a signatory to the ‘Voluntary Code 
of Conduct for Executive Search Firms’  
on gender diversity and best practice.
Potential candidates were considered  
on the basis of their skills and experience 
in the context of the range of skills and 
experience of the existing board as  
a whole.
Following a rigorous process of  
interviews and assessments and, on  
the recommendation of the Nomination 
committee, the board approved the 
appointment of Wolfhart Hauser with 
effect from 14 January 2015.
Diversity policy at board level
As a board, we recognise that diversity is 
key for introducing different perspectives 
into board debate and decision-making.  
A genuinely diverse board comprises 
individuals with a range of personal 
attributes, perspectives, skills, experience 
and backgrounds, as well as representing 
differences in nationality, race and gender.
It is the board’s policy to make new 
appointments based on merit, recognising 
that gender remains an important aspect  
of the overall diversity which is crucial  
to creating an optimal board in terms  
of balance and composition. Candidates 
for future board appointments will be 
considered from the widest possible pool, 
although any executive search agencies 
engaged will be asked to ensure that half 
of the candidates they put forward for 
consideration are women.
Re-election of non-executive directors
The committee reviewed the results of 
the annual board performance evaluation 
that related to the composition of the 
board and whether the time needed  
to fulfil the roles of Chairman, Senior 
Independent Director and non-executive 
director was appropriate. It was satisfied  
that all members of the board are  
devoting sufficient time to their duties.
The committee considered the re-election 
of directors prior to their recommended 
approval by shareholders at the AGM.  
The non-executive directors who have 
been on the board for more than six  
years were subject to particularly  
rigorous review.
Performance review
The performance of the committee was 
evaluated as part of the annual board 
performance evaluation and it was found  
to be operating effectively.

Key duties
In accordance with its terms of reference,  
the Audit committee’s key duties include:
• monitoring the integrity of the group’s 
financial statements and any formal 
announcements relating to the Company’s 
performance, reviewing significant financial 
reporting judgements contained in them  
before their submission to the  
board for approval;
• on matters of financial reporting: reviewing 
and challenging where necessary, the 
consistency of, and any changes to, 
accounting and treasury policies; whether 
the group has followed appropriate 
accounting policies and made appropriate  
estimates and judgements; the clarity and 
completeness of disclosure; significant 
adjustments resulting from the audit; the

Activities during the year 
In order to fulfil its terms of reference,  
the Audit committee receives and  
reviews presentations and reports  
from the group’s senior management, 
consulting as necessary with the  
external auditors.
Monitoring the integrity of  
reported financial information
Ensuring the integrity of the financial 
statements and associated 
announcements is a fundamental 
responsibility of the Audit committee.
During the year it formally reviewed  
the group’s interim and annual reports, 
including the associated pre-close  
period trading updates, and the trading 
updates issued for the first and third 
quarters. These reviews considered:
• the accounting principles, policies  
and practices adopted in the group’s 
financial statements, any proposed 
changes to them, and the adequacy  
of their disclosure in the annual report;
• important accounting issues, areas of 
complexity and the actions, estimates 
and judgements of management in 
relation to financial reporting;
• any significant adjustments to financial 
reporting arising from the audit;
• litigation and contingent liabilities 
affecting the group; and
• potential tax contingencies, compliance 
with statutory tax obligations and the 
group’s tax policy.
Significant accounting issues 
considered by the Audit  
committee in relation to the  
group’s financial statements
In the preparation of these financial 
statements a number of areas required  
the exercise of management judgement 
or a degree of estimation. Set out opposite 
are the areas considered by the Audit 
committee to be the most significant 
accounting issues and how the committee 
concluded that such judgements and 
estimates were appropriate. These  
are divided into those that could have  
a material impact on the financial 
statements and those that are less  
likely to have a material impact but 
nevertheless, by their nature, required  
a degree of estimation.
Key duties continued
• overseeing the relationship with the group’s 
external auditors, reporting to the board 
each year whether it considers the audit 
contract should be put out to tender taking 
into account any legal requirements for 
tendering or rotation of the audit contract, 
reviewing and monitoring their objectivity 
and independence including seeking 
information from the external auditor  
on an annual basis about its policies and 
procedures for maintaining independence, 
agreeing the scope of their work and  
fees paid to them for audit, assessing  
the effectiveness of the audit process,  
and agreeing the policy in relation to  
the provision of non-audit services.
Governance
The Audit committee comprises a 
minimum of three members, all of whom 
are independent non-executive directors 
of the Company. Two members constitute 
a quorum. Appointments are for a period 
of three years after which they are subject 
to annual review, extendable by two 
further three-year periods so long as 
members continue to be independent. 
Any term beyond six years is subject  
to particularly rigorous review. The 
membership of the Audit committee has 
been refreshed over the last few months: 
Wolfhart Hauser was appointed as a 
member of the committee on 13 April 
2015, Javier Ferrán stepped down as a 
member on 26 October 2015. Lord Jay will 
cease to be a member of the committee 
on his retirement as a non-executive 
director on 30 November 2015.
The committee structure requires  
the inclusion of one financially qualified 
member (as recognised by the Consultative 
Committee of Accountancy Bodies) with 
recent and relevant financial experience. 
Currently, the committee chairman fulfils 
this requirement. All committee members 
are expected to be financially literate  
and to have an understanding of the 
following areas:
• the principles of, and developments  
in, financial reporting including the 
applicable accounting standards and 
statements of recommended practice;
• key aspects of the Company’s operations 
including corporate policies and the 
group’s internal control environment;
• matters which may influence the 
presentation of accounts and key figures;
• the principles of, and developments  
in, company law, sector-specific laws 
and other relevant corporate legislation;
• the role of internal and external  
auditing and risk management; and
• the regulatory framework for the 
group’s businesses.
The committee invites the Group Finance 
Director, Group Financial Controller, 
Director of Financial Control and senior 
representatives of the external auditors  
to attend its meetings in full, although it 
reserves the right to request any of these 
individuals to withdraw. Other senior 
managers are invited to present such 
reports as are required for the committee 
to discharge its duties.
During the year, the committee held  
four meetings with the external auditors 
without any executive members of the 
board being present.
The committee has unrestricted access  
to Company documents and information, 
as well as to employees of the Company 
and the external auditors.
The committee may take independent 
professional advice on any matters 
covered by its terms of reference at  
the Company’s expense.
The committee chairman reports the 
outcome of meetings to the board.
The committee’s effectiveness is reviewed 
on an annual basis as part of the board’s 
performance evaluation process.
The terms of reference of the Audit 
committee were reviewed and updated 
during the year and can be viewed on  
the Investors section of the Company’s 
website (www.abf.co.uk).
Meetings
The Audit committee met five times 
during the year including an additional 
meeting related to the tendering of the 
external audit. The committee agenda  
are linked to events in the group’s  
financial calendar.

Significant accounting issues material  
to the group financial statements
Audit committee assurance
Impairment of goodwill,  
intangible and tangible assets
Assessment for impairment involves 
comparing the book value of an asset  
with its recoverable amount (being the 
higher of value in use and fair value less 
costs to sell). Value in use is determined 
with reference to projected future cash 
flows discounted at an appropriate rate. 
Both the cash flows and the discount  
rate involve a significant degree of 
estimation uncertainty.
The committee considered the reasonableness of cash flow projections which were based  
on the most recent budget approved by the board and reflected management’s expectations  
of sales growth, operating costs and margins based on past experience and external sources  
of information. Long-term growth rates for periods not covered by the annual budget were 
challenged to ensure they were appropriate for the products, industries and countries in which  
the relevant cash generating units operate. The committee also reviewed and challenged  
the key assumptions made in deriving these projections: discount rates, growth rates,  
and expected changes in production and sales volumes, selling prices and direct costs.  
The committee also considered the adequacy of the disclosures in respect of the key 
assumptions and sensitivities. Refer to notes 8 and 9 to the financial statements for more  
details of these assumptions.
The committee was satisfied that the discount rate assumptions appropriately reflected  
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks associated with  
the particular assets. The other key assumptions were all considered to be reasonable.
The external auditor explained the results of their own review of the estimate of value in  
use, including their challenge of management’s underlying cash flow projections as well  
as the long-term growth assumptions and discount rates. On the basis of their audit work,  
and their challenge of the key assumptions and associated sensitivites, they concurred  
with management’s conclusion that no impairments were required.
Tax provisions
The level of current and deferred tax 
recognised in the financial statements  
is dependent on subjective judgements  
as to the outcome of decisions by tax 
authorities in various jurisdictions around  
the world and the ability of the group  
to use tax losses within the time limits 
imposed by the various tax authorities.  
See also references to taxation on page 46.
The committee annually reviews the Company’s principles for managing tax risks.
The committee reviewed and challenged the provisions recorded at the balance sheet  
date and management confirmed that they represent their best estimate of the likely  
financial exposure faced by the group.
The external auditor explained to the committee the work they had conducted during the  
year, including how their audit procedures were focused on those provisions requiring  
the highest degree of judgement. The committee discussed with both management  
and the external auditor the key judgements which had been made. It was satisfied that  
the judgements were reasonable and that, accordingly, the provision amounts recorded  
were appropriate.
Other accounting areas requiring 
management judgement or estimation
Audit committee assurance
Biological assets
The valuation of growing sugar cane 
requires management to estimate:
• the sucrose content in the cane and  
the expected cane and sucrose yields  
for the following season taking into 
account weather conditions, harvesting 
programmes, and an assessment of  
the maturity of the cane at the balance 
sheet date; and
• the sucrose price, which depends on the 
markets to which the forthcoming crop  
is likely to be sold, the probable domestic 
and export prices, and related foreign 
currency exchange rates.
The sugar business has a good track record of calculating reliable estimates and any significant 
over or under-estimation becomes apparent in subsequent profit realisation.
Actual results were reviewed for consistency of measurement in the light of profit budgets and 
forecasts and the actual results of prior periods. The committee was satisfied that appropriate 
assumptions had been made and consistently applied. As biological assets represent just  
1% of total assets and 2% of net assets, material misstatement of the financial statements  
was considered unlikely.
The committee also reviewed the adequacy of disclosures in respect of the sensitivities  
to unobservable inputs on the fair valuation of biological assets (note 10).
Post-retirement benefits
Valuation of the group’s pension schemes 
and post-retirement medical benefit schemes 
require various subjective judgements to  
be made including mortality assumptions, 
discount rates and general inflation,  
salary inflation, and the rate of increase  
for pensions in payment and those  
in deferment.
Actuarial valuations of the group’s pension schemes are undertaken every three years by 
independent qualified actuaries who also provide advice to management on the assumptions  
to be used in preparing the accounting valuations each year. Details of the assumptions made  
in the current and previous two years are disclosed in note 12 of the financial statements 
together with the bases on which those assumptions have been made. 
The committee reviewed the assumptions by comparison with externally derived data and  
also considered the adequacy of disclosures in respect of the sensitivity of the surplus or  
deficit to changes in these key assumptions.

Misstatements
Management reported to the Committee 
that they were not aware of any material  
or immaterial misstatements made 
intentionally to achieve a particular 
presentation. The auditors reported to  
the committee the misstatements that 
they had found in the course of their work. 
After due consideration the committee 
concurred with management that no 
adjustments were required.
Internal financial control and risk 
management
The committee is required to assist the 
board to fulfil its responsibilities relating  
to the adequacy and effectiveness  
of the control environment, controls  
over financial reporting and the group’s 
compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. To fulfil these duties, 
the committee reviewed:
• the external auditors’ management 
letters and their Audit committee 
memoranda;
• internal audit reports on key audit  
areas and significant deficiencies in  
the financial control environment;
• reports on the systems of internal 
financial controls and risk management;
• reports on fraud perpetrated against  
the group; and
• the group’s approach to IT, cyber 
security and whistleblowing.
Internal audit
The Audit committee is required to  
assist the board to fulfil its responsibilities 
relating to the adequacy of the resourcing 
and plans of internal audit. To fulfil these 
duties, the committee reviewed:
• internal audit’s reporting lines and 
access to the committee and all 
members of the board;
• internal audit’s plans and its 
achievement of the planned activity;
• the results of key audits and other 
significant findings, the adequacy of 
management’s response and the 
timeliness of their resolution;
• statistics on staff numbers, 
qualifications and experience and 
timeliness of reporting;
• the nature and extent of non-audit 
activity performed by internal  
audit; and
• changes since the last annual 
assessment of the significant financial 
risks and the group’s ability to respond 
to changes in its business and the 
external environment.
Whistleblowing and fraud
The group’s ‘whistleblowing’ policy 
contains arrangements for an independent 
external service provider to receive, in 
confidence, complaints on accounting,  
risk issues, internal controls, auditing 
issues and related matters for reporting  
to the Audit committee as appropriate. 
The Audit committee reviewed reports 
from internal audit and the external service 
provider and the actions arising therefrom.
The group’s anti-fraud policy has been 
communicated to all employees and states 
that all employees have a responsibility  
for fraud prevention and detection. Any 
suspicion of fraud should be reported 
immediately and will be investigated 
vigorously. The Audit committee reviewed 
all instances of fraud perpetrated against 
the Company and the action taken  
by management both to pursue the 
perpetrators and to prevent recurrences.
External audit
Auditor independence
The Audit committee is responsible for  
the development, implementation and 
monitoring of policies and procedures  
on the use of the external auditors for 
non-audit services, in accordance with 
professional and regulatory requirements. 
These policies are kept under review to 
meet the objective of ensuring that the 
group benefits in a cost-effective manner 
from the cumulative knowledge and 
experience of its auditors whilst also 
ensuring that the auditors maintain the 
necessary degree of independence and 
objectivity. Consequently, any non-audit 
work to be undertaken by the auditor in 
excess of £300,000 requires authorisation 
by the chairman of the Audit committee 
and the Group Finance Director prior to its 
commencement. Individual assignments 
less than £300,000 are approved by the 
Group Finance Director. The aggregate 
expenditure with the group auditors is 
reviewed by the Audit committee.
The committee is required to approve  
the use of the external auditors to provide: 
accounting advice and training; employee 
benefit plan audits; corporate responsibility, 
IT and other assurance services; due 
diligence in respect of acquisitions and 
disposals; certain specified tax services 
including tax compliance, tax planning  
and related implementation advice; and 
certain other services when it is in the 
best interests of the Company to do  
so and they can be undertaken without 
jeopardising auditor independence.  
No individually significant non-audit 
assignments that would require disclosure 
were undertaken in the financial year.  
The extent to which non-audit services 
may be provided by the group auditor  
will be kept under review in light of  
new restrictions to be introduced by  
EU legislation which comes into effect  
in 2016.
The Company has a policy that any 
recruits hired directly from the external 
auditors must be pre-approved by the 
Group HR Director, and the Group Finance 
Director or Group Financial Controller,  
with the chairman of the Audit committee 
being consulted as appropriate.
The Audit committee has formally 
reviewed the independence of its  
auditors. KPMG LLP has provided a letter 
confirming that it believes it remained 
independent throughout the year, within 
the meaning of the regulations on this 
matter and in accordance with their 
professional standards.
To fulfil its responsibility to ensure the 
independence of the external auditors,  
the Audit committee reviewed:
• changes in external audit executives  
in the audit plan for the current year;
• a report from the external auditors 
describing their arrangements to 
identify, report and manage any 
conflicts of interest; and
• the extent of non-audit services 
provided by the external auditors.
The total fees paid to KPMG LLP for  
the year ended 12 September 2015  
were £8.0m of which £2.3m related  
to non-audit work. Further details are 
provided in note 2 to the financial 
statements.
Consideration is also given by the  
Audit committee to the need to include  
the risk of the withdrawal of the external 
auditors from the market in its risk 
evaluation and planning.

Auditor effectiveness
To assess the effectiveness of the external 
auditors, the committee reviewed:
• the external auditors’ fulfilment of the 
agreed audit plan and variations from it;
• reports highlighting the major issues 
that arose during the course of  
the audit; 
• feedback from the businesses 
evaluating the performance of each 
assigned audit team; and
• a report from the Audit Quality  
Review Team of the Financial  
Reporting Council.
The Audit committee holds private 
meetings with the external auditors after 
each committee meeting to review key 
issues within their sphere of interest  
and responsibility.
To fulfil its responsibility for oversight  
of the external audit process, the Audit 
committee reviewed:
• the terms, areas of responsibility, 
associated duties and scope of  
the audit as set out in the external  
auditors’ engagement letter;
• the overall work plan and fee proposal;
• the major issues that arose during the 
course of the audit and their resolution;
• key accounting and audit judgements;
• the level of errors identified during  
the audit; and
• recommendations made by the external 
auditors in their management letters 
and the adequacy of management’s 
response.
Auditor appointment
The Audit committee reviews annually  
the appointment of the auditor, taking  
into account the auditor’s effectiveness 
and independence, and makes a 
recommendation to the board accordingly. 
Any decision to open the external audit  
to tender is taken on the recommendation 
of the Audit committee. There are no 
contractual obligations that restrict  
the company’s current choice of  
external auditor.
As indicated last year, in light of the 
requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and other recent 
changes to the EU regulatory framework, 
the committee undertook a competitive 
tender for the external audit, KPMG  
having been the group’s auditor since 
1935. KPMG did not participate in the 
tender process. This process involved: 
presentations to the Audit committee  
by the three tendering firms, addressing  
the key business risks and their proposed  
audit approach; individual meetings of the 
tendering firms with all of the divisional 
and functional management teams, 
executive management and members  
of the Audit committee; the presentation 
of written tender documents; and a final 
presentation to a selection committee 
chaired by the chairman of the Audit 
committee and comprising executive and 
non-executive directors and the Group 
Financial Controller. The result of this 
comprehensive tender process was that, 
on the recommendation of the committee, 
the board selected Ernst & Young LLP as 
auditor for the year ending 17 September 
2016. Accordingly, shareholder approval 
will be sought to confirm the appointment 
of Ernst & Young LLP as auditor of the 
Company at the AGM on 4 December 2015.

Annual statement by the Remuneration Committee Chairman
Dear fellow shareholders
2014/15 performance and incentive outcomes
As you know, our range of activities is broad and our portfolio of businesses diverse. We aim to achieve strong and sustainable 
positions and have a focus on the longer-term growth of the Company. As referred to in my Chairman’s statement, the two major 
challenges facing the group have been food commodity deflation and substantial movements in currency markets. Against this 
background, earnings per share has seen a slight decrease.
This year no changes have been made to our remuneration policy, which is re-presented on the following pages for reference but is 
not subject to a shareholder vote. The committee has dedicated time in two meetings in 2014/15 to considering whether incentive 
outcomes are a fair reflection of performance. The conclusions that we reached are outlined below.
Short Term Incentive Plan (STIP)
Operating results this year were significantly affected by lower sugar prices and the negative translation impact of currency movements, 
both factors being outside the control of management. However, having regard to the fact that previous performance has benefited 
from higher sugar prices, and that the STIP has always been measured against profits translated into sterling at actual average foreign 
exchange rates for the year rather than at constant currency, the committee concluded that the incentive payout of 49.44% on the 
financial element of the STIP was a fair reflection of the performance outcome. The original STIP targets were increased for the 
additional profit made by businesses acquired during the year, in line with our normal policy for acquisitions.
As previously disclosed, in November 2012, the committee reduced vesting on the 2009–12 Long Term Incentive Plan from 100%  
to 97.42% to reflect an asset impairment charge relating to the Australian meat business, Don KRC. Continuing property development 
deals relating to the Don KRC site, which are not included in the annual operating profit calculation, mean that the committee now 
feels it is appropriate to return to the executive directors the balance of the value which was reduced in 2012. A partial repayment  
was made in 2014 and the remaining balance due of £23,963 for George Weston and £16,073 for John Bason will be paid this year. 
No further payments will be made in respect of this previous reduction in vesting as the aggregate outcome is now as it would have 
been had no impairment charge been taken.
For 2015/16 there has been no change in the setting of our STIP financial targets which are based on a performance range around 
budget for both the profit measure and the working capital measure. The reasons for adoption of these financial metrics are detailed  
in the policy report on page 88.
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
In the Chairman’s statement I have noted a strong performance despite currency and commodity challenges, and that we expect 
currency pressures to lead to a modest decline in adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings for the group for the coming year.  
In view of this and having regard to the adjusted earnings per share (adjusted eps) performance in 2014/15, the level of growth required 
to achieve the performance targets on existing awards vesting in 2016 and 2017 is now extremely challenging. The committee made 
no discretionary changes to the targets already set. However, recognising that the shape of the group has changed greatly in recent 
years, and in view of the fact that the LTIP is designed to motivate and retain some 150 senior managers across the group, the 
committee has decided that it would be appropriate to undertake a complete review of the group’s incentive arrangements over  
the course of the next year.
If this review concludes that changes are required, the committee will present a revised executive remuneration policy to investors  
at the 2016 AGM, one year earlier than originally anticipated. If approved by shareholders, any changes to policy will become effective  
in the 2016/17 financial year.
As part of this review, we will be seeking input from our major shareholders in May/June 2016.
In setting the targets for the 2015/18 LTIP , the committee has taken into account the outlook for a modest decline in adjusted eps  
in the 2016 financial year and the consequential implications of this for 2017. Accordingly, the committee has decided that the LTIP 
targets will assume no growth for the first year of the 2015/18 LTIP . Thereafter, the compound annual growth rates of 5% to achieve 
threshold, 8% to achieve target and 11% to achieve maximum will be applied. We believe that this approach is appropriate and in the 
best interests of our shareholders.

Remuneration policy
The remuneration policy for executive directors has applied since it was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM. The wording 
in the policy, provided for reference below, is unchanged from that approved in 2014 except as necessary to update references 
and increase clarity for the reader, for example, by changing dates and including current salary numbers in scenario charts. For 
unvested share awards only, the provisions of the remuneration policy presented in the 2013 Remuneration report will continue 
to apply until such time as all long-term incentive awards granted under that policy have vested.
The committee reviews the approved remuneration policy annually to ensure that it remains aligned with the Company’s 
strategic objectives. This year, the committee has determined that no changes should be made. As outlined on the previous page, 
the committee expects to present a revised remuneration policy to investors for approval at the 2016 AGM and will discuss its 
proposals with major shareholders before finalising the proposed policy.

BASE SALARY  
(100% CASH)
Base salaries are normally reviewed on an annual basis or following 
a significant change in responsibilities. Factors taken into account 
include market pay movements, the level of increases awarded 
to UK employees across the group and the impact of any increase 
on the total remuneration package. 
Increases will usually be limited 
to those available for other 
UK employees. In line with 
other employees, if there is 
a significant change in role 
responsibility, increases will 
reflect this. 
To provide core reward for the 
role, recognising responsibility  
for setting and delivering  
the strategy.
BENEFITS (EXCLUDING  
RELOCATION)
Benefits are restricted to typical UK market levels for executive 
directors and include, but are not limited to, death in service payment, 
permanent health insurance, company car plus private fuel, family 
healthcare and, where relevant, fees to maintain professional 
memberships. Executives are provided with the technology they 
require to carry out their roles efficiently and effectively.
The cost of these benefits is 
not expected to exceed 10% 
of salary but is dependent 
on factors, such as insurance 
premium rates, that can vary.
To provide a competitive and 
cost-effective benefits package 
appropriate to the role.
SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE  
PLAN (STIP) (100% CASH)
Performance measures
Group financial performance is assessed against prime financial 
measures, such as adjusted operating profit and working capital, 
used across the group on a day-to-day basis to drive and 
monitor performance.
The personal element of the STIP is calculated as a percentage of 
base salary on achieving certain personal targets set by the Company 
Chairman for the Chief Executive and by the Chief Executive for the 
Finance Director.
Target setting
Budget performance is set as the ‘on-target’ performance level at the 
start of each financial year. The committee sets a range around target 
to incentivise delivery of truly stretching performance.
Individual personal objectives are also set each year. These may be 
specific short-term goals or milestones towards medium or long-term 
objectives, but are closely aligned to the overall strategy of the group. 
Following the end of the financial year, the Chairman reviews the 
performance of the Chief Executive against these objectives and 
makes a recommendation to the Remuneration committee about 
the appropriate level of payout for the personal element. Similarly, 
the Chief Executive makes a recommendation to the Remuneration 
committee regarding the Finance Director following an assessment 
of his performance.
Discretion, clawback and malus
In specific circumstances the Remuneration committee retains 
discretion, including in relation to malus and clawback, as set out 
in the notes that follow this table.
150% of base salary:
• 130% based on financial 
results; and
• 20% on personal performance.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVE  
PLAN (LTIP)
Executive directors are eligible to participate in the Associated British 
Foods Long-Term Incentive Plan (the LTIP). Annual allocations of 
conditional shares vest over a three-year period, subject to agreed 
performance targets being satisfied. Allocations are granted  
over shares to the value of 200% of base salary at allocation.  
For maximum performance 100% of the shares vest; for target 
performance 50% vest; for threshold performance 10% vest;  
and below threshold level awards lapse.
A mandatory two-year holding period applies for any shares 
allocated under the LTIP from the 2014 AGM onwards.
Performance measures
Group performance is measured against an absolute range of 
compound annual growth in adjusted earnings per share (eps).
This measure was chosen because it:
• reflects the group’s objective of sustained long-term 
earnings growth;
• is a measure which is well understood both by participants 
and shareholders;
• is a published figure with limited adjustments; and
• encompasses the diverse nature of the group.
An absolute, rather than a relative measure is used, as the group is 
a global business for which UK inflation factors are of limited impact.
Other financial measures have been considered, but found to be 
unhelpful or inappropriate.
Target setting
Targets are set by the committee at the beginning of each three-year 
performance period, taking into account the state of the markets in 
which the group operates as well as the scale of investments made 
in the pursuit of long-term growth. In determining a fair but stretching 
target, the committee also considers:
• the results of the long-term incentive plan to date;
• market expectations and internal forecasts for the next few years; 
and
• advice from its appointed remuneration advisors.
Discretion, clawback and malus
When the Company introduced the new LTIP, approved by 
shareholders in 2013, malus and clawback were introduced into the 
plan rules. In specific circumstances the Remuneration committee 
retains discretion in relation to the plan. Further information can 
be found in the notes to this table.
Previous plan
Conditional shares already allocated for 2012–15 and 2013–16 
will vest, or not, under the terms of the Executive Share Incentive 
Plan 2003. These allocations were subject to earnings per share 
performance targets and, in contrast to the new plan, do not 
have clawback in place.

SHAREHOLDING  
REQUIREMENT
Executive directors are required to build and maintain a shareholding 
in the Company to a value at least equal to their pre-tax base salary.
In order to achieve this target, executives are required to retain at 
least 50% of the post-tax value of any shares vesting each year 
and then to manage their shareholding in such a way as to continue 
to meet the requirement.
Shareholding of 100% of salary.
To demonstrate commitment to, 
and align personal interests with, 
the success of the Company 
and its shareholders.
PENSION
Defined benefit pension arrangements –  
closed to new members
The current executive directors are members of the Company’s 
HMRC approved defined benefit pension scheme, which closed to 
new entrants in October 2002. Both executive directors opted out 
of the scheme on 5 April 2006, but retain their accrued benefits up 
to that date. The scheme is designed to provide retirement benefits 
of around two-thirds of final pensionable salary at age 65 (62 for 
John Bason).
The current executive directors have, since 5 April 2006, earned 
benefits in an Employer-Financed Retirement Benefit Scheme 
(EFRBS). The EFRBS is unregistered, but is designed to broadly 
mirror the provisions of the defined benefit pension scheme by 
providing retirement benefits of around two-thirds of final 
pensionable salary at normal retirement age.
Defined contribution pension arrangements
Future executive directors, who are not already entitled to defined 
benefit pension arrangements at the time of appointment, would 
benefit from an HMRC approved defined contribution arrangement, 
with a Company contribution (or cash equivalent) of 25% of  
base salary.
Cash alternative
Where a UK-based pension arrangement is not possible, or is not 
tax efficient, a cash supplement equivalent to the normal pension 
contribution may be paid in lieu of pension contributions.
For directors entitled to benefits 
under the Company’s defined 
benefit pension scheme and/or 
EFRBS, a retirement benefit 
target of around two-thirds 
of final pensionable salary is 
payable at normal retirement age.
For directors entitled to 
defined contribution pension 
arrangements, executives may 
receive Company contributions 
(or cash equivalent) up to a 
maximum of 25% of base salary.
To provide a competitive 
retirement benefit in line with 
best practice standards adopted 
by major companies in the United 
Kingdom and continental Europe.

Notes to the Remuneration policy table
Target-setting and commercial sensitivity
The committee selected the performance conditions shown in the preceding table because these are the key measures used by 
the executive directors to manage the business. The performance targets are set by the committee annually taking into account 
the views of their advisors and management.
The committee is of the opinion that performance targets for the annual bonus are commercially sensitive and that it would be 
detrimental to the interests of the Company to disclose them before the start of the financial year. Achievement against financial 
targets will be disclosed after the end of the relevant financial year in that year’s Remuneration report.
Discretion, malus and clawback
The committee may, at any time within two years of the vesting date of an LTIP award (under the new plan) or payment of an STIP 
award, determine that clawback shall apply if the committee determines that performance outcomes were misstated; an erroneous 
calculation was made in assessing the extent to which performance targets were met; or the participant is found to have committed, 
at any time prior to vesting/payment, including prior to grant, an act or omission which justifies, or, in the opinion of the Remuneration 
committee, would have justified, summary dismissal.
As a condition of participating in the STIP and LTIP from the 2014/15 financial year onwards, all participants have been required to 
agree that the committee may cause any STIP or LTIP award in which they participate to lapse (in whole or in part) and may operate 
clawback under any share scheme or bonus scheme in which they participate operated by a group company and may operate 
clawback by reducing any amounts payable to the participant and/or by requiring the participant to immediately transfer shares 
or cash back to the Company.
The committee will apply discretion, where necessary and by exception, to ensure that there are no unintended consequences from 
the operation of the remuneration policy. The committee has a robust set of principles that it applies to ensure that the outcome is 
consistent with business performance and aligned with shareholder interests. Any material exercises of discretion by the committee in 
relation to the STIP and LTIP will be in line with scheme rules or other applicable contractual documentation and will be fully disclosed 
and explained in the relevant year’s report on the implementation of remuneration policy and will not exceed scheme maxima.
Remuneration for other employees compared with that of executive directors
First line reports to the Chief Executive and other senior executives are rewarded broadly within the same overall remuneration policy 
as executive directors, in order to ensure fairness and common purpose across the group. In general, other executives therefore 
participate in incentive arrangements similar to those of the executive directors, but with lower levels of potential payout. The 
proportion of variable pay to base salary for first line executives is around 1.2 to 1 for ‘on-target’ performance and 2.25 to 1 for 
maximum performance. The Remuneration committee regularly reviews the reward package for other groups of senior executives 
below board level to ensure that they remain at a level sufficient to attract and retain high-calibre individuals.
Associated British Foods is geographically dispersed and therefore subject to very different pay markets, so it is difficult to make 
sensible comparisons with all employees across the group. The salaries of executive directors are reviewed in line with UK employees 
of the group. In December 2014, when the salary increase for employees in the UK was between 1.75% and 3.0%, including a 3% 
increase in the minimum wage, the Chief Executive received a salary increase of 2.6%.
In order to drive and reward performance, and to align better the interests of executives and shareholders, the executive directors 
have a greater proportion of their total reward package at risk than other employees. This means that in years of very good 
performance, the Chief Executive’s package increases proportionately more than that of most other employees and conversely 
in years of lower performance it may decrease. However, the structure and principles of incentives are consistent further down 
the organisation including:
• the belief that employees should be encouraged to do the right thing for the long-term benefit and success of the organisation;
• the belief that individuals should have line of sight to their performance targets; and 
• the belief in combining profit and return measures with personal measures in the STIP .
The committee operates share-based long-term incentives for approximately 150 senior individuals across the group.
Executive directors serving as non-executive directors
To encourage self-development and allow external insight and practice, the committee has determined that, with the consent of  
the Chairman and the Chief Executive, executive directors may serve as non-executive directors of other companies in an individual 
capacity and will retain any fees earned. Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
80 Governance | Remuneration report |
Remuneration policy – consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company
How pay and conditions of employees were taken into account when setting directors’ remuneration policy
The committee considered the salary increases proposed for the employee population generally and other changes to the 
remuneration policy within the Company when reviewing executive salaries at its September and October meetings. As outlined 
in the policy table, the committee typically limits the range of increases for executive directors to the range of increases available 
to employees unless there has been a change of role.
The design of incentives is broadly consistent across the group. The committee is provided with data on the remuneration structure 
for senior management in the two tiers below executive director and uses this information to work with the Company to ensure 
consistency of approach. In addition, the committee approves all share-based LTIP awards across the group. 
Consideration of employees’ views
In setting the remuneration policy, the committee seeks to act in the best interests of the Company. Whilst the views of employees 
are not explicitly sought, employees are able to feed back their opinions through employee opinion surveys or directly to the 
Company’s management.
Remuneration policy – executive director contracts, recruitment, retention and loss of office
Recruitment arrangements – all executive directors
As we may need to recruit future executive directors from outside the UK or from companies with more aggressive incentive policies 
than our own, and as our long-term incentive plans do not give us significant headroom to make awards to new joiners above the 
levels set out in the policy table, the arrangements below are intended to give us the flexibility to recruit the right individuals should 
we need to.
Core package – in line with remuneration policy table on pages 76 to 78
Salary – Based on a combination of market information, internal relativities and individual experience.
Benefits – In line with remuneration policy.
Pension – Defined contribution pension or cash alternative to pension in line with policy.
STIP – Pro rata in year of recruitment. Part of STIP may be guaranteed to reduce the need for additional cash payments to hire 
new joiners.
LTIP – Prorated grant for the year of recruitment. A mandatory two-year holding period will apply for any shares vesting under 
the LTIP for all newly appointed executive directors.
Buy-out arrangements – in addition to remuneration policy table on pages 76 to 78
The committee may, when it considers this to be in the best interest of the Company, make a one-off award of additional cash and/or 
shares to replace incentives foregone from a previous company. The committee would seek validation of the value of incentives 
foregone, including the nature, time horizon and performance requirements attaching to that remuneration. Additional awards will 
not exceed the committee’s advisors’ calculation of the value of the original awards. If possible, additional incentive awards will be 
tied to group performance targets.
Other elements – in addition to remuneration policy table on pages 76 to 78
The committee may, when it considers this to be in the best interest of the Company, make a one-off additional award of cash and/or 
shares as an incentive to join. This may, for example, be necessary if recruiting an individual from overseas. If possible, additional 
incentive awards will be tied to group performance targets. 
Total maximum additional incentive value will not exceed 200% of salary.
Internal appointments
For internal appointments, awards in respect of the prior role may be allowed to vest according to the terms of the scheme, 
adjusted as relevant to take account of the new appointment. In addition, ongoing prior remuneration obligations may continue.
Relocation
If a new executive director needs to relocate, the Company may pay:
• actual relocation costs and other reasonable expenses relating to moving house; 
• disturbance allowance of up to 5% of salary, some of which may be tax-free for qualifying expenditure;
• school fees for dependent children where there are cultural or language considerations;
• medical costs for the overseas family, where relevant; 
• one business class return fare per annum each for the executive, his/her partner and dependent children in order to maintain 
family or other links where an executive is recruited from outside the UK; 
• reasonable fees and taxes for buying and/or selling a family home and/or appropriate rental costs; and
• any tax due, grossed up, on any relocation related payments listed above.

Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
81 Governance | Remuneration report |
Service contracts and payments for loss of office
It is the Company’s policy that executive directors have rolling contracts with 12-month notice periods. This is in accordance with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code and contracts are available for inspection at the Company’s offices. Contracts and service 
agreements are not reissued when base salaries or fees are changed. Pension arrangements for both the current executive 
directors have been amended, as described in the policy table, without reissuing their contracts.
The executive directors’ service contracts allow for the Company to terminate the employment by paying the director in lieu of some 
or all of his notice period. The Company may determine that a payment in lieu of notice is made in monthly instalments or as a lump 
sum. A payment in lieu of notice will comprise the salary, benefits and pension provision that the director would otherwise have 
received during the relevant period. The Company is committed to the principle of mitigation. If the committee determines that a 
payment in lieu of notice will be paid in monthly payments, it would reduce the instalments to take account of amounts received 
from alternative employment.
In addition, the executive director may be entitled to a payment in respect of his statutory rights. The committee may also determine 
that a contribution will be made to the director’s legal fees in connection with his termination and may agree to make reasonable 
payments to him in respect of outplacement. In limited circumstances, in addition to making a full payment in lieu of notice, the 
Company may permit an executive director to stay employed after the announcement of his departure for a limited period to ensure 
an effective hand-over and/or to allow time for a successor to be appointed. It would be open to the Company to consider terminating 
an executive director’s service agreement in breach (i.e. not to make a payment to him in lieu of notice) and instead to make a payment 
of damages to him which compensates him for the loss he will suffer as a result of the termination of his contract, taking into account 
his duty to mitigate his loss.
There is no automatic entitlement to accrued STIP/LTIP awards on termination; the approach to determining whether or not a payment 
might be made is set out in the table below. Prorated STIP and LTIP awards will not usually take account of notice periods, but the 
committee retains the discretion to determine that they will. The committee would not expect to do so in the case of poor performance.

took place.
Any agreed payment will 
be made in the December 
following the year end.
In the case of death,

The committee will consider 
allowing awards due to vest in 
relation to the financial year of 
termination to vest. Other awards 
lapse unless the committee uses 
its discretion to allow them to 
vest. The committee has never 
previously done this.
Vesting will take place on the usual 
vesting date, subject to performance 
conditions unless the committee 
determines that the award should 
vest earlier pro rata, in which case 
the committee may determine 
whether the executive’s notice 
period will be taken into account 
in any prorating.

Remuneration policy for non-executive directors
Summary of remuneration policy for non-executive directors
Non-executive directors’ fees are reviewed periodically in the light of fees payable in comparable companies and the importance 
attached to the retention and attraction of high-calibre individuals as non-executive directors. Fees are paid on a per annum basis 
and are not varied for the number of days worked. Non-executive directors receive no other benefits and take no part in any 
discussion or decision concerning their own fees.
The Remuneration committee (under the chairmanship of the Senior Independent Director) reviews the Chairman’s fees. In addition 
to his fee, the Chairman also receives private medical insurance for himself and his spouse.
Element Purpose Operation
Chairman
Fees To attract and retain a high-calibre 
chairman by providing a competitive 
core reward for the role.
The Chairman is paid a single fee for all his responsibilities. 
The level of this fee is reviewed every other year by the committee (in the 
absence of the Chairman) and the executive directors in the light of fees payable 
in comparable companies.
Fees are paid in cash on a monthly basis.
Benefits To provide market-competitive benefits. Private medical insurance (for Chairman and spouse).
Other non-executive directors
Fees To attract and retain high-calibre 
non-executive directors by offering 
market-competitive fees.
Fees are paid on a per annum basis and are not varied for the number of days worked. 
The Chairman and executive directors review non-executive directors’ fees every 
other year in the light of fees payable in comparable companies.
The Senior Independent Director and chairman of the Audit committee are paid 
an additional fee to reflect their extra responsibilities.
Fees, paid in cash on a quarterly basis, were last reviewed on 3 September 2014.
Non-executive directors’ terms of appointment
It is the Company’s policy that all non-executive directors are subject to specified terms of appointment. Appointment is for an initial 
term of three years unless terminated by either party on six months’ notice. Continuation of the contract of appointment is contingent 
on satisfactory performance and re-election at forthcoming annual general meetings. Non-executive directors are typically expected 
to serve two three-year terms, although the board may invite a non-executive director to serve for an additional period.
The Company’s Articles of Association require that all directors retire from office if they have not retired at either of the preceding  
two annual general meetings. In any event, at this year’s annual general meeting, all directors are standing for election or re-election  
in compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, except for Lord Jay who will retire on 30 November 2015.
Where an individual retires at the annual general meeting and does not stand for re-election, they are not paid in lieu of notice.
Approach to recruitment for non-executive directors
The approach to fees outlined above would apply to new non-executive directors.
We would not pay to relocate a non-executive director to the head office location but would reimburse reasonable expenses incurred 
in travelling on behalf of the business. In the first year, such expenses may be higher than usual as part of the individual’s induction 
into the business.
Remuneration policy – statement of consideration of shareholders views
Each year the chairman of the committee invites our larger institutional shareholders to discuss with him their views on the group’s 
remuneration, strategy and governance.
Ahead of the 2014 AGM, we received feedback from some investors who did not feel that our earnings per share targets were 
sufficiently stretching. The committee robustly reviews targets each year, with detailed input from our advisors and from the 
Company. We have satisfied ourselves, in the context of the challenges facing the sugar business, that the targets that we set for 
the LTIP in 2013 and 2014 were extremely challenging and that delivering this level of performance would represent a very good 
performance by the executive directors on behalf of shareholders. The Chairman’s statement on page 74 sets out more information  
on our approach to setting LTIP targets for 2015-18.
In light of the changing scale and shape of the business, we are planning to review remuneration policy in 2015/16 and seek 
shareholder approval for this at the 2016 AGM. The committee chairman remains happy to discuss any remuneration matters 
at any time to help shape our policy and practice.

Pensions
Both directors opted out of the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme, a defined benefit scheme, on 5 April 2006, and since 
then have earned benefits in an Employer-Financed Retirement Benefit Scheme (EFRBS). 
George Weston
The director has an overall benefit promise of a minimum of 
2
/3rds of final pay or 
1
/45th of final pensionable earnings for each year of 
pensionable service. The director opted out of the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme on 5 April 2006, and has a deferred benefit  
in the Scheme; the balance of the promise is provided under an EFRBS. The director’s benefits are payable from age 65. There is no 
additional benefit entitlement for the members if they take early retirement. The pension accrued by the director at 12 September 2015 
was £512,670.
John Bason
The director has an overall benefit promise of a minimum of 
2
/3rds of final pay or 
1
/45th of final pensionable earnings for each year of 
pensionable service, less an allowance for the director’s retained benefits from previous employment. The director opted out of the 
Associated British Foods Pension Scheme on 5 April 2006, and has a deferred benefit in the Scheme; the balance of the promise is 
provided under an EFRBS. The director’s benefits are payable from age 62. There is no additional benefit entitlement for the members  
if they take early retirement. The pension accrued by the director at 12 September 2015 was £311,787. Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015

The committee considered whether it would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to disclose the precise 
targets agreed for each of the performance measures for 2014/15. The conclusion was that retrospective detail on financial targets  
set will not be disclosed at this stage as it is, in the opinion of the committee, commercially sensitive. 
During 2016, we will consider, as part of the wider review of our approach on incentives, what further transparency we can provide 
to shareholders without disadvantaging the business.
Following a review of personal performance against specific objectives for the 2014/15 financial year, the committee determined that 
George Weston will receive 14.93% of salary in relation to performance that was slightly ahead of target against set objectives, with 
performance improvements in our ingredients businesses and in Australia, ongoing continuous improvement in the sugar business, 
a strengthened balance sheet and continuing successful growth of Primark. John Bason will receive 15.50% of base salary for the 
individual element of the annual bonus, reflecting overall performance that is ahead of target with most objectives having been 
attained, the review of auditors having been well managed and a good focus on investor relations during the year. Personal objectives 
set for each of the executive directors were closely aligned to the overall strategy of the group but will not be disclosed because of 
commercial sensitivity. 
In addition to the above percentages, the committee has determined to increase the personal element of the incentive payment 
by a further £23,963 for George Weston and £16,073 for John Bason in relation to a previous discretionary reduction in vesting  
of the 2009–12 LTIP to reflect an asset impairment charge in our Australian meat business. In 2014, the committee returned to the 
executive directors some, but not all, of the previously reduced value to recognise the value delivered from property development 
deals relating to the site. These deals have continued to recapture the impaired value for the business and its shareholders this year. 
No further payment will be made in respect of this previous reduction in vesting as the aggregate outcome is now as it would have 
been had no impairment charge been taken.

Long-Term Incentive Plan – 2012–2015
The performance measures for each three-year LTIP cycle are set by the committee. Awards are made annually, at the discretion 
of the committee, and eligible executives receive shares at the end of the performance period, subject to achievement of the 
performance measures. For the 2012–2015 cycle the threshold level of compound adjusted eps growth was 5% per annum with  
on target at 8% and maximum at 11%. The adjusted eps range, adjusted for the impact of IAS 19, was 100.1p at threshold, 109.0p  
at target and 118.5p at maximum. Actual eps was 102.0p. In November 2015 executive directors will therefore receive 18.54%  
of the conditional shares allocated in 2012 – George Weston will receive 24,575 shares and John Bason 16,168 shares. No further 
deferral will be applied to these shares, as they were granted before December 2014.

Grant policy for share plans
Conditional share awards are granted each year at the end of November, following announcement of the Company’s results. 
In addition, further awards are made, following approval by the committee, between the end of November and 1 June each year 
to new starters or newly promoted individuals who are eligible to participate. The share price used to determine the number of 
shares in an allocation is the average of the closing share prices on the five trading days immediately preceding the award date.
All awards are settled using shares bought in the market.

The committee determined that performance for this award should be measured against an absolute range of 5% to 11% compound 
annual growth in adjusted earnings per share. The committee believes that the range is extremely stretching over the three-year 
performance period given sugar profitability and foreign exchange rates. In setting this target, the committee took into account:
• the volatility present in many of the markets in which the group operates;
• the scale of investments made in the pursuit of long-term growth;
• the results of the long-term incentive to date; 
• market expectations;
• internal forecasts for the next few years; and
• advice from their appointed remuneration advisors.
As outlined in the remuneration policy, there will be a further two-year holding period in place for these shares after vesting.
Executive directors’ shareholding requirements and share interests (audited information)

TSR performance and Chief Executive’s pay
The performance graph below illustrates the performance of the Company over the past six years from September 2009 to 
September 2015, in terms of total shareholder return compared with that of the companies comprising the FTSE 100 index. 
This index has been selected because it represents a cross-section of leading UK companies. 
In addition, the table below the graph provides a six-year summary of the total remuneration of the Chief Executive over the same 
period showing a breakdown of each of the elements of variable pay within the total remuneration figure. For the purpose of 
calculating the value of the remuneration of the Chief Executive, data has been collated on a basis consistent with the ‘single figure’ 
methodology as defined in the applicable UK directors’ reporting regulations.

Percentage change in remuneration of the Chief Executive
Between 2014 and 2015, the increase in the Chief Executive’s salary was 2.6% and the average increase in salaries for our UK 
employees was between 1.75–3%. The total reward for the Chief Executive reduced by 59%, reflecting 18.54% vesting on the LTIP , 
reduced from 100% vesting in the previous year as well as a reduced STIP payment. The overall increase in expenditure on reward  
for all of our employees was 3%. These numbers are based on aggregate data presented on page 111 as it is very difficult, in a 
decentralised group of the Company’s size, to separate the increase in expenditure on incentives and benefits.
Executive directors serving as non-executive director
During the year, George Weston served as a non-executive director of Wittington Investments Limited, for which he received 
no compensation. 
John Bason is a non-executive director and chairman of the audit committee of Compass Group PLC, for which he received  
a fee of £105,875 in the 2014/15 financial year. He also served as a trustee of Voluntary Service Overseas and as chairman of  
the charity FareShare, but received no compensation in respect of either of these roles.

Long-Term Incentive Plan – 2015–18
The LTIP will be operated in line with the remuneration policy and with the continuing Company grant policy (see page 77). 
Each year the committee reflects carefully on a number of Company and external data points and on feedback from our shareholders 
in setting the eps targets for the LTIP . 
For 2015–18 we have taken into account the very significant impact of sugar pricing and foreign exchange movements on the expected 
profitability of a number of our divisions in 2015/16. This means that in the first year of the LTIP we anticipate a reduction in adjusted 
eps compared with 2014/15, as reflected in the outlook paragraph of the Chairman’s statement on page 5.
In setting the targets for the 2015–18 LTIP , the committee has taken into account the outlook for a modest decline in adjusted eps  
in the 2016 financial year and the consequential implications of this for 2017. Accordingly, the committee has decided that the LTIP 
targets will assume no growth for the first year of the 2015/18 LTIP . Thereafter, the compound annual growth rates of 5% to achieve 
threshold, 8% to achieve target and 11% to achieve maximum will be applied. We believe that this approach is appropriate and in the 
best interests of our shareholders.

Remuneration committee advisors and fees
Following a competitive tender in 2003, Towers Watson (then Towers Perrin) was selected to provide independent market information 
and remuneration advice to the Remuneration committee. The committee has retained Towers Watson in this role because it values 
the robust data provided and continuity of advice over the long term. The committee remains satisfied that the advice from Towers 
Watson is independent, thoughtful and challenging.
Towers Watson is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and adheres to its code in relation to executive remuneration 
consulting. The only other advice that Towers Watson provides to the Company is in survey provision and remuneration benchmarking. 
The fees paid to Towers Watson for committee assistance over the past financial year totalled £72,593.
Role of the committee
The Remuneration committee is responsible to the board for determining:
• the remuneration policy for the executive directors and Chairman taking into account remuneration trends across the Company;
• the specific terms and conditions of employment of each individual director;
• the overall policy for remuneration for the Chief Executive’s first and second line reports; 
• the design and monitoring of the operation of any Company share plans;
• stretching incentive targets to encourage enhanced performance;
•  an approach that rewards fairly and responsibly contribution to the Company’s long-term success; and 
• other provisions of the executive directors’ service agreements and ensuring that contractual terms on termination, and payments 
made, are fair to the individual and the Company and that failure is not rewarded and loss is mitigated. 
The committee’s remit is set out in detail in its terms of reference, which are reviewed regularly and were updated in September 2015. 
They are available on the website at www.abf.co.uk/investorrelations under corporate governance/board committees, or from the 
Company Secretary’s office on request. 
Remuneration principles
The overall remuneration policy of the Company aims to:
• provide alignment between remuneration and the Company’s business objectives;
• align executive rewards with shareholder value;
• attract and retain high-calibre executive directors;
• motivate executive directors to achieve challenging performance levels and reward them for so doing;
• recognise both individual and group achievement; and
• reflect the diversity of the group’s interests.
Statement on shareholder voting
At the last AGM in December 2014 the voting results on resolution two, to receive and approve the Remuneration report for the year 
ended 13 September 2014, were as follows:
(i)  the total number of votes cast in relation to the resolution was 659,736,109: 619,982,274 ‘for’ and 39,753,835 ‘against’
(ii)  the percentage ‘for’ was 93.97% and the percentage ‘against’ was 6.03%
(iii) the number of abstentions was 1,672,922
The voting results on resolution three, to approve the directors’ remuneration policy, were as follows:
(i)  the total number of votes cast in relation to the resolution was 660,191,206: 598,077,621 ‘for’ and 62,113,585 ‘against’
(ii)  the percentage ‘for’ was 90.59% and the percentage ‘against’ was 9.41%
 (iii) the number of abstentions was 1,216,643
Compliance statement
The remuneration policy was subject to a binding vote at the 2014 annual general meeting of the Company. It is our intention that  
the policy will be reviewed during 2015/16 and we will seek shareholder approval before making any changes to the policy at the  
AGM in 2016.
The report on directors’ remuneration section contained within this report will be subject to an advisory vote at the forthcoming  
annual general meeting of the Company. The vote will have advisory status in respect of overall remuneration packages and will not  
be specific to individual levels of remuneration. 
KPMG LLP has audited the report to the extent required by the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended).

Employees
During the year under review, the group 
employed an average of 124,036 people 
worldwide (2014: 118,209) of whom 
42,416 were employed in the UK. The 
group’s business priority is to safeguard 
the wellbeing, development and safety  
of its employees and those who work  
with it. It also wants employees to have 
opportunities to grow and progress as part 
of an enjoyable career. While the group’s 
approach to human resource management 
is decentralised, with flexibility given to 
each of the businesses, as a group it 
abides by the following principles:
• equal opportunities – the group  
is committed to offering equal 
opportunities in recruitment, training, 
career development and promotion to all 
people, including those with disabilities, 
having regard for their particular 
aptitudes and abilities. As a matter of 
policy, full and fair consideration is given 
to applicants with disabilities and every 
effort is made to give employees who 
become disabled whilst employed by 
the group an opportunity for retraining 
and for continuation in employment.  
It is group policy that the training, career 
development and promotion of disabled 
persons should, as far as possible, be 
the same as that of other employees;
• health and safety – health and safety  
are considered as equal in importance  
to that of any other function of the  
group and its business objectives and 
the group is committed to providing  
a safe and healthy workplace to protect 
all employees, visitors and the public 
from foreseeable work hazards. The 
health and safety policy is available  
on the Company’s website at  
www.abf.co.uk;
• harassment – sexual, mental or  
physical harassment in the workplace 
will not be tolerated. It is expected  
that incidents of harassment are 
reported to the appropriate human 
resources director;
• human rights – the group provides 
opportunities that promote human 
rights and dignity every day through  
the employment created, both directly 
and indirectly in its global supply  
chains and through the positive 
Introduction
The directors of Associated British Foods 
plc (the ‘Company’) present their report  
for the 52 weeks ended 12 September 
2015, in accordance with section 415  
of the Companies Act 2006. The UKLA’s 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules and 
Listing Rules also require the Company to 
make certain disclosures, some of which 
have been included in other appropriate 
sections of the annual report and accounts.
The information set out on page 93, and 
the following cross-referenced material,  
is incorporated into this Directors’ report:
• likely future developments in the 
group’s business (pages 12 to 45);
• greenhouse gas emissions  
(page 50); and
• the board of directors and the Corporate 
governance report (pages 60 to 73).
Results and dividends
The consolidated income statement is  
on page 96. Profit for the financial year 
attributable to equity shareholders 
amounted to £532m.
The directors recommend a final dividend 
of 25.0p per ordinary share to be paid, 
subject to shareholder approval, on  
8 January 2016. Together with the interim 
dividend of 10.0p per share paid on 3 July 
2015, this amounts to 35.0p for the year. 
Dividends are detailed on page 112.
Directors
The names of the persons who were 
directors of the Company during the 
financial year and as at 3 November 2015 
appear on pages 60 and 61. All the 
directors, with the exception of Lord Jay 
who is retiring as a non-executive director 
with effect from 30 November 2015,  
are standing for election or re-election  
at this year’s AGM in December.
Appointment of directors
The Company’s articles of association  
(the ‘Articles’) give the directors power  
to appoint and replace directors. Under  
the terms of reference of the Nomination 
committee, any appointment must  
be recommended by the Nomination 
committee for approval by the board  
of directors. A person who is not 
recommended by the directors may only 
be appointed as a director where details  
of that director have been provided at least 
seven and not more than 35 days prior  
to the relevant meeting by at least two 
members of the Company. The Articles 
require directors to retire and submit 
themselves for election at the first AGM 
following appointment and all directors 
who held office at the time of the two 
preceding AGMs and, in any event, not 
less than one-third of the relevant directors 
(excluding those directors who retire other 
than by rotation), to submit themselves for 
re-election. The Articles notwithstanding, 
all directors, with the exception of Lord Jay, 
will stand for election or re-election at the 
AGM this year in compliance with the  
UK Corporate Governance Code. Details 
of unexpired terms of directors’ service 
contracts are set out in the Remuneration 
report on page 88.
Power of directors
The directors are responsible for managing 
the business of the Company and may 
exercise all the powers of the Company 
subject to the provisions of relevant 
statutes, to any directions given by special 
resolution and to the Company’s Articles. 
The Articles, for example, contain specific 
provisions and restrictions concerning  
the Company’s power to borrow money. 
As indicated above, powers relating to the 
issuing of shares are also included in the 
Articles and such authorities are renewed 
by shareholders at the AGM each year.
Directors’ indemnities
Three directors of operating subsidiaries 
benefited from qualifying third-party 
indemnity provisions provided by the 
Company’s wholly owned subsidiary,  
ABF Investments plc, during the financial 
year and at the date of this report.
The directors of a subsidiary company that 
acts as trustee of a group pension scheme 
benefited from a qualifying pension 
scheme indemnity provision during the 
financial year and at the date of this report.
Directors’ share interests
Details regarding the share interests of the 
directors and their connected persons in 
the share capital of the Company, including 
any interests under the long-term incentive 
plan, are set out in the Remuneration

Relationship agreement with 
controlling shareholders
Any person who exercises or controls,  
on their own or together with any person 
with whom they are acting in concert, 
30% or more of the votes able to be  
cast at general meetings of a company is 
known as a ‘controlling shareholder’ under 
the Listing Rules. The Listing Rules require 
companies with controlling shareholders 
to enter into an agreement which is 
intended to ensure that the controlling 
shareholders comply with certain 
independence provisions in the Listing 
Rules and which must contain 
undertakings that:
• transactions and arrangements with the 
controlling shareholder (and/or any of its 
associates) will be conducted at arm’s 
length and on normal commercial terms;
• neither the controlling shareholder nor 
any of its associates will take any action 
that would have the effect of preventing 
the listed company from complying  
with its obligations under the Listing 
Rules; and
• neither the controlling shareholder  
nor any of its associates will propose  
or procure the proposal of a shareholder 
resolution which is intended or appears 
to be intended to circumvent the proper 
application of the Listing Rules.
Wittington Investments Limited 
(‘Wittington’) and, through their control of 
Wittington, the trustees of the Garfield 
Weston Foundation (‘the Foundation’) are 
controlling shareholders of the Company. 
Certain other individuals, including certain 
members of the Weston family who hold 
shares in the Company (and including  
two of the Company’s directors, George 
Weston and Emma Adamo) are, under the 
Listing Rules, treated as acting in concert 
with Wittington and the trustees of the 
Foundation and are therefore also treated 
as controlling shareholders of the 
Company. Wittington, the trustees of the 
Foundation and these individuals together 
comprise the controlling shareholders of 
the Company and, at 12 September 2015, 
have a combined interest in approximately 
59.06% of the Company’s voting rights.
The board confirms that, in accordance 
with the Listing Rules, on 14 November 
2014 the Company entered into a 
relationship agreement with Wittington 
and the trustees of the Foundation 
containing the required undertakings  
(the ‘Relationship Agreement’). Under  
the terms of the Relationship Agreement, 
Wittington has agreed to procure 
compliance with the undertakings by  
the other individuals who are treated as 
controlling shareholders (the ‘Non-Signing 
Controlling Shareholders’). The board 
confirms that, during the period under 
review, that is, from entry into the 
Relationship Agreement on 14 November 
2014 until 12 September 2015:
• the Company has complied with the 
independence provisions included  
in the Relationship Agreement;
• so far as the Company is aware, the 
independence provisions included  
in the Relationship Agreement have  
been complied with by the controlling 
shareholders and their associates; and
• so far as the Company is aware, the 
procurement obligation included in  
the Relationship Agreement as regards 
compliance with the independence 
provisions by the Non-Signing Controlling 
Shareholders and their associates, has 
been complied with by Wittington.

Authority to issue shares
At the AGM held on 5 December 2014, 
authority was given to the directors to  
allot unissued relevant securities in the 
Company up to a maximum of an amount 
equivalent to two-thirds of the shares in 
issue (of which one-third must be offered 
by way of rights issue). This authority 
expires on the date of this year’s AGM  
to be held on 4 December 2015. No such 
shares have been issued. The directors 
propose to renew this authority at the 
2015 AGM for the forthcoming year.
A further special resolution passed at that 
meeting granted authority to the directors 
to allot equity securities in the Company 
for cash, without regard to the pre-emption 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
This authority also expires on the date  
of the 2015 AGM and the directors will 
seek to renew this authority for the 
forthcoming year.
Authority to purchase own shares
The Companies Act 2006 empowers  
the Company to purchase its own shares 
subject to the necessary shareholder 
approval. The Company has no existing 
authority to purchase its own shares.
Amendment to Company’s articles  
of association
Any amendments to the Articles may be 
made in accordance with the provisions  
of the Companies Act 2006 by way of 
special resolution of the shareholders.
Significant agreements – change  
of control
The group has contractual arrangements 
with many parties including directors, 
employees, customers, suppliers  
and banking groups. The following 
arrangements are considered to be 
significant in terms of their potential 
impact on the business of the group as  
a whole and could alter or terminate  
on a change of control of the Company:
• the group has a number of borrowing 
facilities provided by various banking 
groups. These facility agreements 
generally include change of control 
provisions which, in the event of a 
change in ownership of the Company, 
could result in their renegotiation or 
withdrawal. The most significant of 
these are the £1.2bn syndicated loan 
facility signed on 15 July 2014 which 
was undrawn at the year end; and
• in addition to these bank facilities, the 
Company has in issue US$680m of 
private placement notes to institutional 
investors. In the event of a change  
in ownership of the Company, the 
Company is obliged to make an offer  
of immediate repayment to the 
remaining note holders. 
There are no agreements between the 
Company and its directors or employees 
providing for compensation for loss of 
office or employment that occurs as  
a result of a takeover bid.
Political donations
The Company did not make any political 
donations during the year. 
Financial risk management 
Details of the group’s use of financial 
instruments, together with information  
on our risk objectives and policies and our 
exposure to price, credit, liquidity, cash 
flow and interest rate risks, can be found  
in note 24 on pages 129 to 138.
Research and development
Innovative use of existing and emerging 
technologies will continue to be crucial  
to the successful development of new 
products and processes for the group.
The Company has a major technical  
centre in the UK at the Allied Technical 
Centre. Facilities also exist at ACH  
Food Companies in the US, Weston 
Technologies and AB Mauri in Australia 
and the Netherlands, and AB Enzymes  
in Germany. These centres support  
the technical resources of the trading 
divisions in the search for new technology 
and in monitoring and maintaining high 
standards of quality and food safety.
Branches
The Company, through various subsidiaries, 
has established branches in a number  
of different countries in which the  
group operates.
Post-balance sheet events
There have been no significant events 
affecting the group from 12 September 
2015 to the date of this report  
requiring disclosure.

the date of approval of this Directors’ 
report confirm that:

93 Governance | Statement of directors’ responsibilities |
We consider the annual report and 
financial statements, taken as a whole,  
is fair, balanced and understandable  
and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
position and performance, business 
model and strategy.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities 
in respect of the annual report and  
the financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing 
the annual report and the group and  
parent company financial statements  
in accordance with applicable law  
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors  
to prepare group and parent company 
financial statements for each financial 
year. Under that law they are required to 
prepare the group financial statements in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
EU and applicable law and have elected  
to prepare the parent company financial 
statements in accordance with UK 
Accounting Standards.
Under company law the directors must  
not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give  
a true and fair view of the state of affairs  
of the group and parent company and  
of their profit or loss for that period.  
In preparing each of the group and  
parent company financial statements,  
the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies  
and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates  
that are reasonable and prudent;
• for the group financial statements,  
state whether they have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted  
by the EU;
• for the parent company financial 
statements, state whether applicable 
UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained  
in the parent company financial 
statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on  
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the group 
and the parent company will continue  
in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company’s transactions and disclose  
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the parent company 
and enable them to ensure that its 
financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They have general 
responsibility for taking such steps as  
are reasonably open to them to safeguard 
the assets of the group and to prevent  
and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations,  
the directors are also responsible for 
preparing a Strategic report, Directors’ 
report, Remuneration report and 
Corporate governance statement  
that complies with that law and  
those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on  
the company’s website. Legislation in  
the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of  
the directors in respect of the  
annual report
We confirm that to the best of  
our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared  
in accordance with the applicable set  
of accounting standards, give a true  
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss  
of the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken  
as a whole; and
• the Strategic report includes a fair 
review of the development and 
performance of the business  
and the position of the Company  
and the undertakings included in  
the consolidation taken as a whole,  
together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties  
that they face.
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
94 Governance | Independent auditor’s report |
Our response continued
This assessment covered key inputs such  
as projected economic growth, operational 
improvement in factory performance,  
cost inflation, selling prices, volumes,  
and discount rates, as well as performing 
break-even analysis on the assumptions  
to assess the sensitivity of them on the 
headroom of each CGU.
We tested the sensitivity of the impairment 
calculations to changes in key assumptions 
used by the directors to evaluate the impact 
on the headroom for each CGU and to assess 
the reasonableness of the disclosures made.
We also assessed whether the group’s 
disclosures about the sensitivity of the 
outcome of the impairment assessment to 
changes in key assumptions reflected the key 
risks inherent in the valuation of goodwill, other 
intangibles and property, plant and equipment.
Tax provisioning (included within 
income tax creditor of £126m)
Refer to pages 71 (Audit committee 
report), 106 (accounting policy) and 112 
(financial disclosures).
The risk
Accruals for tax contingencies require the 
directors to make judgements and estimates 
in relation to tax issues and exposures given 
that the group operates in a number of tax 
jurisdictions, the complexities of transfer 
pricing and other international tax legislation 
and the time taken for tax matters to be 
agreed with the tax authorities.
Our response
In this area our audit procedures included  
the use of our own international and local 
tax specialists to assess the group’s tax 
positions, its correspondence with the 
relevant tax authorities, and to analyse  
and challenge the assumptions used  
to determine tax provisions based on  
our knowledge and experiences of the 
application of the international and local 
legislation by the relevant authorities  
and courts.
We also considered the adequacy of the 
group’s disclosures in respect of tax and 
uncertain tax positions.
Opinions and conclusions arising  
from our audit
1. Our opinion on the financial 
statements is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements 
of Associated British Foods plc for the  
52 week period ended 12 September 2015 
set out on pages 96 to 151.
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true  
and fair view of the state of the group’s 
and of the parent company’s affairs as  
at 12 September 2015 and of the 
group’s profit for the 52 weeks  
then ended;
• the group financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European 
Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU);
• the parent company financial 
statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with UK 
Accounting Standards; and
• the financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies  
Act 2006; and, as regards the group 
financial statements, Article 4 of  
the IAS Regulation.
2. Our assessment of risks  
of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above  
on the financial statements the risks  
of material misstatement that had  
the greatest effect on our audit were  
as follows:
Carrying value of goodwill, other 
intangibles and property plant  
and equipment of £1,404m
Carrying value non-current assets of  
AB Mauri (£531m), Australian meat 
(£84m), UK Bakeries (£258m) and 
European sugar (£531m).
Refer to pages 71 (Audit committee 
report), 106 (accounting policy) and  
114 to 117 (financial disclosures).
The risk
AB Mauri, Australian meat, European sugar 
and UK Bakeries have all experienced difficult 
trading environments in recent years.
AB Mauri’s profitability has been impacted 
by competitive pricing pressures in some  
of its businesses compounded by macro-
economic conditions, including high inflation 
rates and currency devaluations.
The Australian meat and UK Bakery 
businesses operate in environments of 
significant retailer pressure on price and 
competitor activity.
Uncertainty surrounding the impact of  
regime reform abolishing EU sugar quotas  
in 2017 and low world sugar prices have  
led to a significant decline in profitability  
of the group’s European sugar businesses. 
Improvement in profitability is dependent  
on recovery in sugar prices and maintaining 
competitive advantage through optimising 
factory performance.
In light of these trading challenges and the 
sensitivity to improvement in profitability, 
there is a risk that the group’s significant 
goodwill, other intangibles and property  
plant and equipment balances in respect  
of AB Mauri, Australian meat, UK Bakeries 
and European sugar businesses may not  
be recoverable.
The recoverability of these assets’ carrying 
value is therefore dependent on forecasting 
and discounting future cash flows, which  
is inherently uncertain.
North China which was previously considered 
to be at risk of impairment is no longer 
included following the disposal of two of  
the four factories and the associated losses 
on disposals recognised in the current year.
Our response
Our audit procedures included testing  
the principles and integrity of the group’s 
discounted cash flow model for each 
highlighted cash generating unit (CGU).
To assess the reasonableness of the cash 
flow model’s principal assumptions we 
compared them to externally derived data 
such as inflation, GDP growth forecasts, 
future commodity price indicators as  
well as our own assessments which took  
into account historic trends and other 
corroborative evidence available.
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT Governance
Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
95 Governance | Independent auditor’s report |
3. Our application of materiality and 
an overview of the scope of our audit
The materiality for the group financial 
statements as a whole was set at  
£50m, determined with reference to  
a benchmark of group profit before tax 
normalised to exclude impairment charges 
of £98m as disclosed in note 2 and losses 
on disposal and closures of businesses  
of £172m as disclosed in note 21 of 
£987m (of which it represents 5%).
We report to the Audit Committee  
any corrected or uncorrected identified 
misstatements exceeding £0.5m for items 
impacting the income statement and  
£2m for items in respect of balance sheet 
misclassifications in addition to other 
identified misstatements that warrant 
reporting on qualitative grounds.
Of the group’s 598 reporting components, 
we subjected 202 to audit for group 
reporting purposes and 40 to specified 
risk-focused audit procedures. The latter 
were not individually financially significant 
to require an audit for group reporting 
purposes, but were included in the scope 
of our group reporting work in order to 
provide further coverage over the 
identified risks and the group’s results.
The components within the scope  
of our audit work accounted for the 
percentages of the group’s results as 
shown in the table below.
†
The group audit team instructed 
component auditors as to the significant 
areas to be covered, including the relevant 
risks detailed above and the information  
to be reported back. The group audit team 
approved the component materialities 
which ranged from £0.01m to £35m, 
having regard to the mix of size and risk 
profile of the group across the components. 
The work on 84 of the 242 components 
was performed by component auditors 
and the rest by the group audit team.
The group audit team visited 55 
components in Ireland, UK, the US, 
Germany, Brazil, Spain and China. 
Telephone conference meetings were 
also held with these component auditors 
and the majority of the others that were 
not physically visited. At these visits and 
meetings, the findings reported to the 
group and divisional audit team were 
discussed in more detail, and any further 
work required by the group and divisional 
audit team was then performed by the 
component auditor.
4. Our opinion on other matters 
prescribed by the Companies Act  
2006 is unmodified
In our opinion:
• the part of the Remuneration report to 
be audited has been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic 
report and the Directors’ report for  
the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements.
5.  We have nothing to report in 
respect of the matters on which we 
are required to report by exception
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are 
required to report to you if, based on the 
knowledge we acquired during our audit, 
we have identified other information in  
the annual report that contains a material 
inconsistency with either that knowledge 
or the financial statements, a material 
misstatement of fact, or that is  
otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to report  
to you if:
• we have identified material 
inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our  
audit and the directors’ statement that 
they consider that the annual report  
and financial statements taken as a 
whole is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the group’s 
performance, business model and 
strategy; or
• the Governance section of the annual 
report does not appropriately address 
matters communicated by us to the 
Audit committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have  
not been kept by the parent company,  
or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches  
not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial 
statements and the part of the 
Remuneration report to be audited  
are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are  
not made; or
• we have not received all the  
information and explanations we  
require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required  
to review:
• the directors’ statement, set out  
on page 67 in relation to going  
concern; and
• the part of the Corporate Governance 
Statement on page 62 relating to the 
company’s compliance with the ten 
provisions of the 2012 UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for  
our review.
We have nothing to report in respect  
of the above responsibilities.
Scope and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
responsibilities statement set out on page 
93, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and 
for being satisfied that they give a  
true and fair view. A description of the 
scope of an audit of financial statements  
is provided on the Financial Reporting 
Council’s website at www.frc.org.uk/
auditscopeukprivate. This report is made 
solely to the company’s members as  
a body and is subject to important 
explanations and disclaimers regarding  
our responsibilities, published on our 
website at www.kpmg.com/uk/
auditscopeukco2014a, which are

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
for the 52 weeks ended 12 September 2015
Associated British Foods plc (‘the 
Company’) is a company domiciled in  
the United Kingdom. The consolidated 
financial statements of the Company for 
the 52 weeks ended 12 September 2015 
comprise those of the Company and  
its subsidiaries (together referred to as 
‘the group’) and the group’s interest in 
associates and joint arrangements.
The financial statements were  
authorised for issue by the directors  
on 3 November 2015.
The consolidated financial statements 
have been prepared and approved by the 
directors in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the EU (‘Adopted IFRS’).
The Company has elected to prepare  
its parent company financial statements 
under UK Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice. These are presented on pages 
147 to 151.
Basis of preparation
The going concern basis has been applied 
in these accounts. The consolidated 
financial statements are presented in 
sterling, rounded to the nearest million. 
They are prepared on the historical cost 
basis except that biological assets and 
certain financial instruments are stated  
at fair value. Assets classified as held  
for sale are stated at the lower of carrying 
amount and fair value less costs to sell.
The preparation of financial statements 
under Adopted IFRS requires 
management to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions about the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expenses and the disclosure 
of contingent assets and liabilities. The 
estimates and associated assumptions are 
based on experience. Actual results may 
differ from these estimates. Judgements 
made by management in the application 
of Adopted IFRS that have a significant 
effect on the financial statements,  
and estimates with a significant risk  
of material adjustment next year, are 
discussed in Accounting estimates  
and judgements detailed on page 106.
The estimates and underlying 
assumptions are reviewed on a regular 
basis. Revisions to accounting estimates 
are recognised from the period in which 
the estimates are revised.
The accounting policies set out below 
have been applied to all periods presented, 
except where detailed otherwise.
Details of new accounting standards 
which came into force in the year are  
set out at the end of this note.
The consolidated financial statements  
of the group are prepared to the Saturday 
nearest to 15 September. Accordingly, 
these financial statements have been 
prepared for the 52 weeks ended 
12 September 2015. To avoid delay  
in the preparation of the consolidated 
financial statements, the results of  
certain subsidiaries, joint arrangements 
and associates are included up to 
31 August each year. The results of  
Illovo are included for the period to 
30 September each year in line with 
Illovo’s local reporting date. Adjustments 
are made as appropriate for significant 
transactions or events occurring  
between 12 September and these  
other balance sheet dates.
The group’s business activities, together 
with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position 
are set out in the Strategic report on 
pages 6 to 45. The financial position  
of the group, its cash flows, liquidity 
position and borrowing facilities are 
described in the Financial review on 
pages 46 and 47. In addition, the Principal 
risks and uncertainties on pages 56 to  
59 and note 24 on pages 129 to 138  
provide details of the group’s policy  
on managing its financial and  
commodity risks.
The group has considerable financial 
resources, good access to debt markets,  
a diverse range of businesses and a  
wide geographic spread. It is therefore 
well placed to manage business  
risks successfully.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements 
include the results of the Company  
and all of its subsidiaries from the date 
that control commences to the date  
that control ceases. The consolidated  
financial statements also include the 
group’s share of the after-tax results, 
other comprehensive income and net 
assets of its joint arrangements and 
associates on an equity-accounted  
basis from the point at which joint  
control or significant influence 
respectively commences, to the  
date that it ceases.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled  
by the Company. Control exists when  
the Company has the power, directly  
or indirectly, to direct the activities  
of an entity so as to significantly  
affect the returns of that entity.
Changes in the group’s ownership 
interest in a subsidiary that do not  
result in a loss of control are accounted  
for within equity.
All the group’s joint arrangements  
are joint ventures, which are entities  
over whose activities the group has  
joint control, typically established by 
contractual agreement and requiring  
the venturers’ unanimous consent  
for strategic financial and  
operating decisions.
Associates are those entities in which  
the group has significant influence, being 
the power to participate in the financial 
and operating policy decisions of the 
entity, but which does not amount to 
control or joint control.
Where the group’s share of losses 
exceeds its interest in a joint venture  
or associate, the carrying amount is 
reduced to zero and recognition of  
further losses is discontinued except  
to the extent that the group has incurred 
legal or constructive obligations or  
made payments on behalf of  
an investee. 102
Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
for the 52 weeks ended 12 September 2015
Control, joint control and significant 
influence are generally assessed by 
reference to equity shareholdings and 
voting rights. The group owns a 51% 
stake in Illovo, which itself owns majority 
stakes in its non-South African businesses. 
Although the group’s ultimate interest  
in these non-South African businesses  
is less than 50%, they are consolidated  
as they are subsidiaries of a subsidiary. 
See note 28 for further details.
Business combinations
On the acquisition of a business, fair 
values are attributed to the identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
acquired, reflecting conditions at the  
date of acquisition. Adjustments to fair 
values include those made to bring 
accounting policies into line with those  
of the group. Provisional fair values  
are finalised within 12 months of the  
business combination date and, where 
significant, are adjusted by restatement  
of the comparative period in which the 
acquisition occurred. Non-controlling 
interests are measured at the proportionate 
share of the net identifiable assets acquired.
Existing equity interests in the acquiree 
are remeasured to fair value as at the  
date of the business combination,  
with any resulting gain or loss taken  
to the income statement.
Goodwill arising on a business 
combination is the excess of the 
remeasured carrying amount of any 
existing equity interest plus the fair value 
of consideration payable for the additional 
stake over the fair value of the share  
of net identifiable assets and liabilities 
acquired (including separately identified 
intangible assets), net of non-controlling 
interests. Total consideration does not 
include acquisition costs, which are 
expensed as incurred.
Contingent consideration is measured  
at fair value at the date of the business 
combination, classified as a liability  
or equity (usually as a liability), and 
subsequently accounted for in line with 
that classification. Changes in contingent 
consideration classified as a liability 
resulting other than from the finalisation  
of provisional fair values are accounted  
for in the income statement.
Revenue
Revenue represents the value of sales 
made to customers after deduction of 
discounts, sales taxes and a provision for 
returns. Discounts include sales rebates, 
price discounts, customer incentives, 
certain promotional activities and similar 
items. Revenue does not include sales 
between group companies. Revenue is 
recognised when the risks and rewards  
of the underlying products have been 
substantially transferred to the customer 
and when it can be measured reliably.
In the food businesses, revenue from  
the sale of goods is generally recognised 
on dispatch or delivery to customers, 
dependent on shipping terms. Discounts 
and returns are provided for as a reduction 
to revenue when sales are recorded, 
based on management’s best estimate  
of the amount required to meet claims  
by customers, taking into account 
contractual and legal obligations,  
historical trends and past experience.
In the retail business, revenue from  
the sale of goods is recognised when  
the customer purchases goods in-store. 
Returns are provided for as a reduction  
to revenue when sales are recorded, 
based on management’s best estimate  
of the amount required to meet claims  
by customers, taking into account 
historical trends and past experience.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are accounted for  
using the effective interest method.  
The group capitalises borrowing costs 
directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of qualifying 
items of property, plant and equipment  
as part of their cost. Interest capitalised  
is taxed under current or deferred tax  
as appropriate.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are defined as items  
of income and expenditure which are 
material and unusual in nature and  
which are considered to be of such 
significance that they require separate 
disclosure on the face of the  
income statement.
Adjusted profit and  
earnings measures
Adjusted operating profit is stated  
before amortisation of non-operating 
intangibles, profits less losses on  
disposal of non-current assets and 
exceptional items. Adjusted profit before 
tax is stated before amortisation of 
non-operating intangibles, profits less 
losses on disposal of non-current assets, 
profits less losses on sale and closure  
of businesses and exceptional items. 
Both measures are shown on the face  
of the income statement.
Adjusted earnings per share is shown in 
the notes and is stated before amortisation 
of non-operating intangibles, profits less 
losses on disposal of non-current assets, 
profits less losses on sale and closure  
of businesses and exceptional items 
together with the related tax effect.
Foreign currencies
In individual companies, transactions  
in foreign currencies are recorded at  
the rate of exchange at the date of the 
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
in foreign currencies are translated at the 
rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. 
Any resulting differences are taken to  
the income statement.
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of 
foreign operations that are denominated 
in foreign currencies are translated into 
sterling at the rate of exchange at the 
balance sheet date. Income and expense 
items are translated into sterling at 
weighted average rates of exchange.
Differences arising from the retranslation 
of opening net assets of group companies, 
together with differences arising from  
the restatement of the net results of 
group companies from average rates to 
rates at the balance sheet date, are taken 
to the translation reserve in equity. 103

Pensions and other post-
employment benefits
The group’s principal pension schemes 
are defined benefit plans. In addition  
the group has defined contribution plans  
and other unfunded post-employment 
liabilities. For defined benefit plans, the 
amount charged in the income statement 
is the cost of benefits accruing to 
employees over the year, plus any benefit 
improvements granted to members by 
the group during the year. It also includes  
net interest expense or income calculated 
by applying the liability discount rate to 
the net pension asset or liability. For each 
plan, the difference between market 
value of assets and present value of 
liabilities is disclosed as an asset or 
liability in the balance sheet. 
Any related deferred tax (to the extent 
recoverable) is disclosed separately in  
the balance sheet. Remeasurements  
are recognised immediately in other 
comprehensive income. Surpluses  
are recognised only to the extent that 
they are recoverable. Movements in 
irrecoverable surpluses are recognised 
immediately as remeasurement in  
other comprehensive income.
Contributions payable by the group in 
respect of defined contribution plans are 
charged to operating profit as incurred. 
Other unfunded post-employment 
liabilities are accounted for in the same 
way as defined benefit pension plans.
Share-based payments
The fair value of share awards at grant  
date is recognised as an employee 
expense with a corresponding increase  
in equity, spread over the period during 
which the employees become 
unconditionally entitled to the shares.  
The amount recognised is adjusted  
to reflect expected and actual levels  
of vesting except where the failure  
to vest is as a result of not meeting  
a market condition.
Income tax
Income tax on profit or loss for the period 
comprises current and deferred tax. 
Income tax is recognised in the income 
statement except to the extent that it 
relates to items taken directly to other 
comprehensive income.
Current tax is the tax expected to be 
payable on taxable income for the year, 
using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted during the period, together with 
any adjustment to tax payable in respect  
of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the  
balance sheet liability method, providing 
for temporary differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
for financial reporting purposes and the 
amounts used for taxation purposes.  
The following temporary differences are 
not provided for: initial recognition of 
goodwill; initial recognition of assets or 
liabilities affecting neither accounting nor 
taxable profit other than those acquired in 
a business combination; and differences 
relating to investments in subsidiaries  
to the extent that they will probably not 
reverse in the foreseeable future. The 
amount of deferred tax provided is based 
on the expected manner of realisation  
or settlement of the carrying amount  
of assets and liabilities, using tax rates 
enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only  
to the extent that it is probable that future 
taxable profits will be available against 
which the asset can be utilised.
Additional income taxes that arise  
from the distribution of dividends are 
recognised at the same time as the 
liability to pay the related dividend.
Financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and financial liabilities, 
except for other non-current investments 
and derivatives, are measured initially 
at fair value, plus directly attributable 
transaction costs, and thereafter  
at amortised cost. Other non-current 
investments (classified under other 
non-current receivables) comprise 
available-for-sale investments measured 
at market prices where available. Where 
quoted market prices in an active market 
are not available, and where fair value 
cannot be reliably measured, unquoted 
equity instruments are measured at  
cost less impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise  
bank and cash balances, call deposits  
and short-term investments with original 
maturities of three months or less. Bank 
overdrafts that are repayable on demand 
and form an integral part of the group’s cash 
management are included as a component 
of cash and cash equivalents for the 
purpose of the cash flow statement.
Derivatives
Derivatives are used to manage the 
group’s economic exposure to financial 
and commodity risks. The principal 
instruments used are foreign exchange 
and commodity contracts, futures, swaps  
or options (the ‘hedging instrument’).  
The group does not use derivatives for 
speculative purposes.
Derivatives are recognised in the  
balance sheet, at fair value, based on 
market prices or rates, or calculated  
using either discounted cash flow or 
option pricing models.
Changes in the value of derivatives are 
recognised in the income statement 
unless they qualify for hedge accounting, 
when recognition of any change in fair 
value depends on the nature of the item 
being hedged.
The purpose of hedge accounting is  
to mitigate the impact on the group’s 
income statement of changes in foreign 
exchange or interest rates and commodity 
prices, by matching the impact of the 
hedged risk and the hedging instrument 
in the income statement.
Changes in the value of derivatives  
used as hedges of future cash flows are 
recognised through other comprehensive 
income in the hedging reserve, with  
any ineffective portion recognised 
immediately in the income statement. 104

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
for the 52 weeks ended 12 September 2015
Calculation of recoverable amount
The recoverable amount of assets is  
the greater of their fair value less costs  
to sell and their value in use. In assessing 
value in use, estimated future cash  
flows are discounted to present value 
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the  
time value of money and the risks  
specific to the asset. For an asset that 
does not generate largely independent 
cash inflows, recoverable amount is 
determined for the CGU to which  
the asset belongs.
Reversals of impairment
An impairment charge in respect of 
goodwill is not subsequently reversed. 
For other assets, an impairment charge  
is reversed if there has been a change  
in the estimates used to determine the 
recoverable amount, but only to the 
extent that the new carrying amount  
does not exceed the carrying amount  
that would have been determined,  
net of depreciation or amortisation,  
if no impairment charge had  
been recognised.
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment 
are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment charges.
Depreciation is charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over  
the estimated useful lives of items of 
property, plant and equipment sufficient  
to reduce them to estimated residual 
value. Land is not depreciated.  
Estimated useful lives are generally 
deemed to be no longer than:
Freehold buildings 66 years
Plant and equipment, fixtures  
and fittings
–  sugar factories, yeast plants, 
mills and bakeries 20 years
– other operations 12 years
Vehicles 10 years
When the future cash flow results in  
the recognition of a non-financial asset  
or liability, the gains and losses previously 
recognised in the hedging reserve are 
included in the initial measurement of  
that asset or liability. Otherwise, gains 
and losses previously recognised in the 
hedging reserve are recognised in the 
income statement at the same time  
as the hedged transaction.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when 
the hedging instrument expires or is  
sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer 
qualifies for hedge accounting. At that 
time, any cumulative gain or loss on  
the hedging instrument recognised  
in the hedging reserve is retained in  
the hedging reserve until the forecast 
transaction occurs. Gains or losses  
on hedging instruments relating to an 
underlying exposure that no longer exists 
are taken to the income statement.
Hedges of the group’s net investment in 
foreign operations principally comprise 
borrowings in the currency of the 
investment’s net assets.
The group economically hedges foreign 
currency exposure on recognised 
monetary assets and liabilities but does 
not normally seek hedge accounting.  
Any derivatives that the group holds to 
hedge this exposure are classified as 
‘held for trading’ within derivative assets 
and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of 
such derivatives and the foreign exchange 
gains and losses arising on the related 
monetary items are recognised within 
operating profit.
Intangible assets other  
than goodwill
Non-operating intangible assets are 
intangible assets that arise on business 
combinations and typically include 
technology, brands, customer 
relationships and grower agreements. 
Operating intangible assets are acquired 
in the ordinary course of business and 
typically include computer software, land 
use rights and emissions trading licences.
Intangible assets other than goodwill  
are stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment charges.
Amortisation is charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the 
estimated useful lives of intangible assets 
from the date they are available for use. 
The estimated useful lives are generally 
deemed to be no longer than:
Technology and brands – up to 15 years
Customer relationships – up to 5 years
Grower agreements – up to 10 years
Goodwill
Goodwill is defined under ‘Business 
combinations’ on page 102. Certain 
commercial assets associated with the 
acquisition of a business are not capable 
of being recognised in the acquisition 
balance sheet. In such circumstances, 
goodwill is recognised, which may 
include, but is not necessarily limited  
to, workforce assets and the benefits  
of expected future synergies.
Goodwill is not amortised but is subject  
to an annual impairment review.
Research and development
Research expenditure is expensed as 
incurred. Development expenditure is 
capitalised if the product or process is 
technically and commercially feasible  
but is otherwise expensed as incurred. 
Capitalised development expenditure  
is stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment charges.
Impairment
The carrying amounts of the group’s 
intangible assets and property, plant and 
equipment are reviewed at each balance 
sheet date to determine whether there is 
any indication of impairment. If any such 
indication exists, the asset’s recoverable 
amount is estimated. For goodwill and 
intangibles without a finite life, the 
recoverable amount is estimated at  
each balance sheet date.
An impairment charge is recognised  
in the income statement whenever  
the carrying amount of an asset or its 
cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds  
its recoverable amount.
Impairment charges recognised in respect 
of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the 
carrying amount of any goodwill allocated 
to that CGU and then to reduce the 
carrying amount of the other assets  
in the unit on a pro rata basis. 105

Leases
A lease is an agreement whereby the 
lessor conveys to the lessee, in return  
for a payment or a series of payments, 
the right to use a specific asset for  
an agreed period of time.
Where the group is a lessee and has 
substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of an asset, the arrangement 
is considered a finance lease. Finance 
leases are recognised as assets of  
the group within property, plant and 
equipment at the inception of the lease  
at the lower of fair value and the present 
value of the minimum lease payments. 
Depreciation on leased assets is charged 
to the income statement on the same 
basis as owned assets. Payments made 
under finance leases are apportioned 
between capital repayments and interest 
expense charged to the income statement. 
Other leases where the group is a lessee 
are treated as operating leases. Payments 
made under operating leases are 
recognised in the income statement on  
a straight-line basis over the term of the 
lease, as is the benefit of lease incentives.
Where the group is a lessor under an 
operating lease, the asset is capitalised 
within property, plant and equipment  
and depreciated over its useful economic 
life. Payments received under operating 
leases are recognised in the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over  
the term of the lease.
Biological assets
Biological assets are measured at fair 
value less costs to sell. Cane roots and 
growing cane are stated at fair value  
on the following bases:
 Cane roots – escalated average cost, 
using appropriate inflation-related indices, 
of each year of planting adjusted for  
remaining expected life.
 Growing cane – estimated sucrose content 
valued at estimated sucrose price for the 
following season, less estimated costs  
for harvesting and transport.
When harvested, growing cane is 
transferred to inventory at fair value  
less costs to sell.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower  
of cost and net realisable value. Cost 
includes raw materials, direct labour and 
expenses and an appropriate proportion 
of production and other overheads, 
calculated on a first-in first-out basis.
Inventories for the retail businesses  
are valued at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value using the retail method, 
calculated on the basis of selling price 
less appropriate trading margin. All retail 
inventories are finished goods.
New accounting policies
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other 
Entities is applied for the first time in 2015. 
It requires disclosure of information on the 
group’s economic interests. The new and 
amended disclosures are given principally  
in notes 28 and 11.
The group has adopted the following  
new and amended IFRSs and IFRIC 
interpretations with no material impact 
apart from minor disclosure changes  
(all effective from 14 September 2014):
• IFRS 10 Consolidated  
Financial Statements;
• IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements;
• Annual Improvements to IFRSs 
2010–2012 and 2011–2013; and
• IAS 28 Investments in Associates  
and Joint Ventures.
The group is also assessing the impact  
of the following revised standards and 
interpretations or amendments that  
are not yet effective. Where already 
endorsed by the EU, these changes will 
be adopted on the effective dates noted. 
Where not yet endorsed by the EU, the 
adoption date is less certain. The impact 
of these standards is currently under 
review (all effective from 13 September 
2015 unless otherwise stated):
• Annual Improvements to IFRSs 
2012–2014 effective 2017  
financial year;
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: 
Classification and Measurement 
effective 2019 financial year  
(not yet endorsed by the EU);
• IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts  
with Customers effective 2018 
financial year (not yet endorsed  
by the EU); and
• Amendments to IAS 16 Property, 
Plant and Equipment and IAS 41 
Agriculture effective 2017 financial 
year, which changes the accounting 
requirements for bearer plants  
(cane roots, in the case of the group)  
(not yet endorsed by the EU). 106

1. Operating segments
The group has five operating segments, 
as described below. These are the 
group’s operating divisions, based on  
the management and internal reporting 
structure, which combine businesses 
with common characteristics, primarily  
in respect of the type of products offered 
by each business, but also the production 
processes involved and the manner of the 
distribution and sale of goods. The board 
is the chief operating decision-maker.
Inter-segment pricing is determined on  
an arm’s length basis. Segment result  
is adjusted operating profit, as shown  
on the face of the consolidated income 
statement. Segment assets comprise  
all non-current assets except employee 
benefits assets and deferred tax assets, 
and all current assets except cash and 
cash equivalents. Segment liabilities 
comprise trade and other payables, 
derivative liabilities and provisions. 
Segment results, assets and liabilities 
include items directly attributable to  
a segment as well as those that can  
be allocated on a reasonable basis. 
Unallocated items comprise mainly 
corporate assets and expenses, cash, 
borrowings, employee benefits balances 
and current and deferred tax balances. 
Segment non-current asset additions are 
the total cost incurred during the period  
to acquire segment assets that are 
expected to be used for more than one 
year, comprising property, plant and 
equipment, operating intangibles  
and biological assets.
The group is comprised of the following 
operating segments:
Grocery
The manufacture of grocery products, 
including hot beverages, sugar & 
sweeteners, vegetable oils, bread & 
baked goods, cereals, ethnic foods,  
 
herbs & spices, and meat products, 
which are sold to retail, wholesale and 
foodservice businesses.
Sugar
The growing and processing of sugar beet 
and sugar cane for sale to industrial users 
and to Silver Spoon, which is included in 
the grocery segment.
Agriculture
The manufacture of animal feeds and the 
provision of other products and services 
for the agriculture sector.
Ingredients
The manufacture of bakers’ yeast, bakery 
ingredients, enzymes, lipids, yeast 
extracts and cereal specialities.
Retail
Buying and merchandising value clothing 
and accessories through the Primark and 
Penneys retail chains.
In applying the accounting policies detailed 
on pages 101 to 105, management has 
made estimates in a number of areas  
and the actual outcome may differ from 
those calculated. Key sources of estimation 
uncertainty at the balance sheet date,  
with the potential for material adjustment  
to the carrying value of assets and 
liabilities within the next financial  
year, are set out below.
Forecasts and discount rates
The carrying values of a number of items 
on the balance sheet are dependent on 
estimates of future cash flows arising 
from the group’s operations which, in 
some circumstances, are discounted  
to arrive at a net present value.
Assessment for impairment involves 
comparing the book value of an asset 
with its recoverable amount (being the 
higher of value in use and fair value less 
costs to sell). Value in use is determined 
with reference to projected future cash 
flows discounted at an appropriate rate. 
Both the cash flows and the discount  
rate involve a significant degree of 
estimation uncertainty.
The realisation of deferred tax assets is 
dependent on the generation of sufficient 
future taxable profits. The group 
recognises deferred tax assets to the 
extent that it is considered probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available 
in the future. Deferred tax assets are 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
considered probable that the related tax 
benefit will be realised.
Post-retirement benefits
The group’s defined benefit pension 
schemes and similar arrangements are 
assessed annually in accordance with 
IAS 19. The accounting valuation, which 
has been assessed using assumptions 
determined with independent actuarial 
advice, resulted in a net liability of £16m 
being recognised as at 12 September 
2015. The size of this net liability is 
sensitive to the market value of the assets 
held by the schemes, to the discount  
rate used in assessing liabilities, to the 
actuarial assumptions (which include  
price inflation, rates of pension and  
salary increases, mortality and other 
demographic assumptions) and to the 
level of contributions. Further details  
are included in note 12.
Biological assets
Cane roots valuation requires an 
estimation by management of the 
average number of ratoons expected 
from each root. The carrying value of  
cane roots is disclosed in note 10.
For the growing cane valuation, estimated 
sucrose content requires management to 
assess expected cane and sucrose yields 
for the following season considering 
weather conditions and harvesting 
programmes; estimated sucrose price 
requires management to assess into 
which markets the forthcoming crop will 
be sold and assess domestic and export 
prices as well as related foreign currency 
exchange rates. The carrying value of 
growing cane is disclosed in note 10.
Taxation
The group makes provision for open  
tax issues including, in a number of 
jurisdictions, routine tax audits which are  
by nature complex and can take a number 
of years to resolve. Provisions are based 
on management’s interpretation of  
tax law in each country and reflect the 
best estimate of the liability. The group 
believes it has made adequate provision 
for such matters. 107

The exceptional item is a £98m non-cash charge to impair the group’s shareholder loans to Vivergo Fuels which, at the time of  
the impairment, was a joint venture in which the group’s equity interest was 47%. Vivergo Fuels is based in the UK and is included  
in the Sugar segment. The impairment was a consequence of the continuing fall in crude oil and bioethanol prices and the further 
weakening of the euro against sterling, both of which affected the group’s assessment of the recoverability of the shareholder loans. 
An exceptional tax credit of £22m arose on this item.

The UK corporation tax rate was reduced to 20% with effect from 1 April 2015 and UK deferred tax has been calculated using  
a rate of 20%. Further reductions in the corporation tax rate to 19% and 18% in April 2017 and April 2020 respectively have been 
substantively enacted since the balance sheet date. Accordingly, the effect of these changes on UK deferred tax balances will  
be included in 2015/16.

7. Earnings per share
The calculation of basic earnings per share at 12 September 2015 was based on the net profit attributable to equity shareholders  
of £532m (2014 – £762m), and a weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year of 790 million (2014 – 790 million). 
The calculation of the weighted average number of shares excludes the shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust 
on which the dividends are being waived.
Adjusted earnings per ordinary share, which exclude the impact of exceptional items, profits less losses on disposal of non-current 
assets and the sale and closure of businesses, amortisation of non-operating intangibles and any associated tax credits, is shown  
to provide clarity on the underlying performance of the group.
The diluted earnings per share calculation takes into account the dilutive effect of share incentives. The diluted, weighted average 
number of shares is 790 million (2014 – 790 million). There is no difference between basic and diluted earnings.

8. Intangible assets continued
A CGU, or group of CGUs, to which goodwill has been allocated must be assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently  
if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
The carrying value of goodwill is assessed by reference to its value in use to perpetuity reflecting the projected cash flows of each  
of the CGUs or group of CGUs. These projections are based on the most recent budget, which has been approved by the board and 
reflects management’s expectations of sales growth, operating costs and margin, based on past experience and external sources  
of information. Long-term growth rates for periods not covered by the annual budget reflect the products, industries and countries  
in which the relevant CGU, or group of CGUs, operate.
For some recently acquired intangible assets, management expects to achieve growth over the next three to five years in excess  
of the long-term growth rates for the applicable country or region. In these circumstances, budgeted cash flows are extended, 
generally to between three and five years, using specific growth assumptions and taking into account the specific business risks.
The key assumptions on which the cash flow projections for the most recent annual budget are based relate to discount rates, 
growth rates and expected changes in volumes, selling prices and direct costs.
The cash flow projections have been discounted using the group’s pre-tax weighted average cost of capital adjusted for country, 
industry and market risk. The rates used were between 9.5% and 14.8% (2014 – between 10.0% and 15.7%).
The growth rates to perpetuity beyond the initial budgeted cash flows, applied in the value in use calculations for goodwill allocated 
to each of the CGUs or groups of CGUs that are significant to the total carrying amount of goodwill, were in a range between 0% 
and 4%, consistent with the inflation factors included in the discount rates applied (2014 – between 0% and 5%).
Changes in volumes, selling prices and direct costs are based on past results and expectations of future changes in the market.
Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions
Impairment testing is dependent on management’s estimates and judgements, particularly as they relate to the forecasting of future 
cash flows, the discount rates selected and expected long-term growth rates. Each of the group’s CGUs had significant headroom 
under the annual impairment review with the exception of AB Mauri.
Notwithstanding a further substantial improvement in profit in the current year, particularly in the US, Canada, Brazil and 
HispanoAmerica, AB Mauri has continued to experience competitive pressure in a number of markets around the world. Management 
has reviewed detailed forecasts for this business for a period of ten years to reflect the time required for completion of the dry yeast 
production strategy, and has concluded that the assets are not impaired. Key drivers of the forecast improvement in performance 
include improved reach and competitiveness in the global dry yeast market from the yeast factory in Mexico, implementation of  
a number of margin improvement initiatives, particularly in cost reduction, and continuing growth in the global bakery ingredients 
business. Headroom was $190m on a CGU carrying value of $947m (2014 – headroom of $306m on a CGU carrying value of 
$1,078m). The geographic diversity and varying local economic environments of AB Mauri’s operations mean that the critical 
assumptions underlying the detailed forecasts used in the impairment model are wide ranging. It is therefore impractical to provide 
meaningful sensitivities to these assumptions other than the discount rate. The discount rate used was 14.66% (2014 – 12.7%) and 
would have to increase to more than 16.73% (2014 – 15.0%) before value in use fell below the CGU carrying value. Estimates of 
long-term growth rates beyond the forecast periods were 2%–3% (2014 – 2.5%–3%) per annum dependent on location.
For all goodwill other than AB Mauri, management has concluded that no reasonably possible change in key assumptions on which 
it has determined value in use would cause carrying values to materially exceed value in use. 116

Impairment
The methodology used to assess property, plant and equipment for impairment is the same as that described for impairment 
assessments of goodwill. See note 8 for further details.
An impairment of A$150m (£98m) was recorded in 2012 in the Australian meat business. Although further progress was made in 
the current year to reduce the factory cost base and improve efficiency, high-cost raw materials in the first half of the year held back 
the rate of profit improvement. Following a detailed assessment, management has concluded that the carrying value of the assets  
in the meat business is not further impaired. Headroom was A$30m on a CGU carrying value of A$284m (2014 – headroom of 
A$26m on a CGU carrying value of A$286m). The discount rate used was 10.5% (2014 – 10.5%). Estimates of long-term growth 
rates beyond the forecast periods were 2.0% (2014 – 2.0%) per annum. A sensitivity of +/- 1% applied to volume assumptions  
after 2017 impacts headroom by +/- A$14m.
Low prices in the EU Sugar businesses led to a substantial fall in operating profit and resulted in them being assessed for impairment. 
Headroom in Azucarera in Spain was €116m on a CGU carrying value of €392m. The discount rate used was 12.83%. A sensitivity  
of +/- 1% applied to sugar pricing in 2020 and beyond impacts headroom by +/- €16m. Headroom in British Sugar was £228m on  
a CGU carrying value of £514m. The discount rate used was 9.7%. A sensitivity of +/- 1% applied to sugar pricing in 2020 and 
beyond impacts headroom by +/- £42m. 117

9. Property, plant and equipment continued
Low bread prices and strong competition in the UK bakery sector led to lower profitability at Allied Bakeries and resulted in the need  
for an assessment of impairment. Headroom was £27m on a CGU carrying value of £294m. The discount rate used was 10.95%.  
A sensitivity of +/- 1% applied to bread volumes impacts headroom by +/- £17m.

12. Employee entitlements
The group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution retirement benefit schemes in the UK and overseas. The 
defined benefit schemes expose the group to a variety of actuarial risks including demographic assumptions such as mortality and 
financial assumptions such as discount rate, inflation risk and market (investment) risk. The group is not exposed to any unusual, 
entity-specific or scheme-specific risks. All schemes comply with local legislative requirements.
UK defined benefit scheme
The group’s principal UK defined benefit scheme is the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme, which is a funded final salary 
scheme that is closed to new members. Defined contribution arrangements are in place for other employees. The UK defined 
benefit schemes represent 92% (2014 – 91%) of the group’s defined benefit scheme assets and 89% (2014 – 89%) of the defined 
benefit scheme liabilities. The Scheme is governed by a trustee board which is independent of the group and which agrees a 
schedule of contributions with the Company each time a formal funding valuation is performed.
The most recent triennial funding valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 5 April 2014, using the current unit method,  
and revealed a surplus of £79m. The market value of Scheme assets was £3,085m, representing 103% of members’ accrued 
benefits after allowing for expected future salary increases.
The Scheme’s assets are managed using a risk-controlled investment strategy, which includes a liability-driven investment policy that 
seeks to match, where appropriate, the profile of the liabilities. This includes the use of derivative instruments to hedge inflation, interest 
and foreign exchange risks. The Scheme utilises both market and solvency triggers to develop the level of hedges in place. To date,  
the Scheme is fully hedged for 31% of inflation sensitivity and 24% of interest rate risk. It is intended to hedge 80% of total exposure.
The Scheme is forbidden by the trust deed from holding direct investments in the equity of the Company, although it is possible  
that the Scheme may hold indirect interests through investments in some equity funds. The Scheme owns the freehold of an  
office building in London which is leased to the group at an open market rent. The fair value of this building is £7m (2014 – £6m). 119

12. Employee entitlements continued
Overseas defined benefit schemes
The group also operates defined benefit retirement schemes in a number of overseas businesses, which are primarily funded final 
salary schemes, as well as a small number of unfunded post-retirement medical benefit schemes, which are accounted for in the 
same way as defined benefit retirement schemes.
Defined contribution schemes
The group operates a number of defined contribution schemes for which the charge was £36m in the UK and £40m overseas, 
totalling £76m (2014 – UK £38m, overseas £38m, total £76m).
Actuarial assumptions
The principal actuarial assumptions for the group’s defined benefit schemes at the year end were:
2015
UK
%
2015
Overseas
%
2014
UK
%
2014
Overseas
%
Discount rate 3.8 0.9 – 16.3 4.1 1.5 – 15.7
Inflation 3.3 0 – 7.4 3.4 0.8 – 9.2
Rate of increase in salaries 3.8 0 – 12.0 3.9 0.5 – 10.7
Rate of increase for pensions in payment 3.1 0 – 4.5 3.2 1.2 – 6.3
Rate of increase for pensions in deferment (where provided) 2.8 0 – 2.0 2.9 1.2 – 6.3
The mortality assumptions used to value the UK defined benefit schemes in both years are derived from the S2 mortality tables  
with improvements in line with the 2013 projection model prepared by the Continuous Mortality Investigation of the UK actuarial 
profession, with no rating for males and a +0.7-year rating down for females, both with a long-term trend of 1.5%. These mortality 
assumptions take account of experience to date, and assumptions for further improvements in life expectancy of scheme members. 
Examples of the resulting life expectancies in the UK defined benefit schemes are as follows:
2015 2014
Life expectancy from age 65 (in years) Male Female Male Female
Member aged 65 in 2015 (2014) 22.7 25.4 22.7 25.2
Member aged 65 in 2035 (2034) 25.0 27.7 24.8 27.6
Other demographic assumptions for the UK defined benefit schemes are set having regard to the latest trends in scheme 
experience and other relevant data. The assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic funding 
valuation of the schemes.
For the overseas schemes, regionally appropriate assumptions for mortality, financial and demographic factors have been used.
A sensitivity analysis on the principal assumptions used to measure UK defined benefit scheme liabilities at 12 September 2015 is:
Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities
Discount rate decrease/increase by 0.5% increase/decrease by 9.2%
Inflation increase/decrease by 0.5% increase/decrease by 8.2%
Rate of increase in salaries increase/decrease by 0.5% increase/decrease by 1.8%
Rate of mortality reduce by one year increase by 3.1%
A sensitivity to the rate of increase in pensions in payment and pensions in deferment is represented by the inflation sensitivity, as all 
pensions increases and deferred revaluations are linked to inflation.
The sensitivity analysis above has been determined based on reasonably possible changes in the respective assumptions occurring 
at the end of the period and may not be representative of the actual change. It is based on a change in the specific assumption while 
holding all other assumptions constant. When calculating the sensitivities, the same method used to calculate scheme liabilities 
recognised in the balance sheet has been applied. The method and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis have not 
changed since the prior year. 120

from future contribution reductions.
Corporate and other bonds relating to UK schemes of £627m includes £49m (2014 – £46m) of assets whose valuation is not derived 
from quoted market prices. The valuation for all other equity assets, government bonds, corporate and other bonds is derived from 
quoted market prices. The carrying value of UK property assets is based on a 31 March market valuation, adjusted for purchases, 
disposals and price indexation between the valuation and the balance sheet dates. Cash and other assets contains £185m  
(2014 – £127m) of assets whose valuation is not derived from quoted market prices.
For financial reporting in the group’s accounts, liabilities are assessed by actuaries using the projected unit method. The accounting 
value is different from the result obtained using the funding basis, mainly due to different assumptions used to project scheme 
liabilities.
The defined benefit scheme liabilities comprise 28% (2014 – 33%) in respect of active participants, 23% (2014 – 20%) for deferred 
participants and 49% (2014 – 47%) for pensioners.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit scheme liabilities at the end of the year is 18 years (UK schemes – 18 years 
and overseas schemes – 18 years).

Cash flow
Group cash flow in respect of employee benefits schemes comprises contributions paid to funded schemes of £39m  
(2014 – £41m) and benefits paid in respect of unfunded schemes of £nil (2014 – £nil). Contributions to funded defined benefit  
schemes are subject to periodic review. Contributions to defined contribution schemes amounted to £76m (2014 – £76m).
Total contributions to funded schemes and benefit payments by the group in respect of unfunded schemes in 2016 are currently 
expected to be approximately £28m in the UK and £9m overseas, totalling £37m (2015 – UK £29m, overseas £8m, totalling £37m).

Deferred tax assets (125) (152)

The recoverability of deferred tax assets is supported by the expected level of future profits in the countries concerned.  
Other deferred tax assets totalling £86m (2014 – £88m) have not been recognised on the basis that their future economic  
benefit is uncertain.
In addition, there are temporary differences of £1,992m (2014 – £2,122m) relating to investments in subsidiaries. No deferred  
tax has been provided in respect of these differences, since the timing of the reversals can be controlled and it is probable  
that the temporary differences will not reverse in the future.

Restructuring
Restructuring provisions relate to the cash costs, including redundancy, associated with the group’s announced reorganisation plans.
Deferred consideration
Deferred consideration comprises estimates of amounts due to the previous owners of businesses acquired by the group which are  
often linked to performance or other conditions.
Other
Other provisions mainly comprise litigation claims and warranty claims arising from the sale and closure of businesses. The extent  
and timing of the utilisation of these provisions is more uncertain given the nature of the claims and the period of the warranties.
20. Share capital and reserves
Share capital
At 13 September 2014 and 12 September 2015, the Company’s issued and fully paid share capital comprised 791,674,183 ordinary 
shares of 5
15
⁄22p, each carrying one vote per share. Total nominal value was £45m.
Other reserves
£173m of other reserves arose from the cancellation of share premium account by the Company in 1993. The remaining £2m  
arose in 2010 as a transfer to capital redemption reserve following redemption of two million £1 deferred shares at par. Both are  
non-distributable.
Translation reserve
The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements  
of foreign operations, as well as from the translation of liabilities that hedge the group’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries.
Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve comprises all changes in the value of derivatives to the extent that they are effective cash flow hedges,  
net of amounts recycled from the hedging reserve on occurrence of the hedged transaction or when the hedged transaction  
is no longer expected to occur. 126

In October 2014, the group acquired Dorset Cereals in the UK for gross cash consideration of £68m, but with cash acquired of £8m. 
Non-operating intangible assets of £21m in respect of brand and customer relationships together with the related deferred tax were 
recognised as fair value adjustments.
In May 2015, the group acquired BP’s 47% interest in Vivergo Fuels in the UK, in which the group already held an equity-accounted 
joint venture interest of 47%. Fair value adjustments comprised the valuation of shareholder loan obligations and associated interest 
accruals together with the related tax consequences.
A non-cash charge of £75m was recorded in line with accounting requirements to remeasure the group’s interest at fair value prior 
to the acquisition. This was charged to loss on sale and closure of business.
The acquisitions contributed aggregate revenues of £81m and an adjusted loss before tax of £1m for the period between the  
dates of acquisition and 12 September 2015. Aggregate contributions to revenue and adjusted profit before tax had the acquisitions 
occurred at the beginning of the period have not been disclosed, as appropriate financial information prepared under Adopted IFRS  
is not available.
2014
During 2014, the group acquired a bakery ingredients business in western Europe and a small animal feed specialist in the UK,  
which together increased net assets by £8m, satisfied by cash consideration of £7m and deferred consideration of £1m. Cash  
and cash equivalents of £5m were acquired with the businesses.
Pre-acquisition carrying amounts were the same as recognised values on acquisition apart from a £4m non-operating intangible  
asset recognised in respect of customer relationships. The acquisitions contributed aggregate revenues of £27m and adjusted  
profit before tax of £1m for the period between the dates of acquisition and 13 September 2014. Aggregate contributions  
to revenue and adjusted profit before tax had the acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the period were not disclosed,  
as appropriate financial information prepared under Adopted IFRS was not available. 127

21. Acquisitions and disposals continued
The cash consideration net of cash acquired with the businesses was £2m which compares with a cash outflow of £8m on  
the purchase of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates shown in the cash flow statement. The difference related to a £5m 
investment in an existing joint venture and £1m of deferred consideration paid in respect of prior year acquisitions.

The group incurred a net £75m non-cash charge arising on the acquisition of BP’s 47% interest in Vivergo Fuels. Accounting 
standards require the remeasurement of the group’s interest at fair value prior to the acquisition, resulting in a loss on the deemed 
disposal of the group’s original interest prior to its immediate re-acquisition at fair value.
Also in the Sugar segment, an intangible asset with a carrying value of £11m was written off on closure of a small business in  
North America.
£14m of warranty provisions relating to disposals made in previous years are no longer required and were released during the year. 
These comprised £6m in Grocery (all in the UK), £5m in Sugar (£4m in Europe & Africa and £1m in Asia Pacific) and £3m in Agriculture 
(all in the UK).
The cash consideration received for the disposal was £3m which compares with a cash inflow of £5m on the sale of subsidiaries, 
joint ventures and associates shown in the cash flow statement. The difference relates to deferred consideration received in respect 
of prior year disposals. 128

21. Acquisitions and disposals continued
2014
During 2014, the group disposed of its interest in a US associate in the Ingredients segment for a profit of £7m. Cash consideration 
was £12m, deferred consideration was £1m, share of net assets disposed was £2m and provisions made were £4m. In addition,  
a charge of £9m was made in the Ingredients segment in China and India for restructuring costs associated with business closures, 
including a £4m impairment of goodwill.
The net cash of £13m differs from the cash inflow of £15m on the sale of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates shown in the cash 
flow statement. The £2m difference relates to deferred consideration received in respect of disposals made in previous years.
22. Share-based payments
The group had the following principal equity-settled share-based payment plans in operation during the period:
Associated British Foods Executive Share Incentive Plan 2003 (‘the Share Incentive Plan’)
The Share Incentive Plan was approved and adopted by the Company at the annual general meeting held on 5 December 2003.  
It takes the form of conditional allocations of shares which are released if, and to the extent that, performance targets are satisfied, 
typically over a three-year performance period. The Share Incentive Plan expired in December 2013, with the last grant of allocations 
made in November 2013. Conditional shares allocated under the Share Incentive Plan will vest under the terms of that plan.
Associated British Foods Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘the LTIP’)
The LTIP was approved and adopted by the Company at the annual general meeting held on 6 December 2013. It takes the form  
of conditional allocations of shares which are released if, and to the extent that, performance targets are satisfied, typically over  
a three-year performance period.
Further information regarding the operation of the above plans can be found in the Remuneration report on pages 74 to 89.
Total conditional allocations under the group’s equity-settled share-based payment plans are as follows:
Balance

2014 5,013,465 1,177,056 (932,626) (892,554) 4,365,341
Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust
Ordinary shares subject to allocation under the group’s equity-settled share-based payment plans are held in a separate Employee 
Share Ownership Plan Trust. The Trust is funded by the Company. Voting rights attached to shares held by the Trust are exercisable 
by the trustee, who is entitled to consider any recommendation made by a committee of the Company. At 12 September 2015  
the Trust held 1,490,218 (2014 – 3,062,447) ordinary shares of the Company. The market value of these shares at the year end  
was £46m (2014 – £80m). The Trust has waived its right to dividends. Movements in the year were releases of 1,572,229 shares  
(2014 – releases of 932,626 and purchases of 2,000,000 shares).
Fair values
The weighted average fair value of conditional grants made was determined by taking the market price of the shares at the time  
of grant and discounting for the fact that dividends are not paid during the vesting period. The weighted average fair value of the 
conditional shares allocated during the year was 2,873 pence (2014 – 2,226 pence) and the weighted average share price was  
3,089 pence (2014 – 2,393 pence). The dividend yield used was 2.5%. 129

24. Financial instruments continued
The methods and assumptions used to estimate fair values of financial assets and liabilities are as follows:
Financial asset/liability Fair value determination
Cash and cash equivalents
Trade receivables, other receivables and accrued income
Trade payables, other payables and accruals
Fair values have been stated at book values due to short maturities or 
otherwise immediate or short-term access and realisability.
Other non-current investments (recorded within other  
non-current receivables)
These comprise minority shareholdings held primarily in privately owned, 
unquoted companies, where there is no active market available to value 
them. Where the fair value of the equity instruments cannot be reliably 
measured, they are recorded at cost.
Where shareholdings are held in publicly quoted companies, bid price  
is used to estimate fair value.
Other non-current receivables
Loans and overdrafts
Finance leases
Fair values for these level 2 financial instruments have been estimated  
by discounting expected future cash flows (see below).
Derivatives Fair values are typically determined either by reference to third-party 
valuations (usually from a bank), or by reference to readily observable 
market prices.
The group’s derivatives primarily cover a period of no more than 12 months 
from the balance sheet date, and information derived from an active market  
is almost always available to assist with the valuation of derivatives.
Deferred consideration Deferred consideration is measured at the directors’ best estimate of the 
expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and  
is discounted to present value where the effect is material. Consequently,  
fair value is equivalent to book value.
Valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value
Financial instruments carried at fair value in the balance sheet comprise other non-current investments and derivatives. The group  
classifies these financial instruments using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the relative significance of both objective evidence and 
subjective judgements on the inputs used in making the fair value measurements:
• Level 1: financial instruments are valued using observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted market prices in an active 
market for identical instruments. An example of an item in this category is a widely traded equity instrument with a normal 
quoted market price.
• Level 2: financial instruments are valued using techniques based on observable inputs, either directly (i.e. market prices and 
rates) or indirectly (i.e. derived from market prices and rates). An example of an item in this category is a currency derivative, 
where forward exchange rates and yield curve data, which are observable in the market, are used to derive fair value.
• Level 3: financial instruments are valued using techniques involving significant unobservable inputs.
b) Derivatives
All derivatives are classified as current on the face of the balance sheet. The table below analyses the carrying amount of derivatives 
and their contractual/notional amounts, together with an analysis of derivatives by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which their 
fair value measurement method is categorised.

year of £46m, £40m is attributable to equity shareholders and £6m to non-controlling interests (2014 – £(42)m attributable to equity 
shareholders and £(2)m to non-controlling interests).
d) Financial risk identification and management
The group is exposed to the following financial risks from its use of financial instruments:
• market risk;
• credit risk; and
• liquidity risk.
The group’s financial risk management process seeks to enable the early identification, evaluation and effective management of key 
risks facing the business. Risk management policies and systems have been established and are reviewed regularly to reflect changes 
in market conditions and the group’s activities. The group, through its standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and 
constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The group sources and sells products and manufactures goods in many locations around the world. These operations expose the 
group to potentially significant price volatility in the financial and commodity markets. Trading and risk management teams have 
been established in the group’s major businesses to manage this exposure by entering into a range of products, including physical 
and financial forward contracts, futures and, where appropriate, options. These teams work closely with group Treasury and report 
regularly to executive management.
Treasury operations and commodity procurement are conducted within a clearly defined framework of board-approved policies  
and guidelines to manage the group’s financial and commodity risks. Treasury works closely with the group’s procurement teams  
to manage commodity risks. Treasury policy seeks to ensure that adequate financial resources are available to the group at all times,  
for the management and development of the group’s businesses, whilst effectively managing its market risk and credit risk.  
The group’s risk management policy explicitly forbids the use of financial or commodity derivatives (outside its risk management 
framework of mitigating financial and commodity risks) for speculative purposes. 132

e) Foreign currency translation
The group presents its financial statements in sterling. As a result of its worldwide operations, the group is exposed to foreign 
currency translation risk where overseas operations have a functional currency other than sterling. Changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates impact the translation into sterling of both the income statement and net assets of these foreign operations.
Where appropriate, the group finances its operations by borrowing locally in the functional currency of its operations. This reduces 
net asset values reported in functional currencies other than sterling, thereby reducing the economic exposure to fluctuations in 
foreign currency exchange rates on translation.
The group also finances its operations by obtaining funding at group level through external borrowings and, where they are not in 
sterling, these borrowings may be designated as net investment hedges. This enables gains and losses arising on retranslation of 
these foreign currency borrowings to be charged to other comprehensive income, providing a partial offset in equity against the 
gains and losses arising on translation of the net assets of foreign operations.
The group does not actively hedge the translation impact of foreign exchange rate movements on the income statement (other than  
via the partial economic hedge arising from the servicing costs on non-sterling borrowings).
The group designates certain of its intercompany loan arrangements as quasi-equity for the purposes of IAS 21. The effect of the 
designation is that any foreign exchange volatility arising within the borrowing entity and/or the lending entity is accounted for 
directly within other comprehensive income.
The group has $280m of borrowings (2014 – $280m) that have been designated as hedges of its net investment in foreign 
operations in US dollars.
A net foreign exchange loss of £7m (2014 – gain of £29m) on retranslation of these loans has been taken to the translation  
reserve on consolidation, all of which was attributable to equity shareholders. The group also held currency forwards and cross 
currency swaps that have been designated as hedges of its net investments in Australian dollars and euros, whose change  
in fair value of £29m has been credited to the translation reserve, all of which was attributable to equity shareholders  
(2014 – £4m debited to the translation reserve).
f) Market risk
Market risk is the risk of movements in the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument or forecast transaction as 
underlying market prices change. The group is exposed to changes in the market price of commodities, interest rates and foreign 
exchange rates. These risks are known as ‘transaction’ (or recognised) exposures and ‘economic’ (or forecast) exposures.
(i) Commodity price risk
Commodity price risk arises from the procurement of raw materials and the consequent exposure to changes in market prices.
The group purchases a wide range of commodities in the ordinary course of business. Exposure to changes in the market price of 
certain of these commodities including wheat, edible oils, soya beans, meat, sugar raws, cocoa, rice, tea and energy is managed 
through the use of forward physical contracts and hedging instruments, including futures and options contracts, primarily to convert 
floating or indexed prices to fixed prices. The use of such contracts to hedge commodity exposures is governed by the group’s risk 
management policies and is continually monitored by group Treasury. Commodity derivatives also provide a way to meet customers’ 
pricing requirements whilst achieving a price structure consistent with the group’s overall pricing strategy.
Some of the group’s commodity derivatives are treated as ‘own use’ contracts, since they are both entered into, and continue to  
be held, for the purposes of the group’s ordinary operations, and the group takes physical delivery of the commodity concerned. 
‘Own use’ contracts do not require accounting entries until the commodity purchase actually crystallises. Certain other commodity 
derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges, but some are not eligible for treatment as ‘own use’ contracts and are not 
contracts for which the strict requirements of hedge accounting can be satisfied. This occurs typically where the group does not 
take physical delivery of the commodity concerned. Such commodity derivatives are used only where the business believes they 
provide an economic hedge of an underlying exposure. These instruments are classified as held for trading and are marked to  
market through the income statement.
The majority of the group’s forward physical contracts and commodity derivatives have original maturities of less than one year.
The group does not have significant sensitivities in respect of the accounting for its on-balance sheet commodity contracts. 133

(ii) Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk comprises two primary elements:
• interest price risk results from financial instruments bearing fixed interest rates. Changes in floating interest rates therefore 
affect the fair value of these fixed rate financial instruments; and
• interest cash flow risk results from financial instruments bearing floating rates. Changes in floating interest rates affect cash 
flows on interest receivable or payable.
The group’s policy is to maintain floating rate debt for a significant proportion of its bank finance, although it periodically assesses  
its position with respect to interest price and cash flow risk.
At 12 September 2015, £636m (71%) (2014 – £593m and 61%) of total debt was subject to fixed rates of interest, the majority  
of which is the US private placement loans of £601m (2014 – £579m).
Floating rate debt comprises bank borrowings bearing interest rates fixed in advance, for various time periods up to 12 months,  
by reference to official market rates (e.g. LIBOR).
The group does not have significant sensitivities to the impact of interest rates on derivative valuations, nor to the impact of interest 
rates on floating rate borrowings.
(iii) Foreign currency risk
The group conducts business worldwide and consequently in many foreign currencies. As a result, it is exposed to movements  
in foreign currency exchange rates which affect the group’s transaction costs. The group also publishes its financial statements  
in sterling and is therefore exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates on the translation of the results and underlying net 
assets of its foreign operations into sterling.
Translation risk is discussed in section e) on page 132.
Transaction risk
Currency transaction exposure occurs where a business makes sales and purchases in a currency other than its functional currency. 
It also arises where monetary assets and liabilities of a business are not denominated in its functional currency, and where dividends 
or surplus funds are remitted from overseas. The group’s policy is to match transaction exposures wherever possible, and to hedge 
actual exposures and firm commitments as soon as they occur by using forward foreign currency contracts. All foreign currency 
instruments contracted with non-group entities to manage transaction exposures are undertaken by group Treasury or, where 
foreign currency controls restrict group Treasury acting on behalf of subsidiaries, under its guidance. Identification of transaction 
exposures is the responsibility of each business.
The group uses derivatives (principally forward foreign currency contracts and time options) to hedge its exposure to movements in 
exchange rates on its foreign currency trade receivables and payables. The group does not seek formal fair value hedge accounting 
for such transaction hedges. Instead, such derivatives are classified as held for trading and marked to market through the income 
statement. This offsets the income statement impact of the retranslation of the foreign currency trade receivables and payables.
Economic (forecast) risk
The group also uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge its exposure to movements in exchange rates on its highly 
probable forecast foreign currency sales and purchases on a rolling 12-month basis. The group does not formally define the 
proportion of highly probable forecast sales and purchases to hedge, but agrees an appropriate percentage on an individual basis with 
each business by reference to the group’s risk management policies and prevailing market conditions. The group documents currency 
derivatives used to hedge its forecast transactions as cash flow hedges. To the extent that cash flow hedges are effective, gains  
and losses are deferred in equity until the forecast transaction occurs, at which point the gains and losses are recycled either to  
the income statement or to the non-financial asset acquired.
The majority of the group’s currency derivatives have original maturities of less than one year.
The group’s most significant currency transaction exposures are:
• sugar prices in British Sugar to movements in the sterling/euro exchange rate;
• sugar prices in Illovo to movements in the South African rand/US dollar/euro exchange rates; and
• sourcing for Primark – costs are denominated in a number of currencies, predominantly sterling, euros and US dollars.
Elsewhere, a number of businesses make sales and purchase a variety of raw materials in foreign currencies (primarily US dollars 
and euros), giving rise to transaction exposures. In all other material respects, businesses tend to operate in their functional currencies. 134

Sensitivity analysis
The following sensitivity analysis illustrates the impact that a 10% strengthening of the group’s operating currencies against local 
functional currencies would have had on profit and equity. The analysis covers currency translation exposures at year end on 
businesses’ financial assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currencies of those businesses. A similar but 
opposite impact would be felt on both profit and equity if the group’s main operating currencies weakened against local functional 
currencies by a similar amount.
The exposure to foreign exchange gains and losses on translating the financial statements of subsidiaries into sterling is not  
included in this sensitivity analysis, as there is no impact on the income statement, and the gains and losses are recorded directly  
in the translation reserve in equity (see opposite page for a separate sensitivity). This sensitivity is presented before taxation and 
non-controlling interests. 135

g) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that counterparties to financial instruments do not perform according to the terms of the contract or instrument. 
The group’s businesses are exposed to counterparty credit risk when dealing with customers, and from certain financing activities.
The immediate credit exposure of financial instruments is represented by those financial instruments that have a net positive fair 
value by counterparty at 12 September 2015. The group considers its maximum exposure to credit risk to be:
2015
£m
2014
£m
Cash and cash equivalents 702 519
Loans and receivables (see note 24a) 1,043 1,290
Derivative assets at fair value through profit and loss 3 8
Derivative assets in designated net investment hedging relationships 33 2
Derivative assets in designated cash flow hedging relationships 38 64
1,819 1,883
The majority of cash balances and short-term deposits are held with strong investment-grade banks or financial institutions.
The group uses market knowledge, changes in credit ratings and other techniques to identify significant changes to the financial 
profile of its counterparties.
Trade and other receivables
Concentrations of credit risk are limited as a result of the group’s large and diverse customer base. The group has an established 
credit policy applied by each business under which the credit status of each new customer is reviewed before credit is advanced. 
This includes external credit evaluations where possible and in some cases bank references. Credit limits are established for all 
significant or high-risk customers, which represent the maximum amount permitted to be outstanding without requiring additional 
approval from the appropriate level of management. Outstanding debts are continually monitored by each business. Credit limits  
are reviewed on a regular basis, and at least annually. Customers that fail to meet the group’s benchmark creditworthiness may  
only transact with the group on a prepayment basis. Aggregate exposures are monitored at group level.
Many of the group’s customers have been transacting with the group for many years and the incidence of bad debts has been low. 
Where appropriate, goods are sold subject to retention of title so that, in the event of non-payment, the group may have a secured 
claim. The group does not typically require collateral in respect of trade and other receivables.
The group provides for impairment of financial assets including trade and other receivables based on known events, and makes a 
collective provision for losses yet to be identified, based on historical data. The majority of the provision comprises specific amounts. 136

Closing balance 22 36
No trade receivables were written off directly to the income statement in either year.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents
Banking relationships are generally limited to those banks that are members of the core relationship group. These banks are selected 
for their credit status, global reach and their ability to meet the businesses’ day-to-day banking requirements. The credit ratings  
of these institutions are monitored on a continuing basis. In locations where the core relationship banking group cannot be used, 
operating procedures including choice of bank, opening of bank accounts and repatriation of funds must be agreed with group 
Treasury. The group has not recorded impairments against cash or cash equivalents, nor have any recoverability issues been 
identified with such balances. Such items are typically recoverable on demand or in line with normal banking arrangements.
Other financial assets
Other non-current investments are typically equity investments with no fixed maturity or recoverability date. No impairment issues 
have been identified with respect to other non-current investments.
A £98m impairment charge was recorded in the year against the group’s shareholder loans to Vivergo Fuels which, at the time of 
the impairment, was a joint venture in which the group’s equity interest was 47%. When the group subsequently acquired a further 
47% of Vivergo Fuels for a controlling interest, the non-cash charge of £75m included remeasurement to £nil of the remaining £55m 
of shareholder loans and £20m of accrued interest (within current trade and other receivables).
Since derivative assets are recorded at fair value, either through profit and loss for those not in a designated cash flow hedging 
relationship, or otherwise through the hedging or net investment hedging reserve, no impairment issues have been identified. 137

h) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the group will encounter difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with its financial liabilities as they 
fall due. Group Treasury is responsible for monitoring and managing liquidity and ensures that the group has sufficient headroom in 
its committed facilities to meet unforeseen or abnormal requirements. The group also has access to uncommitted facilities to assist 
with short-term funding requirements.
Available headroom is monitored via the use of detailed cash flow forecasts prepared by each business, which are reviewed at least 
quarterly, or more often, as required. Actual results are compared to budget and forecast each period, and variances investigated  
and explained. Particular focus is given to management of working capital.
Details of the group’s borrowing facilities are given in section i) on page 138.

The principal reasons for differences between carrying values and contractual undiscounted cash flows are coupon payments on  
the fixed rate debt to which the group is already committed, future interest payments on the group’s finance leases, and cash flows 
on derivative financial instruments which are not aligned with their fair value. 138

In addition to the above facilities there are also £212m (2014 – £225m) of undrawn and available credit lines for the purposes  
of issuing letters of credit and guarantees in the normal course of business.
The group also has £12m (2014 – £12m) of finance lease liabilities which are not included in the tables above, but which are  
included in the group’s loans and overdrafts in note 17.
The group has a £1.2bn syndicated facility which matures in July 2020 with an option to extend by a further year. In addition  
to the bank debt, the Company has £601m of private placement notes in issue to institutional investors in the US and Europe.  
At 12 September 2015, these had an average remaining duration of 4.7 years and an average fixed coupon of 5.1%. The other 
significant core committed debt facilities comprise local committed facilities in Illovo and Azucarera.
Uncommitted bank borrowing facilities are normally reaffirmed by the banks annually, although they can theoretically be withdrawn 
at any time.
Refer to note 9 for details of the group’s capital commitments and to note 26 for a summary of the group’s guarantees.  
An assessment of the group’s current liquidity position is given in the Financial review on page 47.
j) Capital management
The capital structure of the group is presented in the balance sheet. The statement of changes in equity provides details on equity 
and note 17 provides details of loans and overdrafts. Short and medium-term funding requirements are provided by a variety of loan 
and overdraft facilities, both committed and uncommitted, with a range of counterparties and maturities. Longer term funding is 
sourced from a combination of these facilities, the private placement notes and committed syndicated loan facilities.
The board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to enable 
successful future development of the business. The board monitors return on capital by division and determines the overall level  
of dividends payable to shareholders.
From time to time the trustee of the Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust purchases the Company’s shares in the market to 
satisfy awards under the group’s long-term incentive plan. Once purchased, shares are not sold back into the market. The group 
does not have a defined share buy-back plan.
There were no changes to the group’s approach to capital management during the year. Neither the Company nor any of its 
subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
25. Lease commitments
Operating leases
The group acts as a lessee, lessor and sub-lessor for land and buildings, and plant and machinery, under operating leases.
Rental receipts of £10m (2014 – £8m) were recognised in the income statement in the period relating to operating leases.  
The total of future minimum rental receipts expected to be received is £53m (2014 – £61m).
Under the terms of the lease agreements, no contingent rents are payable. 139

26. Contingencies
Litigation and other proceedings against companies in the group are not considered material in the context of these financial statements.
The group has adopted the amendments to IAS 39 in relation to financial guarantee contracts which apply for periods commencing  
on or after 1 January 2006. Where group companies enter into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of  
other group companies, the group considers these to be insurance arrangements and has elected to account for them as such in 
accordance with IFRS 4. In this respect, the guarantee contract is treated as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes 
probable that the relevant group company issuing the guarantee will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
As at 12 September 2015, group companies have provided guarantees in the ordinary course of business amounting to £1,397m  
(2014 – £916m).
27. Related parties
The group has a controlling shareholder relationship with its parent company, Wittington Investments Limited, with the trustees of 
the Garfield Weston Foundation and with certain other individuals who hold shares in the Company. Further details of the controlling 
shareholder relationship are included in note 28. The group has a related party relationship with its associates and joint ventures  
(see note 28) and with its directors. In the course of normal operations, related party transactions entered into by the group have 
been contracted on an arm’s length basis.

for the 52 weeks ended 12 September 2015
27. Related parties continued
1.  The Garfield Weston Foundation (‘the Foundation’) is an English charitable trust, established in 1958 by the late W Garfield Weston. 
The Foundation has no direct interest in the Company, but as at 12 September 2015 was the beneficial owner of 683,073 shares 
(2014 – 683,073 shares) in Wittington Investments Limited representing 79.2% (2014 – 79.2%) of that company’s issued share 
capital and is, therefore, the Company’s ultimate controlling party. At 12 September 2015 trustees of the Foundation comprised 
two children and two grandchildren of the late W Garfield Weston and five children of the late Garry H Weston.
2.  Details of the directors are given on pages 60 and 61. Their interests, including family interests, in the Company and its subsidiary 
undertakings are given on pages 85 and 86. Key management personnel are considered to be the directors, and their 
remuneration is disclosed within the Remuneration report on page 83.
3.  Members of the Weston family who are employed by the group and are not directors of the Company or Wittington Investments 
Limited and are not trustees of the Foundation.
4.  The fellow subsidiary undertakings are Fortnum and Mason plc and Heal & Son Limited.
5.  The companies with common key management personnel are the George Weston Limited group, in Canada, and Selfridges  
& Co. Limited.
Amounts due from joint ventures comprise £19m (2014 – £14m) of finance lease receivables (see note 14) and £nil (2014 – £145m)  
of loan receivables. The remainder of the balance is trading balances. The loan receivables in 2014 were all non-current, and all but 
£3m (2014 – £3m) of the finance lease receivables are non-current.
28. Group entities
Control of the group
The largest group in which the results of the Company are consolidated is that headed by Wittington Investments Limited 
(‘Wittington’), the accounts of which are available at Companies House, Crown Way, Cardiff CF14 3UZ. It is the ultimate holding 
company, is incorporated in Great Britain and is registered in England.
At 12 September 2015 Wittington, together with its subsidiary, Howard Investments Limited, held 431,515,108 ordinary shares 
(2014 – 431,515,108) representing in aggregate 54.5% (2014 – 54.5%) of the total issued ordinary share capital of Associated British 
Foods plc.
Wittington, and, through their control of Wittington, the trustees of the Garfield Weston Foundation (‘the Foundation’) are controlling 
shareholders of the Company. Certain other individuals, including certain members of the Weston family who hold shares in the 
Company (and including two of the Company’s directors, George Weston and Emma Adamo) are, under the Listing Rules, treated  
as acting in concert with Wittington and the trustees of the Foundation and are therefore also treated as controlling shareholders of  
the Company. Wittington, the trustees of the Foundation and these individuals together comprise the controlling shareholders of the 
Company and, at 12 September 2015, have a combined interest in approximately 59.06% of the Company’s voting rights. Information  
on the relationship agreement between the Company and its controlling shareholders is set out on page 91 of the Directors’ report.
Subsidiary undertakings
A list of the group’s subsidiaries as at 12 September 2015 is given below. The entire share capital of subsidiaries is held within  
the group except where the group’s ownership percentages are shown. These percentages give the group’s ultimate interest  
and therefore allow for the situation where subsidiaries are owned by partly owned intermediate subsidiaries. Where subsidiaries 
have different classes of shares, this is largely for historical reasons and the effective percentage holdings given represent both  
the group’s voting rights and equity holding. Shares in ABF Investments plc are held directly by Associated British Foods plc. All 
other holdings in subsidiaries are owned by members of the Associated British Foods plc group. All subsidiaries are consolidated  
in the group’s financial statements.

Following recent changes to Lusaka Stock Exchange (LuSE) regulations, all listed companies in Zambia must have a minimum of 
25% of their shares held by public investors to constitute a free float. As a result, Illovo Sugar was required to reduce its shareholding 
in Zambia Sugar plc by 6.6%. Effective 26 September 2014, 5.1% of the shares were sold to local Zambian institutional investors  
for £11m. Net assets attributable to the increase in non-controlling interests were £8m, resulting in a £3m gain recognised directly  
in equity. As agreed with LuSE, the remaining 1.5% will be held in a separate account in the LuSE Central Securities Depository.  
While Illovo will waive its voting rights on these shares, it will still be entitled to receive dividends thereon.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
for the 52 weeks ended 12 September 2015
Basis of preparation
The financial statements are presented in sterling, rounded to the nearest million. They are prepared under the historical  
cost convention, except that derivative financial instruments are stated at their fair value, and in accordance with applicable  
United Kingdom accounting standards (UK GAAP) and the Companies Act 2006.
As permitted by section 408(4) of the Companies Act 2006, a separate profit and loss account for the Company has not been 
included in these financial statements. As permitted by FRS 1, no cash flow statement for the Company has been included  
on the grounds that the group includes the Company in its own published consolidated financial statements. As permitted by  
FRS 8, no related party disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries have been included.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, not to prepare  
a note to the financial statements relating to financial instruments as the information is available in the published financial  
statements of the group.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets comprise goodwill arising on acquisitions since 17 September 1998 and operating intangibles. Goodwill is  
the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration of businesses over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill  
is capitalised in accordance with FRS 10 and amortised over its useful life, not exceeding 20 years. Goodwill previously written  
off against reserves has not been reinstated.
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are reported at cost less any provision for impairment.
Financial instruments
All financial assets and financial liabilities are measured initially at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs, and  
thereafter at amortised cost.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
The Company operates defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes. Contributions to the defined contribution 
scheme are charged to the profit and loss account as they become payable. The principal defined benefit scheme is a  
multi-employer scheme and the Company is unable to identify its share of underlying assets and liabilities on a consistent and 
reasonable basis. Contributions to this scheme are accounted for as if they were contributions to a defined contribution scheme.  
The Company has one small unfunded defined benefit scheme which it accounts for in accordance with FRS 17 using the advice  
of professional actuaries. The amount charged to the profit and loss account is the cost of benefits accruing to employees over  
the year, plus any benefit improvements granted to members during the year. It also includes a charge equal to the expected  
interest on plan liabilities over the year. The present value of plan liabilities is disclosed as a liability on the balance sheet net  
of any related deferred tax.
Share-based payments
The Company’s equity-settled share-based payment plans take the form of conditional allocations of shares to employees  
which are released if, and to the extent that, performance targets are satisfied, typically after a three-year performance period.  
The fair value of the conditional allocations is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in reserves.  
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the executives become unconditionally entitled  
to the shares. The fair value of the conditional allocations is measured taking into account the terms and conditions under which  
the shares were allocated. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares that vest.
Where the Company grants allocations of shares to employees of its subsidiaries, these are accounted for on the same basis  
as allocations to employees of the Company, except that the fair value is recognised as an increase to investment in subsidiaries 
with a corresponding increase in reserves.
Shares in the Company are held in a separate trust and are deducted in arriving at equity shareholders’ funds.
Derivatives
Derivatives are used to manage the Company’s economic exposure to financial risks. The principal instruments used are foreign 
exchange contracts and swaps (the ‘hedging instrument’).
Derivatives are recognised in the balance sheet, at fair value, based on market prices or rates, or calculated using either discounted 
cash flow or option pricing models.
Changes in the value of derivatives are recognised in the income statement unless they qualify for hedge accounting, when 
recognition of any change in fair value depends on the nature of the item being hedged. 149

The non-distributable capital redemption reserve arose following redemption of two million £1 deferred shares at par in 2010.
Dividends
Details of dividends paid and proposed are provided in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.
Own shares held reserve and share-based payments
Ordinary shares subject to allocation under the Company’s equity-settled share-based payment plans are held in a separate 
Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust. The Trust is funded by the Company. Voting rights attached to shares held by the  
Trust are exercisable by the trustee, who is entitled to consider any recommendation made by a committee of the Company.  
At 12 September 2015, the Trust held 1,490,218 (2014 – 3,062,447) ordinary shares of the Company. The market value of these 
shares at the year end was £46m (2014 – £80m). The Trust has waived its right to dividends. Refer to note 22 of the consolidated  
financial statements for further information on the group and Company’s equity-settled share-based payment plans.
Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve comprises all changes in the value of derivatives to the extent that they are effective cash flow hedges,  
net of amounts recycled from the hedging reserve on occurrence of the hedged transaction or when the hedged transaction is  
no longer expected to occur.
6. Contingent liabilities
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its  
group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such. The guarantee contract is 
treated as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment  
under the guarantee.
The Company has provided £538m of guarantees in the ordinary course of business as at 12 September 2015 (2014 – £109m). 151

8. Other information
Emoluments of directors
The remuneration of the directors of the Company is shown in the Remuneration report for the group on page 83.
Employees
The Company had an average of 153 employees in 2015 (2014 – 135).
The Company is a member of the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme, which is a funded final salary scheme that is closed  
to new members. Defined contribution arrangements are in place for other employees. For the defined contribution scheme,  
the pension costs are the contributions payable. Because the Company is unable to identify its share of the scheme’s assets and 
liabilities on a consistent basis, as permitted by FRS 17, the scheme is accounted for by the Company as if it were a defined 
contribution scheme.
The most recent triennial funding valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 5 April 2014, using the current unit method and 
revealed a surplus of £79m. The market value of Scheme assets was £3,085m, representing 103% of members’ accrued benefits 
after allowing for expected future salary increases.
Further details are contained in note 12 in the consolidated financial statements. There is no material difference in the valuation 
methodologies under IAS 19 and FRS 17.
Auditors’ fees
Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements of the group provides details of the remuneration of the Company’s auditors  
on a group basis. 152

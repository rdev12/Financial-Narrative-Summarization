Focus on 
delivery
EnQuest is an oil and gas production 
and development Company, focused on 
turning opportunities into value by targeting 
maturing assets and undeveloped oil fields.
Delivering on execution
Production in 2015 was strong across the portfolio, 
averaging 36,567 Boepd. EnQuest ended the year 
with production averaging above 50,000 Boepd in both 
November and December. The Kraken development 
continues on schedule. At the mid-point of EnQuest’s 
guidance range for 2016, EnQuest is forecasting a further 
26% growth in production. 
  Read more on pages 04–06, 08–12, 14, 18, 28, 36, 38.
Strengthening the balance sheet
EnQuest is improving its balance 
sheet through good performance. 
Capital expenditure on the Kraken 
development has been cut by c.$425 
million since sanction. 
  Read more on pages 04–06,  
09–12, 14, 18, 28, 36, 38.
Streamlining operations
EnQuest has continued to reduce 
operating costs. In 2015, these were 
reduced to $29.7/bbl and EnQuest 
is targeting a further reduction to 
$25-27/bbl for 2016. At the mid-point, 
this represents a 12% saving compared 
to 2015. After Kraken and Scolty/Crathes 
are onstream unit opex should be in 
the low $20s per barrel.

2016 Priorities & Outlook Highlights
 o Hedging remains in place for 2016: 10 
million barrels are hedged across 2016, at 
an average of $68 per barrel.
 o Further cost reductions: Unit opex: 
EnQuest is now on course to achieve 
further reductions in average unit opex, 
in the range $25 – 27/bbl overall for 2016 
and into the low $20s after the Kraken 
development is fully onstream. Total 
EnQuest 2016 cash capex has been 
reduced again, now at the low end of the 
previously announced $700 million to 
$750 million, despite including additional 
capex associated with the 10.5% increase 
in EnQuest’s Kraken working interest. 
This is down from an equivalent initial 
2016 cash capex budget of c.$950 million. 
 o EnQuest remains focused on its balance 
sheet strength and is also pursuing a 
range of further opportunities for debt 
reduction, including potential asset sales 
and continuing opex and capex cost 
reductions. As at 31 December 2015, cash 
and undrawn facilities totalled $496.0 
million, giving sufficient liquidity to fund 
Kraken through first oil at prevailing 
prices. 
 o EnQuest reaffirms its production 
guidance for the full year 2016 at an 
average of between 44,000 Boepd to 
48,000 Boepd.
 o Projects: Six Alma/Galia production wells 
have now been commissioned and are all 
expected to be onstream by early Q2 
2016. The Kraken FPSO is on course for 
departure from Singapore in 2016, and 
the development is continuing on 
schedule for first oil in 2017. Since capex 
savings of c.$300 million were announced 
in 2015, a further c.$125 million reduction 
has been made against Kraken’s full cycle 
gross capex budget. 
2015
 o Production averaged 36,567 Boepd in 
2015, up 31% on 2014 and above 
EnQuest’s guidance range. In both 
November and December, EnQuest 
production averaged over 50,000 Boepd. 
This reflected a very good operating 
performance in 2015, with continuing 
high levels of production efficiency. 
 o Continued to reduce operating costs, 
with full year 2015 unit opex at $29.7/bbl, 
compared to $42.1/bbl in 2014.
 o Revenue of $906.6 million and EBITDA** 
of $464.8 million, reflecting the strong 
operational performance.
 o Projects: Alma/Galia was brought 
onstream on 27 October 2015. The 
Kraken project continued on schedule 
and overall project savings of c.$300 
million were achieved compared to the 
original sanctioned level of capital 
expenditure. 
 o Net 2P reserves of 216 MMboe*** as at 
start of 2016, down 4 MMboe after 2015 
production of 13.3 MMboe, also 
reflecting the impact of lower oil price 
assumptions and of EnQuest’s 10.5% 
additional interest in the Kraken 
development, acquired at the start of 
2016. Net contingent resources were  
146 MMboe at end of 2015.
 o Non-cash post-tax tangible oil and gas 
asset impairments of $626.2 million, due 
to significant reduction in the oil price, 
particularly in the near term. 
 o Net debt at the year end, was  
$1,548.0 million, EnQuest was therefore 
well within its net debt to EBITDA 
covenant of five times, for 2015.

EnQuest field optimisation
Turning maturing field decline into production growth  
and economic field life extension.
In a low oil price environment in 
which development of new production is 
constrained, EnQuest’s low cost approach 
is a competitive advantage. EnQuest is 
the right company to turn around the 
performance of maturing assets, assets which 
had high operating costs and low levels of 
production efficiency before EnQuest took 
over operatorship. Here are four ‘before’ and 
‘after’ examples, showing how EnQuest has 
increased production in each case.
In 2010, EnQuest’s work programme for 
Thistle included; modern seismic, the 
successful reactivation of the old drill rig, 
the drilling of new wells, a major power 
supply upgrade, the introduction of new 
and simplified process controls and safety 
systems and integrity work on the platform 
topsides. These measures returned Thistle to 
production levels it had not achieved since the 
1990s. In 2015, six years after EnQuest started 
this programme, Thistle was still delivering 
very high levels of production efficiency, 
in the mid-80s%, on EnQuest’s analysis. 
After Thistle, a similar approach was taken 
at Heather/Broom. Rig reactivation, drilling 
workovers and new wells, a new injection 
flowline and significantly increased water 
injection, have all materially increased 
production levels. Heather/Broom also 
achieved production efficiency in the 
mid-80s% in 2015. 
In 2014, EnQuest acquired interests in both the 
Greater Kittiwake Area (‘GKA’) in the North Sea 
and the PM8/Seligi Production Sharing 
Contract in Malaysia, both of which swiftly 
recouped their original investment and which 
achieved strong production growth in 2014 
and 2015.
At the Greater Kittiwake Area hub, 
EnQuest’s first priorities were to rejuvenate 
the well stock, to raise production efficiency 
and to significantly reduce unit operating 
costs, from over $100 per barrel at the time 
of the acquisition. The Mallard well was 
worked over, the Gadwall well was side-
tracked and dissolver treatments were 
implemented, all of which has driven 
production from 2,000 Boepd levels around 
the time EnQuest took over operatorship, to 
between 14,000 Boepd and 16,000 Boepd 
for much of the last quarter of 2015. 
Production efficiency was taken from very 
low levels to around 80% in 2015, with unit 
operating costs substantially down, to below 
$30/bbl. 
At PM8/Seligi in Malaysia, EnQuest assumed 
operatorship in October 2014 and through 
an early programme focusing on facility 
integrity, gas compressor reliability and idle 
well restoration, quickly increased 
production from 12,400 Boepd to 15,100 
Boepd. This has been achieved before any 
new drilling has taken place. Production 
efficiency has also been enhanced, from 
82%, to over 90% in 2015.

EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
EnQuest’s strategy
EnQuest intends to deliver sustainable growth by focusing on 
exploiting its existing reserves, commercialising and developing 
discoveries, converting contingent resources into reserves and 
pursuing selective acquisitions.
Turning opportunities into value 
by targeting maturing assets 
and undeveloped oil fields
In-house, EnQuest has the full spectrum 
of integrated technical capabilities needed 
to successfully deliver new oil field 
developments and to optimise assets which 
are already in production; these capabilities 
include subsurface, facilities planning and 
drilling. In 2015, EnQuest again delivered 
production efficiency levels which we 
believe rank it as one of the best operators 
in the UK North Sea. EnQuest is now 
replicating these performance levels in 
Malaysia, where EnQuest has already had 
considerable success with its programme 
to revitalise previously idle wells. EnQuest 
believes that these technical skills, its 
operational scale, its financial resilience and 
high levels of operating and cost efficiency, 
all leave it well positioned to deliver its long 
term sustainable growth strategy. 
EnQuest is a company of substantial 
operational size. EnQuest has always 
been focused on controlling its cost base. 
Testament to which is the fact that in its 
first years, prior to current low oil prices, 
EnQuest was able to keep its unit operating 
costs broadly flat, while average costs in the 
UK North Sea doubled. Since the oil price 
decline which started around the middle of 
2014, EnQuest has made further significant 
cuts to its cost base and continues to work 
with the supply chain and contractors to 
achieve additional savings. Despite having 
extensive operations in the relatively high 
cost operating environment of the northern 
North Sea, EnQuest is on track to reduce 
its operating costs from the mid-$40s per 
barrel in 2014, to the low $20s per barrel, 
targeting $25-$27/bbl in 2016, then 
reducing again when the low unit opex 
Kraken and Scolty/Crathes developments 
come onstream. EnQuest’s production 
efficiency and cost control skills are essential 
in the current macro environment. EnQuest 
is managing its business in a manner which 
will allow it to withstand a prolonged period 
of low oil prices.
Exploiting our existing 
reserves
Dons, Thistle/Deveron,  
Heather/Broom, GKA, PM8/Seligi
In 2015, despite the positive impact of 
an additional 10.5% interest in Kraken 
(effective from 1 January 2016) and a 
reserve increase from revisions to 
estimates at PM8/Seligi, EnQuest’s 
production of 13MMboe, combined 
with the negative impact of lower future 
oil price assumptions, led to a net 
reduction of 4MMboe in EnQuest’s 
net 2P reserves.

Commercialising and 
developing discoveries
Scolty/Crathes
The sanction of the Scolty/Crathes 
development in 2015, built on the 2014 
development planning, which had 
allowed Scolty/Crathes to be promoted 
to 2P reserves that year.
  Read more on pages 12, 20, 32.
Converting contingent 
resources into reserves
In 2014 as a result of development 
planning, contingent resources were 
promoted to reserves in relation to 
Scolty/Crathes and Ythan. In the context 
of EnQuest’s prevailing strategic 
priorities, whilst the Scolty/Crathes 
proposals were confirmed, no new 
projects received such development 
planning approvals in 2015 and 
consequently there were no additional 
promotions to reserves.
  Read more on pages 12, 20, 30, 32.
Making selective acquisitions 
and divestments
Egypt, Tunisia, Norway, Malaysia 
In the context of low oil prices and, 
as part of its investment prioritisation 
programme, in 2015 EnQuest disposed 
interests in Norway, Egypt and Tunisia 
and sold its exploration assets in 
Malaysia. It also relinquished interests 
in a number of licences in the UK. 
No decrease to reserves was required as 
a result of these disposals. In Q1 2016, 
EnQuest acquired an additional 10.5% 
working interest in Kraken.

EnQuest’s business model
Realising value through 
capability
EnQuest has the right mix of capabilities, which focus on 
production and development opportunities in maturing basins.
Through its proven skills, EnQuest 
delivers industry leading levels of 
production efficiency and of cost control, 
creating opportunities for it to add value 
to the assets it manages. EnQuest has the 
full spectrum of integrated technical 
capabilities needed to deliver new oil field 
developments successfully; combining 
subsurface, facilities planning and drilling. 
The low oil price environment has acted as 
a catalyst, swiftly driving further forward 
and substantially upscaling initiatives which 
EnQuest already had in place to streamline 
operations. A new lower cost structure is 
now being institutionalised, with unit opex  
in the $20s per barrel, adapting EnQuest’s 
business model for an extended period of 
low oil prices.

EnQuest’s asset base 
and production growth
EnQuest’s principal UK assets at the end of 2015 were its interests in the producing operated oil 
fields Heather/Broom, Thistle/Deveron, the Dons area, the Greater Kittiwake Area and Alma/Galia, 
also in the Kraken and Scolty/Crathes developments. EnQuest also has a non‑operated interest  
in the producing Alba oil field. In Malaysia, EnQuest’s operated assets include the PM8/Seligi 
Production Sharing Contract and the T anjong Baram Risk Services Contract.
Investment prioritisation and 
asset disposals
In 2015, as part of its programme 
of investment prioritisation and asset 
disposals, EnQuest ceased to have interests 
in Egypt, Tunisia and Norway and also  
sold its exploration assets in Malaysia.  
In the UK since the start of this low oil price 
environment, EnQuest has relinquished or 
otherwise disposed of interests in a number 
of licences. At the end of 2015, EnQuest  
had interests in 30 UK production licences, 
covering 42 blocks or part blocks, and was 
the operator of 25 of these licences. 
In Q1 2016, EnQuest acquired an additional 
10.5% working interest in Kraken.

Focused on skills 
and execution
EnQuest’s strong production performance in 2015 was underpinned by high 
operational uptimes and excellent levels of production efficiency.
EnQuest the cost efficient operator
EnQuest’s North Sea production efficiency 
has again been excellent, despite the 
deep and ongoing programme of cost 
reductions. In 2014, EnQuest had a top 
quartile position in Oil & Gas UK’s rankings, 
with an Oil & Gas UK rating of 65%. Peer 
data is not yet available for 2015, however in 
2015, despite a longer than normal planned 
maintenance shutdown period, EnQuest 
again delivered a very strong performance, 
internally assessed to have been 77%. 
Without planned maintenance losses, 
EnQuest assessed its 2015 production to 
have been at 82%. Production efficiency 
directly contributes to cost efficiency.
Since 2014, new cost savings have been 
achieved across the business. EnQuest’s 
operating cost reduction initiatives have 
focused on three key areas:
 o Lower unit rates: Examples are scale 
treatments, subsea inspection, repairs 
and maintenance, logistics, equal time 
rotas and reduced contractor rates
 o Incentivised contract structures: KPI 
structures for our service providers 
ensures payment is linked to performance
 o Enhanced contract and procurement 
practices. EnQuest has moved its 
procurement team to Dubai to take 
advantage of lower global costs 
Transportation costs have also reduced; 
EnQuest is working with the Sullom Voe 
Terminal (‘SVT’) operator to reduce gross 
cost levels and agree cost allocation based 
on usage. Unit transportation costs have 
improved and we expect reductions 
to continue.
General and administration costs for 2015 
have achieved the lower end of the previous 
targeted range, reflecting further savings 
initiatives and reductions in the size of the 
direct workforce. The overall EnQuest 2015 
2015 drilling programme was below budget, 
with very high operating efficiencies across 
EnQuest’s operated rigs and significantly 
lowered spread rates. 
Performance
The strong 2015 production performance 
result was achieved whilst ensuring that 
safe results, no harm to people and 
respect for the environment remained 
top priorities. EnQuest has an in-house 
focused organisational structure and it 
is the operator on most of its assets. By 
aligning the interests of its teams and 
through its high level of direct control 
EnQuest can optimise the efficiency of 
its operational performance, using its 
focused skill sets to successfully execute 
its business plans. 
EnQuest’s people
EnQuest is its people. EnQuest is 
differentiated by the breadth and

streamlining operations.
EnQuest continues to focus on its strategic 
priorities in this low oil price environment: 
strengthening the balance sheet, delivering 
on production and execution targets and 
streamlining operations. Significant 
reductions in both capex and opex have 
been achieved, in conjunction with continued 
excellent operational performance, enabling 
us to produce positive operational cashflows 
at current oil prices. At the start of 2016, 
EnQuest had $496.0 million of cash and 
undrawn facilities, giving sufficient liquidity 
to fund Kraken through first oil at prevailing 
oil prices.
In 2015, average production of 36,567 
Boepd was up 31% year on year, above the 
36,000 Boepd upper end of our guidance. 
This reflected high levels of operating 
efficiency and contributions from Alma/Galia 
and a full year contribution from Malaysia, 
which is now 25% of total production. 
Since EnQuest’s Operations Update 
in December 2015, we have taken further 
action on costs and are delivering additional 
savings, with unit operating costs now 
expected to be in the range of $25-27/bbl 
for 2016 and into the low $20s per barrel 
after Kraken is fully onstream. The Kraken 
full project capex had already been reduced 
by c.$300 million and EnQuest has since 
made a further c.$125 million reduction. 
The development itself continues to make 
strong progress, in particular the critical 
path conversion programme for the Kraken 
FPSO vessel is on schedule for its departure 
from Singapore for commissioning and hook 
up, with production in H1 2017. 
EnQuest’s high operating efficiency, great 
execution and low cost capabilities are 
essential for the challenges of the current 
market conditions.

$425 million
In terms of critical path progress, the 
successful installation of the submerged 
turret production buoy in the field marked 
an important deliverable in 2015.
With the mooring system for the Floating, 
Production and Storage and Offloading 
(‘FPSO’) vessel in place, and all subsea 
infrastructure established for drill centre one 
(‘DC1’), there is now, in effect, connectivity 
from the wells that will be drilled on DC1 
to the FPSO when it is installed. The 
installation of a final riser in 2016 will 
complete connectivity for DC2.
A successful 2015 drilling programme, 
completed ahead of schedule, is 
continuing into 2016. The two full 
well penetrations completed in 2015 
produced data that correlate well with 
the previous subsurface prognosis. 
The Singapore based conversion programme 
on the FPSO remains on schedule for first 
oil in 2017. Engineering work for the vessel 
and all modules was completed in 2015, and 
the electrical house installed. Construction, 
lifting and integration of the power, steam 
generation and primary process modules 
are scheduled for completion in H1 2016. 
  Read more on pages 18, 38.
The capital cost of the 
project has been reduced by 
c.$425 million from the level 
of costs agreed at the time 
the project was originally 
sanctioned.
Kraken constitutes EnQuest’s largest 
project to date, and is one of the biggest in 
the UKCS in recent years. The development, 
in which EnQuest now owns a 70.5% interest, 
is expected to deliver first oil in the first half 
of 2017.
Kraken has remained on schedule since 
sanction in 2013. On an overall project 
basis, in 2015 capex was reduced by 
approximately $300 million or 10% 
compared to sanction estimates.
This accomplishment was due to efficient 
execution of key elements, specifically 
the ongoing drilling programme, and, more 
broadly, a project environment shaped by 
robust planning and proactive management. 
Close agile collaboration with contractors 
and subcontractors and sustained scrutiny 
of all development activities, were key 
attributes of the project throughout 
2015. Since the initial $300 million 
reduction, an additional reduction of 
$125 million has also been secured.

Strengthening 
the balance sheet Focus on
Scolty/ 
Crathes
With unit operating costs  
of under $15/bbl in the 
initial peak volume years, 
Scolty/Crathes further 
streamlines EnQuest’s 
overall operations.
The Scolty/Crathes development comprises 
two wells tied back to the Kittiwake platform 
in the Greater Kittiwake Area (‘GKA’). 
In addition to its merits as a standalone 
project, Scolty/Crathes highlights the 
benefits of the hub strategy, extending 
as it does the life of the existing GKA 
hub to 2025. With unit operating costs 
of under $15/bbl in the initial peak 
volume years, Scolty/Crathes further 
streamlines EnQuest’s overall operations. 
Scolty/Crathes was the only pure oil offshore 
development approved by the Oil & Gas 
Authority in 2015. It is scheduled to yield 
first oil in the first half of 2017. EnQuest is 
the operator. 
Scolty/Crathes fits with EnQuest’s successful 
strategy at GKA, where since EnQuest’s 
acquisition in 2014, production rates have 
increased from approximately 2,500 Boepd 
to around 12,500 Boepd at the end of 2015. 
GKA operating costs have been reduced 
from over $100 per barrel to less than $30. 
Scolty/Crathes, in which EnQuest holds 
a 50% working interest, is yet another 
example of EnQuest’s ability to identify 
previously stranded fields which can be 
made commercially viable by appropriate 
access to nearby infrastructure and by 
bringing EnQuest’s efficiency improving 
capabilities to bear. These are both 
objectives which featured prominently in 
Sir Ian Wood’s 2014 Report on Maximising 
Economic Recovery in the UKCS.
In 2015, the Scolty/Crathes project team 
was successful in reducing the initially 
proposed development costs by 40%, 
during the Front End Engineering and 
Design stage. Following formal approval, 
initial work around all key workscopes was 
instigated in the closing months of 2015.
During 2016, the focus is upon delivery 
by the three main contractor areas; subsea, 
drilling and topside modifications. The 
topside facilities are being installed in an 
unused area of the platform, minimising 
disruption to Kittiwake operations. 
The development also affords further time 
for potential GKA exploration activities in 
due course.

Tanjong  
Baram
The swift and successful 
execution of the field 
development plan.
The Tanjong Baram field in Malaysia reached 
first production on schedule in June 2015 
after the swift and successful execution of  
the field development plan.
Having been awarded a risk service contract 
by PETRONAS for the field in the spring of 
2014, EnQuest demonstrated its delivery 
capabilities by bringing Tanjong Baram into 
production within 14 months.
Tanjong Baram takes the form of an 
unmanned platform with two producing 
wells, tied back to the PETRONAS operated 
West Lutong A complex.
EnQuest had carried out detailed design 
work in tandem with the contract award 
process, in order to deliver a fast-track 
project. 
Tanjong Baram is located off the Malaysian 
state of Sarawak. EnQuest sought to use the 
local supply chain wherever possible during 
a development which saw the platform 
substructure installed in February 2015, the 
subsea pipeline network completed in April 
and the platform topsides installed in May. 
Good working relationships with local 
contractors greatly facilitated the project. 
Engagement with stakeholders, including 
partners PETRONAS and Uzma, regulatory 
authorities and contractors, was a priority 
throughout the development.
The same approach was beneficially 
applied throughout a field shut-in period 
following first production, with all parties 
working closely and co-operatively together. 
Modification work was undertaken to 
accommodate the volumes of liquids in 
the associated gas. The process was swiftly 
and efficiently managed. From initial issue 
identification to solution implementation, 
Tanjong Baram was back on stream in 
two months. 
The field was achieving high reliability 
performance and production levels of close 
to 3,000 Boepd gross towards the end of 
2015. As the first asset EnQuest has operated 
in Malaysia, the Tanjong Baram project has 
demonstrated EnQuest’s operational 
credentials and ability to deliver in 
this market.

Chairman’s statement
EnQuest in 2015
Our strategic priorities are to grow 
production by delivering on operational and 
development execution, while reducing the 
operating cost base and strengthening the 
balance sheet. In 2015, EnQuest delivered 
an excellent operational performance, whilst 
at the same time significantly reducing cost, 
given the low oil price environment. 2015 
cash capital investment was 29% down on 
2014. In 2016, the focus is on the Kraken 
development. 
Lower future oil price assumptions reduced 
overall reserves and EnQuest started 2016 
with a net 2P reserve base of 216 MMboe. 
Notwithstanding this decrease, the new 
total represents a net 167% increase since 
EnQuest’s formation six years ago or an 18% 
growth per annum and a current reserve life 
of 18 years. 
Industry context
Prior to the oil price declines which started 
in 2014, the UK oil and gas industry had a 
high operating cost structure. The wake-up 
call of low oil prices galvanised the industry 
to cut costs. Since its inception, operating 
efficiency has been central to EnQuest. This 
is how, in its first five years, EnQuest was 
able to hold unit operating costs broadly 
flat, when on average they doubled across 
the UK North Sea. In practice, EnQuest 
has always been pursuing cost reduction 
strategies. The new lower cost base 
currently being forced on the oil and 
gas industry in the UK needs to represent 
a lasting structural change. 
EnQuest believes that the need to 
protect critical infrastructure is an 
important objective in the current climate. 
If operators of these infrastructure nodes 
are considering cessation of production, 
the implications for other connected asset 
owners must be considered. Assets need to 
be in the hands of the right owners, owners 
who are operationally competent and who 
have the financial capability to make the 
level of investment required to fund not 
only current cost efficiency and investment 
programmes, but also to fund longer term 
growth. Simplification of the UK upstream 
tax regime and a programme of reduction 
in the headline level of oil and gas tax rates 
are essential to create certainty and to drive 
the investment needed to ensure optimal 
extraction of hydrocarbons, for the decades 
potentially still to come in the North Sea. 
The Department of Energy & Climate 
Change’s (‘DECC’) has an evolving strategy 
for ‘Maximising Economic Recovery (‘MER’) 
for the UK’, to ensure the North Sea is fully 
developed. The Oil & Gas Authority (‘OGA’) 
has been established as DECC’s operationally 
independent executive agency and as a 
regulator. The UK Government has recently 
formed a North Sea oil group to provide 
support to the industry. EnQuest looks 
forward to adding value to these initiatives 
through applying its capabilities to optimise 
the recovery of oil from the North Sea.
EnQuest’s performance in a lower oil 
price environment
The current period of lower oil prices 
started in the second half of 2014, when 
EnQuest implemented its oil price hedging 
programme and accelerated its programme 
of working closely with the supply chain to 
reduce operating and capital expenditure. In 
2015, the cost base was further substantially 
reduced and the oil price hedging was 
increased and extended. The investment 
programme itself was materially cut back and 
reprioritised, with EnQuest deselecting and 
exiting a number of countries and assets. 
“In 2015, EnQuest delivered 
an excellent operational 
performance, whilst at the 
same time significantly 
reducing costs given the  
low oil price environment.”

Passion
Passion is a value that thrives at 
EnQuest, where a creative and 
collaborative culture has been 
cultivated. Your ideas are valued and 
exchanging these ideas is encouraged. 
It’s commonplace to share your passion 
for resolving everyday challenges and 
to continually deliver on projects. It’s 
this collective passion that keeps things 
exciting and makes me look forward to 
the next challenge here.
Haekal Hashim
Geologist, Subsurface
Despite these challenges and the 
considerable reductions in previously 
planned levels of spending, EnQuest 
achieved an excellent operational 
performance in 2015. The very strong 31% 
year on year production growth represents 
a compound annual growth rate of 18% 
since EnQuest began. In its first full year, 
Malaysia has been established as a material 
part of the Group, with a 25% contribution 
to total production. The implementation 
of EnQuest’s hub strategy at the Greater 
Kittiwake Area has already delivered 
considerable production and cost 
efficiency success and with the sanction 
of the adjacent Scolty/Crathes development 
is set to continue to do so. The Alma/Galia 
field achieved first oil in October 2015, 
with the FPSO finally being ready to accept 
hydrocarbons. Since its sanction in 2013, the 
Kraken development has consistently been 
on schedule and in 2015, through rigorous 
project management, it secured a c.10% 
reduction against its original approved 
capital costs, with further progress in 2016.
EnQuest’s funding facilities include a 
$1.2 billion committed credit facility, with a 
$500 million accordion. In 2015, to provide 
greater flexibility for its capital expenditure 
programme, EnQuest renegotiated 
covenants with its lending banks and these 
were relaxed until mid-2017. The covenants 
were fully complied with in 2015 and ongoing 
continued compliance with its covenants 
remains a priority for 2016 and beyond. 
The EnQuest Board
In August 2015, EnQuest welcomed Phillip 
Holland to the Board, as a new Non-Executive 
Director. Phil has extensive international 
project management experience in oil and 
gas, making him a valuable addition to the 
Board. Otherwise the composition of the 
Board remained constant during 2015. In 
2016, Clare Spottiswoode will be retiring from 
the Board and will therefore not be standing 
for re-election at our forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting. The Board would like to 
extend its gratitude to Clare for her valuable 
contributions during her tenure with EnQuest.
The Directors assess and evolve EnQuest’s 
strategy as appropriate, taking key decisions 
on its implementation. 
In 2015, the strategic focus was on positioning 
the business for an extended period of lower 
oil prices, whilst also ensuring it continued to 
achieve its operational targets. Delivery of 
these ongoing programmes has only been 
possible due to the agility and collaboration  
of EnQuest’s people. The Board would like  
to thank everyone at EnQuest for such an 
impressive performance in these  
challenging times. 
Governance 
The Board believes that the manner in 
which EnQuest conducts business is 
important and is committed to delivering 
the highest standard of corporate 
governance. Ensuring EnQuest has the right 
approach to governance and that the Board 
works effectively remain a key focus. 
EnQuest is required to comply with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code, as revised 
in 2014. The Board is pleased to report that 
all the principles of the code were complied 
with in 2015. EnQuest embraces the spirit 
of the code and views corporate governance 
as an essential part of its framework, 
supporting structure, risk management 
and core values. 
EnQuest’s Corporate Responsibility is 
focused on Health and Safety, People, 
Environment, Business Conduct and 
Community. EnQuest is committed to 
operating responsibly and never knowingly 
compromises its health and safety standards 
to meet its operational objectives. Our 
approach to HSE&A management is built 
on our Company values. Through respect for 
our people, our contractors, our stakeholders 
and the environment, we pursue our principal 
aim: safe results, with no harm to people and 
respect for the environment.
EnQuest has developed an Environmental 
Management System to ensure its activities 
are conducted in such a way that EnQuest 
minimises and mitigates its impact on the 
environment. The system is aligned with 
the requirements of the International 
Organisation for Standardisation’s 
(‘ISO’) environmental management system 
standard: ISO 14001:2004. EnQuest works 
to minimise its impact on the environment 
and report on and measure liquid waste, 
accidental spills, atmospheric emissions, 
waste management and continual 
improvement. Detailed environmental 
statements relating to EnQuest’s operations 
are available on its website.
Dividend
The Company has not declared or paid any 
dividends since incorporation and does not 
intend to pay dividends in the near future. 
Any future payment of dividends is 
expected to depend on the earnings and 
financial condition of the Company and on 
such other factors as the Board of Directors 
of the Company considers appropriate.
Delivering sustainable growth
In 2014, EnQuest started putting in 
place its programme to address lower 
oil prices. In 2015, EnQuest took that 
programme substantially further forward 
and has done so again in early 2016. 
EnQuest has a more positive long term 
view of oil prices than the levels which 
have prevailed in the first quarter of 2016. 
Nonetheless, EnQuest continues to manage 
rigorously on the planning assumption of a 
prolonged period of lower oil prices. With 
unit opex heading into the low $20s/bbl 
post Kraken, EnQuest is continuing to 
improve its position to cope with the 
current macro climate and beyond.  Strategic Report 18
EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Chief Executive’s report
EnQuest’s performance, business 
model and strategy, in a low oil price 
environment
EnQuest is working hard and is performing 
well in addressing the challenges of the 
low oil price environment. EnQuest is 
strengthening its balance sheet, delivering 
on production and execution targets and 
streamlining operations. EnQuest has a long 
standing culture and practice of rigorous cost 
discipline, essential in the current market 
conditions. EnQuest has actively hedged oil 
prices to protect its investment programme; 
hedging added $261.2 million to EBITDA in 
2015. In addition, in 2016, 10 million barrels 
are hedged at an average of $68 per barrel. 
Execution in 2015 was marked by first oil from 
Alma/Galia, a transformation in performance 
from the Greater Kittiwake Area, substantial 
further progress on the Kraken development 
and a material first full year contribution from 
EnQuest’s business in Malaysia. 
Production averaged 36,567 Boepd in 2015, 
above the upper end of the target range and 
up 31% on 2014, with production in H2 in 
particular strong across the portfolio. 
Production in H2 2015 was up 49% on H1, 
with the strong finish to the year including 
both November and December averaging 
over 50,000 Boepd. The Alma/Galia 
development was brought onstream in late 
October and the Kraken development was on 
schedule overall, with the drilling programme 
ahead of schedule. I am pleased to report an 
excellent operating performance overall. 
Controlling costs and managing operations 
in an agile and efficient manner are core 
EnQuest competencies. Given the macro 
environment, EnQuest has driven even more 
operational streamlining initiatives, both in 
terms of pace and scale. 2015 unit operating 
costs were delivered ahead of target at 
$29.7/bbl. With further persistent granular 
work on all aspects of the operating cost 
base, EnQuest has improved its operating 
targets further, and in 2016 is on course 
to achieve an average unit opex in the 
range $25-27/bbl. This is achieved through 
both production increases and ongoing 
material cost reductions. Further unit opex 
reductions are set to follow, when the 
low operational costs of the Kraken and 
Scolty/Crathes developments are brought 
fully onstream. The resulting unit opex base 
will be in the low $20s per barrel, providing 
a sustainable lower cost base in a lower oil 
price environment. 
In December 2015, the capex cost of the 
overall Kraken development was reduced by 
c.$300 million, and in early 2016 by a further 
c.$125 million. The 2015 drilling programme 
was delivered below budget, with very high 
efficiency levels across our operated rigs 
and with significantly lowered supplier rates. 
Given the low oil price environment, in H1 
2015, EnQuest negotiated a relaxation of 
covenants to its revolving credit facility 
and in its retail bond until mid-2017. This 
continued commitment from the lenders 
recognised the cash flow generation of 
EnQuest’s business and in particular those 
expected from the Kraken development. 
With 2016 capex focused on Kraken, net 
debt is planned to increase during 2016 
ahead of Kraken first oil. 
EnQuest produced 13.3 MMboe of oil in 
2015, which combined with the impact of 
lowered future oil price assumptions and the 
inclusion of a 10.5% increase in the Kraken 
working interest, resulted in a 2% decrease 
in overall net 2P reserves to 216 MMboe at 
the start of 2016. EnQuest has increased 
net oil reserves by 135 MMboe over the 
last six years, and converted the equivalent 
of 68% of its original 81 MMboe reserves 
into flowing barrels. Notwithstanding the 
reductions to the investment programme, 
EnQuest remains on course to achieve 
annual net production well in excess of 
50,000 Boepd, with six operated producing 
hubs in the UK and with the PM8/Seligi hub 
in Malaysia. Beyond Kraken, PM8/Seligi in 
particular has the potential to increase 
international production significantly 
over the coming years. 
“EnQuest’s high operating 
efficiency, great execution 
and low cost capabilities are 
essential for the challenges 
of current market conditions.”

Health, Safety, Environment and 
Assurance (‘HSE&A’)
In 2015, EnQuest met its commitment to 
deliver safe results. 
In its UK operations, the frequency of 
Dangerous Occurrences (incidents with the 
potential to cause a major accident, such as 
hydrocarbon releases, dropped objects and 
lifting incidents) reduced by more than 30% 
from 2014, with only relatively minor incidents 
reported. The Lost-Time Injury (‘LTI’) 
Frequency Rate and the Recordable Injury 
Frequency Rate both remained low at 2.14 
and 4.99 incidents per million man hours 
respectively; with the producing North Sea 
assets Kittiwake, Northern Producer and 
Heather achieving 10 years, 43 months 
and 34 months LTI free respectively.
In 2015 EnQuest also had a total of 11 
safety and environmental inspections of its 
operated assets by UK regulators (Health 
and Safety Executive and Department of 
Energy & Climate Change) with no reported 
enforcement action.

Chief Executive’s report continued
In Malaysia, EnQuest delivered an excellent 
occupational health and safety performance, 
with no lost time injuries from 1.7 million 
man hours worked and only one 
recordable incident. 
These results are a testament to EnQuest’s 
unceasing focus on HSE&A.
North Sea operations
In 2015, EnQuest delivered strong 
production of 27,505 Boepd in the UK, 
13% up on 2014. This reflects the continuing 
strength of field reservoir performance and 
continuing high production efficiency from 
EnQuest’s existing UK assets and the 
inclusion of first production from Alma Galia. 
In 2015, EnQuest’s North Sea operations 
delivered an impressive operating 
performance. First oil from the Ythan 
development was achieved five months 
earlier than scheduled and produced oil 
was sustained at higher than expected rates. 
At Thistle, the success of the initial three 
well drilling programme resulted in further 
activity being added. These wells were 
delivered at 25% under budget, with three 
of the wells drilled having already achieved 
payback within 2015. The transformational 
post acquisition performance at the Greater 
Kittiwake Area (‘GKA’) has continued, with 
2015 reported production of 3,981 Boepd 
compared to 1,281 Boepd in 2014. The 
sidetracking of the Gadwall well and 
resolution of gas-lift issues on Grouse 
were highlights of the 2015 programme 
of well rejuvenation and improved 
production efficiency. 
Savings have been achieved across the 
business; GKA reduced unit opex from 
above $100/bbl, at the time of its acquisition, 
to below $30/bbl, partly due to significant 
increases in production, but also to cost 
reduction. EnQuest is continuing to work with 
the supply chain and contractors to achieve 
further cost savings and optimisation. 
North Sea developments
Alma/Galia 
First oil from the Alma/Galia development 
was achieved on 27 October 2015, following 
final commissioning of all the required 
systems. This final commissioning took 
longer than anticipated, due mainly to more 
work than expected being required on the 
cargo systems, as became apparent during 
testing, which was only possible when the 
vessel was offshore and in situ. 
Production was increased in the second 
half of November as the Galia well was also 
brought onstream, adding to production 
from the first two Alma wells. The EnQuest 
Producer FPSO vessel performed well in 
2015 and the first cargo offload was 
completed in December 2015.
Kraken 
During 2015, the Kraken project again 
progressed well. The development project 
proceeded on schedule, and by the end of 
the year capex costs for the overall project 
had been reduced by c.10%, bringing the 
expected gross capex down to c.$2.9 billion. 
The fixed pipelines for the first two Kraken 
drill centres were installed on the seabed in 
H1 2015. Installation of the mooring system 
for the FPSO was started. Following 
manufacture, the submerged turret/buoy 
was transported to the field and successfully 
installed. Drill centre one (‘DC1’) was fully 
connected to the turret/buoy, at the year 
end only one production riser was still to 
be connected from the second drill centre.
In H2 2015, following the completion of the 
Kraken batch top-hole drilling programme 
at DC1, the drilling rig progressed with 
the pre-drilling of individual wells into the 
reservoir. This element of the project was 
ahead of schedule in 2015, contributing 
to the reduction in overall project capex. 
Reservoir analysis of the two full well 
penetrations to the end of 2015 
correlated closely with the 
previous subsurface prognosis. 
The conversion programme for the Kraken 
FPSO vessel continued on plan, with the 
vessel on track for delivery in 2016. 
Scolty/Crathes
The Scolty/Crathes development received 
regulatory approval and was sanctioned 
by EnQuest in H2 2015. EnQuest is the 
operator of the development, with a 50% 
working interest. The project benefits from 
limited cash capital expenditure until 
first oil in 2017 and extends field life for 
the GKA field. Including this field life 
extension, unit capital costs for the 
project are under $20/bbl. Unit 
operating cost should be under $15/
bbl in the initial peak volume years. 
The fields will be tied back to the Kittiwake 
platform, in the Greater Kittiwake Area. 
The potential for such a tie back was part 
of the rationale for the acquisition of GKA. 
Production from the Scolty/Crathes fields is 
expected to continue until 2025; this also 
extends the life of the GKA hub itself to 2025. 
Development well drilling is anticipated by 
mid-2016, with first oil from Scolty/Crathes 
expected by the first half of 2017. 
The cost of the tie back and the work 
required on the topsides of the Kittiwake 
platform have been agreed on a fixed lump 
sum turnkey basis and will become payable 
after a first oil determined date. 
Malaysia
In 2015, EnQuest’s Malaysian operations 
continued to increase in both significance 
and importance, representing 25% of 
production. PM8/Seligi increased production 
from 3,459 Boepd in 2014 (six months of 
production averaged over the full year), to 
8,689 Boepd in 2015, with well intervention 
activities resulting in a gross production 
increase of approximately 3,000 Boepd in 
Q4 2015. First oil was achieved from Tanjong 
Baram in June 2015, the field was then briefly 
shutdown for changes requested by the host 
platform to accommodate volumes of liquids 
in gas. The changes were engineered and 
implemented extremely quickly, enabling 
rapid restart to production. This type of 
performance typifies EnQuest’s agile 
operational capability. 
Production from PM8/Seligi had already 
covered most of the consideration costs of 
the acquisition before completion and the 
team’s operational performance since then 
has been excellent. 
Investment prioritisation and asset 
disposals
As part of its investment prioritisation 
programme, EnQuest disposed of its 
Norwegian North Sea interests in 2015. 
EnQuest also ceased to have interests in 
Egypt and Tunisia and sold its exploration 
assets in Malaysia. In the UK, it has 
relinquished interests in a number of 
licences since the oil price decline. By the 
end of 2015, EnQuest had interests in 30 UK 
production licences, down from 35 before 
oil prices started to decline steeply in 
H2 2014.  Strategic Report 21
EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Financial performance
In 2015, EnQuest generated EBITDA of 
$464.8 million compared with $581.0 million 
in 2014, lower as a result of the lower oil 
prices, as mitigated by hedging income of 
$261.2 million and also by the significant 
action taken on costs. 
Cost reduction measures led to EnQuest’s 
average unit production and transportation 
cost being reduced by $12.4 per barrel, or 
by 29.5% over 2014. 
EnQuest’s funding facilities include c.$900 
million of bonds and a committed credit 
facility of $1.2 billion, plus an accordion of 
up to a further $500 million. At 31 December 
2015, EnQuest had cash and undrawn 
facilities totalling $496.0 million. 
Exceptional items include non-cash post-tax 
impairments of $626.2 million, due to lower 
near term oil price assumptions.
2016 year to date
EnQuest has performed well at the start 
of 2016. At Alma/Galia, six wells have now 
been commissioned and are all expected to 
be onstream by early Q2 2016. 
With effect from 1 January 2016, EnQuest 
acquired an additional 10.5% interest in 
the Kraken development, from First Oil plc, 
bringing EnQuest’s total interest to 70.5%. 
This added approximately $90 million 
to EnQuest’s net Kraken capex to 
first production.
In addition to the c.$300 million Kraken 
capex saving announced in December 2015, 
an additional c.$125 million saving in Kraken’s 
capex has been made, following optimisation 
of the drilling programme. A total of 23 wells 
will now be drilled from three drill centres, 
instead of 25 wells from four drill centres. The 
overall full cycle project costs have now been 
reduced by c.$425 million from $3.2 billion at 
sanction, a reduction of c.13%.
Outlook for the rest of 2016 
and beyond
EnQuest is intent on delivering on execution, 
with safety as the first priority. EnQuest 
remains extremely focused on operational 
efficiency and on further reducing both 
operating and capital costs. 
Total EnQuest production for 2016 
continues to be expected to average 
between 44,000 Boepd and 48,000 Boepd, 
a 26% increase over 2014 at the mid-point of 
the range. 2016 hedging remains in place, 
with 10 million barrels hedged at an average 
of $68 per barrel. 
Action is continuing on all cost fronts, 
including production operations and 
services, fuel costs, logistics, maintenance, 
subsea, manpower, and SVT capital 
programme reductions. Further recent 
progress on these and other operating cost 
areas has enabled EnQuest to improve unit 
operating targets, to between $25-27/bbl 
for 2016. The business continues to target 
additional improvements in 2016, seeking 
low $20s unit opex from the North Sea 
business and mid-teens from Malaysia; the 
latter would effectively enable that business 
to fund its growth from its own cash flow. 
2016 priorities include delivering the 
investment programme on time and on 
budget. Total EnQuest 2016 cash capex 
has been reduced again, now at the low 
end of the previous $700 million to $750 
million range, despite including additional 
capex associated with the 10.5% increase 
in EnQuest’s Kraken working interest. The 
predominant focus areas are the next phases 
of the Kraken development, with the FPSO 
being a critical path element. This has been 
reduced from an equivalent c.$950 million 
original capex budget, including the First 
Oil acquisition. 
Smaller production and development 
companies require high efficiency and 
low cost capabilities, in particular in 
these market conditions. EnQuest has the 
requisite capabilities and with its operating 
costs rebased at materially lowered levels, 
even modest increases in oil prices would 
have a significant positive impact on future 
cash flows and growth. However, for the 
foreseeable future, EnQuest’s priority is to 
continue delivering a business which is 
robust in a low oil price environment.

Risks and uncertainties
Management of risks and 
uncertainties 
The Board has articulated EnQuest’s 
strategy to deliver shareholder value by:
 o exploiting its hydrocarbon reserves;
 o commercialising and developing 
discoveries;
 o converting its contingent resources into 
reserves; and 
 o pursuing selective acquisitions and 
disposals.
In pursuit of this strategy, EnQuest has 
to face and manage a variety of risks. 
Accordingly, the Board has established a 
Risk Management Framework to enhance 
effective risk management within the 
following overarching statement of risk 
appetite approved by the Board:
 o We aim to deliver consistently above 
median investment performance 
 o We will manage the investment portfolio 
against agreed key performance 
indicators 
 o We seek to avoid reputational risk by 
ensuring that our operational processes 
and practices reduce the potential for 
error to the extent practicable
 o We seek to embed a risk culture within 
our organisation corresponding to the 
appetite for risk which is articulated for 
each of our principal risks 
 o We seek to manage operational risk by 
means of a variety of controls to prevent 
or mitigate occurrence 
 o We set clear tolerances for all material 
operational risks to minimise overall 
operational losses, with zero tolerance 
for criminal conduct
We seek to balance our risk position 
between investing in activities that may 
drive growth and the continuing need to 
remain a stable and viable company with 
the capacity to continue to grow as market 
opportunities present themselves. The 
Board will review the Company’s risk 
appetite annually in light of changing market 
conditions and the Company’s performance.
The Executive Committee periodically 
reviews and updates the Group Risk 
Register based on the individual risk 
registers of its members. The Group 
Risk Register, along with an assurance 
mapping exercise and a risk report 
(focused on the most critical risks and 
emerging and changing risk profiles), is 
periodically reviewed by the Board (with 
senior management), to ensure that key 
issues are being adequately identified 
and actively managed. In addition, a 
sub-Committee of the Board has been 
established (the Risk Committee) to provide 
a forum for the Board to review selected 
individual risk areas in greater depth. 
The Board, upon the advice of the Audit 
Committee, has reviewed the Group’s 
system of risk management and internal 
control for the period from 1 January 2015 
to the date of this report, and is satisfied 
that they are effective and that the Group 
complies in this respect with the Financial 
Reporting Council’s ‘Guidance on Risk 
Management, Internal Control and Related 
Financial and Business Reporting’. 
Key business risks 
The Group’s principal risks are those which 
could prevent the business from executing its 
strategy and creating value for shareholders 
or lead to a significant loss of reputation.
The Board has carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing 
the Company, including those that 
would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity. The 
Group’s risk management system works 
effectively in assessing the Group’s risk 
appetite and has supported a robust 
assessment by the Directors of the principal 
risks facing the Group. Set out below are the 
principal risks and the mitigations (together 
with an estimate of the potential impact and 
likelihood of occurrence after the mitigation 
actions and how these have changed in the 
past year) and an articulation of the Group’s 
risk appetite for each of these principal risks.
Risk Appetite Mitigation
Health, safety and environment (‘HSE’)
Oil and gas development, production and 
exploration activities are complex and HSE 
risks cover many areas including major 
accident hazards, personal health and safety, 
compliance with regulatory requirements and 
potential environmental harm.
Potential impact – Medium  
(2014 Medium)
Likelihood – Low (2014 Low)
There has been no material change in 
the potential impact or likelihood and 
the Group’s overall record on HSE 
remains robust.
The Group strives to provide a highly 
secure setting for its people and the natural 
environment and we endeavour to constantly 
improve our safety standards back to where we 
have shown we can deliver with zero recordable 
or high potential incidents. There is no reason 
for anyone associated with our business to 
take safety risks other than those normally 
associated with oil and gas operations and the 
Group has a low appetite for risks to HSE.
The Group maintains, in conjunction with its 
core contractors, a comprehensive programme 
of health, safety, environmental, asset integrity 
and assurance activities and has implemented a 
continual improvement programme, promoting 
a culture of transparency in relation to HSE 
matters. The Group has established a 
Corporate HSE Committee which meets 
quarterly. HSE performance is discussed at 
each Board meeting.
In addition, the Group has a positive, 
transparent relationship with the UK Health 
and Safety Executive and Department of Energy 
& Climate Change.
EnQuest’s HSE&A Policy is now fully integrated 
across our operated sites and this has enabled 
an increased focus on Health, Safety and the 
Environment. There is a strong assurance 
programme in place to ensure EnQuest 
complies with its Policy and Principles and 
regulatory commitments. Strategic Report 23
EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Risk Appetite Mitigation
Production
The Group’s production is critical to its 
success and is subject to a variety of risks 
including subsurface uncertainties, operating 
in a mature field environment and potential 
for significant unexpected shutdowns and 
unplanned expenditure to occur (particularly 
where remediation may be dependent on 
suitable weather conditions offshore).
Lower than expected reservoir 
performance may have a material 
impact on the Group’s results.
The Group’s delivery infrastructure in the 
UKCS is mostly dependent on the Sullom 
Voe Terminal.
Longer-term production is threatened if low 
oil prices bring forward decommissioning 
timelines.
Potential impact – High (2014 High)
Likelihood – Low (2014 Low)
There has been no material change in the 
potential impact or likelihood.
Since production efficiency is core to 
our business and the Group seeks to maintain 
a high degree of operational control over 
production assets in its portfolio, EnQuest has 
a very low tolerance for operational risks to its 
production (or the support systems that 
underpin production).
The Group’s programme of asset integrity and 
assurance activities provides leading indicators 
of significant potential issues which may result 
in unplanned shutdowns or which may in other 
respects have the potential to undermine asset 
availability and uptime. The Group continually 
assesses the condition of its assets and operates 
extensive maintenance and inspection 
procedures designed to minimise the risk 
of unplanned shutdowns and expenditure. 
The Group monitors both leading and lagging 
KPIs in relation to its maintenance activities 
and liaises closely with its downstream 
operators to minimise pipeline and 
terminal production impacts.
Production efficiency is continually 
monitored and identified and remedial and 
improvement opportunities are undertaken 
as required. A continual, rigorous cost focus is 
also maintained. 
Life of asset production profiles are audited by 
independent reserves auditors. The Group also 
undertakes regular internal reviews. The Group’s 
forecasts of production are risked to reflect 
appropriate production risks.
The Sullom Voe Terminal has a good 
safety record and its safety and operational 
performance levels are regularly monitored and 
challenged by the Group and other terminal 
owners and users to ensure that operational 
integrity is maintained. Nevertheless, the Group 
actively continues to explore the potential of 
alternative transport options and developing 
hubs that may provide cost savings.
Project execution 
The Group’s success will be dependent upon 
bringing new developments, such as Alma/
Galia (which was not delivered to schedule or 
budget) and Kraken, to production on budget 
and on schedule. To be successful, the Group 
must ensure that project implementation is 
both timely and on budget. Failure to do so 
may have a material negative impact on the 
Group’s performance.
Potential impact – High (2014 High)
Likelihood – Low (2014 Medium)
The likelihood of occurrence of an event 
impacting project execution has decreased 
as the Alma/Galia project has come into 
production and as the Kraken development 
project progresses. 
However, in light of the adverse market 
conditions impacting EnQuest and the oil 
and gas industry, the potential impact of 
a significant cost increase or delay to the 
Kraken project has increased in light of the 
greater materiality to EnQuest which the 
project now represents.
The efficient delivery of new developments 
is a key feature of the Group’s long-term 
strategy. While the Group necessarily 
assumes significant risk when it sanctions a 
new development (for example, by incurring 
costs against oil price assumptions), it requires 
that risks to efficient implementation of the 
project are minimised.
The Group has project teams which are 
responsible for the planning and execution 
of new projects with a dedicated team for each 
development. The Group has detailed controls, 
systems and monitoring processes in place 
to ensure that deadlines are met, costs are 
controlled and that design concepts and 
Field Development Plans are adhered to 
and implemented. These are modified when 
circumstances require and only through a 
controlled management of change process 
and with the necessary internal and external 
authorisation and communication. The Group 
also engages third party assurance experts 
to review, challenge and, where appropriate, 
make recommendations to improve the 
processes for project management, cost 
control and governance of major projects. 
EnQuest ensures that responsibility for 
delivering time-critical supplier obligations and 
lead times are fully understood, acknowledged 
and proactively managed by the most senior 
levels within supplier organisations.
The Kraken development was sanctioned by 
DECC and EnQuest’s partners in November 
2013. First oil production remains scheduled 
for 2017. The development involves the drilling 
of 23 new subsea horizontal wells which will be 
connected to an FPSO. Prior to sanction, 
EnQuest identified and optimised the 
development plan using EnQuest’s pre-
investment assurance processes. Strategic Report 24
EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Risks and uncertainties continued
Risk Appetite Mitigation
Project execution continued With respect to the Kraken development, 
the FPSO is being provided by a third party 
on a lease basis to mitigate risk of cost overrun. 
As well as FPSO related engineering and 
management expertise in the Kraken project 
team in Aberdeen, there is also a dedicated 
EnQuest team at the FPSO construction yard in 
Singapore to ensure quality and mitigate risk of 
schedule overrun.
Reserve replacement
Failure to develop its contingent and 
prospective resources or secure new licences 
and/or asset acquisitions and realise their 
expected value.
Potential impact – High (2014 High)
Likelihood – Medium (2014 Medium)
The likelihood has increased as oil price 
volatility continues to limit business 
development activity. Low oil prices can 
potentially affect development of contingent 
and prospective resources and can also affect 
reserve certifications. 
Reserves replacement is a key element of 
the Group’s success. The Group has some 
tolerance for the assumption of risk in relation 
to the key activities required to deliver reserves 
growth, such as drilling and acquisitions.
The Group puts a strong emphasis on 
subsurface analysis and employs industry 
leading professionals. The Group continues 
to recruit in a variety of technical positions 
which enables it to manage existing assets 
and evaluate the acquisition of new assets 
and licences.
All analysis is subject to internal and, where 
appropriate, external review. All reserves are 
currently externally audited by a Competent 
Person. In addition, EnQuest has active 
business development teams both in the UK 
and internationally developing a range of 
opportunities and liaising with vendors/
government.
Financial
Inability to fund financial commitments. 
The Group’s revolving credit facility and 
retail bond contain certain financial covenants 
(each containing covenants based on the 
ratio of net indebtedness to EBITDA and 
finance charges to EBITDA) and in the case 
of the revolving credit facility, a requirement 
for liquidity testing. Prolonged low oil prices, 
cost increases and production delays or 
outages could threaten the Group’s liquidity 
and/or ability to comply with relevant 
covenants.
Potential impact – High (2014 High)
Likelihood – High (2014 Medium)
Falling oil prices have continued to impact 
cash flow adversely. However, it is considered 
that the risk is being appropriately mitigated 
and remains controlled. Further information is 
contained in the going concern and viability 
paragraphs on pages 44 and 45 of the 
Financial Review.
The Group recognises that significant 
leverage has been required to fund its 
growth. It is however intent on maintaining 
liquidity and complying with its obligations to 
finance providers, recognising that reasonable 
assumptions relating to external risks need to 
be made in transacting with finance providers.
During the year, the Group renegotiated 
certain financial covenants under its revolving 
credit facility and under its £155 million retail 
bond to provide greater flexibility for its capital 
investment programme (the net debt/EBITDA 
covenant has been increased to five times and 
the ratio of financial charges to EBITDA is 
reduced to three times, both until mid-2017) 
and disposed of its Aberdeen office 
developments.
Ongoing compliance with the financial 
covenants under all of the Group’s lending 
arrangements (including the $650 million  
High Yield Bonds) is actively monitored  
and reviewed. 
Funding from the bonds and revolving credit 
facility is supplemented by operating cash 
inflow from the Group’s producing assets. The 
Group reviews its cash flow requirements on an 
ongoing basis to ensure it has adequate 
resources for its needs. 
The Group is maintaining a focus on costs 
through supplier renegotiations, cost-cutting 
and rationalisation. Where costs are incurred 
by external service providers, e.g. at Sullom 
Voe Terminal, the Group actively challenges 
operating costs. The Group also maintains a 
framework of internal controls. Strategic Report 25

Human resources
The Group’s success is dependent upon its 
ability to attract and retain key personnel and 
develop organisational capability to deliver 
strategic growth. Industrial action across the 
sector could also impact on the operations of 
the Group.
Potential impact – Low (2014 Low)
Likelihood – Medium (2014 Low)
The impact has remained static due to low oil 
prices impacting the buoyancy of the 
employment market. The likelihood has 
increased due to the erosion in value of 
long-term share based incentive plans. 
As a low cost, lean organisation, the Group 
relies on motivated and high quality 
employees to achieve its targets and manage 
its risks. The Group recognises  
that the benefits of a lean and flexible 
organisation require agility to assure against 
the risk of skills shortages.
The Group has established a competent 
employee base to execute its principal 
activities. In addition to this, the Group, which 
seeks to maintain good relationships with its 
employees and contractor companies, regularly 
monitors the employment market to provide 
remuneration packages, bonus plans and 
long-term share-based incentive plans that 
incentivise performance and long-term 
commitment from our employees to the Group.
EnQuest is undertaking a number of 
human resource initiatives. These initiatives 
are part of the overall People and Organisation 
strategy and have specific themes relating 
to Organisation, People, Performance and 
Culture. It is a Board-level priority that the 
Executive and senior management have the 
right mix of skills and experience. 
The Group also maintains market-competitive 
contracts with key suppliers to support the 
execution of work where the necessary skills 
do not exist within the Group’s employee base.
The focus on Executive and senior 
management retention, succession planning 
and development remains an important priority 
for the Board and an increasing emphasis will 
continue to be placed on this. 
Reputation
The reputational and commercial exposures 
to a major offshore incident are significant.
Potential impact – High (2014 High)
Likelihood – Low (2014 Low)
There has been no material change in the 
potential impact or likelihood.
The Group has no tolerance for conduct which 
may compromise its reputation for integrity 
and competence.
Operational activities are conducted in 
accordance with approved policies, standards 
and procedures. Interface agreements are 
agreed with all core contractors.
The Group requires adherence to its Code of 
Conduct and runs compliance programmes to 
provide assurance on conformity with relevant 
legal and ethical requirements.
The Group undertakes regular audit activities 
to provide assurance on compliance with 
established policies, standards and 
procedures.
Oil price
A material decline in oil and gas prices 
adversely affects the Group’s operations and 
financial condition. 
Potential impact – High (2014 High)
Likelihood – High (2014 High)
The potential impact and likelihood remains 
high due to low and volatile oil prices.
The Group recognises that considerable 
exposure to this risk is inherent to its value 
proposition.
This risk is being mitigated by a number 
of measures including hedging production, 
renegotiating supplier contracts and 
lending arrangements and reducing 
costs and commitments.
The Group monitors oil price sensitivity relative 
to its capital commitments and has a policy 
which allows hedging of its production. The 
Group has hedged significant amounts of its 
production in 2016 using puts and calls. This 
ensures that the Group will receive a minimum 
oil price for its production.
In order to develop its resources, the Group 
needs to be able to fund substantial levels of 
investment. The Group will therefore regularly 
review and implement suitable policies to hedge 
against the possible negative funding impacts 
of changes in oil prices whilst remaining within 
the limits set by its revolving credit facility.
The Group has established an in-house trading 
and marketing function to enable it to enhance 
its ability to mitigate the exposure to volatility 
in oil prices. Strategic Report 26

Risks and uncertainties continued
Risk Appetite Mitigation
Political and fiscal
Unanticipated changes in the regulatory 
or fiscal environment can affect the Group’s 
ability to deliver its strategy and potentially 
impact revenue and future developments.
Potential impact – High (2014 High)
Likelihood – Low (2014 Medium)
The likelihood has reduced as it appears 
unlikely that the UK government will 
unexpectedly burden the industry in 
the current low oil price environment.
The Group faces an uncertain macro-
economic and regulatory environment. Due 
to the nature of such risks and their relative 
unpredictability, it must be tolerant of certain 
inherent exposure.
It is difficult for the Group to predict the timing 
or severity of such changes. However, through 
Oil & Gas UK and other industry associations 
the Group does engage with government and 
other appropriate organisations in order to 
ensure the Group is kept abreast of expected 
potential changes and takes an active role in 
making appropriate representations.
All business development or investment 
activities recognise potential tax implications 
and the Group maintains relevant internal tax 
expertise.
At a more operational level, the Group has 
procedures to identify impending changes 
in relevant regulations to ensure legislative 
compliance.
Joint venture partners
Failure by joint venture parties to fund 
their obligations.
Dependence on other parties where the 
Group is not the operator.
Potential impact – Medium  
(2014 Medium)
Likelihood – Medium (2014 Medium)
There has been no material change in the 
potential impact or likelihood.
The Group requires partners of high integrity. 
It recognises that it must accept a degree of 
exposure to the creditworthiness of partners 
and evaluates this aspect carefully as part of 
every investment decision.
The Group operates regular cash call and 
billing arrangements with its co-venturers to 
mitigate the Group’s credit exposure at any 
one point in time and keeps in regular dialogue 
with each of these parties to ensure payment. 
Risk of default is mitigated by joint operating 
agreements allowing the Group to take over 
any defaulting party’s share in an operated 
asset and rigorous and continual assessment 
of the financial situation of partners.
The Group generally prefers to be the 
operator. The Group maintains regular 
dialogue with its partners to ensure alignment 
of interests and to maximise the value of joint 
venture assets.
Competition
The Group operates in a competitive 
environment across many areas including 
the acquisition of oil and gas assets, the 
marketing of oil and gas, the procurement 
of oil and gas services and access to 
human resources.
Potential impact – Medium  
(2014 Medium)
Likelihood – Medium (2014 Medium)
There has been no material change in 
the impact or likelihood.
The Group operates in a mature industry with 
well-established competitors and aims to be 
the leading operator in the sector; it thus has 
a high appetite for this risk.
The Group endeavours to have a resilient 
balance sheet, which puts it in a position to be 
able to compete effectively and move quickly 
when looking to acquire assets.
The Group also has strong technical and 
business development capabilities to ensure it 
is well positioned to identify and execute 
potential acquisition opportunities.
The Group maintains good relations with oil 
and gas service providers and constantly keeps 
the market under review. Strategic Report 27
EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Risk Appetite Mitigation
Portfolio concentration
The Group’s assets are concentrated in the 
UK North Sea around a limited number of 
infrastructure hubs and existing production 
(which is principally only oil) is from mature 
fields. This amplifies exposure to key 
infrastructure, political/fiscal changes and 
oil price movements.
Potential impact – Medium  
(2014 Medium)
Likelihood – Medium (2014 Low)
Although the extent of portfolio concentration 
has reduced (as the business has developed), 
the majority of the Group’s assets remain 
relatively concentrated and therefore this 
risk is still intrinsic to the Group.
This risk is mitigated in part through 
acquisitions. For all acquisitions, the Group 
uses a number of business development 
resources to evaluate and transact acquisitions 
in a commercially sensitive matter. This 
includes performing extensive due diligence 
(using in-house and external personnel) and 
actively involving executive management in 
reviewing commercial, technical and other 
business risks together with mitigation 
measures. 
The Group also constantly keeps its portfolio 
under rigorous review and accordingly, actively 
considers the potential for making disposals, 
executing development projects (Alma/Galia, 
Kraken), making international acquisitions and 
expanding hubs.
International business
Whilst the majority of the Group’s activities 
and assets are in the UK, the international 
business is becoming more material. The 
Group’s international business is subject to 
the same risks as the UK business (e.g. HSE, 
production and project execution); however, 
there are additional risks that the Group faces 
including security of staff and assets, 
political, foreign exchange and currency 
control, taxation, legal and regulatory, 
cultural and language barriers and 
corruption.
Potential impact – Medium  
(2014 Medium) 
Likelihood – Low (2014 Medium)
The likelihood of the overall risk has reduced 
due to EnQuest exiting Egypt and Tunisia. In 
addition, oil price uncertainty has increased 
the potential impact and likelihood of a 
slowdown in international growth plans.
In light of its long-term growth strategy, 
the Group seeks to expand and diversify its 
production (geographically and in terms of 
quantum); as such it is tolerant of assuming 
certain commercial risks which may accompany 
the opportunities it pursues. However such 
tolerance does not impair the Group’s 
commitment to comply with legislative and 
regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions 
in which it operates.
Prior to entering into a new country, EnQuest 
evaluates the host country to assess whether 
there is an adequate and established legal 
and political framework in place to protect 
and safeguard first its expatriate and local staff 
and, second, any investment within the country 
in question.
When evaluating international business risks, 
executive management reviews commercial, 
technical and other business risks together with 
mitigation and how risks can be managed by 
the business on an ongoing basis.
EnQuest looks to employ suitably qualified 
host country staff and work with good quality 
local advisers to ensure it complies within 
national legislation, business practices and 
cultural norms whilst at all times ensuring that 
staff, contractors and advisers comply with 
EnQuest’s business principles, including those 
on financial control, cost management, fraud 
and corruption.
Where appropriate, the risks may be mitigated 
by entering a joint venture with partners with 
local knowledge and experience.
After country entry, EnQuest maintains a 
dialogue with local and regional government, 
particularly with those responsible for oil, 
energy and fiscal matters, and may obtain 
support from appropriate risk consultancies. 
When there is a significant change in the risk 
to people or assets within a country, the Group 
takes appropriate action to safeguard people 
and assets. Strategic Report 28

Operating review
North Sea operations
Overview
As a focused and agile company, EnQuest 
commenced work on streamlining operations 
well before the oil price started to decline in 
Q4 2014. As a result, additional benefits were 
realised early in 2015. By acting early and 
working proactively with the supply chain, 
EnQuest lowered unit costs significantly, 
without impacting safety or production 
efficiency, for which EnQuest has had a 
strong track record since its inception. With 
the EnQuest Producer onstream in October 
2015, EnQuest delivered full year 2015 
production above guidance levels, having 
achieved its strongest production 
performance yet. As well as maintaining 
high levels of Production Efficiency (‘PE’). 
EnQuest’s 2015 drilling programme was 
upper quartile, measured against the 
industry standard ‘Rushmore’ benchmark.
2015 was a busy and successful year 
on Thistle, it saw further benefits from 
the field life extension programme. 
The drilling programme on Heather was 
completed in 2015, following which the 
drill crew returned to drill on Thistle. 
Initially, the Thistle programme was 
sanctioned with three activities but 
the maturation of subsurface targets, 
coupled with high drilling efficiency, 
enabled the completion of additional 
previously unscheduled activities. The 
programme was delivered approximately 
25% below budget, benefitting from the 
power upgrades completed in the life 
extension project, careful engineering 
and rigorous performance management 
of drilling operations. The Thistle 
development programme has been self 
funding. The production programme on the 
Northern Producer was well ahead of plan, 
despite scaling issues on the West Don field 
which impacted Q1 production. Heather 
also benefitted from the drilling activities 
performed in 2014, with an almost doubling 
of the field’s production rate. The Heather 
team’s focus and perseverance on costs 
saw significant progress in 2015. The Ythan 
development was delivered well ahead of 
schedule. In 2014, EnQuest took the licence, 
prepared the Field Development Plan (‘FDP’) 
and then had the well hooked up by Q2 2015. 
Performance of the Ythan development well 
has exceeded expectations.
On unit opex overall, EnQuest set a target 
of a 10% reduction for 2015. In the event, 
a reduction of over 15% in unit opex was 
delivered. In Q4 2015, unit costs in the 
North Sea were below $30/bbl and this 
comprehensive cost reduction programme 
is sustainable. EnQuest anticipates overall 
unit opex in 2016 to be $25-27/bbl and there 
will be a further reduction once Kraken is 
fully onstream. Unnecessary complexity is 
avoided with standardised approaches used 
whenever possible. Procurement has been 
offshored to Dubai and we continue our 
long standing tradition of working closely 
with the supply chain, constantly seeking 
innovative new ways to optimise cost 
efficiencies. EnQuest is incorporating a 
structurally lower unit operating cost into 
its base whilst maintaining high production 
efficiency. This now includes Kittiwake, 
the asset which had a running opex of 
more than $100/bbl when first taken over 
in March 2014 and which now operates at 
below $30/bbl. 
Capital discipline is also paramount 
and, post Alma/Galia, other than Kraken, 
EnQuest’s North Sea activities are focused 
on a much lower, more limited capex 
programme to activities which generate 
higher margins and achieve faster paybacks. 
Development costs continue to be brought 
down; for example, since the early concept 
selection work on the Scolty/Crathes project 
was completed, a 40% reduction in capex 
was achieved along with a low-risk execution 
strategy and the majority of facilities’ capex 
is payable after first oil related dates. 
In 2015, our HSE performance was 
very good. The continuous improvement 
programme has therefore been revised in 
2016 to drive our performance higher. Our 
aim is always to achieve safe results and to 
have the right targets to help us achieve 
incident free operations.
“By acting early and working 
proactively with the supply 
chain, EnQuest lowered unit 
costs significantly.”

Drilling recommenced at Thistle in 2015, with the A61/34 well 
which came onstream in May and which has been performing 
well. An additional production well A62/53 has been drilled 
and was placed on production in August. An Electric Submersible 
Pump (‘ESP’) workover on well A59/45 was completed successfully 
in August, with the well reinstated to production. Due to strong 
performance of the drilling programme, two wells anticipated in 
2016 were brought forward into 2015. Well A64/40 was drilled in 
the crest of the Western Fault Block and was brought online in 
October. This was followed by completion of the Deveron 
A63/07 well with a dual ESP, which was brought online in 
November and the workover of the Deveron A58 well 
to upgrade the ESP. Excellent drilling performance has 
delivered considerable savings against budgeted costs.

The Heather H66 production well was brought onstream in March 
and has performed well, contributing to the successful outcome of 
this phase of the development drilling campaign. The rig crew then 
moved to Thistle. Water injection was reinstated to the Broom field 
as planned in Q2 2015, following replacement of a flowline. Overall 
production in 2015 was ahead of 2014 reflecting the increase in 
Heather rate from 2014 drilling, offset by the water injection outage 
on Broom and the planned maintenance shutdown in June 2015. 
High levels of operational uptime have been achieved. Overall 
levels of water injection improved in 2015 and this increased

GKA
In 2015, GKA demonstrated continual improvement in production 
efficiency since acquisition, achieving almost 80% across the year, 
including the impact of a planned shutdown. The redundant 
Gadwall production well was successfully sidetracked to an updip 
location and was brought onstream in August with encouraging 
results. A successful chemical treatment has also been undertaken 
on Goosander raising production levels substantially from the 
field. The planned three week GKA maintenance shutdown was 
successfully completed in September. Reported 2015 production 
was over three times the level in 2014, with Gadwall having 
peaked at over 19,000 Boepd. 
The success of GKA demonstrates the transferability of the 
EnQuest model and of its ability to create value from mature 
assets; the strategy was sound, the investment programme has 
been focused and the opex discipline has been strong. 
The Scolty/Crathes development (to be tied back to GKA). 
50% EnQuest working interest
The Scolty/Crathes Field Development Plan received regulatory 
approval in H2 2015 and was then sanctioned by EnQuest. 
EnQuest is the operator of the development with a 50% working 
interest. The project benefits from limited cash capital expenditure 
until first oil in 2017 and extends field life for the GKA field. 
The development plan consists of single horizontal wells to be 
drilled in each of the Scolty and Crathes fields. The fields will be 
tied back to the Kittiwake platform, in the Greater Kittiwake Area. 
Production from the Scolty/Crathes fields is expected to continue 
until 2025, which also extends the life of the GKA hub itself to 
2025. Development well drilling is anticipated by mid-2016, with 
first oil from Scolty/Crathes expected by the first half of 2017. 
2016 and beyond
Subsea and topside scopes on the Scolty/Crathes development 
are progressing according to schedule. There will be no other

In H1 2015, the FPSO vessel left the yard in Newcastle, 
successfully completed marine performance trials and was towed 
out to the field, where it was securely moored. It was first made 
‘storm safe’ and then all the remaining anchor chains were 
installed. All the risers were then pulled in and the ship was able 
to weathervane. The subsea equipment was successfully function 
tested from the vessel via the umbilicals. The Galia production 
well was also completed and tied into the production manifold. 
First oil from the Alma/Galia development was achieved on 
27 October 2015, following the safe delivery of final commissioning 
of all the required systems. Production from the first two Alma ESP 
wells (K3Z and K5) was increased in the second half of November as 
the Galia well was also brought onstream. 
2016 and beyond 
The FPSO has performed well since first oil and continues to do 
so. Excellent uptime has been achieved on the EnQuest Producer, 
with 77% in 2015 and over 90% in early 2016. The first cargo was 
successfully offloaded in December. A short production shutdown 
is required to prepare for transfer over to power generated from 
the steam turbine generators and to commission the remaining 
subsea scope. At Alma/Galia, all six wells have now been 
commissioned, alongside one water injector well. All six 
production wells are expected to be onstream by early Q2 
2016. The permanent boiler and turbine power arrangements 
are also expected to be online in early Q2 2016.

Creativity
At EnQuest, creativity is key to finding innovative solutions 
to everyday problems. Within the subsurface team we work 
collaboratively to maximise the potential of our assets and to 
identify undeveloped opportunities close to our existing hubs. 
As the North Sea basin matures further, this becomes an ever 
increasing challenge, especially within the current oil price 
environment. This situation has forced us to become more creative 
and to break out of established patterns and ways of thinking.

Tanjong Baram was developed as an unmanned platform with 
production from two wells tied back to the PETRONAS Carigali 
operated West Lutong A complex. 
First production from the Tanjong Baram field was achieved on 
schedule in June 2015. The host platform requested changes to 
the receiving vessel to accommodate the volumes of liquids in the 
associated gas. This required the field to be shut in while the work 
was completed. Tanjong Baram was successfully restarted on 
18 August and the field was producing close to 3,000 Boepd 
gross by year end. 
2016 and beyond
Tanjong Baram experienced two unplanned shutdowns in January 
due to weather. Average overall oil production has nonetheless 
continued at stable levels. Co-ordination with the host platform 
operator is continuing in order to optimise daily production rates 
and minimise operating costs.

2015
EnQuest assumed offshore field operations in October 2014 
and the overall transition was completed in December 2014. The 
PM8/Seligi asset has delivered strong production performance, 
well above target, due to improved production efficiency and to 
the successful idle well restoration activities completed since 
assuming operatorship. In 2015, EnQuest was able to deliver 
material improvements from 16 idle wells. 
The 2015 PM8/Seligi field infrastructure work programme focused 
on inspections to establish pipeline, vessel and structural integrity 
baselines and on overhauls and repairs to gas compression trains. 
As a result, compressor availability was improved from 70% to 
95% and overall production efficiency was increased from c.80% 
to over 90%, delivering an immediate boost to production. In 
addition, well intervention activities were completed to restore 
idle wells and optimise existing wells, leading to a production 
gain of approximately 3,000 gross Boepd in Q4. 
2016 and beyond
EnQuest will continue to enhance production by investing in 
well intervention work, activities to improve facility reliability 
and production efficiency, and facilities improvement upgrades. 
At the same time, ongoing technical studies will support future 
drilling, well workover, gas injection and water injection projects 
to further enhance production and ultimate recovery. 
The overall impact of the north east monsoon season has been 
low compared to last year, and 2016 production has started 
strongly, following a successful well intervention on Seligi A. 
Summary
EnQuest’s Production Sharing Contract (‘PSC’) for PM8/Seligi in 
Malaysia includes the Seligi oil field, once the largest oil field off 
Peninsular Malaysia. PM8/Seligi combined has over 200 wells. This 
is a substantial opportunity for EnQuest to replicate the success of 
its strategy on Thistle, potentially on a considerably larger scale, 
significantly increasing production, extending PM8/Seligi’s field 
life and increasing reserves.

Major projects
Overview
During 2015, the Kraken project again 
progressed well. The development project 
proceeded on schedule, and by the end of 
the year capex costs for the overall full cycle 
project had been reduced by over 10%, 
bringing the expected gross capex down  
to c.$2.9 billion. A further c.$125 million 
reduction in project capex has since been 
made. The Kraken FPSO vessel continues  
to be on track for ‘sail-away’ in 2016. 
The successful installation of the integrated 
turret/buoy mooring system was an 
important part of the 2015 programme.  
All the risers and mooring lines are now 
connected to this turret/buoy, which will  
itself be connected to the FPSO when it 
arrives in the field. This avoids the need for 
the individual risers to be connected one by 
one into the FPSO, and significantly reduces 
the weather window to connect the wells, 
down to only forty eight hours of suitably 
calm seas.
From the start of the project, the Kraken 
development has applied an approach 
of using standardised equipment where 
possible. Suppliers were asked to provide 
and install their standard units and EnQuest 
tailored the design of its field to those 
standard facilities. EnQuest does not 
commission bespoke designs or 
engineering where standardised 
approaches already provide  
good solutions. 
The initial c.10% capex cost reduction 
on the project was challenging to achieve, 
due in particular to the lump sum fixed price 
contractual nature of most of the supplier 
arrangements. The saving derives partly from 
the efficiencies of the drilling programme, 
but also generally as a result of rigorous 
project management of all aspects of the 
project, with excellent planning and project 
execution. Change procedures in particular 
are strictly managed. An interventionist 
approach is taken with all subcontractors, 
with whom EnQuest is actively involved to 
ensure commitments are delivered. 
“The Kraken project 
is progressing well, 
on schedule and 
under budget.”
Richard Hall
Head of Major Projects

Agility
Some would associate finance with 
routine and repetition; however, I find 
working at EnQuest that no two days 
are the same. For me, agility is about 
thinking on your feet, being able to turn 
your hand to something new, understand 
it, deal with it effectively and move on.
This supports ‘The EnQuest way’ and 
very much feels like part of daily routine. 
The exposure gained across such a wide 
variety of functions and levels within the 
organisation is great.

In H2 2015, following the completion of the Kraken batch top-hole 
drilling programme at DC1, the drilling rig progressed with the 
pre-drilling of individual wells into the reservoir. Reservoir analysis 
of the two full well penetrations to the end of 2015 correlated very 
closely with the previous subsurface prognosis. Procurement, 
manufacture and installation continued in relation to the next 
phases of wells, subsea infrastructure and the FPSO.
2016 and beyond 
In 2016, the drilling programme is focused on drill centres one and 
two. It continues to be ahead of schedule, despite a particularly 
harsh North Sea winter; this should ensure that as planned there 
will be eight wells available for first oil, four production wells and 
four injection wells.
Following the departure of the FPSO from dry dock, in December 
2015, work is continuing on the marine systems and the modules 
which will be lifted onto the vessel in the first half of 2016. The 
FPSO remains on schedule to leave Singapore in 2016 for 
commissioning and ‘hook-up’, with production in H1 2017. 
Preparation on Kraken readiness to transition from development 
to operations is well underway.
Kraken’s capex has been reduced by an additional c.$125 million, 
following a revision to the development plan. A total of 23 wells 
will now be drilled from three drill centres, instead of 25 wells 
from four drill centres. The overall full cycle project costs have 
now been reduced by c.$425 million from $3.2 billion at sanction, 
a reduction of c.13%. 
With effect from 1 January 2016, EnQuest acquired an additional 
10.5% interest in the Kraken development, from First Oil plc, 
bringing EnQuest’s total interest to 70.5%.

Financial overview
Against a backdrop of the lowest crude oil prices since 2002, with 
the price of oil averaging $52.4/bbl throughout 2015 versus $98.9/
bbl through 2014, EnQuest has delivered a robust operational 
performance. Production, on a working interest basis, increased by 
31% to 36,567 Boepd. This included a full year of production from 
PM8/Seligi, which contributed 8,689 Boepd compared to 3,459 
Boepd in 2014 and 1,084 Boepd from Alma/Galia, with first oil 
achieved in October 2015. Reflecting EnQuest’s cost optimisation, 
first oil from Alma/Galia and the increase in production, unit 
operating costs reduced by 29% to $29.7/bbl.

due to lower oil prices in H2 2015, which were partially mitigated 
through the contribution of $261.2 million of EBITDA from the 
Group’s commodity hedge portfolio. 
Reflecting the ongoing investments EnQuest has made in its assets, 
notably Kraken, EnQuest’s net debt has increased from $967.0 million 
at the end of 2014 to $1.55 billion as at 31 December 2015.

There are no significant debt maturities until October 2017. As at

As a result of the continued capital investment, UK corporate 
tax losses at the end of the year increased to approximately $2.54 
billion. In the current environment, no material corporation tax 
or supplementary corporation tax is expected to be paid on UK 
operational activities. The Group paid cash corporate income tax 
on assets acquired in Malaysia which will continue throughout the 
life of the Production Sharing Contract (PSC).
The substantial decline in the oil price has led to $626.2 million 
of post-tax impairments to tangible oil and gas assets, and the 
de-recognition of $478.1 million of tax losses. This impairment is 
made up of Thistle/Deveron $104.7 million, Heather and Broom 
$60.4 million, the Dons hub $96.2 million, Alba $12.3 million,  
Alma/Galia $344.8 million and Tanjong Baram $7.8 million. 
Income Statement
Production and revenue
Production levels, on a working interest basis, for the year ended 
31 December 2015 averaged 36,567 Boepd compared with 27,895 
Boepd in 2014. The increase reflects a full year of production from 
PM8/Seligi, additional production from Gadwall and Goosander in

the Greater Kittiwake Area (GKA), production from the Alma/Galia 
development which was brought onstream in late October and initial 
production from Tanjong Baram. This was partially offset by the 
expected natural decline in the Don fields.
The Group’s blended average realised price per barrel of oil sold 
excluding hedging was $50.9 for the year ended 31 December 2015, 
significantly below the $100.6 per barrel received for 2014, reflecting 
the steep decline in the oil price in 2015. Revenue is predominantly 
derived from crude oil sales and for the year ended 31 December 
2015 crude oil sales totalled $634.3 million compared with $970.5 
million in 2014. The decrease in revenue was due to the lower oil 
price offset partially by the higher production. Revenue in 2015 also 
included $261.2 million of realised income relating to oil commodity 
hedges, and other oil derivatives. This includes $119.1 million of 
hedge accounting gains deferred from 2014 and $111.6 million of 
non-cash amortisation of option premium.
Operating costs
Cost of sales comprises cost of operations, tariff and transportation 
expenses, change in lifting position, inventory movement, derivative 
and foreign exchange hedging movements and depletion of oil and 
gas assets. Cost of sales for the Group (pre-exceptionals and 
depletion of fair value adjustments) was as follows:

 – Tariff and transportation costs 6.3 10.6
 – Operating costs 29.7 42.1
 – Depletion of oil and gas properties 25.0 24.6
54.7 66.7
Cost of sales pre-exceptionals and depletion of fair value 
adjustments was $733.4 million for the year ended 31 December 
2015 compared with $654.1 million in 2014. Lifting costs and tariffs 
decreased by $67.2 million reflecting EnQuest’s cost reductions and 
a lower percentage of throughput at the Sullom Voe Terminal (SVT). 
This was offset by an increase in the DD&A charge of $61.2 million 
driven by increased production on PM8/Seligi, GKA and first 
production from Alma/Galia. Other operating costs, which 
principally includes the supplemental payment due on profit oil in 
Malaysia increased by $11.1 million, reflecting a full year of PM8 
production, and higher profit oil entitlement. Overlift and inventory 
movement increased by $15.8 million. Additionally, 2014 had 
benefitted from a gain of $46.7 million relating to the bond 
proceeds currency transactions. 
The Group’s operating costs, which are included in the calculation 
of the unit operating costs, comprise production costs, tariff and 
transportation costs, and the effect of any realised foreign exchange 
hedging gains or losses. Operating costs for the year ended 
31 December 2015 totalled $390.7 million compared with  
$399.4 million in 2014 (on a pre-exceptional basis). Production costs 
of $318.5 million were $28.7 million lower than 2014. This was driven 
by the Group’s ongoing cost optimisation activities, partially offset by 
a full year of PM8. Transportation costs decreased from $107.5 million 
to $69.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2015. This reduction 
is primarily driven by lower SVT costs in 2015. These reductions were 
offset by a negative movement of $58.4 million in hedging, most of 
which is attributable to the gain realised in 2014 in respect of the 
bond proceeds currency swap. 
Due to the above factors, the Group’s average unit production and 
transportation cost has decreased by $12.4 per barrel.
The Group’s depletion expense per barrel for the year increased 
slightly due to the impact of depletion on Alma/Galia which has a 
higher depletion rate than the rest of the Group’s hubs. 
Exploration and evaluation expenses
Exploration and evaluation expenses were $0.3 million in the year 
relating to pre-licence costs expensed.
General and administrative expenses 
General and administrative expenses were $14.4 million in 
the year ended 31 December 2015 compared with $16.5 million 
reported in the previous year. The decrease reflects reduced 
personnel costs in 2015. 
Other income and expenses
Other income of $15.4 million is comprised mainly of net foreign 
exchange gains of $15.0 million in the year ended 31 December 
2015 relating to foreign currency forwards and trades, as well as 
foreign exchange gains on other working capital.
Taxation 
The tax credit for the year of $129.3 million (2014: $105.8 million tax 
charge), excluding exceptional items, is due primarily to an increase 
in the Ring Fence Expenditure Supplement on UK activities. 
Exceptional items and depletion of fair value uplift
Exceptional losses totalling $1,339.4 million before tax ($887.3 million 
on a post-tax basis) have been disclosed separately in the year 
ended 31 December 2015. This primarily relates to a post-tax 
impairment of tangible oil and gas assets of $626.2 million caused 
by the continued decline in the oil price throughout 2015.
Exceptional items also include an impairment of $1.9 million 
to capitalised exploration costs in respect of licence areas 
where development of the area is unlikely to take place in 
current market conditions.
The material items which make up the remaining balance are  
the unrealised mark to market losses on derivative contracts of 
$45.6 million, $3.8 million of depletion on the fair value uplift on 
acquisitions, $26.6 million which includes $3.7 million relating to the 
unavoidable costs in relation to the sub-let space of the Aberdeen 
building and $22.9 million of which relates to providing for the

Focus
I really enjoy working for EnQuest because it is such a

unutilised days for the Stena Spey drilling vessel activity in 2016, 
the vessel will not be fully utilised during this period. There was also 
an $8.5 million loss on the disposal of Annan House, $7.2 million 
relating mainly to the write-off of costs for relinquished licences 
for Cairngorm, Norway and Elke and $13.6 million relating to the 
write-down of the carrying value of Xmas trees in inventory. Finally, 
a $4.4 million loss was incurred relating to the difference between 
the receivable from PA Resources in Tunisia as at 31 December 2014 
and the actual settled amount.
The tax impact of the above exceptional items is a tax credit of 
$634.4 million. A one-off deferred tax credit of $56.8 million in 
respect of the enacted decrease in the supplementary charge on 
UK oil and gas production to 20%, with effect from 1 January 2015, 
and decrease in the Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) rate to 35%, with 
effect from 1 January 2016, has been reported as an exceptional 
item in the period. The de-recognition of tax losses resulted in a 
deferred tax charge of $239.1 million.
Finance costs
Finance costs of $176.4 million include $80.2 million of bond 
and loan interest payable, $17.0 million unwinding of discount 
on decommissioning provisions, $70.0 million relating to the 
amortisation of premium on options designated as hedges of 
production and $5.0 million relating to the unwinding of the KUFPEC 
cost recovery provision. Other financial expenses of $11.0 million are 
primarily commitment and letter of credit fees and amortisation of 
finance fees of $7.3 million relates to arrangement fees for the bank 
facilities and bonds. The Group capitalised interest of $14.4 million 
for the year ended 31 December 2015 is in relation to the interest 
payable on borrowing costs on its capital development projects.
Finance income
Finance income of $1.0 million includes $0.3 million of bank interest 
receivable and $0.5 million unwinding on the financial asset created in 
2012 as part of the consideration for the farm out of the Alma/Galia 
development to KUFPEC.
Earnings per share
The Group’s reported basic earnings per share was (98.0) cents for 
the year ended 31 December 2015 compared with (22.8) cents in 
2014. The decrease of 75.2 cents was attributable to a lower gross 
profit, higher finance fees and offset by a lower effective income tax 
for 2015. The Group’s reported diluted earnings per share excluding 
exceptional items was 16.5 cents for the year ended 31 December 
2015 compared with 17.8 cents in 2014. The decrease of 1.3 cents 
was mainly attributable to lower gross profit and higher finance 
costs offset by a lower effective income tax rate. 
Cash flow and liquidity
The Group’s reported cash generated from operations in 2015 
was $221.7 million compared with $632.2 million in 2014, reflecting 
principally the significant reduction in the oil price. The reported 
cash flow from operations was 28.6 cents per share compared with 
81.6 cents per share in 2014. 
During the year ended 31 December 2015, $2.9 million was 
received in relation to an exploration refund for EnQuest Norge AS’s 
activities in Norway. In addition, $3.5 million was received in relation 
to EnQuest Group’s UK tax liabilities for non-operational activities 
and PRT. $7.7 million was paid in relation to the Group’s operations 
in Malaysia. 
It is anticipated that the underlying effective tax rate for 2016 will be 
below the UK statutory tax rate of 50%, excluding one-off exceptional 
tax items, due to UK tax reliefs and profits charged to tax at a lower 
rate in Malaysia. In the current environment and with the investment 
in the North Sea, the Group does not expect a material cash outflow 
for UK corporation tax on operational activities. This is due to the 
benefits from tax deductible first year capital allowances in the UK, 
available investment allowances and accumulated tax losses which 
are largely attributable to the Group’s capital investment 
programme to date.

 o the Thistle life extension and drilling programme;
 o the drilling of the Ythan JT well; 
 o the drilling of the Heather/Broom H66 side-track well; and
 o the completion of the Tanjong Baram development in Malaysia.
Net debt at 31 December 2015 amounted to $1,548.0 million 
compared with net debt of $967.0 million in 2014.
In early 2015, the Group renegotiated financial covenants under 
its Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) to provide greater flexibility for its 
capital investment programme. The net debt/EBITDA covenant has 
been increased to five times and the ratio of financial charges to 
EBITDA is reduced to three times, both until mid-2017. Compliance 
with ongoing covenants continues to be a priority for the Group, and 
financial covenants have been complied with throughout the year.
Balance Sheet
The Group’s total asset value has decreased by $481.9 million to 
$3,777.3 million at 31 December 2015 (2014: $4,259.2 million).
Property, plant and equipment
Property, Plant and Equipment (PP&E) has decreased to $2,436.7 
million at 31 December 2015 from $3,279.7 million at 31 December 
2014. The decrease of $843.0 million is mainly due to the oil and gas 
assets impairment of $1,224.5 million offset by additions of $826.5 
million and an increase in PP&E of $45.6 million in relation to 
changes in estimates on the decommissioning provision. This is 
offset by the disposal of the new building in Aberdeen, reducing 
PP&E by $78.1 million and depletion and depreciation charges of 
$309.7 million.  EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015

Intangible oil and gas assets
Intangible oil and gas assets decreased by $19.2 million to $46.5 
million at 31 December 2015. The decrease mainly relates to an 
impairment of the Outwith Broom development costs, the disposal 
of the Norway licences, write-offs relating to the relinquishment of 
licences and the sale of the Elke licence. There was also $16.2 million 
of intangible assets reclassified to tangible assets, with Scolty/Crathes 
accounting for the majority of this balance. The remaining balance 
primarily relates to Kraken and the exploration of the Tyrone and 
Tiree areas and the Avalon development of which Summit is 
the operator.
 
Investments
The Group holds an investment of 8,045,198 new ordinary shares in 
Ascent Resources plc which is valued at $0.1 million based on the 
quoted bid price as at 31 December 2015.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables have increased by $65.7 million to 
$351.9 million at 31 December 2015 compared with $286.2 million 
in 2014. The increase is due to higher trade receivables as a result of 
December crude oil sales from the GKA and Alma/Galia fields, as 
well as an increase in joint venture debtors. 
Cash and bank
The Group had $269.0 million of cash and cash equivalents at 
31 December 2015 and $902.3 million was drawn down on the  
$1.2 billion RCF.
 
Provisions
The Group’s decommissioning provision increased by $57.1 
million to $506.8 million at 31 December 2015 (2014: $449.7 million). 
The increase is driven by the inclusion of a provision for Kraken to 
account for the subsea infrastructure that is now in place. Additionally, 
the Alma/Galia provision was increased to reflect the full cost of the 
estimate now that first oil has been achieved, and the estimates for 
Dons and GKA increased reflecting an increase in the estimate of the 
number of days to decommission a well. 
The $80.0 million provision held at 31 December 2014 in respect 
of the Kraken reserves determination contingent carry has been 
released in full during the year ended 31 December 2015, with 
a corresponding credit booked in PP&E. The reduction of this 
provision reflects management’s view that the reserves determination 
process, which is required to use the dated Brent forward curve, less 
an appropriate oil price discount, will result in no contingent carry. 
The reserves determination process which will ultimately determine 
whether any amount is payable, will commence in the 2nd quarter 
of 2016.
Income tax
The Group had no UK corporation tax or supplementary corporation 
tax liability at 31 December 2015, which remains unchanged from 
the prior year. The Group had PRT payable of nil at 31 December 
2015 compared with a $4.4 million liability at 31 December 2014. 
The reduction in the liability is due to a significant reduction in PRT 
payable on income from Alba during 2015. The income tax asset at 
31 December 2015 represents UK corporation tax receivable in 
relation to non-upstream activities.
Deferred tax
The Group’s net deferred tax position has moved from a liability of 
$476.3 million at 31 December 2014, to an asset of $79.3 million at 
31 December 2015. This movement is principally due to a $598.2 
million reduction in the deferred tax liability following the impairment 
of the Group’s oil and gas assets, a reduction in the deferred tax 
liability of $56.8 million due to the reduction in statutory tax rates 
which is offset by a $239.1 million de-recognition of deferred tax 
assets due to the uncertainty of recovery. Total UK tax losses carried 
forward at the year end amount to approximately $2,535.8 million. 
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables have increased to $543.5 million at 
31 December 2015 from $429.1 million at 31 December 2014. This 
increase reflects both an increase in activity, principally related to 
Kraken, plus the impact of the milestone payments in relation to the 
Kraken and Scolty/Crathes developments. 
Other financial liabilities
Other current financial liabilities have decreased by $92.3 million 
to $9.2 million. The decrease relates to the Kraken ‘firm’ carry 
which has expired in the year, amounting to $66.2 million as well as 
a reduction in the value of commodity contracts and forward foreign 
currency contracts of $26.1 million.
 
Other non-current financial liabilities have decreased by $16.0 
million to $7.7 million. The balance forms part of the agreement 
to acquire the PM8 assets in Malaysia, the Group agreed to carry 
PETRONAS Carigali for its share of exploration or appraisal well 
commitments, the balance is the discounted carry.
Financial Risk Management
Oil price
The Group is exposed to the impact of changes in Brent crude oil 
prices on its revenue and profits. EnQuest’s policy is to manage the 
impact of commodity prices to protect against volatility and to 
ensure the availability of cash flow for reinvestment in capital 
programmes that are driving business growth. 
During 2014 the Company entered into commodity hedging 
contracts to hedge partially the exposure to fluctuations in the 
Brent oil price during 2015. The Group has actively managed 
this hedge portfolio during 2015, which has generated cash flows 
of $68.6 million and revenue of $264.0 million. Finance costs of 
$119.8 million have been recognised, representing the movement 
in the time value of put options which have been designated as 
effective hedges of production. The revenue recognised includes 
$119.1 million of gains realised in 2014 which were deferred until 
2015 to match the timing of the underlying production the options 
were hedging. It also includes $123.6 million of non-cash gains in 
respect of the movement in the time value of options not 
designated as hedges.
At 31 December 2015, the Group’s commodity derivative 
contracts includes bought put options over 8MMbbls, maturing 
throughout 2016 with an average strike price of $68/bbl and a 
positive fair value of $164.8 million (including deferred premiums 
owed by EnQuest of $53.5 million). The Group also has oil swap 
contracts to sell 2MMbbls at $66.64/bbl maturing throughout 2016 
with a positive fair value of $49.7 million, and net sold call options 
which, based on the current forward curve, are not expected to 
result in any loss to the Group, and had a positive net fair value 
of $42.0 million (including deferred premiums owed to EnQuest 
of $44.4 million).
In addition to the realised gains and losses on these contracts, 
the Group’s business performance results will be impacted by 
the amortisation of option premium over the life of these options. 
Amortisation of premium in respect of bought put options 
designated as effective hedges are recognised in finance costs, 
whilst the amortisation of all other option premium is recognised 
in revenue. Business performance results for 2015 include a charge  EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Strategic Report 44
Financial review continued
in finance costs totalling $70.0 million in respect of bought put 
option premium amortisation, and revenue includes $111.6 million of 
sold option premium amortisation. The current hedging position will 
result in the realisation of a further $24.2 million of revenue and 
$35.7 million of finance costs throughout 2016.
Foreign exchange
EnQuest’s functional currency is US Dollars. Foreign currency 
risk arises on purchases and the translation of assets and liabilities 
denominated in currencies other than US Dollars. To mitigate the 
risks of large fluctuations in the currency markets, the hedging 
policy agreed by the Board allows for up to 70% of the non-US 
Dollar portion of the Group’s annual capital budget and 
operating expenditure to be hedged. For specific contracted 
capital expenditure projects, up to 100% can be hedged. The 
Group has hedged its exposures to Sterling, Norwegian Kroner 
and the Euro in line with this policy.
For the year ended 31 December 2015, the Group’s foreign currency 
hedging portfolio realised a loss of $3.2 million. Unrealised gains of 
$2.3 million were also recognised.
At the end of 2015, the Group had foreign exchange hedge 
contracts in place over £463.6 million with a protection rate 
of approximately $1.49/£, €13.0 million with a protection rate of 
approximately €1.12/£ and forward contracts over NOK74.6 million 
at a fixed rate of NOK7.84/£. These contracts had a negative net 
fair value of $9.2 million at 31 December 2015 and expire 
throughout 2016.
EnQuest continually reviews its currency exposures and when 
appropriate looks at opportunities to enter into foreign exchange 
hedging contracts.
Surplus cash balances are deposited as cash collateral against 
in-place letters of credit as a way of reducing interest costs. 
Otherwise cash balances can be invested in short term bank 
deposits and AAA-rated liquidity funds, subject to Board 
approved limits and with a view to minimising counterparty 
credit risks.
Going Concern
The Group closely monitors and manages its funding position 
and liquidity risk throughout the year, including monitoring forecast 
covenant results to ensure it has access to sufficient funds to meet 
forecast cash requirements. Cash forecasts are regularly produced 
and sensitivities considered for, but not limited to, changes in 
crude oil prices (adjusted for hedging undertaken by the Group), 
production rates and development project timing and costs. These 
forecasts and sensitivity analyses allow management to mitigate any 
liquidity or covenant compliance risks in a timely manner.
Following the significant decline in oil prices, management has 
taken action to implement certain cost saving programmes to 
reduce planned operational expenditure, general and administrative 
spend and capital expenditure in 2016 and 2017. Management also 
successfully renegotiated temporary relaxation of certain covenants 
within the Revolving Credit Facility and Retail Bond.
At year end, the Group had headroom of $235 million on its 
borrowing facilities (excluding cash at hand) and headroom on 
its related financial covenants which are the same under both 
the Revolving Credit Facility and the Retail Bond. The Group’s 
forecasts and projections take into account the actions described 
in the preceding paragraph, and reflect the assumptions that the 
Group’s major projects remain on track. 
This going concern assessment is prepared on the basis that 
the Facility providers continue to provide access to funding for the 
duration of the period under review. The forecasts which underpin 
this assessment, use an oil price assumption of $30/bbl throughout 
2016, and $40/bbl in the first quarter of 2017, indicate that the 
Company will be able to operate within the headroom of its existing 
borrowing facilities for 12 months from the date of approval of the 
Annual Report and Accounts. Furthermore, management is pursuing 
a number of options available to it to inject near-term liquidity, 
including asset sales and other funding options. The Directors 
therefore consider it appropriate to continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 
Viability assessment
The Directors have assessed the viability of the Group over a 
three-year period to March 2019. This assessment has taken into 
account the Group’s financial position as at March 2016, the future 
projections and the principal risks and uncertainties. The Directors’ 
approach to risk management, their assessment of the Group’s 
principal risks and uncertainties and the actions management are 
taking to mitigate these risks are outlined on pages 22 to 27. 
The period of three years is deemed appropriate as it provides a 
sufficient time horizon to assess the performance of the Kraken 
project and covers the period within which the Group’s Revolving 
Credit Facility will be due to be partly repaid or refinanced. This 
viability assessment is prepared on the basis that the facility 
providers continue to provide access to sufficient funding for the 
duration of the three year period under review. The forecasts which 
underpin this assessment uses the same oil price assumption as the 
going concern with a longer term price assumption for the viability 
statement being aligned to the current forward curve.
The Group’s projections reflect significant steps already underway 
to reduce operating and capital expenditure in light of the 
prevailing lower oil prices.
EnQuest values
Respect
There are a number of definitions of respect, but the one I like 
is the concept of due regard. I always try to remember that 
many different beliefs exist and that to acknowledge those 
beliefs is the outward expression of my respect for an 
individual, a purpose and the EnQuest way. 
Abraham Zen Mohamed
Seligi A Offshore Installation Manager – Offshore Malaysia EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Strategic Report 45
The Directors are pursuing a number of further mitigations to 
improve medium term liquidity. These options include but are not 
limited to:
 o a sale and leaseback of the EnQuest Producer. EnQuest is 
in reasonably advanced discussions with a counterparty;
 o a number of asset sale scenarios are being pursued; and
 o other funding options.
The Directors will continue to work closely with the facility 
providers to keep them updated on progress on the above. The 
Group will seek to modify or temporarily waive the existing covenants 
and loan amortisation as appropriate. The RCF lenders continue to be 
supportive and have provided waivers to date. There is also regular 
dialogue with RCF lenders to ensure they remain informed on 
progress on the key projects and operations and the projections 
underpinning the liquidity position.
Based on these initiatives and Group’s projections, the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
the period to March 2019. 
The Group’s business plan process has underpinned this assessment. 
The business plan process takes account of the Group’s principal risks 
and uncertainties, and has further been stress tested to understand 
the impact on the Group’s liquidity and financial position of 
reasonably possible changes in these risks and/or assumptions. 
The Directors draw attention to the specific risks and uncertainties 
identified below, which the Directors believe individually or 
collectively, could have a material impact on the Group’s viability 
during the period of review. In forming this view, it is recognised 
that such future assessments are subject to a level of uncertainty 
that increases with time and, therefore, future outcomes cannot be 
guaranteed or predicted with certainty. The impact of these risks 
and uncertainties, including their combined impact, has been 
reviewed by the Directors and the effectiveness and achievability  
of potential mitigating actions have been considered.
 o Oil price volatility
 To mitigate oil price volatility the Directors hedged 10 million 
barrels of 2016 production at an average price of $68 per barrel. 
As further mitigation the Directors, in line with Group policy, will 
continue to pursue hedging at the appropriate time and price.
 o Project execution
 The Group has planned capital expenditure of approximately 
$1.6 billion during the three-year period covered by the viability 
assessment. This expenditure principally relates to the remaining 
capital expenditure to first oil on the Kraken and Scolty/Crathes 
developments (remain on track) and the future phases on the 
drilling programme on Kraken. Whilst much of this expenditure 
has been contracted on fixed price lump sum contracts, risks 
remain that capital expenditure could exceed that projected, 
and/or that commissioning of projects, in particular Kraken, could 
occur later than projected. A growth in capital expenditure, or 
delays to the commissioning of Kraken, could result in reducing 
the Group’s liquidity during the period of the review. 
 The Directors and management team monitor project progress 
against key milestones and ensure timely intervention as 
appropriate. In addition the management are engaging with the 
key contractors to improve the near-term liquidity.
 o Access to funding
 The Directors recognise the importance of ensuring medium 
term liquidity particularly in light of the recent further decline in 
oil price. EnQuest has a diversified funding structure including a 
committed $1.2 billion Revolving Credit Facility and a further 
$0.5 billion potentially available through an accordion structure. 
Repayment of the RCF commences in October 2017 with final 
repayment due in October 2019. In addition it has a £155 million 
Retail Bond and $650 million High Yield Bond, with both 
maturing in 2022. 
 
 Recognising the decline in oil price in late 2014, the Directors 
engaged with it’s facility providers and bond holders and in 
early 2015 secured a relaxation to the relevant financial 
covenants until mid-2017. The Directors continue to work closely 
with the lenders in the Revolving Credit Facility to ensure that 
funding remains available. 
In conducting the viability review, these risks have been taken into 
account in the stress testing performed on the base case described 
above. Specifically the base case, which includes the additional 
10.5% interest in Kraken acquired from First Oil, has been subjected 
to stress testing by considering the impact of the following plausible 
down-side risks:
 o a six month delay to first oil from Kraken;
 o a 10% increase in opex;
 o an increase in capital expenditure associated with the Kraken 
project;
 o a 5% reduction in production; and
 o replacement of the existing surety bonds with letters of credit, 
resulting in a reduction in the available debt capacity.
A scenario has been run illustrating the impact of the above risks on 
the base case. Without all the mitigating actions being implemented, 
this plausible down-side case would result in further funding being 
required in the absence of a significant recovery in oil prices and/or 
the ongoing support of the lenders. If this was the case then the 
Group’s viability would be under threat. However, the Group also has 
a number of other liquidity enhancing options including asset sales 
and other financing which are also currently being considered.
Having reviewed the Group’s financial position as at March 2016, 
the future projections, the principal risks and uncertainties and the 
mitigating actions, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the period to March 2019 and therefore support 
this viability statement.

Corporate responsibility 
review
Health, Safety, Environment & 
Assurance (‘HSE&A’): HSE&A 
performance in 2015 was below  
the high watermark of 2014 but 
nonetheless still strong.
In 2015, we maintained our pursuit of very 
high HSE&A performance levels.
In the UK, we delivered another strong 
HSE&A performance, however not as strong 
as the exceptional performance delivered in 
2014. Although most of our assets achieved 
their Lost-Time Incident Frequency Rate 
(‘LTIFR’) and Recordable Injury Frequency 
Rate (‘RIFR’) targets, some did not. High-
Potential Incidents (‘HIPOs’) and Dangerous 
Occurrences (‘RIDDOR’) were however 
better than target overall and we were 
pleased to record a Safety Critical 
Maintenance backlog of zero at year end. 
In October 2015, we were delighted that 
the Kittiwake platform recorded 10 years 
without a Lost-Time Incident. This record was 
achieved against the backdrop of ongoing 
high levels of activity on the platform. 
Evidence of our commitment to maintain 
excellence in HSE&A was apparent throughout 
2015 in the ongoing implementation of our 
Continuous Improvement Plan. Encompassing 
12 identified areas of activity, it witnessed 
material progress under each of its strategic 
themes: leadership and culture, control of 
major accident hazards, personal health and 
safety, and environmental controls.
Examples include:
 o Completion of an embedding process for 
risk management procedures across all 
EnQuest sites
 o Implementation of a simplified and 
standardised control of work system, 
focusing on major accident hazards
 o Roll-out of enhanced control procedures 
for lifting operations
 o Introduction of new treatment systems 
offshore to reduce volume of waste from 
drilling programmes and asset 
operations going to landfill
 o Development of a programme to identify, 
and effectively manage, all environmentally 
critical elements on operated assets
A major exercise was instigated to update 
EnQuest’s safety case systems following the 
introduction of updated UK regulations in 
July 2015, in response to the EU’s Offshore 
Safety Directive. The HSE&A and DECC 
have together formed a joint competent 
authority, the Offshore Safety Directive 
Regulator (‘OSDR’), and we have taken the 
required steps to ensure compliance 
throughout upcoming safety case 
review programmes. 
Operations Excellence – and its three 
overarching themes of controlling major 
accident hazards, minimising waste and 
maximising production – remains a key 
reference point for our HSE&A activities. 
The 2015 appointment of Ian MacRae as 
Operations Functional Manager serves to 
underpin this commitment. 
The appointment of a new HSE&A Manager 
in August 2015 ensured continuity in the 
development and delivery of our 
improvement plans. 
We took key steps towards formalising 
our network of voluntary environmental 
representatives (‘E-Reps’) on our assets. 
Our first E-Rep forum was held in October 
and more are planned for 2016. The initiative 
provides greater support for the work of 
E-Reps by enhancing their profile and 
responsibilities, providing new learning 
opportunities and sharing best practice.
In Malaysia, we completed our first 
full year of operations with no Lost-Time 
Incidents (‘LTIs’). We completed 700,000 man 
hours on the Tanjong Baram project with no 
accidents or injuries. We continue to develop 
our in-country HSE&A framework, in line with 
the prevailing legislative environment and 
EnQuest’s own processes, principles 
and values. 
People: Challenging macro-economic 
conditions intensified
EnQuest took significant steps in 2015 
towards realising a key strategic goal: shaping 
a streamlined organisation which provides our 
talented people with the platform to deliver a 
clearly defined work programme.
The business decision to focus for now solely 
upon operations in the UK and Malaysia, 
allied to the challenges posed by the low oil 
price environment and rising operating costs 
in the North Sea, created the impetus behind 
“Evidence of our  
commitment to maintain 
excellence in HSE&A was 
apparent throughout 2015 in 
the ongoing implementation 
of our Continuous 
Improvement Plan.”

EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
our pursuit of this goal. Our People 
and Organisation strategy – the right 
organisation, with great people, who deliver 
exceptional performance, in the EnQuest way 
– provided the necessary framework.
Headcount reduction was inevitably 
part of our response. We strived to execute 
the process with respect and consideration 
throughout and we also took wider steps to 
create a simplified, more efficient and highly 
focused organisation.
In the UK, our northern North Sea assets 
moved to an equal time rota in 2015; our 
central North Sea operations are doing 
likewise in 2016. In line with wider market 
practices, we adjusted our contractor rates.
We further deepened EnQuest’s direct 
presence offshore, with another tranche 
of personnel choosing to become EnQuest 
employees rather than contractors, thereby 
enabling us to build our capabilities further 
in key areas.
In addition, we established a Dubai based 
team to deliver all purchasing support for 
our North Sea operations. This has created  
a simplified supply chain environment, 
delivering greater purchasing diversity  
and new commercial advantages.
A reorganisation exercise within our wells 
delivery function, allied to the introduction  
of offshore coaches, yielded outstanding 
performance – not least on the Kraken 
drilling programme. The Kraken team as a 
whole delivered exceptional results, despite 
the highly challenging work programme  
and geographical diversity of the project. 
The team embraced the principle of 
collaboration, and remained focused  
and engaged throughout. 
The successful relocation to our new offices 
in Annan House in Aberdeen – completed 
on time and on budget – has served to 
mature the EnQuest culture and supported 
a collective focus on our long term 
sustainability. 
During our first full year of operations in 
Malaysia, we worked to optimise the 
organisation and build a distinct EnQuest 
culture within it.
Specifically, as part of our strong working 
partnership with PETRONAS, we signed 
up for its people development initiative, 
Prodigy (Programme for the Development 
of Ingenious Young Talent), committing to 
take graduates on board in our drilling and 
operations functions. A competency system 
was introduced to our offshore operations 
to help achieve high performance in work 
execution and demonstrate our commitment 
to Safe Results.
Our Malaysia operations also moved into a 
single new office facility in Kuala Lumpur to 
bring all personnel together in one location.

Community: Continuing charitable 
focus on Archway, the learning 
disabilities support group
Despite the challenges posed in the 
prevailing low oil price environment, 
EnQuest remained fully committed to an 
active community engagement programme 
throughout 2015. 
By applying our values of collaboration and 
creativity, and specifically by capitalising upon 
our relationships with companies in our supply 
chain, we sought to add substance and extra 
value to our community support activities. 
This was particularly evident in our ongoing 
work with Tullos Primary School in Aberdeen. 
We arranged for pupils to visit the facilities of 
Bond Offshore Helicopters, to view aircraft 
and speak to pilots and engineers. Likewise, 
a group from Tullos visited remotely 
operated vehicle (ROV) provider i-Tech,  
a division of Subsea 7. 
The purpose of these events was to 
give young people a direct insight into 
specialist areas of the oil and gas industry 
and encourage them to consider the career 
opportunities they present. More broadly, 
our aim was to inspire them to build a career 
in any sphere of working life. 
It was with similar objectives in mind that 
we hosted a careers day for 30 pupils at 
Annan House to profile not only the core 
professional disciplines at EnQuest but also 
all key support areas, from administrative 
and security operations to IT and HR. 
We continued to enjoy a fruitful 
relationship with the Paul Lawrie 
Foundation. The charitable organisation 
twice brought pop-up sports facilities to 
Tullos School to encourage participation 
and skills development. 
Archway, an Aberdeen-based charity 
which supports young people and 
adults with learning disabilities, was 
one of our nominated charities in 2015 
and the relationship is continuing into 
2016. Over the year, the organisation 
benefited from various fund-raising 
activities at EnQuest as well as support 
from EnQuest personnel for Archway-led 
ventures to generate funds. There was 
also practical support, in the form of 
EnQuest team visits to Archway facilities 
to perform refurbishment work. 
EnQuest’s charity committee reviews 
requests for support on an ongoing 
basis, and selects a number that meet our 
established criteria. We did so throughout 
2015: the projects that benefited from our 
support included dates-n-mates Aberdeen, 
which offers friendship and dating 
opportunities to adults with learning 
disabilities. EnQuest staff spent time 
decorating the organisation’s Halloween

Business conduct
The Group has zero tolerance of slavery 
and expects the same of all with whom it 
has business dealings; for example, in relation 
to procurement, by requiring suppliers to 
confirm their commitment to anti-slavery 
before being qualified to supply the Group. 
The Group has also begun implementing 
procedures that will ensure that it is fully 
compliant with its obligation under the 
Modern Slavery Act 2015.

Chairman’s letter
Dear Shareholder
During the period under review EnQuest PLC (‘EnQuest’ or the 
‘Company’) has generated strong production growth. The Company 
operates in a geopolitical environment that has become more 
turbulent and the price of oil has significantly declined since the 
second half of 2014. Operating efficiency has always been central to 
EnQuest and 2015 saw the Company further pursue cost reducing 
strategies. Although the Company is incurring debt to assure delivery 
of projects to which we have committed, the consequential increases 
in production and improvements in production efficiency should 
position EnQuest to meet the challenges of a lower price environment 
and to prosper from oil price recovery. In the last year EnQuest has 
achieved excellent operational performance with high production 
efficiency, combined with a successful drilling programme.
Corporate governance
On behalf of the Board of Directors (the ‘Board’), I am 
pleased to introduce EnQuest’s corporate governance report. 
The Board believes that the manner in which it conducts its 
business is important and it is striving to deliver the highest standard 
of corporate governance. Ensuring the right approach to governance 
is taken and that the Board works effectively remains a key focus of 
the Company. EnQuest’s Company values of Respect, Focus, Agility, 
Creativity, Passion, Collaboration and Empowerment help to foster a 
working environment where people are safe, creative and passionate, 
with a relentless focus on results. These values guide everything we 
do at EnQuest. 
The work of the Board is supported by several key Board 
Committees. The Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees 
have recently been supplemented by the creation of a new Risk 
Committee. Each of these Committees has formal terms of reference 
approved by the Board. Further details on each Committee can be 
found on pages 58 to 61 (Audit), pages 62 to 75 (Remuneration), 
pages 76 to 78 (Nomination) and page 57 (Risk). These Committees 
report back to the Board after each meeting.
EnQuest’s governance framework also contains several non-
Board committees, which provide advice and support to the Chief 
Executive, including an Executive Committee and an Operations 
Committee for the North Sea business division. The Company also 
holds dedicated HSE reviews on a quarterly basis which are chaired 
by the Chief Executive. During 2015 a hedging policy was adopted 
which, inter alia, required the set up of a new non-Board committee, 
the Marketing and Trading Risk Management Committee. 
“Operating efficiency has 
always been central to 
EnQuest and 2015 saw the 
Company further pursue 
cost reducing strategies.” EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Governance 53
Board composition and succession planning
The Board regularly considers how it operates and whether there is 
an appropriate composition and mix around the Board table, both 
to respond to today’s challenges and to enhance EnQuest’s future 
strategic direction. The Board was further strengthened during 2015 
with the addition of Philip Holland, who EnQuest is delighted to 
welcome to the Board. Phil joined the Board as a Non-Executive 
Director in August 2015 and brings deep experience of capital 
projects management in the oil and gas industry. Phil is the 
Chairman of the newly formed Risk Committee. 
The Company will reach its ninth anniversary in 2019 and the 
Board considers it desirable to ensure the independence of its 
Non-Executive Directors through a phased approach to the 
retirement of its existing Non-Executive Directors. Consequently, 
Clare Spottiswoode will be retiring from the Board in 2016. The 
Board would like to extend its gratitude to Clare for her valuable 
contributions during her tenure with EnQuest.
Board evaluation
2015 saw EnQuest’s second externally facilitated Board review, 
which confirmed again that it is a well run and well governed 
organisation, with a strong leadership team. The review highlighted 
that as EnQuest moves from being a new entrant to an established 
producer in a more challenging external environment it must 
continue to evolve its governance procedures in line with this 
transition. The Board has adopted a number of measures as it 
progresses this agenda; such as streamlining the membership 
of Board Committees, the introduction of the Risk Committee as 
a Committee of the Board; and a more structured approach to 
refreshing Board membership over time. See page 56 for details. 
Corporate responsibility 
The Company’s corporate responsibility is focused on five main areas. 
These are Health and Safety, People, Environment, Business Conduct 
and Community. EnQuest is committed to operating responsibly and 
never knowingly compromises its health and safety standards in order 
to meet operational objectives. EnQuest’s approach to HSE&A 
management is built on its Company values. Through respect for 
its people, contractors, stakeholders and the environment, EnQuest 
pursues its principal aims: safe results, with no harm to people and 
respect for the environment.
EnQuest has developed an Environmental Management System 
(‘EMS’) to ensure its activities are conducted in such a way that 
it can manage and mitigate its impact on the environment. The 
system is broadly aligned with the requirements of the International 
Organisation for Standardisation’s environmental management 
system standard – ISO 14001:2004. EnQuest works to minimise its 
impact on the environment and reports on, and measures, liquid 
waste, accidental spills, atmospheric emissions, waste management 
and continual improvement. Public environmental statements 
relating to the Company’s operations are available on the website  
www.enquest.com.
Risk
This has been the first year that EnQuest has implemented the 
Risk Management Framework (‘RMF’) adopted in 2014. During the 
year the risk, planning and strategy work of the Executive Committee 
has been further aligned and the Board has established a new 
Committee, the Risk Committee, which is empowered to review 
individual risk areas in depth and report thereon to the Board. 
Strategy
The Board continued to provide strategic guidance to executive 
management throughout the year, which culminated in EnQuest’s 
annual Board strategy day in October 2015. The workshop involved 
a comprehensive review of the Company’s existing strategy (aligned 
with the mitigation of the Company’s principal risks) as well as 
identification of key themes to help it navigate changes in the 
landscape for the business. EnQuest is confident that its strategy 
has positioned it well to achieve its long-term goals and to maximise 
shareholder value.

essential part of its framework, supporting structure, risk 
management and core values.

Board composition and changes
For the year ended 31 December 2015 the Board had eight 
Directors, consisting of two Executive Directors and six 
Non-Executive Directors (including the Chairman). The 
biographical details of each are set out on pages 48 and 
49. The Board appointed a new Non-Executive Director, 
Philip Holland, with effect from 1 August 2015.
The role of the Board
The Board is the custodian of the Company’s values, its long-term 
vision and provides strategic direction and guidance for the 
Company in order to deliver long-term shareholder value. 
The matters reserved to the Board for its decisions are detailed in  
a formal schedule. This schedule is reviewed and approved by the 
Board. The key reserved matters include:
 o the Group’s overall strategy;
 o review business plans and trading performance;
 o approval of major capital investment projects;
 o examination of acquisition opportunities and divestment policies;
 o review of significant financial and operational issues;
 o review and approval of the Company’s financial statements;
 o oversight of control and risk management systems (supported by 
the Audit Committee); and
 o succession planning and appointments (supported by the 
Nomination Committee).
The Board held six scheduled Board meetings in the year ended 
31 December 2015, four of which were held at the Company’s 
registered office in London, one was held at the Company’s 
Aberdeen office and one was held offsite in conjunction with 
the strategy day. In addition, a number of ad hoc meetings were 
arranged in order to deal with matters that required consideration 
at short notice. It is expected that all Directors attend scheduled 
Board and relevant Committee meetings and the Company’s 
Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’). Details of Board and Committee 
membership and attendance can be found on pages 56, 58,  
63 and 77.
All Directors are covered by the Company’s Directors’ and Officers’ 
insurance policy.
A clear division of responsibilities 
There is a clear division between the role of the Chairman and Chief 
Executive; this has been set out in writing and agreed by the Board. 
The Chairman was independent upon his appointment to the Board, 
and the Board continues to consider him to be an independent 
Non-Executive Director. The Chairman is responsible for setting the 
leadership of the Board, setting the Board agenda and ensuring the 
overall effective working of the Board. The Chief Executive is 
accountable and reports to the Board. His role is to develop 
strategy in consultation with the Board, to execute that strategy 
following presentation to, and consideration and approval by, the 
Board and to oversee the operational management of the business. 
The role of the Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors combine broad business and 
commercial experience from oil and gas and other industry sectors. 
They bring independence, external skills, objective judgement and 
constructively challenge the actions of senior management. This is 
critical for providing assurance that the Executive Directors are 
exercising good judgement in delivery of strategy and decision 
making. The Board is satisfied that all of the Non-Executive Directors 
meet the independence criteria as set by the Code. Information on 
the skills and experience of the Non-Executive Directors can be 
found in the Board biographies on pages 48 to 49.
The Chairman holds one-to-one and group meetings with the 
Non-Executive Directors, without the Executive Directors present, 
at least once a year. 
The role of the Senior Independent Director
The Senior Independent Director (‘SID’) is available to shareholders 
if they have concerns where contact through the normal channels 
of the Chairman, the Chief Executive or other Executive Directors 
has failed to resolve an issue or where such contact is inappropriate. 
In his role as the SID, Helmut Langanger continues to provide a 
sounding board for the Chairman as well as act as an intermediary 
with other Directors when necessary. 
Company Secretary
The Company Secretary is responsible for advising the Board, 
through the Chairman, on all governance matters. In addition, 
each Director has access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary. The Company Secretary is instrumental in facilitating the 
induction of new Directors and assists with the ongoing training and 
development of the Board. EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015

Board activities during the year
How the Board operates
During 2015 the Board held six scheduled meetings and ad 
hoc meetings were arranged to deal with matters arising between 
scheduled meetings as appropriate. Board meetings are preceded 
by a day of Committee meetings as appropriate. This pattern of 
meetings is intended to support the Board’s focus on the strategic 
and long-term matters, while ensuring that it discharges its 
monitoring and oversight role effectively through intensive high 
quality discussions and high quality information flow.
All Board papers are published via an online Board portal 
system. This offers a fast, secure and reliable method of distribution, 
which helps lower the Company’s environmental impact through the 
reduction of printing and lowers costs associated with printing and 
postage. Board agendas are drawn up by the Company Secretary 
in conjunction with the Chairman and with agreement from the 
Chief Executive.

Board Committees
The Board delegates a number of responsibilities to its Audit 
Committee, Remuneration Committee, Nomination Committee and 
now to its newly formed Risk Committee. The Chairman of each 
Committee reports formally to the Board on its proceedings after 
each meeting and makes recommendations that it deems appropriate 
to the Board for its consideration and approval. There are formal terms 
of reference for each Committee, approved by the Board. The terms 
of reference for each of these Committees sets out the scope of 
authority of the Committee, satisfies the requirements of the Code 
and are reviewed internally on an ongoing basis by the Board. Copies 
of the terms of reference are available on the Company’s website 
www.enquest.com.
The Committees are provided with all necessary resources to 
enable them to undertake their duties in an effective manner. 
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committees other 
than the Remuneration Committee, for which the Human Resources 
Director acts as secretary, and minutes of all Committee meetings are 
available to all Directors.
One of the recommendations made in the 2015 external Board review 
was to limit the memberships of EnQuest’s Board Committees. The 
following proposals were made and adopted in December 2015 for 
the Nomination Committee and in January 2016 for the remaining 
three Committees: 
Nomination Committee Audit Committee
Dr James Buckee (Chair) Jock Lennox (Chair)
Helmut Langanger Philip Nolan
Amjad Bseisu Clare Spottiswoode
Risk Committee Remuneration Committee
Philip Holland (Chair) Helmut Langanger (Chair)
Clare Spottiswoode Dr James Buckee
Jock Lennox Philip Nolan
In addition to the four Board Committees, EnQuest has several 
non-Board committees, which assist the Chief Executive in the 
implementation and monitoring of strategy. These are the Executive 
Committee, Investment Committee, International Operations 
Committee, North Sea Operations Committee and the Group 
Health, Safety, Environment and Assurance team. 
Delegation of authority
Responsibility levels are communicated throughout the Group as 
part of the business management system and through an authority 
matrix which sets out, inter alia, delegated authority levels, 
segregation of duties and other control procedures.
Board performance evaluation
In 2015, the Board appointed Colin Mayer, an independent external 
facilitator, to conduct a Board evaluation review. The process 
consisted of one-to-one structured interviews with each Director, 
selected senior management, the outgoing and incoming partners 
in charge of external audit, two investors and one of EnQuest’s 
banks, as well as attendance at Board and Committee meetings. 
The evaluation showed that EnQuest is a well governed and well 
run company that comfortably conforms to the requirements of the 
Code. The Company has executives of the highest calibre, led by 
an outstanding Chief Executive and a first rate Chairman. Board 
proceedings are relaxed, with a strong sense of team spirit and 
collegiality, encouraging open and frank discussions. 
A number of agreed action points from the 2015 Board evaluation 
review are set out below:
 o An annual assessment of the performance of each Board 
member supplemented to the review of the performance of the 
Board as a whole will be conducted by the Chairman
 o Board Committee memberships streamlined
 o Structured Board succession planning
 o A Risk sub-Committee of the Board with clear terms of reference
 o Streamlining of the Board pack format, in order to facilitate 
Board decisions
In addition to the external Board evaluation, the Senior Independent 
Director led a rigorous review of the Chairman, in conjunction with 
the other Board members. The review recognised that the Chairman 
brings a deep knowledge of the business, together with extensive 
experience and expertise. Certain areas of focus were identified 
to optimise how the Chairman can best ensure the most effective 
operation of the Board in the future, and these areas will be 
reviewed at the following year’s review. Helmut Langanger and Jock 
Lennox were also each subject to a particularly rigorous review by 
the Nomination Committee, as they approach their six year tenure 
with the Company, and the Committee concluded that each 
of those Directors continues to provide valuable service to 
the Company.
Induction, information and support
The Directors may consult with the Company Secretary at any time 
on matters related to their role on the Board. 
On joining EnQuest, Non-Executive Directors receive a full 
and tailored induction to the Company. The induction programme 
consists of a comprehensive briefing pack, which includes Group 
structure details, the constitution of the Company, the Group 
governance map, a guide to Directors’ duties, terms of reference 
of each Committee, Group policies and the Company’s delegation 
of authority. In addition to this, each Director receives an 
introduction to the Company’s resource centre (including all 
external communications, such as investor presentations, reports 
and corporate responsibility reports) and a schedule of one-to-one 
meetings with each of the Executive Directors, members of senior 
management and external advisers. 
All Non-Executive Directors have access to the Company’s 
senior management between Board meetings and the Board aims 
to hold at least one meeting each year in one of the business units 
to allow Non-Executive Directors to meet and engage with local 
staff. In addition, the continuing development of Board members 
is supported through regular briefings on key business, industry, 
governance and regulatory developments. The Chairman monitors 
the breadth of knowledge, skills and experience of the Board and 
its Committees to ensure that they can fulfil their obligations.
Accountability
Conflicts of interest
The Board operates a policy to identify and, where appropriate, 
manage, conflicts or potential conflicts of interest with the Company’s 
interests. In accordance with the Directors’ interests’ provisions in the 
Companies Act 2006, all the Directors are required to submit details 
to the Company Secretary of any situations which may give rise to a 
conflict, or potential conflict, of interest. The Board monitors and 
reviews potential conflicts of interest on a regular basis and is satisfied 
that formal procedures are in place to ensure that authorisation for 
potential and actual conflicts of interest are operated efficiently. EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Governance 57
Anti-bribery and corruption
The Company has a number of policies covering anti-bribery and 
corruption and the overall anti-bribery and corruption programme 
is reviewed annually by the Board.
As part of training, the Company also requires new personnel 
to familiarise themselves with the Company’s Code of Conduct 
and a corruption risks awareness email is sent out annually by the 
Chief Executive (to prompt all personnel to complete an online 
anti-corruption training course). In addition, the Company runs a 
focused training programme targeted towards particular groups 
of personnel. 
The Company also encourages staff to escalate any concerns 
and, to facilitate this, provides an external ‘speak-up’ reporting line.
The limited number of relevant instances that were reported to the 
Board were investigated by the Company’s General Counsel.
Risk
EnQuest has continued throughout the year to implement and 
develop its comprehensive Risk Management Framework, which was 
developed in 2014, and has conducted a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group; see pages 22 to 27 of the Strategic 
Report for further information. 
The Company has further embedded its risk principles by 
establishing an additional committee of the Board, a Risk 
Committee. The primary responsibility of the Risk Committee will be 
to act as a forum for engaging in thorough analysis of particular 
material risks that the Board believes merits analysis and discussion 
in greater depth than is ordinarily practicable within the agendas of 
full Board meetings. The initial activity of the Risk Committee is to 
set its agenda for the coming year. The terms of reference of the 
Audit Committee remain unchanged and it remains responsible for 
the following risk management related tasks:
 o reviewing the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls 
and risk management systems;
 o reviewing and approving the statements to be included in the 
Annual Report concerning internal controls and risk 
management; and
 o monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the Company’s 
internal audit function in the context of the Company’s overall 
risk management system.
Relations with shareholders 
Engagement with shareholders
EnQuest maintained an active and constructive dialogue 
with its shareholders throughout the year through a planned 
programme of investor relations activities. In 2015 the Chairman 
and the Company’s Senior Independent Director met with officers 
of certain large institutional investors and discussed matters of 
corporate governance. The Board was then updated on the outcome 
of those meetings. The Company’s investor relations team keeps the 
Board informed of broker and analysts’ views, and presents a paper at 
each Board meeting. In addition, EnQuest periodically carries out an 
independent survey to a cross section of shareholders in order to 
assess shareholder perception of the Company.
EnQuest’s investor relations team and Company Secretarial 
department field daily queries from shareholders and analysts  
and there is a section of the website dedicated to shareholders:  
www.enquest.com. EnQuest’s registrars, Capita, also have a team of 
people to answer shareholder queries in relation to technical aspects 
of their holdings, such as shareholding balances. 
All of the Company’s financial results presentations are available on 
the website at www.enquest.com and shareholders can register on 
the website to receive email alerts.
In 2015 numerous investor and broker sales team and analyst 
meetings were held, including presentations at investor conferences, 
results presentations and a capital markets day for investors was held 
in December 2015. At the beginning of the year investors attended a 
site visit in Newcastle, which included a tour of the EnQuest Producer 
FPSO, in respect of the Alma/Galia development. As normal, EnQuest 
offered to make available meetings with the Chairman and Senior 
Independent Director for discussion of any governance or other 
matters and some such routine meetings took place in 2015. 
2015 Annual Report
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and Financial Statements and consider that, taken as a whole, the 
Annual Report and Financial Statements are fair, balanced and 
understandable and provide the necessary information for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy.
Annual General Meeting
The Company’s AGM is attended by the Board and senior 
management and is open to all EnQuest shareholders to attend. 
The Chief Executive gives a presentation on operational matters 
before the Chairman deals with the formal business of the meeting. 
To encourage shareholder participation, EnQuest offers electronic 
proxy voting through the CREST electronic proxy appointment 
service. At the AGM all resolutions are proposed and voted upon 
individually by way of a poll by shareholders or their proxies. All 
shareholders present can question the Board during the meeting 
as well as informally afterwards.  EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015

Audit Committee Report
Dear Shareholder
The Audit Committee’s core responsibilities are to:
 o monitor the integrity of the financial statements and the 
appropriateness of the related significant judgements 
and estimates;
 o review the effectiveness of internal financial controls;
 o monitor and review the effectiveness of the internal audit 
function; and
 o in respect of the external auditor, make recommendations to 
the Board in relation to their appointment, re-appointment and 
removal, approve their remuneration and terms of engagement, 
review their independence and objectivity, and develop and 
implement the non-audit services policy.
Our full terms of reference are available on the Company’s website 
www.enquest.com under investors/shareholder centre.
As planned when we last reported to you, our work in 2015 has 
responded to the continuing decline in the oil price. The price 
environment has unsurprisingly put pressure on the Company’s cash 
flows and liquidity, and the viability of the Company. We have taken 
this into account in our review of the going concern assumption, and 
through overseeing how the Company has complied with the new 
requirements in respect of the viability statement. Additionally, 
through internal audit, we have reviewed the Group’s cash flow 
modelling, to ensure it is robust and well controlled.
The oil price deterioration has also increased the risk in respect of 
certain judgements and estimates made in the financial statements, 
such as the recoverable value of the Group’s assets, and our work 
during the year has responded to this. Details of these judgements 
and estimates, and how we satisfied ourselves as to their 
appropriateness, are set out in detail below, together with further 
information on how the Committee discharged its responsibilities 
during the year.
With the oil price uncertainty expected to continue throughout 
2016, we will remain focused on continuing to monitor closely the 
Group’s financial position and liquidity, as well as overseeing the 
execution of our risk-based internal audit plan.

Meetings are also normally attended by the General Counsel 
and Company Secretary, the Chief Financial Officer the external 
auditors and other key finance team members as required. The 
Chief Executive and Chairman of the Board also attend the 
meetings when invited to do so by the Committee. PwC, in their 
role as internal auditors during 2015, attended the meetings as 
appropriate. The Chairman of the Committee regularly meets with 
the external audit partner (this included particular focus on going 
concern and longer-term viability) and the internal audit partner to 
discuss matters relevant to the Company.

Financial reporting and significant financial statement reporting issues
The primary role of the Committee in relation to financial reporting is to assess, amongst other things:
 o the appropriateness of the accounting policies selected and disclosures made, including whether they comply with International 
Financial Reporting Standards; and
 o those judgements, estimates and key assumptions that could have a significant impact on the Group’s financial performance and 
position, or on the remuneration of senior management.
We consider these items together with both management and our external auditors, who both provide reports to the Audit Committee in 
respect of these areas at each Committee meeting. The main areas considered during 2015 are set out below:
Significant financial statement reporting issue Consideration
Going concern and viability
The Group’s assessment of the going concern assumption and 
viability is based on detailed cash flow and covenant forecasts. 
These are, in turn, underpinned by forecasts and assumptions in 
respect of:
 o production forecast for the next three years, based on the 
Group’s latest risked production forecast;
 o the oil price assumption of $30 (2016), $40 (Q1 2017) and aligned 
to the current forward curve thereafter;
 o opex and capex forecasts based on the approved 2016 budget 
and plan; and
 o other funding activities including certain asset portfolio 
activities.
The Board regularly reviews the liquidity projections of the Group. 
In the December Audit Committee meeting a draft of the viability 
statement and supporting liquidity analysis was presented by 
management. The detailed going concern and longer-term viability 
analysis, including sensitivity analysis and stress testing, and 
explanations and justifications for the key assumptions made were 
presented at the March Audit Committee meeting. The external 
auditors presented their findings on the conclusions drawn.
This analysis was considered and challenged, in detail, by the Audit 
Committee, including the appropriateness of the assumptions 
made. The wording in the Annual Report concerning the viability 
statement and going concern assumption (see pages 44 to 45) was 
reviewed and approved for recommendation to the Board.
Potential misstatement of oil and gas reserves
The Group has total proved and probable reserves at 31 December 
2015 of 216 MMboe (adjusted for the acquisition of a further 10.5% of 
Kraken from First Oil PLC, acquired 1 January 2016). The estimation of 
these reserves is essential to:
 o the value of the Company;
 o assessment of going concern;
 o impairment testing;
 o decommissioning liability estimates; and
 o calculation of depreciation.
In the March meeting, management presented the Group’s 2P 
reserves, together with the report from Gaffney Cline, our reserves 
auditor.
We considered the scope of the work performed by Gaffney Cline 
and their independence and objectivity. EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Governance 60
Significant financial statement reporting issue Consideration
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets
Significant capital expenditure is incurred on projects and the fair value of these 
projects is a significant area of judgement. At 31 December 2015, a total of $3.7 
billion had been capitalised in respect of oil and gas and other fixed assets, and 
$0.2 billion in respect of goodwill. The recovery of these amounts is dependent 
upon the expected cash flows of the underlying assets. 
Owing to the significant decline in the oil price, impairment testing has been 
performed resulting in an impairment of $1.2 billion of tangible oil and gas assets. 
These impairment tests are underpinned by assumptions regarding:
 o 2P reserves (as audited by Gaffney Cline);
 o oil price assumptions (forward curve until 2019 and $70 real thereafter);
 o life of field opex and capex; and
 o an asset specific discount rate driven by EnQuest’s weighted average cost of 
capital.
Management presented to the Committee, in 
the March meeting, the key assumptions made in 
respect of impairment testing, and the result thereof. 
The Committee considered and challenged these 
assumptions. Consideration was also given to EY’s 
view of the work performed by management.
Adequacy of the decommissioning provision
The Group’s decommissioning provision is carried at $507 million at 31 December 
2015, which is based on a discounted estimate of the future costs and timing 
of decommissioning the Group’s assets. Judgement exists in respect of the 
estimation of the costs involved, the discount rate assumed, and the timing 
of decommissioning activities.
In 2013 the Group commissioned Wood Group PSN to estimate the costs 
involved in decommissioning each of our operated fields and facilities, and a 
further evaluation of the Kittiwake costs completed in 2015. These estimates 
underpin the 2015 provision. 
The estimate for PM8 was also internally developed, but has been reviewed for 
reasonableness by a third party.
For Alba, our non-operated asset, the provision is based initially on the estimates 
provided by the operator, and adjusted as necessary by our own internal experts, 
to ensure consistency in key assumptions with our other North Sea assets.
We reviewed the report by management summarising 
the key findings and their impact on the provision. 
Regard was also given to the observations made by EY 
as to the appropriateness of the estimations made.
Tax
The Group carried deferred tax balances at 31 December 2015 totalling $1.3 billion 
of tax assets (primarily comprised of tax losses) and $1.2 billion of tax liabilities (after 
reducing the deferred tax liability by $0.6 billion following the asset impairments 
described above). 
The recoverability of the tax losses has then been assessed by reference to the tax 
projections derived from the Group’s impairment testing. A write off of $0.5 billion 
of tax losses ($0.25 billion net) has been recorded following this assessment.
Given the complexity of certain tax legislation, risk exists in respect of some of the 
Group’s tax positions.
We received a report by the Group’s Head of Tax, 
outlining all uncertain tax positions, and evaluated the 
technical arguments supporting the position taken by 
management. We also took into account the views of 
EY as to the adequacy of our tax balances.
Internal controls
The Code requires that the Board monitors the Company’s risk management and internal control systems and, at least annually, carries out and 
reports on the results of a review of their effectiveness. The Board has oversight of risk management within EnQuest, and page 22 provides 
more detail on how the Board, and its Risk Committee, has discharged its responsibility in this regard.
Responsibility in respect of internal controls is delegated to the Audit Committee. Key features of the Group’s internal control framework, 
the effectiveness of which is reviewed on an ongoing basis throughout the year, include:
 o Clear delegations of authorities to the Board and its sub-committees, and to each level of management;
 o HSE&A, operational and financial targets and budgets are set and monitored by management and the Board;
 o A comprehensive risk management process with clear definition of risk tolerance and appetite. This includes a review by the Risk 
Committee of the management controls/actions which mitigate or minimise the high-level risks, to ensure that they are in operation;
 o An annual risk-based internal audit plan developed in conjunction with management. Findings are communicated to the Audit Committee 
and follow up reviews are conducted where necessary; and
 o Further objective feedback is provided by the external auditors and other external specialists.

Internal audit
Since the flotation in 2010, the Group has outsourced its internal 
audit function and following a re-tender process in 2013 PwC were 
appointed to act as our internal auditors. The Committee remains 
satisfied that outsourcing this function, rather than building an 
in-house team, remains the most appropriate action for a company 
of this size. We will continue to keep this under review.
In respect of the work performed by the internal auditors, we set the 
internal audit plan each year. When setting the plan we consider 
recommendations from management, the internal auditors, and have 
consideration of the risks impacting the Company, which are 
reviewed by the Board and Risk Committee. During 2015 internal 
audit undertook various projects, including reviews of:
 o the appropriateness of the processes and controls in respect of 
the Group’s corporate model. This review was specifically 
requested by the Committee given the increased importance of 
accurate liquidity projections and stress testing in managing the 
Group’s financial position;
 o the inventory management controls and processes in place in 
the Group’s North Sea business unit;
 o the processes, controls and governance in place in respect of 
the Trading & Marketing function. This review was designed to 
understand whether the organisation was appropriately structured 
and the necessary processes and controls were in place to support 
the planned increase in activity following the commissioning of the 
Alma/Galia project;
 o the appropriateness of the finance processes and controls in 
respect of the Tanjong Baram Risk Service Contract in Malaysia, to 
ensure that the finance function was appropriate and complied 
with both PETRONAS’ and EnQuest’s requirements; and
 o a post implementation review of the Group’s new HR system 
which was implemented during 2014.
In all cases the audit conclusions were that the systems and processes 
were satisfactory. Where control enhancements were identified, the 
Committee ensured that appropriate action was being taken by 
management to implement any agreed improvements. 
External audit
One of the Committee’s key responsibilities is to monitor the 
performance, objectivity and independence of EY, EnQuest’s external 
auditor, who has been the Group’s auditor since 2010. Each year the 
Committee reviews and agrees the audit plan and the associated fees. 
The process for reviewing the performance of EY involves interviewing 
key members of the organisation who are involved in the audit 
process, on an annual basis, to obtain feedback as to the performance 
of the external auditors. Additionally, the Audit Committee members 
take into account their own view of the performance of EY when 
determining whether or not to recommend their reappointment. 
We formally evaluated the effectiveness of EY during our August 
meeting, and concluded that the Committee continues to be fully 
satisfied with the performance of EY, and that EY continues to be 
both objective and independent. In performing this evaluation, the 
Committee took account of the review of EY’s 2014 audit conducted 
by the Financial Reporting Council (‘FRC’). EY’s 2014 audit had been 
selected as part of the FRC’s annual Audit Quality Review, and the 
review focused on the quality of the audit work performed in respect 
of revenue recognition, oil and gas reserve estimates, impairment of 
assets and going concern. The Committee took comfort in the fact 
there were no findings that the Committee deemed significant. In 
evaluating the effectiveness of EY, the Committee considered the 
level of non-audit service fees provided by EY during the year, the 
compliance with our policy in respect of the provision of non-audit 
services by the auditor, and the safeguards in place to ensure 
continued independence and objectivity of EY. The Committee also 
took into account in this review the fact that the Committee Chairman 
is an ex-partner of EY.
In respect of audit tendering and rotation, the Committee has 
adopted a policy which complies with the proposed UK regulations 
and the requirements of the EU Audit Regulations. This policy requires 
an annual assessment of whether a tender is required on the basis of 
quality or independence, a mandatory tender after ten years, and 
rotation of audit firms at least every 20 years. As noted above, EY 
has been the Group’s auditor since 2010, and the external audit has 
not been tendered in this time. Following the results of the annual 
evaluation of EY, which included taking account of the rotation of the 
audit partner after the conclusion of the 2014 audit, a decision was 
taken to not tender the 2016 audit. While no rotation is required until 
2020, the Committee will continue to evaluate the appropriate time to 
conduct a tender. In recommending the reappointment of EY for 2016, 
the Committee took note of the reduction from the prior year in the 
absolute size of non-audit fees (from $296,000 in 2014 to $50,000 in 
2015 (representing less than 8% of the total audit fees of $626,000)). 
The ratio of non-audit fees to audit fees over the last three years is 
39%, which is below the 70% cap outlined in the Company’s new 
policy in respect of non-audit services provided by the auditors. 
Use of external auditors for non-audit services
The Audit Committee and Board believe that the external auditors’ 
independence and objectivity can potentially be affected by the 
level of non-audit services to EnQuest. However, the Committee 
acknowledges that certain work of a non-audit nature is best 
undertaken by the external auditor. To ensure objectivity and 
independence, and to reflect best practice in this area, the 
Committee has recently implemented a policy that adopts the EU 
Regulations to be introduced from 17 June 2016. As a consequence 
of this the Committee took the decision to discontinue using EY for 
tax services, other than in very unusual circumstances. From 2017 the 
external auditors will be prohibited from providing any tax services.
As part of the Committee’s process in respect of the provision of 
non-audit services, the external auditors provide the Committee 
with information about their policies and processes for maintaining 
independence and monitoring compliance with current regulatory 
requirements, including those regarding the rotation of audit partners 
and staff. EY confirmed their independence and objectivity.
The key features of the non-audit services policy, the full version of 
which is available on our website, are as follows:
 o a pre-defined list of prohibited services has been established;
 o a schedule of services where the Group may engage the external 
auditor has been established and agreed by the Committee; 
 o any non-audit project work which could impair the objectivity or 
independence of the external auditor may not be awarded to the 
external auditor; and
 o fees for permissible non-audit services provided by the external 
auditor for three consecutive years are to be capped at no more 
than 70% of the average Group audit fee for the preceding 
three years. 
Delegated authority by the Audit Committee for the approval of 
non-audit services by the external auditor is as follows:
Authoriser
Value of services per 
non-audit project
Chief Financial Officer Up to £50,000
Chairman of the Audit Committee Up to £100,000
Audit Committee Above £100,000
Raising concerns at work 
Throughout the year, a whistleblowing procedure, titled the ‘Speak 
Up’ reporting line, has been in place across the Group. This allows 
employees and contractors to confidentially raise any concerns 
about business practices through an independently appointed third 
party. Any concerns raised under these arrangements or otherwise 
are investigated promptly by the General Counsel and notified to 
the Chairman of the Audit Committee, with follow-up action being 
taken as soon as practicable thereafter. As noted on page 57 of 
the Corporate Governance Statement there have been a limited 
number of instances where such issues have been elevated and 
the Committee has been kept appraised of how these have 
been addressed.  EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015

2015 Bonus
The Executive Directors’ bonus awards are based on a combination 
of financial and operational results and the achievement of strategic 
and personal objectives. Awards of 61% of base salary (27% of 
maximum) for Amjad Bseisu and 119% of base salary for Jonathan 
Swinney (53% of maximum) have been made in respect of 2015 – 
partly paid in shares and subject to deferral. Further details of how 
these awards were determined are set out on pages 69 to 71. 
Despite the severe external challenges faced across the industry, 
the Committee considers these levels of awards to be appropriate 
for the good operational results and the extensive work on 
managing the Company’s financial position.
2013 Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) award
The 2013 PSP award, which had a three-year performance period 
ending 31 December 2015, vested at 76.6% of the maximum. Two of  
the three performance conditions were met in full (production growth 
per share and reserve growth per share), however only the threshold  
Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) measure was met. Details on the 
satisfaction of these performance conditions are included in the report.
Executive Director remuneration for 2016
Base salaries
For 2016, the base salaries of Amjad Bseisu and Jonathan Swinney 
have been frozen for the second year in a row in line with the general 
approach taken for all employees across the Company.
PSP
EnQuest’s policy is that award levels should vary from year to year 
based on Company and individual performance. For PSP awards 
made in 2016, relating to the 2015 performance year, the Committee 
felt that it was appropriate to grant levels of awards equivalent to 
156% of base salary for both Amjad Bseisu and Jonathan Swinney. 
These grants have been set at 78% of the normal maximum award 
and reflect the Committee’s view of Company performance in 2015.
The weightings of the performance conditions of the 2016 PSP 
awards have been amended to respond to the current circumstances 
of both the Company and the wider industry. The TSR target is being 
given greater emphasis and will have a weighting of 50% (previously 
30%). Converting 2P reserves into production and cash flow continues 
to be a strategic priority and will have a weighting of 40% (previously 
50%). The Company will continue to look to acquire new 2P reserves 
to replace production and this is being given a weighting of 10% 
(previously 20%).
The Committee encourages dialogue with the Company’s 
shareholders and will consult with major shareholders ahead of future 
changes to remuneration policy. It remains the Committee’s intention 
that the policy which shareholders approved at the 2014 AGM will 
remain in operation for the full three years and an updated policy 
will be presented to shareholders for approval at the 2017 AGM.
We are committed to transparent communication and I hope 
you find this report of the Committee’s work comprehensive, clear 
and understandable. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank 
shareholders for their continued support in this challenging time for 
the industry. I hope you will support the resolution to vote for this 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and look forward to receiving this 
at the forthcoming AGM.
Helmut Langanger
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee

Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board I am pleased to present EnQuest’s report on 
its remuneration policy and practice for the financial year ended 
31 December 2015. The report has three main sections:
1. Governance of remuneration at EnQuest.
2. The key elements of the Remuneration Policy which was 
approved by shareholders at the 2014 Annual General Meeting 
(‘AGM’) and took effect from January 2014. This sets out the 
policy for the remuneration of Directors for the current and 
forthcoming financial year.
3. The Remuneration Report of the Executive Directors and 
Non-Executive Directors during 2015 which will be subject to an 
advisory shareholder vote at the 2016 AGM.
The Remuneration Committee aims to ensure that the 
remuneration policy supports business strategy and the highest levels 
of performance and governance. The link between performance and 
reward is central to the remuneration philosophy throughout the 
Company, and the Committee believes that the current remuneration 
policy continues to meet these objectives, and for this reason, we are 
not proposing any changes to the policy for 2016.
Performance and reward for 2015
A strong underlying performance against certain key 
categories of the Company’s 2015 scorecard (Production, Financial, 
and progress of the Kraken Development) was in contrast to the 
delayed start-up of the Alma/Galia development and, in particular, 
to the further decline in the global price of oil; the latter having a 
significant negative impact on EnQuest’s share price and net 2P 
reserves. Management continue to take action in response to the 
decline in oil price by cutting operating and capital expenditures 
and managing the Company’s balance sheet.
Overall performance by the Company was assessed by the 
Remuneration Committee to be once again marginally below the 
challenging targets set by the Board. Remuneration outcomes for the 
Executive Directors reflect this level of performance but also, in the 
case of the Chief Financial Officer, take into account his significant 
contribution in protecting the Company’s financial position during a 
challenging period. EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Governance 63
GOVERNANCE AND APPROACH 
General governance
The Directors’ Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of 
the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) Regulations 2008 as amended in August 2013. It also 
describes the Group’s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the ‘Code’) in relation to remuneration. The Committee has 
taken account of the requirements for the disclosure of Directors’ 
remuneration and guidelines issued by major shareholder bodies 
when setting the remuneration strategy for the Company. 
Terms of reference
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on our website or 
on request. The remit of the Committee embraces the remuneration 
strategy and policy for the Executive Directors, senior management, 
and, in certain matters, for the whole Company. 
Meetings in 2015
The Committee normally meets at least twice per year. During 2015 
it met three times to review and discuss base salaries for Executive 
Directors, the setting of Company performance and related annual 
bonus for 2014, the satisfaction of performance conditions relating 
to the 2012 PSP and the approval of new share awards.

own remuneration.
REMUNERATION POLICY
This section sets out the principles behind our remuneration policies 
and the key elements of the remuneration policy for both the 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors that were approved by 
shareholders in May 2014.
The full policy is as disclosed in the 2013 Annual Report and 
Accounts with the key features incorporated in this report.
Remuneration principles
In determining the remuneration policy we reviewed our overall 
remuneration principles to ensure that they were aligned to our 
strategy. EnQuest’s strategic objective is to achieve sustainable 
growth by focusing on exploiting its existing reserves, 
commercialising and developing discoveries, converting contingent 
resources into reserves, and pursuing selective acquisitions.
We also want to ensure that we operate within the appropriate 
culture and, therefore, the principles support and reinforce the 
EnQuest values. Our principles are clear and simple, strengthen the 
link of reward for exceptional performance, as well as emphasise the 
importance of our values.
In summary, the principles underpinning our remuneration policy 
are that remuneration for Executive Directors should be:
1. aligned with shareholders’ interests;
2. fair, reflective of best practice, and market competitive;
3. comprise of fixed pay, currently set below the median and 
variable pay capable of delivering remuneration at upper 
quartile; and
4. reward performance with a balance of short-term and long-term 
elements.
Executive Directors
General approach
The remuneration of the Executive Directors comprises base salary, 
participation in an annual bonus plan (paid partly in cash and partly 
in deferred shares), a Long-Term Incentive Plan (PSP), private 
medical insurance, and cash, in lieu of pension and other benefits.
When setting remuneration for the Executive Directors, the 
Committee takes into account the performance and experience 
of the Director, as well as the Company performance, employment 
conditions for other employees in the Company, and the external 
marketplace. Data is obtained from a variety of independent sources. EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015

Remuneration outcomes in different performance scenarios
The charts set out an illustration of the remuneration arrangements in line with the remuneration policy described on pages 64 to 66. The 
charts provide an illustration of the proportion of total remuneration made up of each component of the remuneration policy and the value 
of each component.
Three scenarios have been illustrated for each Executive Director:
Below threshold performance o fixed remuneration;
 o zero annual bonus; and
 o no vesting under the PSP.
Target performance o fixed remuneration;
 o 100% of annual base salary as annual bonus; and 
 o 25% vesting under the PSP.
Maximum performance o fixed remuneration;
 o 225% of annual base salary as annual bonus; and
 o 100% vesting under the PSP.
Approach to recruitment remuneration
In the event that the Company appoints a new Executive Director either internally or externally, when determining appropriate 
remuneration arrangements, the Committee will take into consideration a number of factors (including, but not limited to, quantum relating 
to prior arrangements and the remuneration of other Executive Directors in the Company, appropriate benchmarks in the industry and the 
financial condition of the Company). This ensures that the arrangements are in the best interests of both the Company and its shareholders 
without paying more than is necessary to recruit an executive of the required calibre.
Salaries for new hires (including internal promotions) will be set to reflect their skills and experience, the Company’s intended pay 
positioning and the market rate for the role. If it is considered appropriate to appoint a new Executive Director on a below market salary 
initially (for example, to allow them to gain experience in the role) their salary may be increased to a market level over a number of years by 
way of a series of increases above the general rate of wage growth in the Group and inflation.
The ongoing remuneration package for a new Executive Director would be set in accordance with the remuneration package offered with 
the terms of the Company’s approved remuneration policy at the time. Different performance measures may be set for the year of joining 
the Board for the annual bonus, taking into account the individual’s role and responsibilities and the point in the year the executive joined.
Benefits and pensions for new appointees to the Board will normally be provided in line with those offered to other Executive Directors and 
employees taking account of local market practice, with relocation expenses/arrangements provided for if necessary. Tax equalisation may 
also be considered if an executive is adversely affected by taxation due to their employment with EnQuest. Legal fees and other relevant 
costs and expenses incurred by the individual may also be paid by the Company.
The Committee may make additional awards on appointing an Executive Director to ‘buy-out’ remuneration arrangements forfeited on 
leaving a previous employer. Any such payments would be based solely on remuneration lost when leaving the former employer and would 
reflect (as far as practicable) the delivery mechanism, time horizons and performance requirement attaching to that remuneration. The 
Group’s existing incentive arrangements will be used to the extent possible (subject to the relevant plan limits), although awards may also 
be granted outside of these schemes, if necessary, and as permitted under the Listing Rules.
In the case of an internal hire, any outstanding variable pay awarded in relation to the previous role will be allowed to pay out according to 
its terms of grant.
On the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director, the fees will be set taking into account the experience and calibre of 
the individual.  EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015

Service contracts
Amjad Bseisu and Jonathan Swinney entered into service agreements with the Company which are terminable by either party giving not 
less than 12 months’ written notice. The Company may terminate their employment without giving notice by making a payment equal to the 
aggregate of the Executive Director’s basic salary and the value of any contractual benefits for the notice period including any accrued but 
untaken holiday. Such payments may be paid monthly and/or subject to mitigation.

Amjad Bseisu 22 February 2010 12 months

Policy on payment for loss of office
The Company’s policy is for all Executive Directors to have contracts of service which can be terminated by either the Director concerned 
or the Company on giving 12 months’ notice of termination. In the event of termination by the Company (other than as a result of a change 
of control), the Executive Directors would be entitled to loss of basic salary and cash benefit allowance for the notice period. Such payments 
may be made monthly and would be subject to mitigation. Depending on the circumstances of termination, the Executive Directors may be 
entitled, or the Remuneration Committee may exercise its discretion to allow the Executive Directors, to receive a pro-rated proportion of their 
outstanding awards under the long-term share incentive plans. Vesting would normally take place at the end of the original vesting period. 
Where Executive Directors leave the Company with good leaver status, and they have an entitlement to unvested shares granted under the 
PSP, the performance conditions associated with each award outstanding would remain in place and are typically tested at the end of the 
original performance period. Shares would typically then vest on their original due date in proportion to the satisfied performance 
conditions and are normally pro-rated for time.
Annual bonuses would not typically be paid to Executive Directors when leaving the Company; however, in good leaver circumstances the 
Committee has the discretion to pay a pro-rated bonus in cash, in consideration for performance targets achieved in the year. Deferred 
bonus shares held by good leavers may, at the Committee’s discretion, vest on a pro-rata basis. 
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts but their terms are set out in a letter of appointment. Their terms of appointment 
may be terminated by either party giving three months’ notice in writing. During the notice period the Non-Executive Director will continue to 
receive their normal fee. EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015

employment. 
2 PSP awarded on 29 April 2013 vested on 29 April 2016. The LTIP value shown in the 2015 single figure is calculated by taking the number of performance shares that 
have vested (76.6% of the performance conditions were achieved) multiplied by the average value of the EnQuest share price between 1 October 2015 and 
31 December 2015, as the share price on 29 April 2016 was not known at the time of this report.
3 Cash in lieu of pension and other benefits.
4 PSP awarded on 19 April 2012 vested on 19 April 2015. The LTIP value shown in the 2014 single figure is calculated by taking the number of performance shares that 
have vested (79.4% of the performance conditions were achieved) multiplied by the share price on that date. The equivalent number in the 2014 report was estimated 
using the average value of the EnQuest share price between 1 October 2014 and 31 December 2014, as the share price on 19 April 2015 was not known at the time of 
that report.

Base salary and 2016 pay review
As stated in the annual statement to this report, the remuneration for the Executive Directors is geared towards variable pay, with base 
salaries currently set around the lower quartile benchmark for the oil and gas industry and comparable sized companies. In the view of the 
Committee it is therefore important to ensure that the base salaries of the Executive Directors are reviewed annually and that any increase 
reflects the change in scale and complexity of the role as the Company grows as well as the performance of the Executive Director.
The table below shows the change to salaries for 2016:
Name Salary for 2015 Salary for 2016 % increase

Annual bonus
The annual bonus scheme for 2016 is unchanged in terms of structure:
 o Executive Directors (and other executive management) will have threshold, target and stretch performance levels performance 
objectives attributed to key performance objectives;
 o Amjad Bseisu’s bonus will be determined solely by the performance of the Company. Jonathan Swinney’s will include a modifier based 
upon individual performance;
 o maximum levels of award for the Executive Directors can be up to 225% of annual base salary applicable in the year of performance; and
 o stretching targets continue to apply at maximum.
The 2016 metrics and weightings, which will determine the level of short-term incentive awards for the Directors are set out below:
Company 2016 performance measures scorecard

Financial targets 30%
Net debt 20%

1 Precise targets are commercially sensitive and are not being disclosed at this time.
2 Performance in Health, Safety, Environment and Assurance is central to EnQuest’s overall results. This category is used as an overlay on overall Company performance.

The choice of performance targets for 2016, and their respective weightings, reflects the Committee’s belief that any short-term annual 
bonus should be tied both to the overall performance of the Company and the individual’s performance. 
The annual bonus model used for the Executive Directors, and all employees in the Company, is shown below. 
Company Individual
Performance level Multiplier Individual performance Multiplier

Consideration by the Directors of matters relating to Directors’ remuneration
During 2015, New Bridge Street (part of Aon plc) continued to provide advice to the Remuneration Committee on appropriate types and 
levels of award for the Directors. New Bridge Street had been selected by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee during 2013 on 
the basis of previous experience and marketplace reputation.
The Committee satisfied itself that the advice given was objective and independent by reviewing it against other companies in EnQuest’s 
comparator group. New Bridge Street is also a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants Group (‘RCG’) Code of Conduct which sets out 
guidelines for managing conflicts of interest. New Bridge Street does not provide any other services to the Company. The fees paid to New 
Bridge Street totalled £22,130 (excluding VAT) and were charged on the basis of the number of hours worked.

Nomination Committee 
Report
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present to you the report of the work of the 
Nomination Committee during 2015.
We were delighted to welcome Philip Holland to the Board in 
August, having recommended his appointment following a robust 
recruitment process which we outlined in our 2014 report. Philip 
immediately undertook an effective induction programme to ensure 
that he would become a valued contributor to our Board and 
Committees as quickly as possible.
A further significant area of work undertaken by the Nomination 
Committee during 2015 was an external evaluation of the Board’s 
effectiveness. I am pleased to report that the review found the 
Board to be functional and well governed and some of the specific 
outcomes are incorporated within this report.
The core work of the Nomination Committee is to ensure that the 
Board has the appropriate balance of skills, expertise and experience 
in order to support the strategy of the Company. We achieve this by 
continuously reviewing the Board composition and skills and ensuring 
that strong succession planning is in place. Currently the Board 
consists of six Non-Executive Directors and two Executive Directors, 
who collectively bring a diverse mix of skills and experience to the 
Company and collaborate to form a strong leadership. During 2015 
the Board has been further strengthened by bringing in significant 
experience of capital projects via the appointment of Philip Holland. 
The Committee has spent additional time during the last year on 
succession planning for the Board; including planning the phasing of 
specific retirements of the Non-Executive Directors, ensuring their 
continued independence, and also considering diversity issues.
As well as looking at the composition of the Board in its entirety, 
the Committee also undertook particularly rigorous reviews of those 
Directors who had reached their sixth anniversary. Helmut Langanger, 
Jock Lennox, and I all underwent reviews in accordance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’).
Over the next few years we shall continue to focus on succession 
planning of both the Executive and Non-Executive Directors, to 
ensure that we have effective plans in place and continue to have a 
broad mix of skills and expertise within the Board.
Dr James Buckee

Nomination Committee membership
During 2015, the Nomination Committee membership was 
compressed following a recommendation from the externally 
facilitated Board effectiveness review that membership of Board 
Committees should be limited.
The revised membership of the Nomination Committee, together with 
appointment dates and attendance at meetings, is set out below:

Amjad Bseisu 22 February 2010 1/1
Helmut Langanger 16 March 2010 1/1
Main responsibilities
The main responsibilities of the Committee are to: 
 o review the size, structure and composition of the Board in order 
to recommend changes to the Board and to ensure the orderly 
succession of Directors;
 o formalise succession planning and the process for new Director 
appointments;
 o identify, evaluate and recommend candidates for appointment as 
Directors taking into account the balance of knowledge, skills 
and experience required to serve the Board; and
 o keep under review the outside directorships and time 
commitments expected from the Non-Executive Directors.
The Nomination Committee’s full terms of reference can be found 
on the Company’s website, www.enquest.com, under Corporate 
Governance. 
Appointment of Directors
We apply a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure 
for appointments of new Directors to the Board, and ensure 
independence by using an external consultancy services firm, 
which has no connection with the Company. The Committee 
thoroughly reviews each candidate in terms of the balance of skills, 
knowledge and level of independence they would bring to the Board. 
The Committee also gives careful consideration to other existing 
commitments a candidate may have and whether they will be able 
to devote the appropriate amount of time in order to fully meet what 
is expected of them. Once the Committee has identified a suitable 
candidate a recommendation is made to the Board for appointment.
Committee activities during the year
The Nomination Committee met once in 2015 and its key activities 
included: 
 o Succession planning – The Committee focused on succession 
planning in order to specifically ensure that effective planning 
is being undertaken in regard to the phasing of Non-Executive 
Director retirements. The Company will reach its ninth 
anniversary in 2019 and work is currently underway to ensure that 
proper planning is in place so that all Non-Executive Directors 
are independent. The Nomination Committee also focused on 
the succession of senior management, to ensure that the Board, 
and principally the Chief Executive, remain fully supported in the 
implementation of the Company strategy. The Board and 
Nomination Committee remain satisfied that the individuals 
currently fulfilling key senior management positions in the Group 
have the requisite depth and breadth of skills, knowledge and 
experience to ensure that orderly succession to the Board and 
Executive Committee can take place. We will continue to work 
closely with the Chief Executive and the HR Director to ensure 
that we are recruiting and developing Board members and 
Executive Management with all of these attributes. 
 o Skills and expertise analysis – We conducted an analysis 
of Board skills and experience during this period to identify 
any potential gaps, the results of which are outlined below. We 
are pleased to report that following the appointment of Philip 
Holland during 2015, the Board and Nomination Committee 
remain satisfied that we have the correct balance of skills, 
expertise and experience needed in order to effectively 
support the Company’s objectives and strategy. During 2016, 
the Committee will commence the search for a future Chair of the 
Audit Committee in order that the Board has the necessary skills 
and experience in place to facilitate an effective transition from 
the current Committee Chairman upon retirement.
 o Establishment of a Risk Committee – During the year, 
the Board adopted a recommendation to create a Risk sub-
Committee. The role of the Committee will be to advise the 
Board on the Company’s overall risk appetite, risk exposures and 
future risk strategy, oversight of the Company’s risk processes, 
and to monitor any large exposures and/or certain risk types.

Oil and gas experience 80%
Engineering 65%
Finance 20%
Capital markets 20%
Regulatory and governance 15%
HSE&A 70%
Operational and strategic 95%
Priorities for the coming year
The main focus of the Committee in 2016 will be to actively manage 
the succession of the Non-Executive Directors to ensure that they 
continue to be independent and of the highest possible calibre. The 
Company is in the process of appointing a reputable executive search 
firm, to support the identification of suitably qualified candidates that 
can contribute strategically to the Board based upon their skills, 
leadership and experience.
Other priorities include continuing to review the effectiveness of 
senior management in ensuring that the Company’s organisation 
has both the necessary capacity and capabilities in delivering its 
principal activities. EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Governance 78
Boardroom diversity
The Board continues to follow the progress made with regard to the 
recommendations of the 2011 Lord Davies report ‘Women on Boards’, 
and took these into account when developing our policy on gender 
diversity. Currently the Board consists of two Executive Directors 
and six Non-Executive Directors. Seven of the members are male and 
one is female. The Board’s policy continues to be that while we will 
work hard to ensure that we recruit from a diverse background of 
candidates, not just in relation to gender, we will continue to recruit 
the best candidate available for the job, without the Board’s decision 
being influenced by a need to fulfil certain quotas. We believe that 
our gender statistics are representative of the demographics of the 
wider oil and gas industry.

Re-election to the Board
Following a formal review of the effectiveness of the Board, 
the Nomination Committee confirms that it is satisfied with the 
performance and of the time commitment of each Non-Executive 
Director throughout the year. We remain confident that each of 
them is in a position to discharge their duties to the Company in the 
coming year and to continue to bring the necessary skills required 
to the Board. Detailed biographies for each Director, including their 
skills and external appointments, can be found on pages 48 and 49.
Conflicts of interest
The Board operates a policy to identify and, where appropriate, 
manage conflicts or potential conflicts of interest with the Company’s 
interests. In accordance with the Directors’ interest provisions in the

All the current Directors served throughout the year, except for 
Philip Holland, who was appointed with effect from 1 August 2015.
All the Directors will offer themselves for election or re-election 
at the AGM on 1 June 2016, in accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code provision for annual re-election of all the directors 
of FTSE 350 companies, except for Clare Spottiswoode who is not 
offering herself for re-election and will retire at the conclusion of the 
AGM. Philip Holland was appointed to the Board during the year and 
will therefore seek election by shareholders for the first time. 
Employee involvement
EnQuest operates a framework for employee information 
and consultation which complies with the requirements of the 
Information and Consultation of Employees Regulation 2005. 
Employees are informed about significant business issues and 
other matters of concern via regular Town Hall meetings, by using 
webcasts on EnQuest’s intranet, as well as face-to-face briefing 
meetings at each business location. Appropriate consultations 
take place with employees when business change is undertaken. 
EnQuest offers employees the opportunity to participate directly 
in the success of the Company and employees are encouraged to 
invest in the Company through participation in a number of share 
schemes such as the Save as You Earn (‘SAYE’) Share Scheme. 
 
EnQuest remains committed to fair treatment of people 
with disabilities in relation to job applications: full consideration is 
given to applications from disabled persons where the candidate’s 
particular aptitudes and abilities are consistent with adequately 
meeting the requirement of the job. Additionally, EnQuest 
offers opportunities to disabled employees for training, career 
development and promotion. In the event of an existing employee 
becoming disabled, it is EnQuest’s policy to provide continuing 
employment whenever practicable in the same or an alternative 
position and to provide appropriate training to achieve this aim.

Greenhouse gas (‘GHG’) emissions
EnQuest has reported on all of the emission sources within its 
operational control required under the Companies Act 2006 
(Strategic Report and Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013. These 
sources fall within the EnQuest consolidated financial statement. 
EnQuest has used the principles of the GHG Protocol Corporate 
Accounting and Reporting Standard (revised edition), ISO 14064-1 
and data gathered to fulfil the requirements under the 
‘Environmental Reporting Guidelines: Including Mandatory 
Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reporting Guidance’ June 2013.
The Mandatory Carbon Reporting (‘MCR’) report includes assets 
which are in the operational control of EnQuest. These are:
 o Heather Alpha;
 o Thistle Alpha;
 o Northern Producer Floating Production Facility (‘FPF’);
 o Kittiwake;
 o Enquest Producer FPF;
 o PM8/Seligi & Tanjong Baram (Malaysia);
 o drilling rigs under the control of EnQuest for exploration and 
appraisal purposes; and
 o all land based offices.
All six greenhouse gases are reported as appropriate. 
Note: All assets within operational control are reported for MCR purposes. Due to 
source data not being readily available for verification, all Malaysian assets (PM8/
Seligi, Tanjong Baram assets and associated land based offices) are reported 
outside the scope of ISO 14064-1 verification.

Where BOE = barrel of oil equivalent.
EnQuest has a number of financial interests, e.g. joint ventures and 
joint investments, for which it does not have operational control. 
Hence, the boundary for emissions within EnQuest’s operational 
control is different to the financial boundary. In line with MCR 
guidance this is fully disclosed.
EnQuest has voluntarily opted to have the emissions reported 
within the MCR scope verified to the internationally recognised 
ISO 14064-1 standard by a UKAS accredited verification body. This 
increases the robustness of the reported emissions and provides the 
reader with more confidence in the stated figures. This goes beyond 
the minimum requirements of the guidance. As indicated above, 
Malaysia is not included within the ISO 14064-1 verification scope.

Credit Facility Agreement, which includes provisions that, upon a 
change of control, permit each lender not to provide certain funding 
under that facility and to cancel its exposure to credit which may 
already have been advanced to the Company; (b) the Company’s 
Euro Medium Term Note Programme (under which the Company 
currently has in issue euro medium term notes with an aggregate 
nominal amount of £155 million), pursuant to which if there is a 
change of control of the Company, a holder of a note has the 
option to require the Company to redeem such note at its principal 
amount, together with any accrued interest thereon; and (c) under 
the indenture governing the high-yield bonds, if the Company 
undergoes certain events defined as constituting a change of 
control, each holder of the high-yield notes may require us to 
repurchase all or a portion of its notes at 101% of their principal 
amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in 
Relation to the Group Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable United 
Kingdom law and regulations. Company law requires the Directors 
to prepare Group financial statements for each financial year. Under 
that law, the Directors are required to prepare Group financial 
statements under International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union.
Under Company law the Directors must not approve the Group 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and of the profit or 
loss of the Group for that period. In preparing the Group financial 
statements the Directors are required to:
 o present fairly the financial position, financial performance and 
cash flows of the Group;
 o select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8: 
Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors 
and then apply them consistently;
 o present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information;
 o make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
 o provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the Group’s financial position and financial 
performance; and
 o state that the Group has complied with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Group and enable them to ensure that the 
Group financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 
and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The Directors are also responsible for preparing the Strategic 
Report, Directors’ Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and 
the Corporate Governance Statement in accordance with 
Companies Act 2006 and applicable regulations, including the 
requirements of the Listing Rules and the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules.
Fair, balanced and understandable
In accordance with the principles of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the Directors are responsible for establishing arrangements 
to evaluate whether the information presented in the Annual Report, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy, and 
making a statement to that effect. This statement is set out on

Overview of our audit approach
Risks of material 
misstatement
 o Going concern
 o Impairment of the carrying value of tangible and intangible assets (including goodwill)
 o Estimates of Oil & Gas reserves
 o Complexity of the deferred taxation calculation
Audit scope o We performed an audit of the complete financial information of two components (North Sea and Malaysia)
 o The components where we performed full or specific audit procedures accounted for 100% of Loss before tax, 
100% of Revenue and 100% of Total assets.
Materiality o Overall Group materiality of $9m which represents 2% of earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and 
amortisation (EBITDA).
Our assessment of risk of material misstatement
We identified the risks of material misstatement described below as those that had the greatest effect on our overall audit strategy, the 
allocation of resources in the audit and the direction of the efforts of the audit team. In addressing these risks, we have performed the 
procedures below which were designed in the context of the financial statements as a whole and, consequently, we do not express any 
opinion on these individual areas. Financials 84

Independent Auditor’s Report  
to the Members of EnQuest PLC continued
(Registered Number: 07140891)
Risk Our response to the risk What we concluded to the Audit Committee
Going concern (including the effect of oil 
prices, bank covenants and projections)
Refer to the Audit Committee Report 
(page 59); Accounting policies (page 95); and 
Note 2 of the Annual Report and Accounts 
(page 95).
With the current low oil price environment, 
coupled with the current bank facility and 
retail bond covenants, there is a heightened 
awareness around going concern, in 
particular future projections of cash flows, oil 
prices and reserves.
The risk has increased in the current year 
due to the sustained low oil prices through 
the period, the continued capital 
expenditure on major projects and the limits 
on currently available borrowing facilities.
We performed procedures to understand 
management’s going concern review process. 
Our audit procedures included:
 o agreeing the assumed cash flows to the 
business plan and walking through the 
business planning process and testing the 
central assumptions to external data;
 o agreeing the available facilities and 
arrangements to underlying 
documentation;
 o auditing key assumptions used by 
management including oil price, 
production, future cost projections 
and reserves;
 o assessing and auditing the sensitivities of 
the underlying assumptions used in the 
going concern review and considering 
whether management has exercised any 
bias in selecting such assumptions;
 o auditing the assumption and mitigating 
factors that management have made with 
regards to potential actions to mitigate 
forecast liquidity shortfalls in future 
periods; and
 o comparing future cash flows to historical 
data, ensuring variations are in line with 
our expectations and considering the 
reliability of past forecasts.
In our view management’s conclusion that 
EnQuest PLC is a going concern is 
appropriate.
Management have undertaken a detailed 
analysis and considered appropriately 
challenging scenarios in making this 
conclusion.
We have also concluded that management 
have made appropriate disclosures 
discussing the risks and assumptions 
associated with this conclusion.
Impact of the estimation of the quantity 
of oil and gas reserves on impairment 
testing, depreciation, depletion and 
amortisation, decommissioning provisions 
and the going concern assessment (Fraud 
Risk) 
Refer to the Audit Committee Report  
(page 59); Accounting policies (page 97);  
and Note 2 of the Annual Report and 
Accounts (page 97).
The estimation of oil and gas reserves 
requires significant judgment and 
assumptions by management and engineers 
which could be manipulated to achieve 
desired results. These estimates have a 
material impact on the financial statements, 
particularly impairment testing; depreciation, 
depletion and amortisation; decommissioning 
provisions and going concern.
There is technical uncertainty in assessing 
reserve quantities and complex contractual 
arrangements dictating EnQuest’s share of 
reserves, particularly the PSAs and RSAs and 
joint venture arrangements in place. We will 
focus on management’s estimation process 
including whether bias exists in the 
determination of reserves and resources.
The risk has remained the same compared to 
last year.
Our audit procedures have focused on 
management’s estimation process, including 
whether bias exists in the determination 
of reserves. 
We carried out procedures to understand and 
walkthrough EnQuest’s internal process for oil 
and gas reserves estimation.
We assessed the competence of 
internal specialists and the competence 
and objectivity of external specialists. We also 
reviewed the report of the external specialist 
on the audit of the reserves for the UK 
North Sea and Malaysia assets as at 
31 December 2015.
We considered whether management had 
exercised any bias in assumption used or the 
outputs produced by the reserves estimation 
exercise.
We used the results of these procedures 
to inform our audit of asset impairment 
testing, the calculation of depreciation, 
depletion and amortisation, the calculation of 
decommissioning provisions, the assessment 
of going concern and reserve disclosures in 
the Annual Report and Accounts.
We have concluded that the estimation of oil 
and gas reserves are in line with appropriate 
methodology and guidelines, and have been 
determined on a reasonable basis through 
the use of competent internal experts and 
objective and competent external parties. Financials 85
EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Risk Our response to the risk What we concluded to the Audit Committee
Impairment of the carrying value of 
tangible ($2,437 million) and intangible 
assets (including goodwill) ($236 million) 
Refer to the Audit Committee Report 
(page 60); Accounting policies (page 99); and 
Notes 10, 11 and 12 of the Annual Report and 
Accounts (pages 113 to 115).
The fall in forward oil and gas prices 
creates an indicator of impairment, which 
potentially could impact the carrying values 
of the assets.
Accounting standards require management 
to assess whether indicators of impairment 
exist. Where indicators exist management 
must carry out an impairment test.
The risk has remained the same compared to 
last year where falling prices also resulted in 
impairment charges being recorded.
The principal indicator of impairment was the 
decline in the forward oil price.
In assessing the appropriateness of 
management’s oil price assumptions, we 
have compared their price assumptions 
with the latest market evidence available, 
including forward curves, brokers’ estimates 
and other long-term price forecasts.
We carried out procedures to understand 
and walkthrough EnQuest PLC’s process 
for identifying impairment triggers, and 
considered management’s assessment of 
indicators of impairment. 
We challenged management’s assessment of 
impairment indicators and whether or not a 
formal impairment test was required. 
Where a formal impairment test 
was necessary, we challenged and 
audited management’s assumptions 
and sensitivities. This included specifically 
the determination of cash generating units, 
cash flow projections, oil prices, production 
profiles, capital and operating expenditure, 
discount rates and sensitivities used. In 
addition we engaged our business modelling 
and valuation specialists to assist us in the 
audit of the impairment charge. 
We performed detailed audit procedures 
on the impairment test models including 
goodwill, intangibles, comparison to historical 
data and past reliability of forecasts, including 
considering whether management had used 
bias in setting assumptions to achieve a 
certain outcome. 
We also used the result of procedures 
performed in relation to estimation of oil and 
gas reserves and depletion calculations. 
We performed full and specific scope 
audit procedures over this risk area in two 
locations, which covered 100% of the 
risk amount.
There are a number of factors which have 
an impact on the impairment charge. The 
impairment charge recorded is particularly 
sensitive to both future oil prices and 
discount rates.
In our view the combination of price 
and discount rate assumptions used by 
management are appropriate given current 
market conditions.
In addition, the future cost assumptions 
and production profiles are appropriate.
Consequently, we believe the impairment 
charge of $1,224 million is also appropriate 
and intangible assets ($2 million) is also 
appropriate.  Financials 86
EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Risk Our response to the risk What we concluded to the Audit Committee
Complexity of the deferred taxation 
calculation Deferred Tax expense $593 
million (2014: $408 million); Deferred Tax 
Assets $139 million (2014: $41 million); 
and Deferred Tax Liabilities $59 million 
(2014: $517 million)
Refer to the Audit Committee Report 
(page 60); Accounting policies (page 103); 
and Note 7 of the Annual Report and 
Accounts (page 111).
The calculation of the deferred tax balances, 
particularly given the recent change in oil 
and gas taxation legislation in relation to 
investment allowances (previously field 
allowances), involves complex estimates 
which increase the risk of incorrectly 
recording deferred tax.
The risk has increased in the current year 
due to the increased complexity relating to 
investment allowances and was not 
previously included within our report.
We carried out procedures to understand and 
walkthrough EnQuest PLC’s tax accounting 
process including the approach to calculating 
deferred tax.
We made enquiries of appropriate personnel 
to understand the process undertaken to 
calculate deferred tax and any assumptions/
changes in the approach during the year.
We obtained and audited the deferred tax 
calculation to agree the clerical accuracy, 
ensured that the assumptions used were in 
line with expectations and that the calculation 
and recognition was in line with IAS 12.
We performed analytical review procedures 
and understood any significant movements 
that were not consistent with our 
expectations.
We challenged and audited support for the 
recoverability of material deferred tax assets.
We considered management’s 
interpretation and application of relevant 
tax law and challenged the appropriateness 
of management’s assumptions and estimates 
in relation to deferred taxation and uncertain 
tax positions.
To assist us in assessing a number of 
uncertain tax positions, we engaged our tax 
specialists to advise us on the tax technical 
issues in order to form a view of the risk of 
challenge to certain tax treatments adopted.
We performed full and specific scope 
audit procedures over this risk area in 
two locations, which covered 100% of the 
risk amount.
No issues have been noted in relation to the 
calculation of deferred taxation amounts and 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets.
In the prior year, our auditor’s report included a risk of material misstatement in relation to Decommissioning and Uncertain Tax Positions. 
This year we did not consider that these risks merited separate commentary in our report as, whilst remaining a risk of misstatement, we did 
not consider there to be a high likelihood of a material misstatement.
The scope of our audit
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for each 
entity within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take into account 
size, risk profile, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of group-wide controls, changes in the business environment and other 
factors such as recent Internal Audit results when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of 
significant accounts in the financial statements, of the two reporting components of the Group, we selected both components covering 
entities within the United Kingdom and Malaysia, which represent the principal business units within the Group.
Of the two components selected, we performed an audit of the complete financial information of one component (‘full scope components’) 
which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. For the remaining component (‘specific scope component’), we performed 
audit procedures on specific accounts within that component that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the 
significant accounts in the financial statements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile. 
The reporting components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 100% (2014: 100%) of the Group’s EBITDA, 100% (2014: 
100%) of the Group’s Revenue and 100% (2014: 100%) of the Group’s Total assets. For the current year, the full scope components 
contributed 91% (2014: 98%) of the Group’s EBITDA, 87% (2014: 95%) of the Group’s Revenue and 95% (2014: 94%) of the Group’s Total

assets. The specific scope component contributed 9% (2014: 2%) of the Group’s EBITDA, 13% (2014: 5%) of the Group’s Revenue and 5% 
(2014: 6%) of the Group’s Total assets. The audit scope of these components may not have included testing of all significant accounts of the 
component but will have contributed to the coverage of significant accounts tested for the Group.
Involvement with component teams 
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the 
components by us, as the primary audit engagement team, or by component auditors from other EY global network firms operating under 
our instruction. Of the one full scope component, audit procedures were performed directly by the primary audit team. For the one specific 
scope component, where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the appropriate level of involvement to enable 
us to determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group as a whole.
For the first time the Senior Statutory auditor visited Malaysia due to the increased activity levels. This visit involved discussing the audit 
approach with the component team, meeting with local management and attending a planning meeting with local management and the 
component team. The primary team interacted regularly with the component teams where appropriate during various stages of the audit 
including discussing any issues arising from their work, reviewed key working papers and were responsible for the scope and direction of 
the audit process. This, together with the additional procedures performed at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion 
on the Group financial statements.
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit 
and in forming our audit opinion. 
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit 
procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be $9 million (2014: $10.5 million), which is 2% (2014: 5%) of EBITDA (2014: business 
performance before taxation). We believe that EBITDA provides us with the most appropriate basis to use as this is the key performance 
indicator used by management, it is the main performance measure used in the covenant calculations associated with the company’s debt 
and is the measure most focussed on by stakeholders. In prior years we have used profit before tax (PBT) as a basis for materiality and we 
considered this for 2015. With the impact of falling prices in the oil and gas industry PBT is becoming more volatile and the focus for 
stakeholders (based on communications to the market) has been increasingly based on more cash based measures as pressure grows on 
companies in the lower oil price environment.  Financials 88
EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the 
probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement was that 
performance materiality was 50% (2014: 50%) of our planning materiality, namely $4.5m (2014: $5.25m). 
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken 
based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale 
and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component. In the current year, 
the range of performance materiality allocated to components was $4m to $0.9m (2014: $5.25m to $1m).
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We collated errors in excess of $0.45m, which is set at 5% of planning materiality, and we agreed with the Audit Committee that we would 
report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of $0.75m (2014: $0.75m), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our 
view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other 
relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report and Accounts 2015 to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based 
on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 82, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on 
the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 o the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; 
and
 o the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements.

threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
 o the disclosures in the annual report that describe those risks and explain how they 
are being managed or mitigated;
 o the Directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether they considered 
it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, 
and their identification of any material uncertainties to the entity’s ability to 
continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of 
approval of the financial statements; and
 o the Directors’ explanation in the annual report as to how they have assessed the 
prospects of the entity, over what period they have done so and why they consider 
that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a 
reasonable expectation that the entity will be able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any 
related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
The Directors have 
included appropriate 
disclosures setting out 
the basis of the going

and the prospects of 
the entity, the 
conclusion drawn and 
the actions required.

by the European Union as they apply to the financial statements of 
the Group for the year ended 31 December 2015 and applied in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006. The accounting policies 
which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the 
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015.
The Group financial information has been prepared on a historical 
cost basis. The presentation currency of the Group financial 
information is United States dollars and all values in the Group 
financial information are rounded to the nearest thousand (US$’000) 
except where otherwise stated.
Going concern concept
The Directors’ assessment of going concern concludes that the use 
of the going concern basis is appropriate and there are no material 
uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the ability of the 
Group to continue as a going concern. See page 44 in the Financial 
Review for further details. 
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the sole right 
to exercise control over the operations and govern the financial 
policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than half of 
the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights 
that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when 
assessing the Group’s control. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated 
from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are 
de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
Intercompany profits, transactions and balances are eliminated on 
consolidation. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been 
changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies 
adopted by the Group.
Unincorporated jointly controlled assets
Oil and gas operations are conducted by the Group as co-licensees 
in unincorporated joint ventures with other companies. The Group’s 
financial statements reflect the relevant proportions of production, 
capital costs, operating costs and current assets and liabilities of the 
joint venture applicable to the Group’s interests. The Group’s 
current joint venture interests are detailed on page 34.
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition 
method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate 
of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair 
value and the amount of any controlling interest in the acquiree. 
For each business combination, the acquirer measures the non-
controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the 
proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Those 
petroleum reserves and resources that are able to be reliably valued 
are recognised in the assessment of fair values on acquisition. Other 
potential reserves, resources and rights, for which fair values cannot 
be reliably determined, are not recognised.
If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate 
consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses whether it has 
correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities 
assumed and reviewed the procedures used to measure the amounts 
to be recognised at the acquisition date, if the reassessment still 
results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the 
aggregate consideration transferred then the gain is recognised in 
profit or loss.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer 
will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Contingent 
consideration classified as an asset or liability that is a financial 
instrument and within the scope of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement, is measured at fair value with 
changes in fair value recognised either in profit or loss, or as a 
change to other comprehensive income (OCI). If the contingent 
consideration is not within the scope of IAS 39, it is measured at 
fair value in accordance with the appropriate IFRS. Contingent 
consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured and 
subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
New standards and interpretations
The Group has adopted new and revised IFRS’s that are relevant 
to its operations and effective for accounting periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2015. The principal effects of the adoption of 
these new and amended standards and interpretations are 
discussed below:
Annual Improvements 2010-2012 Cycle
With the exception of the improvement relating to IFRS 2 Share-
based Payment applied to share-based payment transactions with 
a grant date on or after 1 July 2014, all other improvements are 
effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2014. 
None of the improvements had any impact on the Group’s financial 
statements nor accounting policies.
Annual Improvements 2011-2013 Cycle
These improvements are effective from 1 July 2014. They had 
no impact on the Group’s financial statements nor the 
accounting policies.
Standards issued but not yet effective
Standards issued and relevant to the Group, but not yet effective up 
to the date of issuance of the Group’s financial statements, are listed 
below. This listing is of standards and interpretations issued, which 
the Group reasonably expects to be applicable at a future date. The 
Group intends to adopt these standards when they become effective. 
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards 
will have a material impact on the Group’s accounts in the period of 
initial application. Financials 96

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 Financial 
Instruments which reflects all phases of the financial instruments 
project and replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement and all previous versions of IFRS 9. The standard 
introduces new requirements for classification and measurement, 
impairment and hedge accounting. IFRS 9 is effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early application 
permitted. Retrospective application is required, but comparative 
information is not compulsory. Early application of previous versions 
of IFRS 9 (2009, 2010 and 2013) is permitted if the date of initial 
application is before 1 February 2015. The adoption of IFRS 9 will 
have an effect on the classification and measurement of the Group’s 
financial assets, but will not have an impact on classification and 
measurement of financial liabilities. 
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and establishes a five-step model 
that will apply to revenue arising from contracts with customers. 
Under IFRS 15 revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the 
consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange 
for transferring goods or services to a customer. The principles in 
IFRS 15 provide a more structured approach to measuring and 
recognising revenue.
The new revenue standard is applicable to all entities and will 
supersede all current revenue recognition requirements under IFRS. 
Either a full or modified retrospective application is required for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Early adoption 
is permitted. The Group is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 15 
and plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date.
IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16 Leases was issued in January 2016, it sets out the principles 
for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of 
leases for both parties to a contract. It replaces the previous leases 
standard IAS 17 Leases and is effective from 1 January 2019.
IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases as either operating 
leases or finance leases, as is required under IAS 17 and, instead, 
introduces a single lease accounting model. The Group will assess 
the impact of IFRS 16 and plans to adopt the new standard on the 
required effective date.
Amendments to IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements for Acquisition of 
Interests
The amendments to IFRS 11 require that a joint operator accounting 
for the acquisition of an interest in a joint operation, in which the 
activity of the joint operation constitutes a business must apply the 
relevant IFRS 3 principles for business combinations accounting. 
The amendments also clarify that a previously held interest in a 
joint operation is not re-measured in the acquisition of an additional 
interest in the same joint operation while joint control is retained. 
In addition, a scope exclusion has been added to IFRS 11 to specify 
that the amendments do not apply when the parties share joint 
control, including the reporting entity, are under common control 
of the same ultimate controlling party.
The amendments apply to both the acquisition of the initial interest 
in a joint operation and the acquisition of any additional interests in 
the same joint operation and are prospectively effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, with early adoption 
permitted. These amendments are not expected to have any impact 
on the Group.
Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: Clarification of Acceptable 
Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation
The amendments clarify the principle in IAS 16 and IAS 38 that 
revenue reflects a pattern of economic benefits that are generated 
from operating a business (of which the asset is a part) rather than 
the economic benefits that are consumed through use of the asset. 
As a result, a revenue-based method cannot be used to depreciate 
property, plant and equipment and may only be used in very limited 
circumstances to amortise intangible assets. The amendments are 
effective prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2016, with early adoption permitted. These amendments 
are not expected to have any impact on the Group given that the 
Group has not used a revenue-based method to depreciate its 
non-current assets.
Annual Improvements 2012-2014 Cycle
These improvements are effective for annual periods beginning on 
or after 1 January 2016 and are not expected to have any impact on 
the Group. They include:
IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued 
Operations
Assets or disposal groups are generally disposed of either through 
sale or distribution to owners. The amendment clarifies that changing 
from one of these disposal methods to the other would not be 
considered a new plan of disposal, rather it is a continuation of the 
original plan. There is, therefore, no interruption of the application 
of the requirements in IFRS 5. This amendment must be applied 
prospectively.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures
The amendment clarifies that the offsetting disclosure requirements 
do not apply to condensed interim financial statements, unless such 
disclosures provide a significant update to the information reported 
in the most recent annual report. This amendment must be applied 
retrospectively.
IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting
The amendment clarifies that the required interim disclosure 
must either be in the interim financial statements or incorporated 
by cross-reference between the interim financial statements and 
wherever they are included within the interim financial report (e.g. in 
the management commentary or risk report). The other information 
within the interim financial report must be available to users on the 
same terms as the interim financial statements and at the same time. 
This amendment must be applied retrospectively.
Amendments to IAS 1 Disclosure Initiative
The amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements 
clarify, rather than significantly change, existing IAS 1 requirements. 
The amendments clarify:
 o the materiality requirements in IAS 1;
 o that specific line items in the statement(s) of profit or loss and 
OCI and the statements of financial position may be 
disaggregated;
 o that entities have flexibility as to the order in which they present 
the notes to the financial statements;
 o that the share of OCI of associates and joint ventures accounted 
for using the equity method must be presented in aggregate as a 
single line item, and classified between those items that will or 
will not be subsequently reclassified to profit or loss. Financials 97
EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Furthermore, the amendments clarify the requirements that 
apply when additional subtotals are presented in the statement of 
financial position and the statements of profit or loss and OCI. These 
amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2016, with early adoption permitted. These amendments 
are not expected to have any impact on the Group.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The management of the Group has to make estimates and 
judgements when preparing the financial statements of the Group. 
Uncertainties in the estimates and judgements could have an impact 
on the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and the Group’s 
result. The most important estimates and judgements in relation 
thereto are:
Estimates in oil and gas reserves
The business of the Group is the exploration for, development of 
and production of oil and gas reserves. Estimates of oil and gas 
reserves are used in the calculations for impairment tests and 
accounting for depletion and decommissioning. Changes in 
estimates of oil and gas reserves resulting in different future 
production profiles will affect the discounted cash flows used in 
impairment testing, the anticipated date of decommissioning 
and the depletion charges in accordance with the unit-of-
production method.
Estimates in impairment of oil and gas assets and goodwill
Determination of whether oil and gas assets or goodwill has suffered 
any impairment requires an estimation of the fair value less costs to 
dispose of the cash-generating units (CGU) to which oil and gas 
assets and goodwill have been allocated. The calculation requires 
the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the 
CGU using discounted cashflow models comprising asset-by-asset life 
of field projections using Level 3 inputs (based on IFRS 13 fair value 
hierarchy). Key assumptions and estimates in the impairment models 
relate to: commodity prices that are based on forward curve prices for 
the first three years and thereafter at US$70 per barrel inflated at 2% 
per annum from 2020; discount rates derived from the Group’s 
post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 8.45% (2014: 8.8%); 
commercial reserves and the related cost profiles. As the production 
and related cashflows can be estimated from EnQuest’s experience, 
management believes that the estimated cashflows expected to be 
generated over the life of each field is the appropriate basis upon 
which to assess goodwill and individual assets for impairment. 
Determining whether an acquisition is a business combination 
or asset purchase
The Group analyses the transaction or event by applying the 
definition of a business combination, principally whether inputs, 
processes and outputs exist, including reviewing Group strategy, 
control and resources. Should the acquired business not be 
viewed as a business combination then it is accounted for as an 
asset purchase.
Determining the fair value of property, plant and equipment on 
business combinations
The Group determines the fair value of property, plant and 
equipment acquired based on the discounted cash flows at the 
time of acquisition, from the proven and probable reserves. In 
assessing the discounted cash flows, the estimated future cash 
flows attributable to the asset are discounted to their present value 
using a discount rate that reflects the market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset at the time of the 
acquisition. In calculating the asset fair value the Group will apply the 
forward curve followed by an oil price assumption representing 
management’s view of the long term oil price. 
Decommissioning provision 
Amounts used in recording a provision for decommissioning are 
estimates based on current legal and constructive requirements 
and current technology and price levels for the removal of facilities 
and plugging and abandoning of wells. Due to changes in relation 
to these items, the future actual cash outflows in relation to 
decommissioning are likely to differ in practice. To reflect the 
effects due to changes in legislation, requirements and technology 
and price levels, the carrying amounts of decommissioning 
provisions are reviewed on a regular basis. 
The effects of changes in estimates do not give rise to prior year 
adjustments and are dealt with prospectively. While the Group uses 
its best estimates and judgement, actual results could differ from 
these estimates.
In estimating decommissioning provisions, the Group applies an 
annual inflation rate of 2% (2014: 2%) and an annual discount rate 
of 3% (2014: 3%).
Carry provision
Part of the consideration for the acquisition of the interest 
in the Kraken field in 2012 was through development carries. 
These were split into two parts, a firm carry where the amount was 
agreed and a contingent carry where the amounts are subject to a 
reserves determination. In assessing the amounts to be provided, 
management has made assumptions about the most likely amount 
outcome of the reserves determination. Future developments may 
require further revisions to the estimate. These would be recorded 
as a financial liability for any outstanding balance under the firm carry 
and as a provision for the contingent carry.
Going concern
The going concern assumption is highly sensitive to 
economic conditions. The Group closely monitors and 
manages its funding position and liquidity risk throughout the 
year including monitoring forecast covenant results to ensure it has 
access to sufficient funds to meet forecast cash requirements. Cash 
forecasts are regularly produced and sensitivities considered for, 
but not limited to, changes in crude oil prices (adjusted for hedging 
undertaken by the Group), production rates and development 
project timing and costs. These forecasts and sensitivity analyses 
allow management to mitigate any liquidity or covenant compliance 
risks in a timely manner.
Taxation
The Group’s operations are subject to a number of specific rules 
which apply to exploration and production. In addition, the tax 
provision is prepared before the relevant companies have filed their 
tax returns with the relevant tax authorities and, significantly, before 
these have been agreed. As a result of these factors, the tax provision 
process necessarily involves the use of a number of estimates and 
judgements including those required in calculating the effective tax 
rate. In considering the tax on exceptionals, the Company applies the 
appropriate statutory tax rate to each exceptional item to calculate 
the relevant tax charge on exceptional items.
The Group recognises deferred tax assets on unused tax losses 
where it is probable that future taxable profits will be available for 
utilisation. This requires management to make judgements and 
assumptions regarding the amount of deferred tax that can be 
recognised, as well as the likelihood of future taxable profits.  Financials 98

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Foreign currencies
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s 
entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (functional currency). 
The Group financial statements are presented in United States 
dollars, the currency which the Group has elected to use as its 
presentation currency.
In the accounts of the Company and its individual subsidiaries, 
transactions in currencies other than a company’s functional 
currency are recorded at the prevailing rate of exchange on the date 
of the transaction. At the year end, monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates of 
exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets 
and liabilities that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency 
are translated using the rate of exchange as at the dates of the initial 
transactions. Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at fair 
value in a foreign currency are translated using the rate of exchange 
at the date the fair value was determined. All foreign exchange gains 
and losses are taken to profit and loss in the statement of 
comprehensive income. 
Classification and recognition of assets and liabilities
Non-current assets and non-current liabilities including provisions 
consist, for the most part, solely of amounts that are expected to 
be recovered or paid more than 12 months after the balance sheet 
date. Current assets and current liabilities consist solely of amounts 
that are expected to be recovered or paid within 12 months after 
the balance sheet date.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any impairment in value. Cost comprises the 
purchase price or construction cost and any costs directly attributable 
to making that asset capable of operating as intended. The purchase 
price or construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair 
value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset. 
Oil and gas assets are depleted, on a field-by-field basis, using 
the unit-of-production method based on entitlement to proven and 
probable reserves, taking account of estimated future development 
expenditure relating to those reserves. 
Depreciation on other elements of property, plant and equipment is 
provided on a straight-line basis at the following rates:
Office furniture and equipment  20%
Fixtures and fittings 10%
Long leasehold land period of lease
Each asset’s estimated useful life, residual value and method of 
depreciation are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each 
financial year end.
No depreciation is charged on assets under construction. 
The carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment 
is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits 
are expected from its use or disposal. The gain or loss arising from 
the derecognition of an item of property, plant and equipment is 
included in the statement of comprehensive income when the item 
is derecognised. Gains are not classified as revenue.
Capitalised costs
Oil and gas assets are accounted for using the successful efforts 
method of accounting.
Intangible oil and gas assets
Expenditure directly associated with evaluation or appraisal 
activities is capitalised as an intangible asset. Such costs include the 
costs of acquiring an interest, appraisal well drilling costs, payments 
to contractors and an appropriate share of directly attributable 
overheads incurred during the evaluation phase. For such appraisal 
activity, which may require drilling of further wells, costs continue to 
be carried as an asset whilst related hydrocarbons are considered 
capable of commercial development. Such costs are subject to 
technical, commercial and management review to confirm the 
continued intent to develop, or otherwise extract value. When this 
is no longer the case, the costs are impaired and any impairment 
loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. When 
exploration licences are relinquished without further development, 
any previous impairment loss is reversed and the carrying costs are 
written off through the statement of comprehensive income. When 
assets are declared part of a commercial development, related costs 
are transferred to property, plant and equipment oil and gas assets. 
All intangible oil and gas assets are assessed for any impairment 
prior to transfer and any impairment loss is recognised in the 
statement of comprehensive income. 
Farm-outs – in the exploration and evaluation phase
The Group does not record any expenditure made by the farmee 
on its account. It also does not recognise any gain or loss on its 
exploration and evaluation farm-out arrangements but redesignates 
any costs previously capitalised in relation to the whole interest as 
relating to the partial interest retained. Any cash consideration 
received directly from the farmee is credited against costs 
previously capitalised in relation to the whole interest with 
any excess accounted for by the farmor as a gain on disposal.
Oil and gas assets
Expenditure relating to development of assets including the 
construction, installation and completion of infrastructure facilities 
such as platforms, pipelines and development wells, is capitalised 
within property, plant and equipment.
Farm-outs – outside the exploration and evaluation phase
In accounting for a farm-out arrangement outside the exploration 
and evaluation phase, the Group:
 o derecognises the proportion of the asset that it has sold to the 
farmee;
 o recognises the consideration received or receivable from the 
farmee, which represents the cash received and/or the farmee’s 
obligation to fund the capital expenditure in relation to the 
interest retained by the farmor and/or any deferred 
consideration;
 o recognises a gain or loss on the transaction for the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of 
the asset disposed of. A gain is only recognised when the value 
of the consideration can be determined reliably. If not, then the 
Group accounts for the consideration received as a reduction in 
the carrying amount of the underlying assets; and
 o tests the retained interests for impairment if the terms of the 
arrangement indicate that the retained interest may be impaired.
The consideration receivable on disposal of an item of property, 
plant and equipment or an intangible asset is recognised initially at 
its fair value by the Group. However, if payment for the item is 
deferred, the consideration received is recognised initially at the 
cash price equivalent. The difference between the nominal amount 
of the consideration and the cash price equivalent is recognised as 
Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued

EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
interest revenue. Any part of the consideration that is receivable in 
the form of cash is treated as a financial asset and is accounted for 
at amortised cost.
Carry arrangements
Where amounts are paid on behalf of a carried party these are 
capitalised. Where there is an obligation to make payments on 
behalf of a carried party and the timing and amount are uncertain, 
a provision is recognised. Where the payment is a fixed monetary 
amount, a financial liability is recognised.
Asset swaps
Exchanges or part exchanges of tangible oil and gas assets 
are measured at fair value unless the exchange transaction 
lacks commercial substance or the fair value of neither the assets 
received nor the asset given up is reliably measurable. The cost 
of the acquired asset is measured at the fair value of the asset 
given up, unless the fair value of the asset received is more clearly 
evident. Where fair value is not used, the cost of the acquired asset is 
measured at the carrying amount of the amount given up. A gain or 
loss is recognised on the difference between the carrying amount of 
the asset given up and the fair value of the asset received in profit or 
loss. Exchanges of intangible oil and gas assets would be measured 
at cost.
Changes in unit-of-production factors
Changes in factors which affect unit-of-production calculations are 
dealt with prospectively, not by immediate adjustment of prior 
years’ amounts.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the construction of qualifying 
assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of 
time to prepare for their intended use, are added to the cost of those 
assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their 
intended use. All other borrowing costs are recognised as interest 
payable in the statement of comprehensive income in accordance 
with the effective interest method.
Impairment of assets (excluding goodwill)
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying 
amounts of its oil and gas assets to assess whether there is an 
indication that those assets may be impaired. If any such indication 
exists, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable 
amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s 
fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. In assessing value in 
use, the estimated future cash flows attributable to the asset are 
discounted to their present value using a post-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the asset.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its 
carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately 
in the statement of comprehensive income.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying 
amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its 
recoverable amount, but only so that the increased carrying 
amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have 
been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the 
asset in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised 
immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
Goodwill
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is initially measured at 
cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over 
the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities of the entity at the date of acquisition. Following initial 
recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated 
impairment losses. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or 
more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
such carrying value may be impaired.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill acquired is 
allocated to the cash-generating units that are expected to benefit 
from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or units to which 
goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the Group at 
which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of 
the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill relates. Where the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the 
carrying amount of the cash-generating unit and related goodwill, 
an impairment loss is recognised. Impairment losses relating to 
goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.
Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit 
and part of the operation within the unit is disposed of, the goodwill 
associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying 
amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on 
disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance 
is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed 
of and the portion of the cash-generating units retained.
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the 
lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying 
amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than 
through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when 
the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate 
sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to 
the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a 
completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Financial assets
Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial 
assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, 
held-to-maturity investments, available-for-sale financial investments, 
or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective 
hedge, as appropriate. The Group determines the classification of its 
financial assets at initial recognition.
All assets are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs, 
except in the case of financial assets recorded at fair value through 
profit or loss.
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets 
within a timeframe established by regulation or convention in the 
marketplace (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date.
The Group’s financial assets include cash and short term deposits, 
trade and other receivables, loans and other receivables, quoted 
and unquoted financial instruments and derivative financial 
instruments. Financials 100
EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their 
classification as described below:
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)
Financial assets are classified as at FVTPL when the financial asset 
is either held for trading or designated as at FVTPL. Financial assets 
are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose 
of selling or repurchasing in the near term. Derivatives are also 
classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective 
hedging instruments as defined by IAS 39. 
Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or 
losses arising on remeasurement recognised immediately in the 
income statement for commodity derivatives and foreign 
exchange derivatives.
Financial assets designated upon initial recognition at FVTPL are 
designated at their initial recognition date and only if the criteria 
under IAS 39 are satisfied.
The Group evaluates its financial assets held for trading, other than 
derivatives, to determine whether the intention to sell them in the 
near term is still appropriate. Where the Group is unable to trade 
these financial assets or management’s intention to sell them in the 
foreseeable future changes significantly, the Group may elect to 
reclassify these assets. The reclassification to loans and receivables, 
available-for-sale or held-to-maturity depends on the nature of the 
asset. This evaluation does not affect any financial assets designated 
at FVTPL using the fair value option at designation. These 
instruments cannot be reclassified after initial recognition.
Held-to-maturity investments
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments 
and fixed maturity are classified as held-to-maturity when the Group 
has the positive intention and ability to hold them to maturity. After 
initial measurement, held-to-maturity investments are measured at 
amortised cost using the Effective Interest Method (EIR), less 
impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account 
any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an 
integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation and losses arising from 
impairment are included in the profit or loss. 
Available-for-sale financial investments
Listed and unlisted shares held by the Group that are traded in an 
active market are classified as being available-for-sale and are stated 
at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are 
recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the 
available-for-sale reserve with the exception of impairment losses 
which are recognised directly in profit or loss. Where the investment 
is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or 
loss previously recognised in the available-for-sale reserve is 
reclassified to profit or loss. 
Loans and receivables 
These include trade receivables, loans and other receivables 
that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in 
an active market and are measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, less any impairment. Interest income 
is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for 
short term receivables when the recognition of interest would 
be immaterial.
Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is any 
objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired. A financial 
asset is deemed to be impaired where there is objective evidence 
of impairment that, as a result of one or more events that have 
occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, the estimated 
future cash flows of the investment have been affected.
For listed and unlisted equity investments classified as available-for-
sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the 
security below its cost is considered to be objective evidence of 
impairment. When an available-for-sale financial asset is considered 
to be impaired, cumulative gains and losses previously recognised 
in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss in 
the period. In respect of equity securities, impairment losses 
previously recognised in profit or loss are not reversed through 
profit or loss but through other comprehensive income. Any 
increase in fair value subsequent to an impairment loss is 
recognised in other comprehensive income.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the 
impairment is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount 
and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at 
the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The carrying 
amount is reduced through use of an allowance account and the 
amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss.
Derivatives
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a 
derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured 
at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or 
loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a 
hedging instrument.
The Group categorises derivatives as follows:
Fair value hedge
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that qualify as fair value 
hedging instruments are recorded in the profit or loss, together with 
any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability. Where 
put options are used as hedging instruments, only the intrinsic value 
of the option is designated as the hedge, with the time value 
recorded in finance costs.
Cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that 
qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive 
income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is 
recognised immediately in the profit or loss. Amounts accumulated in 
shareholders’ equity are transferred to the profit or loss in the period 
when the hedged item will affect the profit or loss. When the hedged 
item no longer meets the requirements for hedge accounting, expires 
or is sold, any accumulated gain or loss recognised in shareholders’ 
equity is transferred to profit and loss when the forecast transaction 
which was the subject of the hedge occurs.
Net investment hedge
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted 
for in a similar manner as cash flow hedges. The gain or loss 
accumulated in shareholders´ equity is transferred to the profit 
or loss at the time the foreign operation is disposed of.
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting
When derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, changes 
in fair value are recognised immediately in the profit or loss.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost less provision for 
impairment.

For the year ended 31 December 2015 Financials 101
EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Inventories
Inventories of consumable well supplies are stated at the lower of 
cost and net realisable value, cost being determined on an average 
cost basis. Inventories of hydrocarbons are stated at the lower of 
cost and net realisable value.
Under/over-lift 
Under or over-lifted positions of hydrocarbons are valued at 
market prices prevailing at the balance sheet date. An under-lift 
of production from a field is included in current receivables and 
valued at the reporting date spot price or prevailing contract price 
and an over-lift of production from a field is included in current 
liabilities and valued at the reporting date spot price or prevailing 
contract price.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash at bank, cash in hand, 
outstanding bank overdrafts and highly liquid interest bearing 
securities with original maturities of three months or less. 
Equity
Share capital
The balance classified as equity share capital includes the total 
net proceeds (both nominal value and share premium) on issue of 
registered share capital of the parent Company. Share issue costs 
associated with the issuance of new equity are treated as a direct 
reduction of proceeds. 
Merger reserve
Merger reserve represents the difference between the market value 
of shares issued to effect business combinations less the nominal 
value of shares issued. The merger reserve in the Group financial 
statements also includes the consolidation adjustments that arise 
under the application of the pooling of interest method.
Cash flow hedge reserve
For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the 
hedging instrument is recognised directly as other comprehensive 
income in the cash flow hedge reserve. Upon settlement of the 
hedged item, the change in fair value is transferred to the statement 
of comprehensive income.
Available-for-sale reserve
Gains and losses (with the exception of impairment losses) 
arising from changes in available-for-sale financial investments are 
recognised in the available-for-sale reserve until such time that the 
investment is disposed of, where it is reclassified to profit or loss.
Share-based payments reserve
Equity-settled share-based payment transactions are measured 
at the fair value of the services received, and the corresponding 
increase in equity is recorded directly at the fair value of the 
services received. The share-based payments reserve includes 
treasury shares.
Retained earnings
Retained earnings contain the accumulated results attributable 
to the shareholders of the parent Company. 
Employee Benefit Trust
EnQuest PLC shares held by the Group are deducted from the 
share-based payments reserve and are recognised at cost. 
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised 
in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from the sale 
and the original cost being taken to reserves. No gain or loss is 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on the 
purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Provisions 
Decommissioning
Provision for future decommissioning costs is made in full when 
the Group has an obligation to dismantle and remove a facility or 
an item of plant and to restore the site on which it is located, and 
when a reasonable estimate of that liability can be made. The 
amount recognised is the present value of the estimated future 
expenditure. An amount equivalent to the discounted initial 
provision for decommissioning costs is capitalised and amortised 
over the life of the underlying asset on a unit-of-production basis 
over proven and probable reserves. Any change in the present value 
of the estimated expenditure is reflected as an adjustment to the 
provision and the oil and gas asset. 
The unwinding of the discount applied to future decommissioning 
provisions is included under finance costs in the statement of 
comprehensive income.
Other
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that 
an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and 
a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities 
Financial assets
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset) is 
derecognised where:
 o the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired;
 o the Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, 
but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without 
material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ 
arrangement; or
 o the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from 
the asset and either (a) has transferred substantially all the risks 
and rewards of the asset, or (b) has neither transferred nor 
retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but 
has transferred control of the asset.
Financial liabilities
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the 
liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
If an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the 
same lender, on substantially different terms, or the terms of an 
existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or 
modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability 
and the recognition of a new liability such that the difference in 
the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees 
incurred are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are recognised initially at 
fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Transaction costs are 
amortised over the life of the facility.
Borrowing costs are stated at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the 
amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest 
expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the 
rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through 
the expected life of the financial liability, or a shorter period to the 
net carrying amount of the financial liability where appropriate.  Financials 102
EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Bonds
Bonds are measured on an amortised cost basis.
Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a 
lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the inception 
date. The arrangement is assessed for whether fulfilment of the 
arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or 
the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset or assets, even if 
that right is not explicitly specified in an arrangement.
Finance leases that transfer substantially all the risks and 
benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item to the Group, 
are capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the fair value 
of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the 
minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned 
between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to 
achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the 
liability. Finance charges are recognised in finance costs in the 
income statement.
A leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. 
However, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group 
will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is 
depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset 
and the lease term.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an operating expense 
in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Revenue
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable economic 
benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be 
reliably measured. 
Oil and gas revenues comprise the Group’s share of sales from the 
processing or sale of hydrocarbons on an entitlement basis, when 
the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been passed to 
the buyer.
Tariff revenue is recognised in the period in which the services are 
provided at the agreed contract rates. 
Gains or losses arising on remeasurement of commodity derivatives 
designated at FVTPL are recognised immediately within the 
income statement. 
Rental income is accounted for on a straight line basis over the lease 
terms and is included in revenue in the income statement.
Exceptional items 
As permitted by IAS 1 (Revised), Presentation of Financial 
Statements, certain items are presented separately. The items that 
the Group separately presents as exceptional on the face of the 
statement of comprehensive income are those material items of 
income and expense which because of the nature and expected 
infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate 
presentation to allow shareholders to understand better the 
elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate 
comparison with prior periods and to assess better trends in 
financial performance.
Depletion of fair value uplift to property, plant and equipment 
on acquiring strategic investments
IFRS requires that a fair value exercise is undertaken allocating the 
cost of acquiring controlling interests to the fair value of the 
acquired identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Any 
difference between the cost of acquiring the interest and the fair 
value of the acquired net assets, which includes identified 
contingent liabilities, is recognised as acquired goodwill. The fair 
value exercise is performed as at the date of acquisition.
The Directors have determined that for strategic investments it is 
important to identify separately the earnings impact of increased 
depletion arising from the acquisition date fair value uplifts made 
to property, plant and equipment over their useful economic lives. 
As a result of the nature of fair value assessments in the oil and gas 
industry the value attributed to strategic assets is subjective, 
based on a wide range of complex variables at a point in time. The 
subsequent depletion of the fair value uplifts bear little relationship 
to current market conditions, operational performance or cash 
generation. Management therefore reports and monitors the 
business performance of strategic investments before the impact of 
depletion of fair value uplifts to property, plant and equipment and 
the uplifts are excluded from the business result presented in the 
Group statement of comprehensive income.
Employee benefits
Short term employee benefits
Short term employee benefits such as salaries, social premiums and 
holiday pay, are expensed when incurred. 
Pension obligations
The Group’s pension obligations consist of defined contribution 
plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the 
Group pays fixed contributions. The Group has no further payment 
obligations once the contributions have been paid. The amount 
charged to the statement of comprehensive income in respect of 
pension costs reflects the contributions payable in the year. 
Differences between contributions payable during the year and 
contributions actually paid are shown as either accrued liabilities or 
prepaid assets in the balance sheet.
Share-based payment transactions
Employees (including Directors) of the Group receive remuneration 
in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby 
employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over 
shares (equity-settled transactions) of EnQuest PLC.
Equity-settled transactions
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured 
by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted. 
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any 
service or performance conditions, other than conditions linked to 
the price of the shares of EnQuest PLC (market conditions) or 
‘non-vesting’ conditions, if applicable.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised over the period 
in which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award 
(the vesting period). The cumulative expense recognised for 
equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting 
date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and 
the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that 
will ultimately vest. The statement of comprehensive income charge 
or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative 
expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, 
except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market or 
non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of 
whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, 
provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied. Equity 
Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued
For the year ended 31 December 2015 Financials 103
EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
awards cancelled are treated as vesting immediately on the date of cancellation, and any expense not recognised for the award at that date 
is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Taxes
Income taxes
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on 
tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts 
in the Group financial statements. However, deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a 
transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. 
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint 
ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are 
offset only if a legal right exists to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities, the deferred income taxes relate to the same 
taxation authority and that authority permits the Group to make a single net payment.
Production taxes
In addition to corporate income taxes, the Group’s financial statements also include and disclose production taxes on net income 
determined from oil and gas production. 
Production tax relates to Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) and is accounted for under IAS 12 since it has the characteristics of an income tax as 
it is imposed under Government authority and the amount payable is based on taxable profits of the relevant fields. Current and deferred 
PRT is provided on the same basis as described above for income taxes. 
Investment allowances
The UK taxation regime provides for a reduction in ring fence supplementary corporation tax where investments in new or existing UK 
assets qualify for a relief known as investment allowances. Investment allowances are only triggered when production from the field 
commences. The Group is eligible for a number of investment allowances which will materially reduce the level of future supplementary 
corporation taxation. Investment allowances are recognised as a reduction in the charge to taxation in the years claimed.
3. Segment information 
Management have considered the requirements of IFRS 8, in regard to the determination of operating segments and concluded that the 
Group has two significant operating segments, being the exploration for, extraction and production of hydrocarbons in the North Sea and 
Malaysia. Operations are located and managed by location, therefore all information is being presented for geographical segments. The 
information reported to the Chief Operating Decision Maker does not include an analysis of assets and liabilities and accordingly this 
information is not presented.

underlying performance of the business as it distinguishes between the temporary timing differences associated with re-measurement 
under IAS 39 rules and actual realised gains and losses.
In July 2015, contingent consideration which was receivable on the disposal of the Slovenian Petisovci asset to Ascent in 2011 was agreed to 
be converted into a convertible loan note. The fair value of the convertible loan note at 31 December 2015, is US$250,000 (2014: nil). 
The impact in the income statement net of foreign exchange is US$272,000 (note 5(e)). The loan note is due to mature in November 2016.
Two other oil price related embedded derivatives have been recognised in 2015 with a fair value at 31 December 2015 of US$30,000 (note 
5(f)) (2014: nil).
Write off and impairment of investments, oil and gas assets and evaluation and exploration assets
In the year ended 31 December 2015, as part of the annual impairment review process, impairment triggers were highlighted which led to 
a US$1,224,463,000 (2014: US$678,801,000) impairment charge (refer to note 10).
Exploration assets were reviewed and this has led to an impairment of US$1,854,000 (2014: US$151,982,000) and a write off of 
US$7,205,000 (2014: nil) (refer to note 12). 
As consideration for the disposal of the held for sale Petisovci asset in 2011, the Group received an investment in Ascent Resources plc. 
The accounting valuation of this shareholding at 31 December 2015 resulted in a non-cash impairment of US$566,000 (note 13), which was 
recognised in the income statement (2014: US$1,316,000). 
Loss/(gain) on disposal of assets
In October 2015, the Group disposed of its Norwegian licences for US$2,065,000, resulting in a loss of US$2,264,000 (note 12). 
In November 2014 the Group disposed of its Dutch asset P8a for US$2,162,000 resulting in a gain of US$2,019,000.
During the year ended 31 December 2015 the Group entered a sale and leaseback arrangement for the Aberdeen office. The loss 
of US$8,473,000 represents the difference between the sale proceeds of US$68,425,000 and the carrying value of the property.
Write down of receivable and inventory
Following EnQuest’s exit from Tunisia, as at 31 December 2014 the Group had recorded a receivable of US$11,400,000 due from PA 
Resources (PAR). Since 27 March 2015, PAR has been in corporate reorganisation in accordance with the Swedish Company Reorganisation 
Act (1996:764). Since PAR commenced its reorganisation process, EnQuest negotiated a settlement agreement whereby in settlement of all 
amounts due from PAR, EnQuest will receive an amount held by PAR in Tunisia of TND13,771,642. EnQuest has security over the monies in 
this account, pending the approval of the Tunisian central Bank to convert these amounts into US Dollars and expatriate them out of Tunisia.
EnQuest has recognised a charge to the income statement totalling US$4,350,000 for the year ended 31 December 2015 which represents 
the difference between the value carried as at 31 December 2014 and the value of the bank account in Tunisian Dinars. The funds of 
US$6,782,000 are disclosed in the balance sheet at 31 December 2015 as Restricted Cash.  Financials 106

4. Depletion of fair value uplift, remeasurements, impairments and other exceptional items continued
At 31 December 2015, due to the current economic climate, the value of certain items of drilling equipment held within inventory were 
reviewed against their recoverable values. This assessment has led to a write down of US$13,598,000 within the income statement.
Depletion of fair value uplift
Additional depletion arising from the fair value uplift of Petrofac Energy Developments Limited’s (PEDL) oil and gas assets on acquisition 
of US$3,786,000 (2014: US$6,869,000) is included within cost of sales in the statement of comprehensive income. 
Change in surplus lease provision
In June 2015, the Group entered a 20 year lease in respect of the Group’s office building in Aberdeen with part of the building 
subsequently being sub-let. A provision has been recognised for the unavoidable costs in relation to the sub-let space due primarily to 
a rent free period offered (note 22). For the year ended 31 December 2015, US$3,611,000 has been recognised within rent expenses 
representing the initial recognition of the provision and the subsequent utilisation in 2015.
In addition, the Group has an agreement to hire the Stena Spey drilling vessel in 2016. Based on the current drilling forecasts for 2016, 
the vessel will not be fully utilised over this period and at 31 December 2015, a provision has been recognised for the unavoidable costs 
of US$22,948,000. 
Negative goodwill
During the year ended 31 December 2014, the Group acquired the PM8/Seligi assets in Malaysia. The assets and liabilities on acquisition 
was fair valued and as the fair value was greater than the deemed consideration then a gain of US$28,630,000 was recognised.
Operator SVT tariff reconciliation
SVT terminal operating costs are allocated to East of Shetland users based on each user’s delivered production throughput, as a 
percentage of the total terminal throughput. Costs are further allocated, based on a user’s share of two associated services – Stabilised 
Crude Oil processing (SCO) & Liquified Petroleum Gas processing (LPG). SVT costs incurred during each month are provisionally allocated 
and charged to users based on a user’s estimated share of costs (based on estimated throughput volumes per service). At year end, a 
process occurs whereby the terminal operator reconciles each user’s estimated share of costs against its actual share (based on the actual 
total spend and actual terminal throughput for that given year).
In 2013, as a direct result of EnQuest’s strong production performance versus other SVT users’ lower than expected throughput in 2013, 
a higher base level cost at SVT and a small excess capacity charge, these all contributed to the exceptional value arising from the 2013 
reconciliation. The charge recognised in the year ended 31 December 2014 in relation to the 2013 reconciliation process was 
US$30,369,000.
There was no exceptional charge or credit in 2015.
Other
As part of the purchase agreement with the previous owner of the GKA assets, a contingent consideration was agreed based on Scolty/Crathes 
Field Development Plan (FDP) approval and ‘first oil’. EnQuest paid US$3,000,000 in November 2015 as FDP approval was achieved in 
October 2015. US$9,000,000 is due on the later of first oil or 30 January 2017 and US$8,000,000 due on the later of one year after first oil  
or 30 January 2018. In addition further payments will become due if the oil price rises above $75 per barrel on a linear basis up to $100 per 
barrel, up to a cap of US$20,000,000. The change has resulted from a higher likelihood of the payment being made due to FDP approval  
of Scolty/Crathes in October 2015. An option model has been used to value the element of the consideration that is contingent on the oil 
price (refer note 22).
The joint venture audit of the SB307/SB308 operator in Malaysia found an overcall, of which US$518,000 is our share and has been 
recognised in the income statement.
In addition there is an adjustment relating to the acquisition of PM8/Seligi assets in Malaysia in 2014. Information in respect of US$1,146,000 
of a condensate/gas sales reserve was not available at the time of finalising the acquisition accounting. In line with IFRS 3 Business 
Combinations any adjustments to acquisition accounting are recognised in the income statement.
Tax
The tax impact on the exceptional items is calculated based on the tax rate applicable to each exceptional item.
Change in tax rate
Finance Act 2015 enacted a change in the mainstream corporation tax rate, reducing it from 20% to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017 and 
18% with effect from 1 April 2020. The impact of the change in tax rate in 2015 was a reduction in the tax credit of US$1,367,000. Finance 
Act 2015 also enacted a change in the supplementary charge tax rate, reducing it from 32% to 20% with effect from 1 January 2015 and a 
change to the petroleum revenue tax rate, reducing it from 50% to 35% with effect from 1 January 2016. The impact of the change in tax 
rate in 2015 was an increase in the tax credit of US$58,157,000.
Recoverability of deferred tax assets
At the year end the recovery of deferred tax assets was reviewed and this has led to a reduction in the carrying amount of US$239,067,000 
due to uncertainty over the recoverability of these tax assets.

respect of the KUFPEC farm-out receivable. Opening retained earnings as at 1 January 2014 has been increased by a corresponding amount.
(d) Tax losses 
The Group’s deferred tax assets at 31 December 2015 are recognised to the extent that taxable profits are expected to arise in the 
future against which tax losses and allowances in the UK can be utilised. In accordance with IAS 12 – ‘Income Taxes’ the Group assessed 
the recoverability of its deferred tax assets at 31 December 2015 with respect to ring fence tax losses and allowances. The impairment 
model used to assess the extent to which it is appropriate to recognise the Group’s UK tax losses as deferred tax assets was run, using an 
oil price assumption of Dated Brent forward curve in the years 2016 to 2019 followed by US$70/bbl ‘real’ terms thereafter. The results of the 
impairment model demonstrated that it was appropriate not to recognise deferred tax asset on US$478,133,000 (2014: nil) of the Group’s 
UK ring fence corporate tax losses at 31 December 2015 based on expected future profitability. The unrecognised loss amount results in 
a deferred tax charge of US$239,066,000 (2014: nil) for the year in respect of losses and allowances that were previously recognised as a 
deferred tax asset.
The Group has unused UK mainstream corporation tax losses of US$36,066,000 (2014: US$16,635,000) for which no deferred tax asset has 
been recognised at the balance sheet date due to the uncertainty of recovery of these losses. 
The Group realised a capital loss of US$3,320,000 in the year in relation to the disposal of a subsidiary company which has not been 
recognised at the balance sheet date due to the uncertainty of recovery.
The Group has unused overseas tax losses in Canada of approximately CAD$13,359,000 (2014: CAD$12,735,000) for which no deferred tax 
asset has been recognised at the balance sheet date. The tax losses in Canada have expiry periods of 20 years, none of which expire in 
2016 and which arose following the change in control of the UK Stratic Group in 2010.  Financials 112

7. Income tax continued
During the year the Group relinquished licences SB307 and SB308 in Malaysia and its only concession in Egypt. No deferred tax asset has 
been recognised at the balance sheet date in respect of tax losses of US$29,965,000 (2014: US$29,700,000) in Malaysia and US$3,133,000 
(2014: US$3,300,000) in Egypt due to the uncertainty of recovery.
The Group has unused Malaysian income tax losses of US$2,052,000 (2014: nil) arising in respect of the Tanjong Baram RSC for which no 
deferred tax asset has been recognised at the balance sheet date due to uncertainty of recovery of these losses. 
No deferred tax has been provided on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries. Finance Act 2009 exempted foreign dividends from 
the scope of UK corporation tax where certain conditions are satisfied.
(e) Change in legislation
Finance Act 2015 enacted a change in the mainstream corporation tax rate, reducing it from 20% to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017 and 
18% with effect from 1 April 2020. The impact of the change in tax rate in 2015 was a reduction in the tax credit of US$1,367,000.
Finance Act 2015 also enacted a change in the supplementary charge tax rate, reducing it from 32% to 20% with effect from 1 January 2015 
and a change to the petroleum revenue tax rate, reducing it from 50% to 35% with effect from 1 January 2016. The impact of the change in 
tax rate in 2015 was an increase in the tax credit of US$58,157,000.
(f) Factors affecting future tax charges
Finance Act 2015 replaced field allowances with a new investment allowance for expenditure incurred in the UKCS. The Group’s existing 
field allowances have been reclassified as investment allowances as at 1 April 2015. Additional investment spend from 1 April 2015 should 
generate further investment allowance which, when activated, will reduce future ring fence profits chargeable to Supplementary Charge.
8. Earnings per share
The calculation of earnings per share is based on the profit after tax and on the weighted average number of Ordinary shares in issue 
during the period. 
Potentially issuable ordinary shares are excluded from the diluted earnings per Ordinary share calculation, as their inclusion would decrease 
the loss per Ordinary share.
Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated as follows:

On 28 August 2015, the Group completed the sale and leaseback of its Aberdeen property, Annan House for US$69,525,000 resulting in 
a loss on disposal of US$8,473,000. 
The change in carry liabilities is principally due to management’s reassessment of 2P reserves to be used in the calculation for the Kraken 
carry provision resulting in a derecognition of the US$80,000,000 provision (see note 22). In addition, there has been a change in the 
estimate required for the Malaysian cost carry of US$1,955,000 (see note 20(f)).
On 12 October 2015, the Scolty/Crathes field received Field Development Plan (FDP) approval. Costs of US$16,052,000 previously held 
within exploration assets have been reclassified as a tangible oil and gas asset.
In March 2014, the Group completed the acquisition of Centrica North Sea Oil Limited (Centrica’s) share of the UKCS Greater Kittiwake 
Area (GKA) assets as well as its 100% interest in the Kittiwake to Forties oil export pipeline. In June 2014, EnQuest completed the 
acquisition of ExxonMobil Exploration and Production Malaysia Inc’s (ExxonMobil’s) interest in the Seligi oil field and the PM8 PSC, 
located offshore Malaysia. The costs relating to these acquisitions are included within ‘Acquired’ costs.
The impairment charge in the year ended 31 December 2015, relate to Heather/Broom (US$120,291,000), Thistle (US$263,061,000), 
Dons (US$182,433,000), Alma/Galia (US$595,542,000), Alba (US$25,324,000), all part of the UKCS CGU and also a charge relating to the 
Malaysian asset, Tanjong Baram (US$7,813,000) These assets have recoverable amounts of US$55,964,000, US$100,861,000, US$13,168,000, 
US$215,250,000, US$(1,327,000) and US$70,731,000 respectively. The impairment was principally due to the continuing fall in the oil price 
during 2015 and the resulting reduction in future revenues and 2P reserves, together with the impact of cutting the capital programme, in 
response to the changing economic conditions. For information on significant estimates and judgements made in relation to impairments

10. Property, plant and equipment continued
During the year ended 31 December 2014, there were impairments in the Alma/Galia and Don fields of US$678,801,000 (US$256,896,000 
on a post tax basis). The impairment was principally due to the significant fall in the oil price in the latter part of 2014. Other factors 
contributing to the impairment included delays in first oil and cost increases in the case of Alma/Galia, together with the impact of cutting 
the capital programme, in response to the changing economic conditions. The only asset with a material impairment was Alma/Galia, where 
it was written down by US$675,600,000 to the estimate of its recoverable value of US$832,900,000. 
The net book value at 31 December 2015 includes US$1,009,842,000 (2014: US$1,504,172,000) of pre-development assets and 
development assets under construction which are not being depreciated. 
The amount of borrowing costs capitalised during the year ended 31 December 2015 was US$14,372,000 (2014: US$3,169,000) and relate 
to the Alma/Galia and Kraken development projects as well as the construction of the new office building. The weighted average rate used 
to determine the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation is 2.03% (2014: 1.54%).
The net book value of property, plant and equipment held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts at 31 December 2015 was 
US$141,000 (2014: US$141,000) of oil and gas assets.

At 1 January and 31 December – –
Net carrying amount 189,317 189,317
The balance at 1 January 2014 represents goodwill acquired on the acquisition of Stratic and PEDL in 2010. The additions during the year 
ended 31 December 2014 represent the acquisition of the Greater Kittiwake Area asset in 2014. 
Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated to a single cash-generating unit (CGU), the UKCS, and therefore the 
lowest level that goodwill is reviewed. 
Impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill 
In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, goodwill and oil and gas assets have been reviewed for impairment at the year end. In 
assessing whether goodwill and oil and gas assets have been impaired, the carrying amount of the CGU for goodwill and at field level for 
oil and gas assets, is compared with their recoverable amounts. 
The recoverable amounts of the CGU and fields have been determined on a fair value less costs to sell basis. Discounted cash flow models 
comprising asset-by-asset life of field projections using Level 3 inputs (based on IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy) have been used to determine 
the recoverable amounts. The cash flows have been modelled on a post-tax and post-decommissioning basis discounted at the Group’s 
post-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 8.45% (2014: 8.8%). Risks specific to assets within the CGU are reflected within the 
cash flow forecasts. 
Key assumptions used in calculations
The key assumptions required for the calculation of the CGU are:
 o oil prices;
 o production volumes;
 o discount rates; and 
 o opex, capex and decommissioning costs. 
Oil prices are based on dated Brent forward price curves for the first three years and thereafter at US$70 per barrel inflated at 2% per 
annum from 2020. 
Production volumes are based on life of field production profiles for each asset within the CGU. The production volumes used in the 
calculations were taken from the report prepared by the Group’s independent reserve assessment experts.
Opex, capital expenditure and decommissioning costs are derived from the Group’s Business Plan adjusted for changes in timing based on 
the production model used for the assessment of 2P reserves.
Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued
For the year ended 31 December 2015 Financials 115
EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
The discount rate reflects management’s estimate of the Group’s WACC. The WACC takes into account both debt and equity. The cost 
of equity is derived from the expected return on investment by the Group’s investors. The cost of debt is based on its interest-bearing 
borrowings. Segment risk is incorporated by applying a beta factor based on publicly available market data. The post-tax discount rate 
applied to the Group’s post-tax cash flow projections was 8.45%. 
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
The Group’s value is highly sensitive, inter alia, to oil price achieved and production volumes. The recoverable amount (NPV) of the CGU 
would be equal to the carrying amount of goodwill if either the oil price or production volumes (on a CGU weighted average basis) were 
to fall by 10% from the prices outlined above. Goodwill would need to be fully impaired if the oil price or production volumes (on a CGU 
weighted average basis) were to fall by 35% from the prices outlined above. The above sensitivities have flexed revenues and tax cash 
flows, but operating costs and capital expenditures have been kept constant. In reality, management would be highly likely to take steps to 
mitigate the value impact of further falls in the oil price by cutting supply chain costs.

On 10 September 2015, the Group acquired an additional 10% working interest in the Scolty/Crathes field. On FDP approval in October 
2015, the total exploration costs of Scolty/Crathes were reclassified to tangible oil and gas assets (note 10).
In October 2015, the Group disposed of its 35% interest in the Norwegian licences PL 758 and PL800 and its 50% interest in the PL760 and 
PL760B for US$2,065,000, resulting in a loss of US$2,264,000. In November 2014 the Group disposed of its Dutch asset P8a for 
US$2,162,000 resulting in a gain of US$2,019,000.
In 2015, the Group exited from its interest in Egypt and costs of US$5,000,000 refunded are included within disposal of interests in 
licences above.
In the year ended 31 December 2015, costs were written off primarily in relation to the Cairngorm and Elke licences.
On 31 October 2015, the Group completed its withdrawal from SB307/308 blocks in Malaysia. Costs associated with SB307 and SB308 were 
impaired in the year ended 31 December 2014.
The impairment charge for the year ended 31 December 2014 included costs relating to Crawford Porter, Kildrummy, Cairngorm and some 
GKA acreage in the UK. In current market conditions some of those interests do not merit sufficient funds to progress them to economic 
development. In addition, costs relating to the SB307 and SB308 blocks in Malaysia (due to the unsuccessful exploration well) and costs 
incurred since acquisition on the NWO block in Egypt were impaired. The costs relating to the South West Heather licence were 
also impaired. 
Included within the acquisition of the GKA assets are exploration licences and an allocation of the fair value is included in acquisition 
of interests above for the year ended 31 December 2014. Financials 116

The investment relates to ordinary shares in Ascent acquired in 2011. In November 2015, Ascent agreed a capital re-organisation whereby 
new shares were issued and the share capital was re-denominated. The impact was to reduce EnQuest’s holding from 160,903,958 0.1p 
ordinary shares to 8,045,198 0.2p ordinary shares. 
The accounting valuation of the Group’s shareholding (based on the quoted share price of Ascent) resulted in an additional non-cash 
impairment of US$566,000 in the year to 31 December 2015 (2014: impairment of US$1,714,000).

was necessary (2014: nil). 
Joint venture receivables relate to billings to joint venture partners and were not impaired. 
Under-lift is valued at net realisable value being the lower of cost and net realisable value.
As at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014 no other receivables were determined to be impaired. 
The carrying value of the Group’s trade, joint venture and other receivables as stated above is considered to be a reasonable approximation 
to their fair value largely due to their short term maturities. Financials 117

The share capital comprises only one class of Ordinary share. Each Ordinary share carries an equal voting right and right to a dividend.
There were no new issues of shares during 2015 or 2014.
At 31 December 2015 there were 26,702,378 shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust (2014: 29,691,691), the decrease is due to shares 
used to satisfy awards made under the Company’s share-based incentive schemes. 
18. Share-based payment plans
On 18 March 2010, the Directors of the Company approved three share schemes for the benefit of Directors and employees, being a 
Deferred Bonus Share Plan, a Restricted Share Plan and a Performance Share Plan. A Sharesave Plan was approved in 2012. The grant 
values for all schemes are based on the average share price from the three days preceding the date of grant.
Deferred Bonus Share Plan (DBSP)
Selected employees are eligible to participate under this scheme. Participants may be invited to elect or, in some cases, be required, to 
receive a proportion of any bonus in Ordinary shares of EnQuest (invested awards). Following such award, EnQuest will generally grant 
the participant an additional award over a number of shares bearing a specified ratio to the number of his or her invested shares (matching 
shares). The awards granted will vest 33% on the first anniversary of the date of grant, a further 33% after year two and the final 34% on the 
third anniversary of the date of grant. The invested awards are fully recognised as an expense in the period to which the bonuses relate. 
The costs relating to the matching shares are recognised over the vesting period and the fair values of the equity-settled matching shares 
granted to employees are based on quoted market prices adjusted for the trued up percentage vesting rate of the plan.
Details of the fair values and assumed vesting rates of the DBSP scheme are shown below:

Restricted Share Plan (RSP)
Under the Restricted Share Plan scheme, employees are granted shares in EnQuest over a discretionary vesting period at the direction 
of the Remuneration Committee of the Board of Directors of EnQuest, which may or may not be subject to the satisfaction of performance 
conditions. Awards made under the RSP will vest over periods between one and four years. At present there are no performance conditions 
applying to this scheme nor is there currently any intention to introduce them in the future. The fair value of the awards granted under the 
plan at various grant dates during the year are based on quoted market prices adjusted for an assumed vesting rate over the relevant 
vesting period.

The charge recognised in the year ended 31 December 2015 amounted to US$879,000 (2014: US$1,637,000). 
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
Under the Performance Share Plan, the shares vest subject to performance conditions. The PSP share awards granted had three sets of 
performance conditions associated with them. One third of the award relates to Total Shareholder Return (TSR) against a comparator group 
of 36 oil and gas companies listed on the FTSE 350, AIM Top 100 and Stockholm NASDAQ OMX; one third relates to production growth per 
share; and one third relates to reserves growth per share, over the three year performance period. Awards will vest on the third anniversary.
The fair value of the awards granted under the plan at various grant dates during the year are based on quoted market prices adjusted for 
an assumed vesting rate over the relevant vesting period.

Sharesave plan
The Group operates an approved savings related share option scheme. The plan is based on eligible employees being granted options and 
their agreement to opening a sharesave account with a nominated savings carrier and to save over a specified period, either three or five 
years. The right to exercise the option is at the employee’s discretion at the end of the period previously chosen, for a period of six months.

19. Loans and borrowings
Revolving credit facility
At 31 December 2015, the Group had a six year US$1,700,000,000 multi-currency revolving credit facility, comprising of a committed 
amount of US$1,200,000,000 (subject to the level of reserves) with a further US$500,000,000 available through an accordion structure.
Interest on the revolving credit facility is payable at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.50% to 4.25%, dependent on specified covenant ratios. 
At 31 December 2015, US$902,277,000 was drawn down under the Group’s facility agreement (2014: US$217,649,000) and LoC utilisation 
was US$7,718,000 (2014: US$149,395,000). Unamortised facility fees of US$19,167,000 have been netted off against the drawdowns in the 
balance sheet (2014: US$24,168,000).
Tanjong Baram project finance loan
During the year ended 31 December 2015, the Group entered a five year US$35,000,000 loan facility in Malaysia. Interest is payable at USD 
LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25%. Unamortised fees of US$886,000 have been netted off against the loan balance in the balance sheet.
Bonds
In April 2014, the Group issued a US$650,000,000 high yield bond which matures in 2022 and pays a coupon of 7% payable bi-annually 
in April and October. The bond is carried at its amortised cost of US$651,120,000 (2014: US$651,077,000). 
At 31 December 2015, the Group also had a 5.5% Sterling Retail Bond of £155,245,000. The bond pays a coupon of 5.5% payable 
bi-annually in February and August and matures in 2022. The bond had a fair value of US$95,508,000 (2014: US$169,010,000) but is 
carried at its amortised cost of US$231,480,000 (2014: US$244,173,000). The fair value of the Sterling Retail Bond has been determined 
by reference to the price available from the market on which the bond is traded. Financials 120

(b) Commodity contracts
The Group uses put and call options and swap contracts to manage its exposure to the oil price. 
Oil price hedging
Purchased put options are designated as hedges of the Group’s production. Where these contracts are effective from a hedge accounting 
perspective, any intrinsic value gains are deferred until such time as the production to which they relate is sold. Movements in the time 
value of these options are recognised in finance costs. A total of 10,000,000 barrels of 2015 production, was hedged via the purchase of 
put options, with a strike price of US$65/bbl. Gains totalling US$127,846,000 were included in realised revenue in the income statement 
in respect of these matured options. A total of 10,000,000 barrels of 2016 production was hedged via similar contracts, with strike prices 
of between US$67/bbl and US$69/bbl. During July 2015 the Group closed put options which were hedging 2,000,000 barrels of 2016 
production, realising US$16,755,000 in cash, and replaced these with oil swap contracts to sell 2,000,000 barrels in 2016 at a fixed price 
of US$67/bbl.
As at 31 December 2015 the Group held put options over 8,000,000 bbls maturing in 2016. The mark to market of the intrinsic value portion 
of these contracts at 31 December 2015 was US$217,160,000, which has been deferred as it relates to contracts hedging future production. 
Mark to market losses on the time value element of these put options, totalling US$119,791,000 have been recognised in finance costs. Of 
this amount, US$70,022,000 has been recognised within the Group’s ‘business performance’ results as it relates to the amortisation of the 
option premium paid, over the life of the option. The balance of the mark to market losses have been recognised as an exceptional charge 
in line with the Group’s accounting policy.
The fair value of the put options as at 31 December 2015 was US$164,763,000.
In addition, in 2014 gains totalling US$119,054,689 were realised when put options hedging 8,000,000 bbls of 2015 production were closed. 
This gain was deferred in cash flow hedge reserves as at 31 December 2014. This has been realised to revenue during the year ended 
31 December 2015. 
Commodity derivative contracts at fair value through profit and loss
Commodity derivative contracts not designated as effective hedges are designated as ‘At Fair Value Through Profit and Loss’ (‘FVTPL’), and 
gains and losses on these contracts are recognised as a component of revenue. These contracts typically include bought and sold call 
options, sold put options and commodity swap contracts. 
For the year ended 31 December 2015, gains totalling US$19,576,000 were recognised in respect of commodity contracts designated as 
FVTPL. This included losses totalling US$94,847,000 realised on contracts that matured during the year ended 31 December 2015, and 
mark to market gains totalling US$114,423,000. Of this amount, US$111,572,000 was realised in business performance revenue in respect 
of the amortisation of premium income received on sale of these options. The premiums received are amortised into business performance 
revenue over the life of the option. The balance, being a gain of US$2,851,000 was recognised in exceptional revenue in line with the 
Group’s accounting policy.
In H2 2015, the Group sold put options held with a strike price of US$65/bbl over a total of 4,164,333 barrels maturing in August – 
December 2015, for proceeds totalling US$31,402,000.
Business performance revenue for the year ended 31 December 2015 included US$10,441,000 of call option premium on options closed 
early, which would have been recognised in 2016 had these options not been closed early. The cost of closing these options was 
US$1,350,000 which was included in business performance revenue for the year ended 31 December 2015.
The mark to market of the Group’s open contracts as at 31 December 2014 was a loss of US$36,227,000 in respect of option contracts and a 
gain of US$3,670,000 in respect of open swap positions. The option contract mark to market was in respect of net sold call options over a 
total of 10,246,150 barrels, maturing in 2015 with an average strike price of US$96.94/bbl, and 7,498,199 barrels of net sold call options 
maturing during 2016 with an average strike price of US$99.36/bbl. 
(c) Forward foreign currency contracts
During the year ended 31 December 2015 various forward currency contracts were entered into to hedge the Group’s exposure to Euro, 
Norwegian Kroner and Sterling opex and capex. At 31 December 2015, the contracts which do not qualify for hedge accounting have a net 
liability fair value of US$8,143,000 (2014: US$10,397,000) and those which do qualify for hedge accounting have a net liability fair value of 
US$1,023,000 (2014: nil). The gains/losses recognised in the income statement are US$2,254,000 unrealised gain (31 December 2014: 
US$18,085,000 unrealised loss) and US$3,169,000 realised loss (2014: US$55,273,000 realised gain) within cost of sales.
(d) Interest rate swap
During the year ended 31 December 2015, the Group entered an interest rate swap which effectively swaps 50% of floating USD LIBOR rate 
interest on the Malaysian loan into a fixed rate of 1.035% until 2018. The swap which is effective from a hedge accounting perspective has a 
net asset fair value of US$47,000. The impact on the income statement is US$31,000 recognised within finance expenses. Financials 122

Other receivables
As part of the 2012 farm-out to KUFPEC of 35% of the Alma/Galia development, KUFPEC agreed to pay EnQuest a total of US$23,292,000 
over a 36 month period after Alma/Galia is deemed to be fully operational, the fair value of which was US$19,300,000. The balance of the 
receivable at 31 December 2015 is US$22,647,000 (2014: US$22,103,000). The unwinding of discount of US$544,000 is included within 
finance income for the year ended 31 December 2015 (2014: US$877,000). 
During the year, contingent consideration receivable on the disposal of the Slovenian Petisovci asset to Ascent in 2011 was converted into 
a convertible loan note. The fair value of the convertible loan note at 31 December 2015 is US$250,000 (2014: nil). The loan note is due to 
mature in November 2016.
Other liabilities
The consideration for the acquisition of 40% of the Kraken field from Cairn (previously Nautical) and First Oil in 2012 was through 
development carries. These were split into a ‘firm’ carry and a ‘contingent’ carry dependent upon reserves determination. The firm carry 
expired in 2015 (2014: liability US$66,502,000). The ‘contingent’ carry has been accounted for as a provision (note 22).
As part of the agreement to acquire the PM8 assets in Malaysia, the Group agreed to carry PETRONAS Carigali for its share of exploration 
or appraisal well commitments. The discounted value of US$7,657,000 has been disclosed as a financial liability (2014: US$5,379,000). The 
unwinding of discount of US$323,000 is included within finance expense for the year ended 31 December 2015 (2014: US$132,000).
The fair value of the Group’s oil price related embedded derivatives is US$30,000 (2014: nil). Financials 123

Provision for decommissioning
The Group makes full provision for the future costs of decommissioning its oil production facilities and pipelines on a discounted basis. 
With respect to the Heather field, the decommissioning provision is based on the Group’s contractual obligation of 37.5% of the 
decommissioning liability rather than the Group’s equity interest in the field.
The provision represents the present value of decommissioning costs which are expected to be incurred up to 2034 assuming no further 
development of the Group’s assets. The liability is discounted at a rate of 3.0% (2014: 3.0%). The unwinding of the discount is classified as a 
finance cost (note 6). Financials 125
EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
These provisions have been created based on internal and third party estimates. Assumptions based on the current economic environment 
have been made which management believe are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability. These estimates are 
reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions. However, actual decommissioning costs will ultimately 
depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required which will reflect market conditions at the relevant 
time. Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning liabilities is likely to depend on the dates when the fields cease to be economically 
viable. This in turn depends on future oil prices which are inherently uncertain.
Carry provision
Consideration for the acquisition of 40% of the Kraken field from Cairn (previously Nautical) and First Oil in 2012 was through development 
carries. The ‘contingent’ carry is dependent upon a reserves determination which is due to commence in April 2016. The ‘contingent’ carry 
is pro-rated between 100 and 166 million barrels of proven and probable reserves (2P reserves). The agreement specifies that the dated 
Brent forward curve at the date of the determination is to be used to determine the reserves of Kraken for the purpose of determining the 
contingent carry. A provision of US$80,000,000 was recognised in 2013 when the FDP was approved which stated 137 million barrels. 
Following the significant decline in the oil price, management’s view is that no payment will be required under the acquisition agreement. 
Accordingly the provision has been reversed in full with a corresponding credit to PP&E. Whilst management’s view is that no contingent 
carry will be payable, the reserves determination will be performed by an independent reserves assessor and accordingly the risk remains a 
payment could be required.
Cost recovery provision
As part of the KUFPEC farm-in agreement, a cost recovery protection mechanism was agreed with KUFPEC to enable KUFPEC to recoup its 
investment to the date of first production. If on 1 January 2017, KUFPEC’s costs to first production have not been recovered or deemed to 
have been recovered, EnQuest will pay to KUFPEC an additional 20% share of net revenue. This additional revenue is to be paid from 
January 2017 until the capital costs to first production have been recovered. 
A provision has been made for the expected payments that the Group will make to KUFPEC. The assumptions made in arriving at the 
projected cash payments are consistent with the assumptions used in the Group’s 2015 year end impairment test, and the resulting cash 
flows were included in the determination of the recoverable value of the project. In establishing when KUFPEC has recovered its capital 
cost to first oil, the farm-in agreement requires the use of the higher of the actual oil price, or $90/bbl real, inflated at 2% per annum from 
2012. These cash flows have been discounted at a rate of 3.0% (2014: 3.0%).
The provision required at 31 December 2014 was netted within the balance of property, plant & equipment as at 31 December 2014. The 
31 December 2014 figures presented above have been restated to show the provision separately from the property, plant & equipment 
balance (see also note 10).
Contingent consideration
As part of the purchase agreement with the previous owner of the GKA assets, a contingent consideration has been agreed based on 
Scolty/Crathes Field Development Plan (FDP) approval and ‘first oil’. EnQuest paid US$3,000,000 in November 2015 as FDP approval was 
achieved in October 2015. US$9,000,000 is due on the later of first oil or 30 January 2017 and US$8,000,000 due on the later of one year 
after first oil or 30 January 2018. In addition further payments will become due if the oil price rises above $75 per barrel on a linear basis up 
to $100 per barrel, up to a cap of US$20,000,000. The cashflows have been discounted using a 3.0% discount rate.
Surplus lease provision
In June 2015, the Group entered a 20 year lease in respect of the Group’s office building in Aberdeen with part of the building 
subsequently being sub-let with a rent free incentive. A provision has been recognised for the unavoidable costs in relation to the sub-let 
space. The provision has been discounted using a 3.0% discount rate. At 31 December 2015, the provision was US$3,469,000.
In addition, the Group has an agreement to hire the Stena Spey drilling vessel in 2016. Based on the current drilling forecasts for 2016, the 
vessel will not be fully utilised over this period and at 31 December 2015, a provision has been recognised for the unavoidable costs of 
US$22,948,000.

23. Trade and other payables continued
Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are normally settled on terms of between 10 and 30 days. During the year the Group 
entered contracts with various suppliers to defer payment of a proportion of its spend on the Kraken and Scolty/Crathes developments 
in accordance with meeting certain milestones. The balance of these deferred payments as at 31 December 2015 will be settled in the 
latter part of 2016. Certain trade and other payables will be settled in currencies other than the reporting currency of the Group, mainly 
in Sterling.
Accrued expenses include accruals for capital and operating expenditure in relation to the oil and gas assets.
The carrying value of the Group’s trade and other payables as stated above is considered to be a reasonable approximation to their fair 
value largely due to the short term maturities.
24. Commitments and contingencies
Commitments
(i) Operating lease commitments – lessee
The Group has financial commitments in respect of non-cancellable operating leases for office premises. These leases have remaining 
non-cancellable lease terms of between one and 20 years. The future minimum rental commitments under these non-cancellable leases are 
as follows:
2015
US$’000
2014
US$’000
Not later than one year 5,694 2,031
After one year but not more than five years 20,926 3,733
Over five years 85,631 1,335
112,251 7,099
Lease payments recognised as an operating lease expense during the year amounted to US$4,062,000 (2014: US$3,086,000). 
Under the Dons Northern Producer Agreement a minimum notice period of 12 months exists whereby the Group expects the minimum 
commitment under this agreement to be approximately US$8,348,000 (2014: US$13,976,000).
(ii) Operating lease commitments – lessor
The Group sub-leases part of its Aberdeen office. The future minimum rental commitments under these non-cancellable leases are 
as follows:
2015

The leases are fixed rate leases with an effective borrowing rate of 2.37% (2014: 2.37%) and is repayable in 2016.
On 20 December 2013, the Group entered into a bareboat charter with Armada Kraken PTE Limited (Armada) for the lease of an FPSO 
vessel for the Kraken field. The lease will commence on the date of first production which is currently targeted to come onstream by 2017. 
Armada will construct the vessel and the Group incurred an initial payment of US$100,000,000 which was paid during 2014. Financials 127
EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
(iv) Capital commitments
At 31 December 2015, the Group had capital commitments excluding the above lease commitments amounting to US$433,496,000 (2014: 
US$788,259,000).
Contingencies
There is deferred consideration of US$3,000,000 dependent on FDP approval in relation to the 20% interest in Kildrummy acquired from 
ENI UK Limited during the year ended 31 December 2012, the costs of this well were impaired in 2014.
In the ordinary course of business there is a risk of disputes with partners, suppliers or customers relating to matters such as cost overruns, 
service provision or contractual terms. Should disputes emerge and become subject to formal legal proceedings the Group could face 
liabilities in the event of adverse determinations. 
A counterparty has initiated a legal claim against the Group alleging breach of a contractual warranty. The Group considers the merits 
of the claim to be poor and the Group intends to vigorously defend itself. In the unlikely event that the claim is successful, the Group 
considers the most likely range for the quantum of any damages award to be between nil and US$20,000,000 (and unlikely to have a 
significant effect on the Group’s consolidated financial position or results). The Group anticipates that in the unlikely event of any trial 
running to a judgement against the Group, no payment of any damages award is likely to be required before 2018.
25. Related party transactions
The Group financial statements include the financial statements of EnQuest PLC and its subsidiaries. A list of the Group’s principal 
subsidiaries is contained in note 28 to these Group financial statements.
Balances and transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and 
are not disclosed in this note. 
All sales to and purchases from related parties are made at normal market prices and the pricing policies and terms of these transactions 
are approved by the Group’s management. There have been no transactions with related parties who are not members of the Group during 
the year ended 31 December 2015 (2014: nil).

26. Risk management and financial instruments
Risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s principal financial assets and liabilities comprise trade and other receivables, cash and short term deposits, interest-bearing 
loans, borrowings and finance leases, derivative financial instruments and trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial 
instruments is to manage short term cash flow and raise finance for the Group’s capital expenditure programme.
The Group’s activities expose it to various financial risks particularly associated with fluctuations in oil price, foreign currency risk, liquidity 
risk and credit risk. Management reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below. Also 
presented below is a sensitivity analysis to indicate sensitivity to changes in market variables on the Group’s financial instruments and to 
show the impact on profit and shareholders’ equity, where applicable. The sensitivity has been prepared for periods ended 31 December 
2015 and 2014 using the amounts of debt and other financial assets and liabilities held at those reporting dates.
Commodity price risk – oil prices
The Group is exposed to the impact of changes in Brent oil prices on its revenues and profits generated from sales of crude oil. 
The Group’s policy is to have the ability to hedge oil prices up to a maximum of 75% of the next 12 months production on a rolling annual 
basis, up to 60% in the following 12 month period and 50% in the subsequent 12 month period.
Details of the commodity derivative contracts entered into during, and on hand at the end of 2015, are disclosed in note 20. Financials 128

Foreign currency risk
The Group has transactional currency exposures. Such exposure arises from sales or purchases in currencies other than the Group’s 
functional currency and the bond which is denominated in Sterling. To mitigate the risks of large fluctuations in the currency markets, the 
hedging policy agreed by the Board allows for up to 70% of non-US Dollar portion of the Group’s annual capital budget and operating 
expenditure to be hedged. For specific contracted capital expenditure projects, up to 100% can be hedged. Approximately 1% (2014: 1%) 
of the Group’s sales and 99% (2014: 91%) of costs are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.
During the year ended 31 December 2015 various forward currency contracts and structured products were entered into to hedge the 
Groups exposure to Euro, Norwegian Krone and Sterling opex and capex. 
In January 2015, knockout forwards were entered to mitigate the foreign currency risk arising on the £307,000,000 of Sterling based capex 
expenditure of the Group. Between the range US$1.505 and US$1.42, they trade at spot, outwith this range EnQuest trades at US$1.505. 
Should the rate rise above US$1.611 then there is no trade. The contracts mature between January 2015 and February 2016.
Also in January 2015, EnQuest entered into a series of FX forward contracts to purchase £283,297,000 to fund the Group’s opex Sterling 
expenditure. EnQuest will trade at spot between the range US$1.532 and US$1.42, out with this range EnQuest will trade at US$1.532. 
The contracts mature between February 2015 and October 2016. 
In March 2015, EnQuest entered a series of FX forward contracts to purchase €32,556,000 of the Group’s Euro capex expenditure 
specifically in relation to the Kraken development project. EnQuest will trade at spot when the Euro/USD rate is between US$1.195 and 
US$0.97. Outwith this range EnQuest will trade at US$1.1195. 
Also in 2015 two NOK forwards totalling NOK74,580,000 were entered into with an average strike price of NOK7.84:£1, these will mature 
in August and November 2016.
In prior years the Group entered into a series of forward contracts and structured products to hedge a portion of its Sterling, Euro and 
Norwegian Krone exposure. In 2014, a total of £182,000,000 of Sterling exposure was hedged using this structured product with an 
average strike price of US$1.46:£1. The remaining contracts matured during 2015. 
The same structure was also used to hedge the Group’s Norwegian Krone (NOK) exposure arising as part of the Kraken development 
project. In 2014, a total of NOK367,000,000 was hedged and any remaining contracts matured during 2015.
Also during 2014, EnQuest entered several foreign exchange swap contracts when Sterling was trading above $1.66:£1. The realised impact 
of US$46,756,000 was recognised in the income statement within cost of sales in the year ended 31 December 2014.
The following table summarises the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the United States Dollar to Sterling foreign exchange rate, 
with all other variables held constant, of the Group’s profit before tax due to changes in the carrying value of monetary assets and liabilities 
at the reporting date. The impact in equity is the same as the impact on profit before tax. The Group’s exposure to foreign currency 
changes for all other currencies is not material:

Credit risk
Credit risk is managed on a Group basis. Credit risk in financial instruments arises from cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial 
instruments where the Group’s exposure arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of 
these instruments (see maturity table within liquidity risks). For banks and financial institutions, only those rated with a A-/A3 credit rating or 
better are accepted. Cash balances can be invested in short term bank deposits and AAA-rated liquidity funds, subject to Board approved 
limits and with a view to minimising counterparty credit risks. Financials 129
EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
In addition there are credit risks of commercial counterparties including exposures in respect of outstanding receivables. The Group trades 
only with recognised international oil and gas operators and at 31 December 2015 there were no trade receivables past due (2014: nil), 
US$1,480,000 of joint venture receivables past due (2014: US$490,000) and nil (2014: US$1,955,000) of other receivables past due but 
not impaired. Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with appropriate follow-up action taken where necessary.

At 31 December 2015, the Group had three customers accounting for 65% of outstanding trade and other receivables (2014: three 
customers, 89%) and five joint venture partners accounting for 98% of joint venture receivables (2014: three joint venture partners, 95%). 
Liquidity risk
The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds by reviewing its cash flow requirements on a regular basis relative to its existing bank 
facilities and the maturity profile of these facilities. Specifically the Group’s policy is to ensure that sufficient liquidity or committed facilities 
exist within the Group to meet its operational funding requirements and to ensure the Group can service its debt and adhere to its financial 
covenants. During 2015, the Group complied with the financial ratios applicable for the period as allowed for by its revolving credit facility. 
In light of recent low oil prices and in order to provide flexibility for EnQuest’s capital investment programme, the revolving credit facility 
lending banks agreed to relax existing credit facility covenants. The net debt/EBITDA covenant was increased to five times and the ratio of 
financial charges to EBITDA was reduced to three times, both until mid-2017. The financial covenants of the retail bond were subsequently 
made consistent with the amended covenants in the revolving credit facility.
At 31 December 2015, the Group held a six year US$1,700,000,000 multi-currency revolving credit facility, comprising of a committed 
amount of US$1,200,000,000 with a further US$500,000,000 available through an accordion structure. 
The maturity profiles of the Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities including projected interest thereon are as follows:

Capital management
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 19, cash and cash equivalents and 
equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as in the Group Statement 
of Changes in Equity on page 92.
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to optimise the return on investment, by managing its capital structure to 
achieve capital efficiency whilst also maintaining flexibility. The Group regularly monitors the capital requirements of the business over the 
short, medium and long term, in order to enable it to foresee when additional capital will be required. Note 19 to the financial statements 
provides further details of the Group’s financing activity.
The Group has approval from the Board to hedge foreign exchange risk on up to 70% of the non-US Dollar portion of the Group’s annual 
capital budget and operating expenditure. For specific contracted capex projects, up to 100% can be hedged. In addition, there is approval 
from the Board to hedge up to 75% of annual production in year 1, 60% in year 2 and 50% in year 3. This is designed to minimise the risk of 
adverse movements in exchange rates and prices eroding the return on the Group’s projects and operations.
The Board regularly reassesses the existing dividend policy to ensure that shareholder value is maximised. Any future payment of dividends 
is expected to depend on the earnings and financial condition of the Company and such other factors as the Board considers appropriate.
The Group monitors capital using the gearing ratio and return on shareholders’ equity as follows:

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities for the 
Parent Company Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected to 
prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under Company law the 
Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of 
the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. 
In preparing the financial statements the Directors are required to:
 o select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
 o make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
 o state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
 o prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that 
the Company financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities. Financials 133

Notes to the Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 December 2015
1. Corporate information
The Company financial statements of EnQuest PLC (the ‘Company’) 
for the year ended 31 December 2015 were authorised for issue in 
accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 16 March 2016.
EnQuest PLC (‘EnQuest’ or the ‘Company’) is a limited liability 
Company registered in England and is the holding Company for the 
Group of EnQuest subsidiaries (together the ‘Group’). 
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The separate financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced 
Disclosure Framework (FRS 101). These financial statements are 
prepared under the historical cost basis and in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. The functional and presentation currency of 
the separate financial statements is United States Dollars and all 
values in the separate financial statements are rounded to the 
nearest thousand (US$’000) except where otherwise stated.
The Company has transitioned to FRS 101 from previously extant UK 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice for all periods presented. 
Transition tables showing all material adjustments are disclosed in 
note 15.
No profit and loss account is presented by the Company as 
permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. The parent 
Company’s accounts present information about it as an individual 
undertaking and not about its Group. EnQuest reported a loss for 
the financial year ended 31 December 2015 of US$389,610,000 
(2014: loss US$17,027,000). There were no other recognised gains 
or losses in the period (2014: nil).
Going concern concept
The Directors’ assessment of going concern concludes that the 
use of the going concern basis is appropriate and that there are 
no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the 
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. See page  
44 in the Financial Review for further details.
The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which 
apply in preparing financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2015.
New standards and interpretations
There were no new and revised IFRS’s and interpretations which 
have impacted on the Company’s financial statements nor 
accounting policies.
Standards issued but not yet effective
Standards issued and relevant to the Company, but not yet effective 
up to the date of issuance of the Company’s financial statements, 
are listed below. This listing is of standards and interpretations 
issued, which the Company reasonably expects to be applicable at 
a future date. The Company intends to adopt these standards when 
they become effective. The Directors do not anticipate that the 
adoption of these standards will have a material impact on the 
Company’s accounts in the period of initial application.
Annual Improvements 2012-2014 Cycle
These improvements are effective for annual periods beginning on 
or after 1 January 2016 and are not expected to have any impact 
on the Company. They include: 
Amendments to IAS 1 Disclosure Initiative
The amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements 
clarify, rather than significantly change, existing IAS 1 requirements. 
The amendments clarify:
 o the materiality requirements in IAS 1;
 o that specific line items in the statement(s) of profit or loss and 
OCI and the statements of financial position may be 
disaggregated;
 o that entities have flexibility as to the order in which they present 
the notes to the financial statements; and
 o that the share of OCI of associates and joint ventures accounted 
for using the equity method must be presented in aggregate as a 
single line item, and classified between those items that will or 
will not be subsequently reclassified to profit or loss.
Furthermore, the amendments clarify the requirements that apply 
when additional subtotals are presented in the statement of financial 
position and the statements of profit or loss and OCI. These 
amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2016, with early adoption permitted. 
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The management of the Group has to make estimates and 
judgements when preparing the financial statements of the Group. 
Uncertainties in the estimates and judgements could have an impact 
on the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and the Group’s 
result. The most important estimates and judgements in relation 
thereto are:
Going concern
The going concern assumption is highly sensitive to economic 
conditions. The Company closely monitors and manages its 
funding position and liquidity risk throughout the year including 
monitoring forecast covenant results to ensure it has access to 
sufficient funds to meet forecast cash requirements. Cash forecasts 
are regularly produced and sensitivities considered for, but not 
limited to, changes in crude oil prices (adjusted for hedging 
undertaken by the Group), production rates and development 
project timing and costs. These forecasts and sensitivity analyses 
allow management to mitigate any liquidity or covenant compliance 
risks in a timely manner.
Impairment of investments in subsidiaries
Determination of whether investments have suffered any 
impairment requires an estimation of the assets recoverable 
value. The recoverable value is based on the discounted cashflows 
expected to arise from the subsidiaries oil and gas assets, using 
asset-by-asset life of field projections as part of the Group’s 
assessment for the impairment of the oil and gas assets. 
See Group critical accounting estimates and judgements. Financials 137
EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Taxation
The tax provision is prepared before the tax return is filed with 
the tax authority and, significantly, before these have been agreed. 
As a result, the tax provision process necessarily involves the use of 
a number of estimates and judgements including those required in 
calculating the effective tax rate.
The Company recognises deferred tax assets on unused tax losses 
where it is probable that future taxable profits will be available for 
utilisation. This requires management to make judgements and 
assumptions regarding the amount of deferred tax that can be 
recognised, as well as the likelihood of future taxable profits. 
Foreign currencies
Transactions in currencies other than the Company’s functional 
currency are recorded at the prevailing rate of exchange on the date 
of the transaction. At the year end, monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates of 
exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets 
and liabilities that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency 
are translated using the rate of exchange as at the dates of the initial 
transactions. Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at fair 
value in a foreign currency are translated using the rate of exchange 
at the date the fair value was determined. All foreign exchange gains 
and losses are taken to the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Classification and recognition of assets and liabilities
Current assets and current liabilities consist of amounts that are 
expected to be recovered or paid within twelve months after the 
balance sheet date and also include receivables where amounts are 
expected to be recovered more than twelve months after the 
balance sheet date. Non-current liabilities including provisions 
consist, for the most part, solely of amounts that are expected to 
be paid more than twelve months after the balance sheet date. 
Financial assets
Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, as financial assets 
at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-
maturity investments, available-for-sale financial investments, or as 
derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, 
as appropriate. All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value 
plus transaction costs, except in the case of financial assets recorded 
at fair value through profit or loss.
Subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their 
classification as described below:
 o financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
 o loans and receivables
 o held-to-maturity investments
 o available-for-sale financial assets
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)
Financial assets are classified as at FVTPL when the financial asset 
is either held for trading or designated as at FVTPL. 
Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or 
losses arising on remeasurement recognised immediately in the 
income statement.
Financial assets designated upon initial recognition at FVTPL are 
designated at their initial recognition date and only if the criteria 
under IAS 39 are satisfied.
Held-to-maturity investments
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments 
and fixed maturity are classified as held-to-maturity when the Group 
has the positive intention and ability to hold them to maturity. After 
initial measurement, held-to-maturity investments are measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method (EIR), less 
impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account 
any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an 
integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation and losses arising from 
impairment are included in the profit or loss. 
Available-for-sale financial investments
Listed and unlisted shares held by the Group that are traded in an 
active market are classified as being available-for-sale and are stated 
at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are 
recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the 
available-for-sale reserve with the exception of impairment losses 
which are recognised directly in profit or loss. Where the investment 
is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or 
loss previously recognised in the available-for-sale reserve is 
reclassified to profit or loss. 
Loans and receivables 
These include trade receivables, loans and other receivables 
that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in 
an active market and are measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, less any impairment. Interest income 
is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for 
short term receivables when the recognition of interest would 
be immaterial.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less any 
provision for impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash at bank, cash in hand, 
outstanding bank overdrafts and highly liquid interest bearing 
securities with original maturities of three months or less. 
Deferred tax
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount 
expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, 
based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences arising 
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the Company financial statements. Deferred tax is 
measured on an undiscounted basis using tax rates (and laws) that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet 
date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset 
is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets 
are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable 
profits will be available against which the temporary differences 
can be utilised.  Financials 138
EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary 
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests 
in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the 
reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at 
each balance sheet date. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
are offset, only if a legal right exists to offset current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities, the deferred income taxes relate 
to the same taxation authority and that authority permits the 
Company to make a single net payment.
Trade and other payables
Liabilities are recognised for amounts to be paid in the future for 
goods or services received, whether billed by the supplier or not.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are recognised initially at 
fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Transaction costs are 
amortised over the life of the facility.
Borrowing costs are stated at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the 
amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest 
expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the 
rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through 
the expected life of the financial liability, or a shorter period to the 
net carrying amount of the financial liability where appropriate. 
Bonds
Bonds are measured on an amortised cost basis. 
Employee Benefit Trust
EnQuest shares held by the Group are deducted from the share-
based payments reserve and are recognised at cost. Consideration 
received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with 
any difference between the proceeds from the sale and the original 
cost being taken to reserves. No gain or loss is recognised in the 
profit and loss account on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation 
of equity shares.
Share-based payment transactions
Employees (including Directors) of the Group receive remuneration in 
the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees 
render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares (equity-
settled transactions) of EnQuest.
Equity-settled transactions
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured 
by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted. 
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any 
service or performance conditions, other than conditions linked to 
the price of the shares of EnQuest (market conditions) or ‘non-
vesting’ conditions, if applicable.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised over the 
period in which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the 
award (the vesting period). The cumulative expense recognised for 
equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting 
date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and 
the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that 
will ultimately vest. The profit and loss account charge or credit for a 
period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised 
as at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, 
except for awards where vesting is conditional upon market or 
non-vesting conditions, which are treated as vesting irrespective 
of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, 
provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied. Equity 
awards cancelled are treated as vesting immediately on the date of 
cancellation, and any expense not recognised for the award at that 
date is recognised in the profit and loss account.
The Company operates a number of share award schemes on behalf 
of the employees of the Group which are described in detail within 
note 18 of the Group financial statements.
The reserve for the share-based payments is used to record 
the value of equity-settled share-based payments awarded to 
employees and transfers out of this reserve are made upon 
vesting of the original share awards.

During the year ended 31 December 2015, an impairment of the investment in the Company’s subsidiaries of US$374,892,000 has been 
recognised due to the continuing fall in the oil price during the year and the impact on the carrying value of the subsidiaries.
During the year ended 31 December 2014, the Company’s subsidiary EnQuest North Sea BV transferred its holding of shares in Ascent 
Resources plc at net book value. These are included within ‘other listed investments’. The Company also acquired subsidiary undertaking 
NSIP (GKA) Limited, owner and operator of the Kittiwake to Forties oil export pipeline, as part of the Company’s acquisition of Greater 
Kittiwake Area assets from Centrica. On 16 December 2014, the Company transferred its investment in subsidiary EnQuest Norge AS to 
EnQuest Global Limited, another subsidiary entity.
During 2014, EnQuest North Sea BV was dissolved and therefore the investment previously impaired was written off.
Details of the Company’s subsidiaries at 31 December 2015 are provided in note 28 of the Group financial statements.
The interest in other listed investments at the end of the year is part of the Group’s 5.11% investment in the ordinary share capital of Ascent 
Resources plc, which is incorporated in Great Britain and registered in England and Wales. Refer to note 4 of the Group financial statements

The share capital comprises only one class of Ordinary share. Each Ordinary share carries an equal voting right and right to a dividend.
There were no new issues of shares during 2015 or 2014. 
At 31 December 2015 there were 26,702,378 shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust (2014: 29,691,691). The decrease is due to the use of 
shares to satisfy awards made under the Company’s share-based incentive schemes. 
10. Reserves
Share premium
The excess contribution over the nominal value on the issuance of shares is accounted for as share premium.
Merger reserve
The Company merger reserve is used to record the difference between the market value of EnQuest shares issued to effect the business 
combinations less the nominal value of the shares issued where merger relief applies to the transaction. The reserve is adjusted for any 
write down in the value of the investment in the subsidiary.
Other reserve
The other reserve is used to record any other transactions taken straight to reserves as non-distributable.
Share-based payments reserve
The reserve for share-based payments is used to record the value of equity-settled share-based payments awards to employees and the balance 
of the shares held by the Company’s Employee Benefit Trust. Transfers out of this reserve are made upon vesting of the original share awards.
Share-based payment plan information is disclosed in note 18 of the Group financial statements.

12. Risk management and financial instruments
Risk management objectives and policies
The Company’s activities expose it to various financial risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. 
Management reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks at a Group level and these are summarised below.
Foreign currency risk
The Company has transactional currency exposures. Such exposure arises from sales or purchases in currencies other than the Company’s 
functional currency. The Company manages this risk by converting US$ receipts at spot rates periodically and as required for payments in 
other currencies. Approximately 100% (2014: 100%) of costs are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.  Financials 142

Liquidity risk
The Company’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of funding from related 
parties to reduce its exposure to liquidity risk. The Company monitors its risk to a shortage of funds by reviewing its cash flow requirements 
on a regular basis relative to its liquid balances with related parties.

Capital management
The capital structure of the Company consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 19, cash and cash equivalents and 
equity attributable to the equity holders of the Company, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as in the Company 
Statement of Changes in Equity on page 134.
The primary objective of the Company’s capital management is to optimise the return on investment, by managing its capital structure to 
achieve capital efficiency whilst also maintaining flexibility for future acquisitions. The Company regularly monitors the capital requirements 
of the business over the short, medium and long term, in order to enable it to foresee when additional capital will be required. Note 26 to 
the financial statements provides further details of the Company’s financing activity.
The Board regularly reassesses the existing dividend policy to ensure that shareholder value is maximised. Any future payment of dividends 
is expected to depend on the earnings and financial condition of the Company and such other factors as the Board considers appropriate.
The Group monitors capital using the gearing ratio and return on shareholders’ equity as follows:

Refer to note 27 of the Group financial statements.
15. Transition to FRS 101
For all periods up to and including year ended 31 December 2014, the Company prepared its financial statements in accordance with 
previously extant United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP). These financial statements, for the year ended 
31 December 2015, are the first the Company has prepared in accordance with FRS 101.
Accordingly, the Company has prepared individual financial statements which comply with FRS 101 applicable for years beginning on or 
after 1 January 2014 and the significant accounting policies meeting these requirements are described in the relevant notes.
In preparing these financial statements, the Company has started from an opening balance sheet as at 1 January 2014, the Company’s date of 
transition to FRS 101, and made those changes in accounting policies and other restatements required for the first time adoption of FRS 101. 
As such, this note explains the principal adjustments made by the Company in restating its balance sheet as at 1 January 2014 prepared under 
previously extant UK GAAP and its previously published UK GAAP financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014.
On transition to FRS 101, the Company has applied the requirements of paragraphs 6-33 of IFRS 1 ‘First time adoption of International 
Financial Reporting Standards’.

(1) Valuation of financial assets
Previously under UK GAAP, investments are held at cost less provisions for any permanent diminution in value. Under IFRS, investments are 
initially recognised at cost and subsequently are usually measured at their fair value at the balance sheet date unless held to maturity. Part 
of the Company’s investments consist of listed investments which have been designated as ‘available-for-sale’ investments and accordingly 
are included in the balance sheet at market value with any impairment losses taken to the income statement. The impact has been to 
decrease the balance sheet carrying value of available-for-sale investments at 1 January 2014 by US$659,000 and at 31 December 2014 
by US$1,108,000.

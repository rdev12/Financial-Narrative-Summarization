Directors’ Report: Governance p44-91 Financial Statements p92-143 Shareholder Information p144-153 Strategic Report p2-43 Proactively Managing the Cycle
A transformation to a value driven 
business with a long term focus
During the second half of 2014 we saw a return to  
a healthier and more balanced housing market after  
a very strong first half of the year. 
The UK housing market continues to grow and 
we have continued to see positive signs, with  
prices increasing slowly. This is underpinned by  
solid consumer confidence and good mortgage 
availability and affordability.
Land is the critical ‘raw material’ for our 
business and the ability to purchase the 
right sites in the right locations at the right 
price and at the right point in the cycle is a 
key driver of shareholder value.
Designing a sustainable community  
that meets the needs of local residents, 
is attractive to potential customers,  
and provides attractive returns for 
shareholders, requires a consultative  
and iterative process of community 
engagement.
We work with selected subcontractors  
and build using carefully sourced materials 
to ensure that the homes that we sell  
are of a high quality and are built safely, 
efficiently, cost-effectively and with  
minimal impact on the environment.
Buying a home is a significant financial 
and emotional investment. We aim to 
make buying, moving into and living  
in a Taylor Wimpey home as easy as 
possible for our customers.
This value cycle requires significant input 
from skilled and committed people to 
deliver aspirational, high-quality homes  
and communities for our customers.
Developing sustainable homes and 
communities is a time-consuming 
process, but this provides us with the 
opportunity to undertake regular reviews 
over the life of each development to 
identify potential improvements.

We aim to balance the long term economic 
stability and growth of our Company with our 
responsibilities to the environment, society 
and the economies in which we operate. 
We believe that sustainability is fundamental 
to each aspect of our value cycle and, 
therefore, to the long term success of 
our Company. 
Operating sustainably is both the right 
thing to do and brings significant 
business benefits.

Our Business Model continued
Proactively managing  
everything we do
 
Our people
As part of this regeneration scheme, 
we have committed to increasing the 
employment and employability of local 
residents. We have specific targets in place 
for employing construction workers and 
apprentices from under-represented groups 
such as those from black and minority ethnic 
backgrounds, women and disabled people.  
We will also provide a range of work 
experience, voluntary work and training 
courses for local people / college students 
and have targets for supporting local 
suppliers and subcontractors including 
small and medium enterprises.
Optimising value
Our joint proposals with London & 
Quadrant for Chobham Manor were selected 
as part of a highly competitive bid process on 
the basis of offering the most attractive financial 
proposal alongside the best design and delivery 
credentials for this landmark scheme. A percentage 
of private revenue received will be paid to the LLDC 
with land payment made on a per plot basis when 
each home is completed, thus providing extremely 
efficient cash flow and a shared risk approach. 
Chobham Manor is one of the most high-profile 
developments in London and will set the 
standard for future housing development 
on the Olympic site.
Delivering 
customer service
Chobham Manor’s state-of-the-art show 
complex is one of the largest in the London 
residential property sector. It is constructed 
over three levels with an impressive reception, 
office space and an interactive area which 
features a 100-inch interactive touch table, 
smaller touch screens and iPads allowing visitors 
to take a virtual tour of Chobham Manor and 
the surrounding area, and browse the homes 
for sale. Visitors can also save and compare 
floorplans of the new homes, email 
screenshots to themselves and even 
see the view from the property.
Selecting land
The home of Chobham Manor – 
Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park – is the 
UK’s biggest ever remediation project 
delivered as part of the London 2012 
Olympic and Paralympic Games legacy. 
The land now occupied by Chobham Manor 
used to house the Olympic and Paralympic 
Basketball Arena and is currently being 
redeveloped with 850 quality new homes. 
Once completed, Chobham Manor will 
be one of the largest developments 
of family housing in London.
Getting the 
homebuilding  
basics right
At Chobham Manor, our focus is on creating 
high-quality sustainable homes and 
communities and we are delivering this through 
creating London’s traditional family 
neighbourhood of terraced and mews houses.  
A number of homes will be multi-generational 
properties designed specifically for Chobham 
Manor to appeal to multiple generations of the 
same family. In addition to quality new homes, 
we will also deliver significant supporting 
infrastructure, such as commercial and 
retail space, play areas, communal 
gardens and public open spaces.
Managing the planning  
and community  
engagement process
Chobham Manor is being designed to fully 
capture the family-friendly nature of the 
neighbourhood while embracing the heritage of 
east London life, with its famous community spirit 
and vibrant cultural diversity. We are undertaking 
considerable consultation with a diverse range 
of local communities and other stakeholders. 
In addition, we have committed to long term 
community development plans including a 
range of innovative projects involving 
local people.

The market context
2011 onwards was a period of stability in the underlying 
housing market, following a sharp downturn in 2008 and 
2009. Whilst sentiment improved and customer confidence 
gradually increased, mortgage availability and affordability 
remained the key constraint on the industry. The introduction 
of various Government initiatives including Funding for 
Lending and most notably Help to Buy in April 2013 
increased both the accessibility to and the affordability  
of mortgages.

2014 Market Conditions
Industry and market overview
We are currently operating in a housing market underpinned by a significant structural demand and supply imbalance. Housing remains high 
on the political agenda with recognition of the importance of housebuilding to the economy and the need for more quality homes in the UK  
by all of the main political parties. Whilst there remains uncertainty around the outcome of the General Election in May, consumer confidence 
remains solid and is supported by healthy underlying demand, low interest rates and high levels of employment. We therefore consider that  
the UK near term market risk is low.

planning approvals
+21%

Q1-Q3 2014
Planning
The changes to the planning system in the last few years including the Localism Act and National Planning Policy Framework are having a 
positive impact on the planning system. We continue to monitor this, along with the recently introduced Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) 
and the time taken to achieve implementable planning permission to start on site.
Planning policy and regulation
Planning remains the fundamental constraint in the UK.  
In recent years there have been a number of changes  
to the planning system, with the implementation of the 
National Planning Policy Framework, Localism Act, the 
Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the National 
Planning Policy Guidance. 
Planning approvals
According to the Home Builders Federation (HBF), 
planning approvals increased by 21% year on year  
to 161,283 in the year to September 2014. 
Mortgage availability and affordability 
We build a wide range of homes, from one-bedroom apartments to five-bedroom houses, with prices ranging from below £100,000 to  
over £3 million. The majority of the homes that we build are sold to individual purchasers who take on significant mortgages to finance  
their purchases. Mortgage availability and affordability therefore are key factors.
During 2014, we have continued to see an improvement 
in customer sentiment and an increase in sales rates  
as customers, already feeling more confident, were able 
to gain access to a healthier mortgage market, helped 
through Help to Buy and a more willing and competitive 
banking system.
In 2014, mortgage availability, including for higher loan  
to value mortgages, continued to improve with the total 
value of mortgage approvals for home purchases up 
10.5% at £124,894 million (2013: £112,985 million) 
according to the Bank of England data, with property 
transactions 13.6% higher at 1,219,710 (2013: 1,073,560).

Affordability in 2014
With the Bank of England base rate remaining low  
at 0.5% throughout 2014 mortgage affordability has 
improved with interest rates for new build properties 
approximately 0.65% lower than in 2013. 
Average mortgage payments as a % of take-home pay 
also rose slightly to 34.0% for the first three quarters  
of 2014 from 32.6% in 2013 according to Nationwide. 
This remains below the recent peak in 2007.
Completions 
The new build market in the UK accounts for c.10% of all transactions. Taylor Wimpey is one of the largest homebuilders in the UK,  
building 12,454 homes in 2014. In addition, we build affordable housing across the UK, representing 17.5% of our 2014 completions.
Housing completions
In 2014 we completed 12,454 homes, up 6.5%  
(2013: 11,696) at an average selling price of £213k, 
11.5% higher than in 2013.
According to the Department for Communities and  
Local Government (DCLG) during the financial year 
ended 2013 / 2014 total completions in the UK increased 
4% to c.141k, with private developers accounting for 
c.79% of the total completions. This is still well below  
the recent peak of 2006 / 2007 of 219k and significantly 
below the current estimate of new homes needed in the 
UK per annum of 250k.

Our Strategy
Our medium term targets 2015-2017 Our long term strategy through the cycle T aylor Wimpey investment proposition
We are confident that we can achieve our objectives  
and ultimately our vision as a result of three key 
differentiating factors:
1.  We have invested in new land in a disciplined way,  
at the right time and in the right locations. This has 
been supported by record conversions in the last  
few years from our strategic pipeline, adding to the 
scale, quality and future profitability of the landbank.
2.  We have a clear view on the right size of our 
business and our focus is on delivering sustainable 
growth and value generation in a balanced, 
consistent way through the housing cycle.
3.  We believe that the underlying quality of the  
business is very important and is worth investing  
in. This includes our non-negotiable approach to 
health and safety and our focus on people and 
customer service.
Dividend and cash return policy 
In 2014 we set out the principles and policy of returning 
surplus cash to shareholders at the appropriate times  
in the cycle. This is in addition to our regular maintenance 
dividend which is set at 2% of net assets. 
Going forward, surplus cash returns will continue  
to form a significant proportion of our annual total  
return to shareholders.
A key part of the rationale of our approach to running  
the business in a sustainable way is to give investors  
a significant, consistent and reliable dividend stream. 
More information on 2014 and 2015 dividend  
can be found on page 12.

We remain disciplined and focused on the long term, continuing to target improvement across all measures to deliver 
the best quality and sustainable returns for our shareholders. Our strategy has not changed since we articulated it in 
2011 and neither have our key strategic financial objectives which were purposefully set as through the cycle measures:
In May 2014 we announced a set of stretching 
financial targets for the period from 2015 to 
2017, to challenge the business to deliver  
more over the medium term. 
These targets, each of which is applicable for the 
period from 2015 to 2017, are to achieve: 
–  An average operating profit* margin of 20% 
over the three year period 
–  A return on net operating assets** of at least 
20% per annum 
–  An average increase in net assets (including 
returns to shareholders) of 15% per annum 
over the three year period 
We also added a further financial target which  
we believe is an important measure of delivery  
for this phase of the cycle. This is focused on 
converting a high proportion of our profitability 
into cash, reflecting the move from the strong 
investment phase of the last four years to a  
new phase focused on delivery. This new target,  
again applying for the period from 2015 to 2017, 
is to achieve:
–  An average conversion of at least 65% of 
operating profit* into operating cash flow †††

 − Earn top quartile operating profit * margin
 − Deliver at least a 15% return on net operating assets **

 − Grow net assets by 10% per annum on average 
through the cycle (including returns to shareholders)
Our strategy is underpinned by our strategic principles 
set out on page 18.
Our cultural principles 
We want to earn returns, but how we do this is equally 
important to us. Our cultural principles underpin 
everything we do. These are set out on page 19.
Our business model 
Our business model is based on a value cycle and each 
component of the value cycle is important in order to 
achieve our strategic objectives. Each element of our 
business model and how this impacts our strategy is

Directors’ Report: Governance p44-91 Financial Statements p92-143 Shareholder Information p144-153 Strategic Report p2-43 Focused on creating value and delivering 
quality across the housing cycle
“ I am delighted to report that in 2014 
shareholders have continued to benefit  
from the results of our strategy.”
Kevin Beeston
Chairman
and additional surplus cash returns at the appropriate 
time in the cycle. More information on our dividend  
policy and strategy can be found on page 12.
We remain committed to paying a regular annual 
maintenance dividend. Reflecting both confidence in  
our performance and the resilience of the UK housing 
market, we have announced our intention to double  
this pay-out to 2% of net assets subject to shareholder 
approval. The 2014 final maintenance dividend of  
1.32 pence per share (2013: 0.47 pence per share), if 
approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting 
(AGM), will be paid as a conventional cash dividend on 
20 May 2015 to shareholders on the register at close  
of business on 10 April 2015. Shareholders are once 
again being offered the opportunity to reinvest all of their 
maintenance dividend under the Dividend Re-Investment 
Plan (DRIP).
In February 2014, we set out the principles and the first 
stages of our cash return plan and returned £49.7 million 
in July 2014. Through 2014, we have continued to 
outperform our own expectations, both in terms of  
cash generated, and our forecast cash requirements. 
Reflecting this performance, at our half year results  
in July 2014, the additional cash return in 2015 was 
increased by £50 million to £250 million, equating to  
7.68 pence per ordinary share. Subject to shareholder 
approval, this will be paid on 3 July 2015 as a cash 
dividend to all shareholders on the register at close of 
business on 22 May 2015. Further details are set out in 
the Notice of Meeting on page 144. Following a change 
in the law, with effect from April 2015, companies are 
unable to offer shareholders a choice over the form of  
a cash return. Shareholders will however be offered the 
opportunity to reinvest all of their 2015 special dividend 
under the DRIP (your attention is drawn to an important 
message regarding the DRIP on page 152). The Board 
intends to keep the mechanics of how the Company 
will pay its special dividends under regular review. 
The way we do business
For Taylor Wimpey, the way in which we conduct 
ourselves both internally and externally matters.  
The Board is firmly of the view that strong values and 
culture are the cornerstone of our success and that they 
are key to protecting and enhancing our reputation, both 
internally and externally. We recognise that we have both 
the obligation and the opportunity to lead by example 
and that, whilst we inevitably do not get everything right, 
we continue to embrace these responsibilities and strive 
to improve in everything we do. 
During the year, we have had a particular focus on 
customer service, following a fall in our externally rated 
2014 performance and positioning the business for the future
It is very pleasing to note that, during the period since we set out our strategy  
in 2011, we have seen the transformation of Taylor Wimpey, underpinned by  
our clarity of focus and value driven business model. During this time, we have 
consistently outperformed the pace of improvement that we aspired to, whilst 
continuing to improve the quality of our business and positioning it to achieve  
our vision of becoming the UK’s leading residential developer for creating value 
and delivering quality. I am delighted to report to you that 2014 has not only been 
a further step in the journey to achieve this long term ambition but that we also 
delivered an excellent in-year performance, delivering 54% growth in operating 
profit*, converting a record 10,779 plots from the strategic land pipeline – more 
than any time in our history – and commencing an additional cash return policy  
to shareholders over and above our regular maintenance dividend. I set out  
more details on this below. In December 2014, we were also delighted to be 
re-admitted to the FTSE 100 Share Index. 
Returns to shareholders
In 2014, shareholders have continued to benefit from the results of our strategy 
with a 26% increase in 2014 total shareholder returns and 433% cumulative 
earnings per share growth in the last three years. Our dividend return is an 
inherent part of our strategy and the Board has set out a policy of making cash 
returns to shareholders through both regular maintenance dividend payments  
Chairman’s Statement
Taylor Wimpey plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2014
8 customer satisfaction score from 90% to 87% and a 
general belief that customers expect and deserve an 
enhanced level of service. Whilst an external score  
of 87% continues to be high by industry and historic 
standards, we are committed to improving further our 
service to our customers. We have embarked on several 
initiatives and introduced additional resourcing to improve 
what we do and how we do it for our customers – further 
detail is set out on page 38.
We have an implicit obligation to serve the local communities 
in which we operate and firmly believe that this responsibility 
grows with our success. In 2014, we invested £300 million 
in communities pursuant to planning obligations in England, 
Wales and Scotland (2013: £227 million) providing 
infrastructure, affordable housing and community  
facilities including schools, transport and play areas.

Corporate Governance
We have a strong track record of good corporate 
governance which your Board will continue to strengthen, 
underpinned by a robust and effective governance 
framework and risk management structure. More 
information on what this means can be found within  
our Corporate Governance Report and the reports  
of the Board Committees (on pages 46 to 85). This is 
further enhanced by the policies and guidelines we have 
in place, setting standards concerning ethics, sound 
business practices and wider governance, which are 
regularly reviewed and can be found on our website. 
We value open and honest dialogue and work hard  
to maintain high levels of trust and transparency with  
all of our stakeholders. As your Chairman, I continue to 
proactively meet with a number of investors and industry 
representatives to answer their questions and to gain  
a better understanding of their policies and views on 
governance.
We also understand and support the importance of  
linking executive reward to the longer term objectives  
of T aylor Wimpey and, in turn, the longer term interests  
of shareholders and are very alert to the need for fair and 
proportionate remuneration arrangements. We have again 
consulted very constructively with our major shareholders 
and their representative bodies concerning both 2014 and 
2015 policy and practice. More information on this can  
be found in the Remuneration Committee Report on  
pages 66 to 85.
The Board has reviewed the 2014 UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the ‘Code’) announced in September 
2014, and welcomes the new changes which will apply 
to our 2015 financial year. Consistent with past practice, 
the Board has already moved to comply with certain 
aspects of the Code.
2014 Board evaluation 
In accordance with the Code, the Board is required to 
undertake a formal and rigorous annual evaluation of  
its own performance and that of its Committees and 
individual Directors. It is also a requirement that the 
evaluation should be externally facilitated at least once 
every three years. The evaluation is a very important part 
of the corporate governance framework and is taken very 
seriously by the Board, its Committees and also by each 
individual Director. In 2014, the evaluation was externally 
facilitated by Independent Board Evaluation via a very 
comprehensive process involving all Directors and  
others who work closely with the Board, both internal  
and external. I am pleased to report to you that this  
review confirmed that your Board is a well-functioning 
and effective board which serves the Company well and 
takes its duties and responsibilities very seriously. Naturally, 
there are areas for improvement and the Board has 
reviewed and will be acting upon the recommendations. 
A summary of the main findings from the evaluation are 
outlined on pages 50 to 51.
Our people
The Board is particularly proud of the level of eligible 
employee participation in the Company’ s all-employee 
share plans, namely Sharesave (37%) and SIP (27%).  
Each plan gives employees the opportunity of owning  
their own personal stake in T aylor Wimpey and our future 
success. We believe that this is important as it encourages 
a greater sense of alignment between our employees and 
our shareholders, together with a greater sense of pride 
and sense of ownership. Further, all Executive Directors 
hold shares significantly in excess of individual guidelines 
and similar individual guidelines have also been applied  
to senior management below Board level. More details  
of our share schemes can be found on pages 70 to 71.
We continue to progress our diversity and inclusivity 
initiatives as we recognise that there are still improvements 
to be made and that we are still in the early part of the 
overall journey. More detail on our initiatives is set out  
in the Corporate Governance section.
As I reflect on a very successful 2014, I would like to 
express my sincere thanks and appreciation to all 4,014 
Taylor Wimpey employees for their professionalism, hard 
work and dedication throughout 2014. I am confident 
that we have in place the strategy, people and framework 
to continue to create value and deliver quality for all our 
stakeholders in the years ahead.

Chief Executive’s Review
2014 summary
In 2014 we saw the positive benefit of the improved 
environment in all of our regional markets and we were 
pleased to see greater balance across the regional 
markets coming into effect in the second half of 2014 
with slower and more sustainable price growth, after  
a very strong first half.
Customer demand remained high across all regions  
and was helped by a more affordable and accessible 
mortgage market, due both to Help to Buy and a more 
competitive lending environment. 
Against this backdrop, and in line with our strategy,  
we have continued to grow steadily and sustainably, 
delivering increased completions and creating additional 
value, increasing operating profit by 53.6% to £480.7 
million (2013: £312.9 million).
2014 was an important year for the Group as we met  
or exceeded all previous financial targets and committed 
to delivering more by setting new stretching targets for 
the medium term, which I will detail later. We are pleased 
that in 2014 we have made significant progress towards 
all of these medium term targets. More information on  
our financial performance can be found in the Group 
Financial Review section on pages 40 to 43. Alongside  
this, there were many operational highlights including 
achieving a record contribution per completion of £49.6k 
(2013: £38.8k), significantly increasing our intake of 
trainee and apprentice programmes and contributing 
£300 million to local communities across the UK via 
planning obligations, providing infrastructure, affordable 
homes, public transport and education. 
Health and safety is our non-negotiable top priority and 
we were particularly pleased to see that this was reflected 
in our 2014 employee survey which found that 99%  
of our staff believe that Taylor Wimpey is committed  
to health and safety and keeping people safe. We have 
continued to keep our UK Annual Injury Incidence Rate 
(AIIR) low at 209 per 100,000 employees and contractors 
in 2014 (2013: 207). We reduced our AIIR for major 
injuries from 60 in 2013 to 26 in 2014.
Proactively managing the cycle 
Our views about managing the cycle have not changed. 
Housebuilding is a cyclical industry and, whilst sensible 
measures from Government, interest rate setters and 
regulators can help to reduce the scale of that cyclicality, 
we do not believe it can be removed completely. 
Therefore, whilst we remain focused on delivering strong 
returns and growth, we are also mindful of mid and long 
term risk. This means that we need to take a more active 
approach to managing the cycle than has been historically 
undertaken in the business, or the sector. We are

currently operating in a housing market underpinned  
by a significant structural demand and supply imbalance. 
Housing remains high on the political agenda with 
recognition of the importance of housebuilding to the 
economy and the need for more quality homes in the  
UK by all of the main political parties. Whilst there remains 
uncertainty around the outcome of the General Election in 
May, consumer confidence remains solid and is supported 
by healthy underlying demand, low interest rates and high 
levels of employment. We therefore consider that the UK 
near term market risk is low. 
We believe that we are currently operating at the early 
stages of the housing cycle. The charts on pages  
14 to 15 show some of the key external measures  
we follow closely and these will change depending  
on the stage of the cycle. However, the housing cycle  
is influenced by many factors and these should not 
be viewed in isolation.
Our strategy 
Taylor Wimpey’s vision is to become the UK’s leading 
residential developer for creating value and delivering 
quality across the housing cycle. Since we set out our 
strategy in 2011, we have seen the transformation of 
Taylor Wimpey to a value driven business, with a long 
term focus on generating the best quality sustainable 
returns. We are confident that we can achieve this as  
a result of three key differentiating factors:
1.  We have invested in new land in a disciplined way,  
at the right time and in the right locations. This has 
been supported by record conversions in the last few 
years from our strategic pipeline, adding to the scale, 
quality and future profitability of the landbank.
2.  We have a clear view on the right size of our 
business and our focus is on delivering sustainable 
growth and value generation in a balanced, 
consistent way through the housing cycle.
3.  We believe that the underlying quality of the  
business is very important and is worth investing  
in. This includes our non-negotiable approach to 
health and safety and our focus on people and 
customer service.
Following a period of strong investment, we are  
now at our optimum size of landbank at c.75k plots, 
equating to c.six years of supply at current completion 
levels. We have therefore moved to a land replacement 
position in the short term land market and, together 
with the increasing profitability of the business, are 
becoming increasingly cash generative. This has 
enabled us to move to a phase focused on delivery, 
maximising the returns from our investments, and

continuing to ensure that the business is optimally 
positioned to deliver those returns on a sustainable 
basis. In May 2014 we announced a set of stretching 
financial targets for the period 2015 to 2017, to 
challenge the business to deliver even more over  
the medium term.
These targets, each of which is applicable for the 
period 2015 to 2017, are to achieve: 
 − An average operating profit* margin of 20% over  
the three year period 
 − A return on net operating assets** of at least  
20% per annum 
 − An average increase in net assets (including returns 
to shareholders) of 15% per annum over the three 
year period 
 − An average conversion of at least 65% of operating 
profit* into operating cash flow
†††
 over the three 
year period
Whilst we clearly do not expect to deliver all of these 
three year targets in 2015, we do expect to show 
significant progress towards all of them. 
More information on these targets and how they fit into 
our long term strategy through the cycle can be found  
on pages 16 to 17.
Our strategy is underpinned by our strategic principles 
set out on page 18. 
We want to earn returns, but how we do this is equally 
important to us. Our cultural principles underpin 
everything we do. These are set out on page 19.
Our business model is based on a value cycle, and  
each component of the value cycle is important in order 
to achieve our strategic objectives. Each element of  
our business model is detailed in full on pages 18 to 25.  
We believe that sustainability is fundamental to each 
aspect of the value cycle and, therefore, to the long  
term success of the Company. Further information on 
sustainability can be found on pages 30 to 33 and within 
our dedicated Sustainability Report 2014. 
Dividend and cash return policy 
In 2014 we set out the principles and policy of returning 
surplus cash to shareholders at the appropriate times in 
the cycle, in addition to our regular maintenance dividend. 
Reflecting both our confidence in our performance and 
the underlying resilience of the market, we have 
announced the doubling of the maintenance dividend 
pay-out to 2% of net assets, which is at the top end  
of previous guidance, subject to shareholder approval. 
This will give a proposed 2014 final maintenance dividend 
of 1.32 pence per share to be paid on 20 May 2015 to 
shareholders on the register at the close of business on 
10 April 2015 (2013 final dividend: 0.47 pence per share). 
In combination with the interim dividend of 0.24 pence 
per share (2013 interim dividend: 0.22 pence per share), 
this gives a total maintenance dividend for the year of 
1.56 pence per share (2013 total maintenance: 0.69 
pence per share).
On 3 July 2014 we commenced the return of surplus 
cash to shareholders with a £49.7 million special  
cash payment, equating to 1.54 pence per share.  
As we previously announced on 30 July 2014, we will 
return approximately £250 million to shareholders on  
3 July 2015, equating to 7.68 pence per ordinary share, 
to shareholders on the register at close of business on  
22 May 2015, subject to shareholder approval at the 
2015 AGM. Going forward, surplus cash returns will 
continue to form a significant proportion of our annual 
total return to shareholders. These cash returns will be

12 Our customers
In 2014 we achieved a customer satisfaction rate of 87% 
(2013: 90%), with the decrease reflecting the challenge  
to deliver our homes on time as the labour market 
adapted to the better sales market. Whilst this remains 
high in comparison to historic trends, we are very 
disappointed that this has decreased. During 2014 we 
began an in-depth review of every aspect and stage of 
our customer journey, to identify areas of improvement 
and to deliver a better homebuying experience for our 
customers. This is a very important area for us and will 
continue to be a key focus in 2015 and on an ongoing 
basis, as we work to realise improvements to our service 
and to our customers’ experience. More information can 
be found on pages 22 and 38.
Our people 
I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate Kevin’s 
words of thanks to the teams and the individuals across 
our business. I believe we have the best people in  
the industry and we want to make Taylor Wimpey  
the employer of choice and establish a culture 
where individuals from all backgrounds can reach 
their full potential. 
Whilst we have done a lot over the last few years in 
developing our people, we recognise there is still more  
to do. We will be focusing on the areas of learning and 
development and building on our success in our training 
programmes in 2015.
Our new Group Human Resources Director Anne Billson-
Ross is working with our GMT and the wider business to 
update the human resources strategy for T aylor Wimpey 
and drive further improvement in 2015. 
I am also extremely proud of the efforts of our employees 
around the country, supporting our chosen charities.  
In total during 2014 we raised over £539k (2013: £415k) 
for registered charities through donations and fundraising. 
More information on this can be found on page 31. Just 
one example of this was in March 2014 where nearly 200 
of our staff from across 80% of the regional businesses 
completed Taylor Wimpey’s inaugural teambuilding event 
in the Brecon Beacons with an aim to climb the Welsh 
National Park’s 10 highest mountains in 10 hours for the 
Youth Adventure Trust, a charity which provides 
adventure camps and day activities for disadvantaged 
children aged between 11 and 14, to enable them to 
experience success, learn to go beyond their own 
expectations and grow in confidence. Our 45 teams 
raised over £141k. This was the highest amount raised  
in a single event in the charity’s history. We are also 
looking forward to building on this with our next all-
employee challenge in May 2015. 
Diversity 
During 2014, we continued to focus on diversity and 
inclusion. We remain committed to the belief that 
embracing diversity and inclusion will enable Taylor 
Wimpey to succeed through a workforce that is creative 
and innovative. We continue to actively embrace the 
business and local communities in which we operate  
and will strive to reflect their richness and character by 
including such aspects as gender, race and religion but 
also diversity of thought, background and experience.  
In 2014 we undertook a range of activities including 
establishing a senior management working party to 
create a diversity and inclusion strategy. For further  
detail please see pages 57 to 59.
Outlook 
Looking forward, and as I mentioned previously, we  
are currently operating in a housing market underpinned  
by a significant structural demand and supply imbalance. 
Housing remains high on the political agenda with 
recognition of the importance of housebuilding to the 
economy and the need for more quality homes in the  
UK by all of the main political parties. Whilst there remains 
uncertainty around the outcome of the General Election  
in May, consumer confidence remains solid and is 
supported by healthy underlying demand, low interest 
rates and high levels of employment. We therefore 
consider that the UK near term market risk is low.
The beginning of the spring selling season has seen  
both demand and trading at the better end of our 
expectations. Net private sales rates for the year to date 
(w/e 1 March 2015) of 0.70 are at healthy levels (2014 
equivalent period: 0.72) and within the range we see as 
sustainable. With slower market growth, we anticipate 
reducing build cost pressure in 2015. 
As at 1 March 2015, we are 51% forward sold for private 
completions for 2015 with a strong total order book of 
£1,657 million (2014 equivalent period: £1,529 million).
This together with our strong landbank, with over 50%  
of plots sourced from the strategic pipeline, positions us 
well for 2015 and beyond. We remain confident that our 
long term strategy, enhanced by the stretching medium 
term targets we announced in May 2014, will enable us 
to maximise the best quality returns from our investments 
on a sustainable basis across the housing cycle.

Planning
The changes to the planning system in the last few years including the Localism Act and National Planning Policy Framework are having a 
positive impact on the planning system. We continue to monitor this, along with the recently introduced Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) 
and the time taken to achieve implementable planning permission to start on site.
Planning policy and regulation
Planning remains the fundamental constraint in the UK.  
In recent years there have been a number of changes  
to the planning system, with the implementation of the 
National Planning Policy Framework, Localism Act, the 
Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the National 
Planning Policy Guidance. 
Planning approvals
According to the Home Builders Federation (HBF),

Mortgage availability and affordability 
We build a wide range of homes, from one-bedroom apartments to five-bedroom houses, with prices ranging from below £100,000 to  
over £3 million. The majority of the homes that we build are sold to individual purchasers who take on significant mortgages to finance  
their purchases. Mortgage availability and affordability therefore are key factors.
During 2014, we have continued to see an improvement 
in customer sentiment and an increase in sales rates  
as customers, already feeling more confident, were able 
to gain access to a healthier mortgage market, helped 
through Help to Buy and a more willing and competitive 
banking system.
In 2014, mortgage availability, including for higher loan  
to value mortgages, continued to improve with the total 
value of mortgage approvals for home purchases up 
10.5% at £124,894 million (2013: £112,985 million) 
according to the Bank of England data, with property 
transactions 13.6% higher at 1,219,710 (2013: 1,073,560).

Average mortgage payments as a % of take-home pay 
also rose slightly to 34.0% for the first three quarters  
of 2014 from 32.6% in 2013 according to Nationwide.

Annual Report and Accounts 2014
16 Our medium term targets 2015-2017 T aylor Wimpey investment proposition
We are confident that we can achieve our objectives  
and ultimately our vision as a result of three key 
differentiating factors:
1.  We have invested in new land in a disciplined way,  
at the right time and in the right locations. This has 
been supported by record conversions in the last  
few years from our strategic pipeline, adding to the 
scale, quality and future profitability of the landbank.
2.  We have a clear view on the right size of our 
business and our focus is on delivering sustainable 
growth and value generation in a balanced, 
consistent way through the housing cycle.
3.  We believe that the underlying quality of the  
business is very important and is worth investing  
in. This includes our non-negotiable approach to 
health and safety and our focus on people and 
customer service.
Dividend and cash return policy 
In 2014 we set out the principles and policy of returning 
surplus cash to shareholders at the appropriate times  
in the cycle. This is in addition to our regular maintenance 
dividend which is set at 2% of net assets. 
Going forward, surplus cash returns will continue  
to form a significant proportion of our annual total  
return to shareholders.
A key part of the rationale of our approach to running  
the business in a sustainable way is to give investors  
a significant, consistent and reliable dividend stream. 
More information on 2014 and 2015 dividend  
can be found on page 12.
In May 2014 we announced a set of stretching 
financial targets for the period from 2015 to 
2017, to challenge the business to deliver  
more over the medium term. 
These targets, each of which is applicable for the 
period from 2015 to 2017, are to achieve: 
–  An average operating profit* margin of 20% 
over the three year period 
–  A return on net operating assets** of at least 
20% per annum 
–  An average increase in net assets (including 
returns to shareholders) of 15% per annum 
over the three year period 
We also added a further financial target which  
we believe is an important measure of delivery  
for this phase of the cycle. This is focused on 
converting a high proportion of our profitability 
into cash, reflecting the move from the strong 
investment phase of the last four years to a  
new phase focused on delivery. This new target,  
again applying for the period from 2015 to 2017, 
is to achieve:
–  An average conversion of at least 65% of 
operating profit* into operating cash flow

Our strategy to deliver enhanced value
We are highly selective with regard to the 
types of sites that we buy, focusing on the 
quality of the land rather than the number  
of plots acquired. We employ dedicated  
land teams in each of our 24 regional 
businesses, who use their expertise and  
local knowledge to identify potential high-
quality, sustainable sites.
Progress in 2014
Added 17,371 plots (net) to the short term 
landbank, of which over 50% were converted 
from the strategic pipeline, to maintain our 
optimum scale of c.75k plots. Average selling 
prices increased in 2014 to £213k (2013: 
£191k) primarily as the result of enhanced 
Our strategy to deliver enhanced value
We believe that a positive and structured 
approach to working with others is at the 
heart of a successful scheme. Residential 
development is a local business and we work 
in partnership with the communities in which 
we build to deliver homes that meet their 
requirements and aspirations.
Progress in 2014
Contributed £300 million to our local 
communities via Section 106 and Section  
75 planning obligations (2013: £227 million).

Why is it key to our strategy?
The strategic pipeline enhances our ability to increase the

margin uplift from strategic plots. It also allows us to take 
a long term view of sites.

Conversion of strategic pipeline 
Objective
KPI
We aim to convert on average c.6k plots per annum

Definition
Number of plots, which originally did not have planning 
permission when we took a commercial interest in the 
land, which we have promoted through the planning 
process and achieved some form of planning on. In this 
way we convert potential plots from the strategic pipeline 
to plots in the short term landbank. 
Why is it key to our strategy?
The strength of our strategic pipeline (plots on which  
we are trying to achieve a planning consent) is a key 
differentiator and enables us to be extremely selective  
in the short term land market and also reduces the 
pressure on the teams. We work with landowners, local 
authorities and communities to promote the strategic 
pipeline through the planning process and achieve 
planning permission.

Our strategy to deliver enhanced value
We want to be the residential developer  
of choice for employees. We want to attract 
and retain the best people by having a culture 
that people identify with, where they can 
realise their full potential and achieve success 
and satisfaction. We will continue to seek a 
balance of internal and external appointments, 
in order to combine career development with 
the introduction of new perspectives and 
innovative approaches.
Our strategy to deliver enhanced value
No matter what the size or price of a 
property, for each customer the home  
that they are buying is aspirational to them. 
We will maintain our focus on delivering 
high-quality homes and a consistently 
excellent ‘Customer Journey’ to all of  
our customers. We continue to make 
improvements to our online capabilities, 
including our website and use of social  
media such as Facebook and Twitter.
Progress in 2014
We are very disappointed that the customer 
satisfaction rate decreased from 90% to 
87%. During 2014 we began an in-depth 
review of every aspect and stage of our 
customer journey, to identify areas of 
improvement and to deliver a better 
homebuying experience for our customers. 
Taylor Wimpey Sales Academy was  
Highly Commended in the Best Customer 
Satisfaction Initiative category at the

Proactively managing  
everything we do
Selecting land
The home of Chobham Manor – 
Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park – is the 
UK’s biggest ever remediation project 
delivered as part of the London 2012 
Olympic and Paralympic Games legacy. 
The land now occupied by Chobham Manor 
used to house the Olympic and Paralympic 
Basketball Arena and is currently being 
redeveloped with 850 quality new homes. 
Once completed, Chobham Manor will 
be one of the largest developments 
of family housing in London.
Getting the 
homebuilding  
basics right
At Chobham Manor, our focus is on creating 
high-quality sustainable homes and 
communities and we are delivering this through 
creating London’s traditional family 
neighbourhood of terraced and mews houses.  
A number of homes will be multi-generational 
properties designed specifically for Chobham 
Manor to appeal to multiple generations of the 
same family. In addition to quality new homes, 
we will also deliver significant supporting 
infrastructure, such as commercial and 
retail space, play areas, communal 
gardens and public open spaces.
Managing the planning  
and community  
engagement process
Chobham Manor is being designed to fully 
capture the family-friendly nature of the 
neighbourhood while embracing the heritage of 
east London life, with its famous community spirit 
and vibrant cultural diversity. We are undertaking 
considerable consultation with a diverse range 
of local communities and other stakeholders. 
In addition, we have committed to long term 
community development plans including a 
range of innovative projects involving 
local people.

Our people
As part of this regeneration scheme, 
we have committed to increasing the 
employment and employability of local 
residents. We have specific targets in place 
for employing construction workers and 
apprentices from under-represented groups 
such as those from black and minority ethnic 
backgrounds, women and disabled people.  
We will also provide a range of work 
experience, voluntary work and training 
courses for local people / college students 
and have targets for supporting local 
suppliers and subcontractors including 
small and medium enterprises.
Optimising value
Our joint proposals with London & 
Quadrant for Chobham Manor were selected 
as part of a highly competitive bid process on 
the basis of offering the most attractive financial 
proposal alongside the best design and delivery 
credentials for this landmark scheme. A percentage 
of private revenue received will be paid to the LLDC 
with land payment made on a per plot basis when 
each home is completed, thus providing extremely 
efficient cash flow and a shared risk approach. 
Chobham Manor is one of the most high-profile 
developments in London and will set the 
standard for future housing development 
on the Olympic site.
Delivering 
customer service
Chobham Manor’s state-of-the-art show 
complex is one of the largest in the London 
residential property sector. It is constructed 
over three levels with an impressive reception, 
office space and an interactive area which 
features a 100-inch interactive touch table, 
smaller touch screens and iPads allowing visitors 
to take a virtual tour of Chobham Manor and 
the surrounding area, and browse the homes 
for sale. Visitors can also save and compare 
floorplans of the new homes, email 
screenshots to themselves and even 
see the view from the property.

25 Our Approach to Risk Management
Our risk assessment and management process
As with any business, Taylor Wimpey faces a number of risks and uncertainties in the course of the day to day operations. It is only  
by effectively identifying and managing these risks that we are able to deliver on our strategic objectives of improving operating margin,  
return on net operating assets, cash conversion and net asset value across the cycle. 
The successful management of risk is essential to  
enable the Group to deliver its strategic objectives. 
Our risk management and internal control framework 
defines the procedures that manage and mitigate risks 
facing the business, rather than eliminate risk altogether 
and can only provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Our risk management framework consists of risk  
registers that are maintained at all organisational  
levels, which detail the risks faced by the Group,  
its operating companies and the central teams that 
support the business and a wider stakeholder group.  
The registers identify key operational, financial and 
strategic risks to the business, with strategic risks  
being identified as part of the business planning process. 
Our risk registers take into account the significance of 
health, safety and environmental issues, together with 
social and governance matters of the Group and use  
a standardised methodology for the assessment of risk.
The standard methodology used in risk management 
requires each risk identified to be assessed and 
measured according to a risk matrix. This matrix 
accounts for the likelihood and impact of each risk, 
mitigating actions and hence the remaining or 
residual risk. 
The risks identified are assessed for the potential  
effect on the Group’s short and long term value. Our risk 
registers are refreshed on an ongoing basis as part of our 
financial planning cycle. The registers feed into a formal 
half-yearly risk assessment that identifies the Principal 
Risks (see pages 28 and 29) and allows the Board to 
re-evaluate the identified strategic risks facing the Group.
Strategic Objectives
Risk Management & Mitigation
Principal Risks & Uncertainties
The Board, supported by the 
GMT and the Audit Committee, 
will identify the Principal Risks 
based on the assessment of the 
material risk register. The Principal 
Risks will be disclosed with the 
half and full year results. 
Feedback regarding changes to 
Principal Risks is given to the risk 
owners who have been identified 
to manage the specific risk on 
behalf of the Group.
Group Material Risk Register
The Material Risk Register is 
maintained by the GMT and 
reviewed by the Audit Committee 
with the promotion, removal or 
change of risks being made as 
part of their assessment of the 
Risk Summaries and their views 
of the changes in the strategic 
risks facing the Group. Each 
Material Risk on the register will 
be assessed as to its likely 
impact based on the Group’s 
standard methodology.
BU & Central Forecast  
and Planning Process
All risk registers are re-evaluated 
and completed as part of the 
formal budget process every six 
months. Each regional business 
unit and central function will 
re-assess with their senior 
management the risks they  
are facing and update their  
risk registers as required.
BU & Central Risk Register
From individual risk registers, all 
risks are grouped to produce a 
Business Unit and Central Risk 
Summary. These risk summaries 
are discussed and assessed by 
the GMT and Audit Committee. 
The GMT assessment includes  
a comparison of the risk 
summaries over time, taking into 
account any changes in the risk 
impact assessment and their 
views on the strategic risks facing 
the Group.

26 Risk materiality process
The Board determines the nature and extent of the Principal Risks it is willing to take in achieving its strategic objectives, whilst maintaining 
sound risk management and internal control systems.
The Board oversees the risk and control framework  
of the Group and the Chief Executive is responsible  
for implementing any necessary improvements with  
the support of the GMT. In line with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Board holds formal risk reviews 
half-yearly. The Board reviews the risk profile of the Group 
and the significant risks with the mitigating factors.
At the meeting in February 2015, the Board completed its 
annual assessment of risks. This followed the Audit 
Committee’s formal assessment of risk, which was 
supported by the detailed risk assessment by  
the GMT, and their review of the effectiveness of internal 
controls. The key risks affecting the Group were identified 
and agreed with the Board, together with the actions and 
processes required to reduce their likelihood of 
occurrence and to mitigate their impact.
Principal Risks probability
Whilst the Principal Risks to the Group being able to execute its business  
strategy have not fundamentally changed since 2013, the likelihood of the  
risk factors occurring may have changed. The table below shows the residual 
likelihood of each risk following our risk mitigation strategies in both 2013 and 
2014. The table does not consider the relative size of the associated financial  
or reputational impacts for each Principal Risk item.

Government policy and 
planning regulations
The implementation of the  
National Planning Policy Framework,  
the Localism Act and the Community 
Infrastructure Levy (CIL) has had  
a significant impact on the planning 
system. A further change in  
Government Policy, although  
unlikely, following an election could  
have a disrupting or destabilising  
effect on the planning system.
Responsibility
 − Chief Executive
 − Director of Land and Planning
 − Other members of our Senior 
Management team
 − Regional Managing Directors
Our ability to build our homes  
and communities is dependent  
on obtaining planning permissions  
and other regulatory requirements  
and permits.
Although the new planning system  
is having a positive effect, it is still a 
relatively new system with the powers 
within the processes still being tested. 
The risk of extended timeframes for 
gaining consent or legal challenge 
continues. Any further structural 
change to the process following an 
election, although unlikely, could have  
a slowing effect on planning consent.
CIL is currently being taken up slowly 
by local authorities. There is a risk of 
planning applications being delayed, 
refused or challenged post April 2015.
 − Inability to obtain suitable 
consents, or unforeseen 
delays, could impact on  
the number or type of homes 
that we build. We may be 
required to fund higher levels 
of planning obligations or 
additional costs to meet 
increased regulatory 
requirements. 
 − The locally produced CIL 
charge schedules may 
increase costs and so  
impact the viability of current 
developments. In addition, 
where local CIL charges are 
not in place there could be  
an impact on gaining planning 
consent or Judicial Review 
challenge.
 − This could have a detrimental 
impact on the contribution  
per plot. 
We have responded to the 
changes in planning policy by 
introducing a comprehensive 
community-led planning strategy 
which improves communications 
with all parties but especially local 
communities, thereby enhancing 
our ability to deliver developments 
that meet local requirements.
We consult with Government 
agencies and opposition parties 
on housing policy, both directly 
and indirectly as a member of 
industry groups, to highlight 
potential issues and to understand 
any proposed changes to 
regulations.
Our customer and community 
engagement strategy is 
becoming embedded and 
having a positive effect.
We have been successful in 
gaining planning consents 
through the year with particular 
emphasis on the conversion  
of the strategic land pipeline.
We continued our participation 
in the local Plans Management 
Group (PMG), via the HBF , to 
ensure local plans are robust 
and CIL charge schedules are 
appropriate.
B
Impact of market 
environment on mortgage 
availability and demand
Mortgage availability is a key constraint 
on the demand for housing. Following 
the Mortgage Market Review in April 
2014, stricter guidelines were 
introduced for lenders to assess 
mortgage affordability. In 2015, the Bank 
of England’s Financial Policy Committee 
(FPC) gained new powers, including 
setting loan-to-value and debt-to-
income limits for residential mortgages.
Also, whilst the Government has 
extended Phase 1 of the Help to Buy 
scheme to 2020, there is uncertainty 
over the impact when the scheme is 
removed.
Responsibility
 − Group Management Team
 − UK Sales and Marketing Director
 − Regional Sales and Marketing 
Directors
The majority of the homes that we  
build are sold to individual purchasers 
who take on significant mortgages  
to finance their purchases. A change  
in business confidence or employment 
opportunities can impact on the 
demand for housing. In particular  
the ability for first time buyers and 
investors to purchase homes is 
impacted by changes in mortgage 
availability at the higher loan-to-value 
levels, as it would impact on the level  
of deposits required.
The new FPC policies may lead to  
a delay in mortgage approvals and 
restrict the volume of approvals.
 − A reduction in effective 
demand for new homes  
below normal levels could 
negatively impact on both 
profitability and cash 
generation. This would have 
an adverse effect on return  
on net operating assets and 
net debt.
Our local teams select the 
locations and home designs  
that best meet the needs of the 
local community and customer 
demand in the present and future. 
We evaluate new outlet openings 
on the basis of local market 
conditions and regularly review  
the pricing and incentives that  
we offer. 
We work closely with the  
financial services industry to 
ensure customers receive good 
advice on the procurement of 
mortgage products.
We offer the Government-
backed Help to Buy scheme 
and have seen strong interest 
in the scheme amongst our 
customers. 
We launched a new Taylor 
Wimpey website in 2013  
to provide best in industry 
customer experience and 
better insight into the  
Taylor Wimpey products.
Throughout 2014 we have 
continued to develop good 
working relationships with 
established mainstream 
lenders and those wishing  
to increase volume within  
the new build market.
C
Material costs and 
availability of 
subcontractors
An increase in production following  
the recovery of the housing market  
may reduce the availability of materials 
and subcontractors, resulting in an 
unexpected increase in costs. It has 
also put pressure on utility firms to  
keep up with the pace of installation, 
leading to build programme and 
completion delays.
Responsibility
 − Head of Procurement
 − Regional Commercial Directors 
In order to optimise our build cost 
efficiency, whilst retaining the flexibility 
to commence work on new sites  
as planning consents allow, the vast 
majority of work carried out on site  
is performed by subcontractors. 
Without the introduction of new 
resources into the housing market, 
labour and material prices could 
increase.
 − If the availability of 
subcontractors or materials  
is insufficient to meet demand 
this could lead to increased 
build times, increased costs 
and, thereby reducing 
profitability. 
 − Lack of skilled subcontractors 
could also result in higher 
levels of waste being produced 
from our sites and lower  
build quality.
We maintain regular contact with 
suppliers and negotiate contract 
volume, pricing and duration  
as appropriate. In addition, we 
provide both high-level and site 
specific programme information  
to aid with demand planning.
Competencies are considered as 
part of our subcontractor selection 
process, particularly in relation to 
health and safety, quality, previous 
performance and financial stability. 
We work to address the skills 
shortage through apprenticeship 
schemes and the Construction 
Industry Training Board.
During 2014 industry volumes 
continued to increase the 
demand for building materials. 
The Group has agreed product 
allocations and volumes  
with key suppliers to mitigate 
against extended lead times 
and potential shortages.
We have made progress  
in delivering increased build 
efficiency by the ongoing 
review of our standard house 
types and selective regional 
cost benchmarking.

Ability to attract and retain 
high-calibre employees
Recruiting employees with inadequate 
skills or in insufficient numbers, or not 
being able to retain key staff with the 
right skills for the future, could have  
a detrimental impact on our business.
Responsibility
 − Chief Executive
 − Group HR Director
 − Every employee managing people
Our value cycle requires significant 
input from skilled people to deliver 
quality homes and communities  
for our customers. 
With the recovery in the housing 
market, there is a greater incidence  
of ‘poaching’ in the housebuilding 
market. This, together with the recent 
changes in the planning system, has 
meant that the demand for high-quality 
trained employees has increased and  
is key to achieving our strategic goals.
 − Not having the right teams 
in place could lead to delays 
in build, quality issues, 
reduced sales levels, 
poor customer service 
and reduced profitability.
We closely monitor employee 
turnover levels on a monthly  
basis and conduct exit interviews, 
as appropriate, to identify any 
areas for improvement. 
We benchmark our remuneration 
to ensure we are competitive 
within the industry and have 
succession plans in place for key 
roles within the Group. We hold 
regular development reviews to 
identify training requirements.
During 2014, we increased  
our intake of apprentice and 
trainee schemes. 
A programme for all senior 
managers was introduced,  
to support open dialogue and 
constructive conversation with 
employees. The graduate and 
apprenticeship programmes 
continued, developing skills at 
entry level positions.
An Assessment and 
Development Centre was run 
for employees with potential for 
Director level roles, to support 
robust development plans. 
E
Land purchasing
The purchase of land of poor quality,  
at too high a price, or incorrect timing  
of land purchases in relation to the 
economic cycle could impact future 
profitability.
Responsibility
 − Group Management Team
 − Divisional Managing Directors
 − Regional Managing Directors
 − Regional Land and Planning Directors
 − Strategic Land Managing Directors
Land is the major ‘raw material’ for  
the Group and the limited availability  
of good-quality land at an attractive 
price throughout the housing cycle 
leads to significant competition.
Purchasing land of the appropriate 
quality, on attractive terms at the right 
time and scale in the economic cycle, 
will enhance the Group’s ability to 
deliver future profit growth as the 
housing market recovers.
 − Purchasing poor-quality or 
mispriced land, or incorrectly 
timing land purchases would 
have a detrimental impact on 
our profitability and returns. 
 − The purchasing of insufficient 
land would reduce the Group’s 
ability to actively manage its 
land portfolio, and create  
value for shareholders.
Our land teams select and 
appraise each site. Our appraisal 
process ensures each project is 
financially viable, consistent with 
our strategy and appropriately 
authorised, dependent on the 
proposed scale of expenditure. 
We strive to be the developer  
of choice by adopting a 
comprehensive approach 
encompassing land vendors,  
land agents, local councils and 
local communities. 
Our strategic land teams work 
alongside regional businesses to 
identify and secure land with the 
potential for future development 
and promote it through the 
planning system.
The short term land market 
remained balanced and 
disciplined throughout  
2014 enabling us to continue 
to source and invest in short 
term value-creating land 
opportunities at investment 
margins of around 20% 
operating margin. Following  
a period of strong investment, 
we are now at our optimum 
size of landbank. In 
combination with the strong 
conversion of the strategic 
pipeline, our reliance on 
purchasing short term land  
has diminished, providing 
some insulation from an 
increase in land price.
F
Site and product safety 
Building sites are inherently dangerous 
places. Unsafe practices  
by our employees or subcontractors 
have the potential to cause death  
or serious injury.
Responsibility
 − Chief Executive
 − Director of Health, Safety and 
Environment
 − Every employee and subcontractor
Our operations involve, and interface 
with, a large number of people.  
People range from employees and 
subcontractors, to customers and  
their families, who live on or visit our 
sites each day. We want all of these 
people to go home at the end of the 
day, safe and uninjured.
 − In addition to the potentially 
tragic personal impact of  
an accident on site or after 
customer completion, there  
is potential for legal proceedings, 
financial penalties, reputational 
damage and delay to the  
site’s progress.
We have a comprehensive health, 
safety and environmental (HSE) 
management system in place, 
which is integral to our business. 
This is supported by our policies 
and procedures to ensure that we 
live up to our intention of providing 
a safe and healthy working 
environment and build homes  
that comply with the required 
regulations. We provide extensive 
HSE training for our employees. 
We run HSE induction training, 
poster campaigns as well as 
providing regular site toolbox talks 
for our contractors and operatives.
All HSE issues are reviewed by  
the GMT and, where appropriate, 
actions put in place to rectify 
issues or prevent a recurrence.  
We continue to compare 
favourably with the UK  
housebuilding and construction 
industry in terms of site safety. 
We have continued to keep  
our Annual Injury Incidence  
Rate (AIIR) low at 209 per 
100,000 employees and 
contractors in 2014 (2013: 
207). We reduced our AIIR for 
major injuries from 60 in 2013 
to 26 in 2014. During 2014,  
we continued our site safety 
training, extending training to 
over 2,750 groundworkers’ 
supervisors, each receiving  
a site safety supervisory 
qualification. 
We introduced additional 
working platform lifts on all  
our scaffolds, resulting in a 
significant reduction in the  
risk of injury from falls or slips, 
particularly from operatives 
working at mid-floor or roof 
level. We introduced specialist 
equipment on all sites to  
make ladders safer to use.

Methodology
We have used the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (revised edition), data gathered to fulfil our requirements under the CRC Energy Efficiency 
scheme and Mandatory Carbon Reporting requirements, and emission factors from the Government’s GHG Conversion Factors for our corporate reporting.
We have reported on the emissions sources required under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013 apart from the exclusions 
noted. The reported sources fall within our consolidated financial statement and are for emissions over which we have financial control. We do not have responsibility for any 
emissions sources that are not included in our consolidated statement.
The following sources of emissions were excluded or part-excluded from this report:
–  Fugitive emissions (refrigerant gases): excluded on the basis of difficulty in acquiring disparate data;
–  Gas and electricity of part-exchange properties: excluded on the basis of immateriality due to very few completions of this type;
–  Certain joint venture properties: where Taylor Wimpey was not part of the handover process. In these cases other housebuilders have captured MCR-related data;
–  Combined heat and power (CHP) plants: excluded on the basis of difficulty in acquiring data.

Annual Report and Accounts 2014
30 Integrating sustainability 
In 2013 we launched our Sustainability Strategy , committing 
T aylor Wimpey to working towards being a more socially , 
environmentally and economically sustainable company; 
and in 2014 we continued our work towards this. 
Our Sustainability Strategy sets out a range of strategic 
commitments that relate to key social, environmental and 
economic issues. The strategy works alongside our Energy 
and Carbon Strategy . Our six sustainability principles apply 
to all of our business activities, from identifying land through 
to completing and handing over our developments. These 
can be found within our Sustainability Report 2014.
Key initiatives in 2014 included reviewing our internal 
processes with regard to flood risk; undertaking a water 
audit and a biodiversity review; investigating climate change 
adaptation and continuing with our energy reduction 
programme on sites, in sales areas and in offices. 
We continue to maintain best practice community 
engagement and health and safety remains a non-
negotiable top priority .
We do much more than build homes
Our operations add significant additional value to 
communities in which we build; for example, job creation, 
improvements to local environments and infrastructure, as 
well as contributions to education and community facilities, 
creating sustainable and vibrant communities. 
During 2014, we contributed £300 million to local 
communities via Section 106 and Section 75 planning 
obligations (2013: £227 million). Since 2010 we have 
invested over £930 million.
We also support charities at both a national and regional 
level. Housing and homelessness continued to be key 
areas of focus for us in 2014, underpinned by our long-
standing partnership with Centrepoint and our network  
of six regional homelessness charities across the UK, as  
well as CRASH and Crisis. In addition, during the year we 
also supported a range of other charitable causes, including 
Macmillan Cancer Support, Y outh Adventure T rust and 
Mayor’ s Fund for London. 
In total during 2014 we raised over £539k (2013: £415k)  
for registered charities through donations and fundraising.
Human rights
We support the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and have policies and processes in place  
to ensure that we act in accordance with our cultural  
values which encompass areas such as equal opportunities, 
anti-corruption and whistleblowing. We do not consider this 
a material issue in our business.
Greenhouse Gas emissions (GHG)
We continue to take steps to improve our approach to 
climate change mitigation, adaptation and transparency . 
Data is provided as tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent 
(CO

including our sites, offices, business travel, as a result  
of waste disposal and throughout our supply chains. 
Our 2014 scope 1 and 2 data has been externally verified 
by the Carbon T rust.
Outlook
Being a sustainable business is fundamental to each 
component of our business model and the long term 
success of our Company . We will continue to measure, 
monitor and report annually on our sustainability 
performance and will strive to further integrate sustainability  
into every aspect of our business in 2015.

Directors’ Report: Governance p44-91 Financial Statements p92-143 Shareholder Information p144-153 Strategic Report p2-43 Taylor Wimpey plc is a UK-focused residential developer, 
with a small operation in Spain. Our Operating Review  
is UK only as the majority of metrics do not apply to the 
Spanish business. A short summary of the Spanish 
business follows.
Sales, completions and pricing
In 2014 we saw the benefit of the improved environment 
in all of our regional markets. We were pleased to see 
greater balance across the regional markets coming into 
effect in the second half of 2014 with slower and more 
sustainable price growth, after a very strong first half.
Customer demand remained high across all regions  
and was helped by a more affordable and accessible 
mortgage market, due to both Help to Buy and a  
more competitive lending environment. 
We have maintained steady and sustainable volume 
growth. Total home completions increased by 6.5% to 
12,454 (including our share of joint venture completions) 
up from 11,696 in 2013, of which 17.5% were affordable 
housing completions (2013: 18.2%). Our net private 
reservation rate for the full year was 0.64 homes per 
outlet per week (2013: 0.62) with cancellation rates still  
at low levels, at 14% (2013: 13%). 
Average selling prices on private completions increased 
by 11.4% to £234k (2013: £210k). This increase is both  
a result of our underlying shift to better quality locations 
and capturing market sales price increases, which  
came through largely in the first half of the year. Our  
total average selling price increased by 11.5% to £213k 
(2013: £191k). 
Contribution per completion increased by 27.8% to a 
record £49.6k per home (2013: £38.8k).
As at 31 December 2014 our order book represented 
6,601 homes (31 December 2013: 6,627 homes), which 
we believe is the optimal size for the business at this point 
of the cycle. This order book increased in value by 12.1% 
to £1,397 million (31 December 2013: £1,246 million), 
driven largely by the strength of private reservations.  
As at 31 December 2014, the average price in the private 
order book increased by 16.5% to £283k (31 December 
2013: £243k). 
We ended the year with 305 outlets (31 December 2013: 
314), with the decrease due to faster outlet closings in a 
healthier market and the time required to meet additional

34 planning permission requirements to start working on 
site. We expect the total number of outlets to increase in 
2015, reflecting our success in the land market and our 
continued focus to get newly acquired sites and phases 
opened properly and efficiently. 
We continue to grow our London presence across all the 
boroughs in a selective and managed way, focusing on 
achieving the best returns. During 2014 we operated on 
an average of 18 outlets in London. 
Selecting 
land
The value we create for our shareholders, communities 
and for customers all starts with land and it is the area  
we add most value, through planning, allowing us to 
generate the best quality returns.
Taylor Wimpey is differentiated by the strength 
and quality of its landbank. This is as a result of our 
disciplined approach to land investment and our long 
term view of value and is ultimately the source of our 
future profitability and cash generation. As at the end 
of December 2014, our total land portfolio, including 
the strategic pipeline, stood at a potential c.£39 billion 
in revenue at current prices. Our land portfolio continues 
to generate excellent returns for shareholders in excess 
of our investment targets. Our landbank is broadly 
spread across the country in targeted quality locations, 
supported by strong demographics and economics, in 
the villages, towns and cities where people want to live.
The short term land market remained balanced and 
disciplined throughout 2014 enabling us to continue  
to source and invest in short term value-creating land 
opportunities at investment margins of around 20% 
operating margin. In 2014 we acquired 8,315 plots in the 
short term land market (2013: 9,560 plots). As previously 
announced, we have now reached our optimal short term 
landbank size, and so we are currently maintaining, rather 
than growing, the short term proportion of our landbank. 
As at the end of December 2014 our short term landbank 
stood at c.75k plots equivalent to c.six years of supply at 
current completion levels. The average selling price in the 
UK short term owned landbank in 2014 has increased by 
13.3% to £222k (2013: £196k), driven by the quality of 
additions and the improvement in the housing market. 
Our success and expertise in sourcing and converting 
land which does not have residential planning consent  
at the time we take a commercial interest (our strategic 
pipeline) is a key part of our strategy and underpins our 
confidence in delivering sustainable margins through the 
cycle. We have one of the largest strategic pipelines in 
the sector which stands at c.110k potential plots  
(31 December 2013: c.110k potential plots). A large 
strategic pipeline enables us to manage our cash flows 
and underpins our profitability, by providing a source  
of land supply at enhanced margins. This also protects 
the quality of the short term landbank, decreasing the 
pressure on the teams across the business to compete  
in the short term land market. We worked with local 
authorities and communities to convert a further  
10,779 plots from the strategic pipeline to the short term 
landbank in 2014, a record for Taylor Wimpey (2013: 
9,210 plots). This is well in excess of our medium term 
conversion target of c.6,000 plots per annum. This 
provides us with increased choices and opportunities  
and we will pursue land disposals on larger sites where 
we can achieve the best value. We continue to invest  
in new opportunities and in 2014 we added c.18k new 
potential plots to the strategic pipeline. In 2014 a record 
39% of our completions were sourced from the strategic 
pipeline (2013: 29%). Our aim is to increase completions 
from the strategic pipeline to over 40% per annum in  
the medium term. With over 50% of our landbank  
now comprising strategically sourced land (2013: 50%),  
we are well placed to deliver strong strategic pipeline 
performance and generate value from this part of  
our landbank. 
Managing the planning 
and community 
engagement process
We do much more than build homes. We are first and 
foremost a local business and an important contributor  
to the local communities in which we build and to the 
sustainability of those communities and areas. 
We operate as a very local business and firmly believe  
we have an implicit commitment to serve the local 
communities in which we work with this responsibility 
growing with our success. In 2014, we contributed 
£300 million to local communities in which we build 
across the UK via planning obligations, providing local 
infrastructure, affordable homes, public transport 
and education (2013: £227 million). In addition, we 
continued to sponsor numerous local teams and 
events, from football teams through to gardening clubs.
We know that local communities do not always welcome 
housing developments in their area, so it is essential that 
we seek to engage, consult and work in partnership with 
communities and all interested stakeholders both before 
we submit a planning application and during the life cycle 
of the site. In this way we can listen to their concerns and 
incorporate these within our plans, where possible.

Directors’ Report: Governance p44-91 Financial Statements p92-143 Shareholder Information p144-153 Strategic Report p2-43 During 2014, we organised 158 days of community 
events and exhibitions and 266 community meetings.  
We were delighted that 96% of our employees believe 
that Taylor Wimpey takes its social and community 
responsibilities seriously.
We aim to be the residential developer that everyone 
wants to deal with and through our creative approach  
to the planning system, focus on localism, and efforts  
to become the preferred partner, we believe we are 
becoming the landbuyer of choice. 
Planning is fundamental to the success of our business 
and we aim to progress sites through planning as 
efficiently as possible. We support the Government’s 
Localism Act and work closely with local authorities  
and communities throughout the planning process and 
beyond. We aim to create development proposals that 
are financially viable, benefit the local community and 
provide the housing that is needed. 
Our Taylor Wimpey website includes pages for all of our 
proposed developments throughout the UK and we have 
continued to develop and improve the functionality and 
content of these pages in 2014. By the end of 2014 we 
had trained relevant employees in all of our regional 
business units on how to design, fill and update the 
content of these pages.
We are committed to publishing information on proposed 
developments online so that members of local 
communities and other interested parties can easily  
find out what we are planning and where. We would like 
people to register their interest so we can update them 
on progress. Above all, we want wider and more diverse 
groups and individuals to get involved and tell us their 
views, whether positive or negative. 
Getting the 
homebuilding  
basics right
Getting the basics right means effective processes, 
consistently applied. 
Health and safety
The health and safety of individuals on our sites is  
our non-negotiable top priority. We are committed to 
providing a safe place in which our employees and 
subcontractors can work and our customers can live. 
This was reflected in our 2014 employee survey which 
found that 99% of staff believe that Taylor Wimpey is 
committed to health and safety and keeping people safe.
We have a comprehensive HSE (Health, Safety and 
Environmental) Strategy in place with accompanying 
action site operational plans. We have continued to keep 
our Annual Injury Incidence Rate (AIIR) for reportable 
injuries low at 209 per 100,000 employees and 
contractors in 2014 (2013: 207). We reduced our 
AIIR for major injuries from 60 in 2013 to 26 in 2014. 
In 2014 we provided an average of 5.3 days per 
person of formal HSE training to our site operational 
staff (2013: 4.3)
(a)
 and 0.2 days to other support staff 
(2013: 0.2). We continue to provide a range of training for 
our operatives from induction training and HSE training 
poster campaigns to regular on-site HSE training briefing 
sessions known as toolbox talks. 
We continue to engage extensively with contractors and 
operatives on health and safety, working in partnership 
with them to continually find safer ways of carrying out 
their tasks on site. During 2014, we launched our HSE 
Theme Initiative, which provides a new approach to 
HSE communication and supervision on site. 
We continued our groundworker training and 
engagement and supervision initiative in 2014 and have 
now trained a total of 2,753 groundworkers’ supervisors 
since the initiative began in 2012. In 2014 we introduced 
additional working platform lifts on all our scaffolds, 
significantly reducing the risk of injury from falls or slips,

Quality product range 
We build homes that people want to live in. We are proud 
of the homes we build and the communities we create. 
Our focus is on providing high-quality, well-designed, 
sustainable homes and communities that meet the needs 
and aspirations of local residents. Our mix of homes is 
informed by the local area.
We continue to offer a wide range of homes from 
apartments to five bedroom houses, with prices ranging 
from under £100k to over £3 million.
In 2014, the proportion of apartments in our private 
completions was 18% (2013: 20%). Strategically we  
look to maintain this level at between 20% and 25% of 
our business. The average square footage of our private 
completions also increased slightly to 1,042 square feet 
(2013: 1,038 square feet).
We are pleased to report that Taylor Wimpey achieved  
its strongest performance yet in the National House-
Building Council (NHBC) Pride in the Job Awards 2014, 
with our site managers winning a total of 70 Quality 
Awards (2013: 68), 23 seals of excellence (2013: 17)  
and five regional awards (2013: five). Regional Winner 
Andy Shaw, from our Midlands regional business,  
was also named Runner-Up in the Multi-Storey Builder 
category at the Supreme Awards for his work at our  
Diglis Water development in Worcester.
During 2014 our house type range was fully utilised on  
all appropriate sites. As at the end of January 2015 this 
range was plotted on c.70% of active sites. These homes 
are designed to be high-quality and extremely energy 
efficient, alongside being cost-effective and safe to build. 
They are also extremely flexible with different internal 
layouts and exteriors that can be varied to complement 
local landscapes and streetscapes. This, in combination 
with our national deals and our scale, will help to mitigate 
expected build cost inflation.
Build costs and efficiency
Our scale affords us the benefit of strong purchasing 
power and we achieve significant cost savings across  
our regional businesses with national agreements with  
a number of suppliers. 
During 2014 the improved market resulted in underlying 
build cost increases (excluding house type mix impact)  
of c.5%. This was broadly spread between labour and 
materials. During the year, manufacturing of key 
components of housebuilding such as bricks increased 
to keep pace with the growth of the industry and, as a 
result, we are now seeing reduced pricing pressure on 
materials. We anticipate that build cost inflation should 
somewhat reduce as the industry adjusts to the 
increased labour and material demand. It is pleasing to 
note that capacity for key supplies is increasing following 
greater certainty on the rate of housebuilding.
National deals account for 90% of key materials  
we purchase and are supplied through our central 
procurement division which focuses on achieving best 
supplier value, assessing sustainability credentials and 
helping to achieve a more secure supply source. Our 
internal supply chain logistics business, Taylor Wimpey 
Logistics, is also an important part of our supply chain 
management in the current environment. Taylor Wimpey 
Logistics sources bulk materials directly from 
manufacturers, generally using national contracts, 
providing us with an alternative route to delivery and 
aiding efficiency with the preparation of ‘just in time’  
build packs for each stage of the building process.
We rely upon our suppliers and subcontractors and strive 
to work in partnership with them to ensure their safety on 
our sites, to treat them fairly and with respect, and to 
make sure that they are paid promptly.
Environment 
We remain committed to high standards of environmental 
management on all of our developments and sites. We 
strive to keep any adverse effects that our activities may 
have on local environments and communities such as 
pollution and ecological damage to a minimum and to 
make a positive contribution to the environment of the 
areas we build in. 
We acknowledge the global threat of climate change 
and are committed to reducing our emissions, energy 
use, waste and water use. In 2014 we continued with 
our energy reduction programme on sites, in sales areas 
and in offices. We also conducted a review of climate 
change adaptation. Our scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions 
intensity reduced by 1.2% in 2014. We expect a greater 
reduction in 2015 as our energy reduction programme 
progresses.
We have a comprehensive Waste and Resource  
Strategy and Action Plan for our housing operations and 
our supply chain. We see materials as resources, using 
them more efficiently through design and on site recovery, 
and keeping waste generated to a minimum. In 2014 we 
saw our construction waste increase to 4.58 tonnes per 
100 square metres of completed floor area (2013: 3.59). 
Our research indicates that nationally there has been 
upward pressure on waste generation figures in 2014.  
 During 2014 our house type range 
was fully utilised on all appropriate sites.

Directors’ Report: Governance p44-91 Financial Statements p92-143 Shareholder Information p144-153 Strategic Report p2-43 We have identified numerous potential contributory 
factors, the principal one being skills shortages 
associated with the upswing in homebuilding activity.  
In 2015 we will develop and implement action plans for 
reducing our construction waste by 15%. Even at our 
2014 level of waste generation, our construction waste 
figures compare very favourably with our peers.
New homes are considerably more energy-efficient  
than older housing stock and we are committed to  
building increasingly energy-efficient homes in line with 
Government policy and Build Regulations. Our ‘fabric 
first’ approach to energy efficiency, which concentrates 
on highly insulated walls and windows, helps owners  
to save energy and money. 
Housebuilding can impact on biodiversity so we need to 
ensure that we build sensitively with regard to the ecology 
of the land being developed. During 2014, we undertook 
an in-depth review of biodiversity with a view to 
developing a biodiversity strategy for Taylor Wimpey.
We undertook a water audit in 2014 and have reported 
on water use for the first time in our Sustainability 
Report 2014.
We carry out flood risk assessments on all sites in 
consultation with water authorities and the Environment 
Agency, as required, to ensure appropriate design for 
each site. Flooding is an issue in the UK and we take 
flood risk extremely seriously. In 2014 we reviewed our 
internal processes to ensure that we effectively assess 
and manage flood risk now and in the future.

Delivering 
customer service
We have a strong and sustainable customer base,  
with over 90% owner occupiers. First time buyers 
accounted for 35% of our sales (2013: 38%). 
We continue to offer a wide range of products to assist 
first time buyers. Our prices are set locally and we use 
targeted customer incentives, on a site by site basis, 
knowing that our customers’ circumstances vary.
We know each home we build is aspirational to the 
customer who purchases it, regardless of price, and we 
want our processes and quality to reflect this. It is critical, 
that as our business grows, we continue to concentrate 
on maintaining a high level of customer service. 
In 2014 we achieved a customer satisfaction rate  
of 87% (2013: 90%), with the decrease reflecting the 
challenge to deliver our homes on time as the labour 
market adapted to the better sales market. Whilst this 
remains high in comparison to historic trends, we are  
very disappointed that this has decreased. During 2014 
we began an in-depth review of every aspect and  
stage of our customer experience, to identify areas of 
improvement and to deliver a better homebuying 
experience for our customers. This is a very important 
area for us and will continue to be a key focus in  
2015 and on an ongoing basis, as we work to realise 
improvements to our service and to our customers’ 
experience.
Sales and marketing
Over the years our customers’ communication 
preferences have changed, with visits to our website  
from mobile devices increasing by 42%. As well as 
increased visits, during 2014 our award-winning website 
has proven very successful in generating 13% more 
telephone calls than 2013.
The Government’s Help to Buy equity loan remains very 
popular with our customers. During 2014 approximately 
35% of total sales used the scheme and we worked  
with c.4,400 households to take the first step to home 
ownership or to move up the housing ladder. Approximately 
73% of sales through Help to Buy in 2014 were to first 
time buyers. 
Our people
Our people are one of our greatest competitive 
advantages. 
We believe that having the right people with the right  
skills at all levels in our organisation is critical to building  
a quality business and delivering our strategy. 
We are an important local employer. During 2014 we 
directly employed, on average c.3,900 people across  
the UK. During 2014 we also indirectly employed an 
average of 11,450 operatives to work on our sites.  
In an increasingly competitive market, we are pleased 
that our voluntary employee turnover rate remained low 
during 2014 at 7.1% (2013: 7.5%).

Taylor Wimpey plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2014
38 We have consistently invested in our future success 
through employee learning and development whilst 
increasing our apprenticeship and trainee schemes 
across a number of areas. During 2014 we significantly 
increased our recruitment for these schemes, taking  
on 99 apprentices, (including 29 site management 
apprentices) 50 management trainees and 19 graduates 
(2013 total: 89).
We have also been assessing how to attract the best 
people and how we retain and reward them. During  
2014 we introduced a number of initiatives including  
an enhanced employee discount scheme of up to 20% 
subject to certain criteria when buying a Taylor Wimpey 
home to reward and encourage long term loyalty of our 
employees. We believe that employee share ownership  
is important and so we were also particularly pleased  
that over 50% of all eligible employees participated in  
the Company’s all-employee share schemes or held 
shares of the Company during 2014. 
Optimising value
Our ability to constantly increase efficiency and tightly 
control costs is part of the Taylor Wimpey culture and 
remains central to delivering enhanced returns. 
This extends to and encompasses all aspects of our 
business as we strive to optimise and capture value  
at every level from procurement through to delivery. 
We actively review every site, both new and old,  
through our value improvement meetings which are  
held quarterly and are tracked centrally. This allows  
us to benchmark our success and identify opportunities 
for further improvement, ranging from replanning of  
sites to redesign and selective enhancements to our 
specification. We are committed to not only delivering 
what we set out to do but by delivering more, instilling  
a discipline of capturing inflation. During 2014, we 
achieved a 2.7% (2013: 1.7%) increase in achieved 
contribution margin on completions on land we had 
acquired post-2009. 
We have improved our UK net operating asset turn to 
1.29 times (2013: 1.25 times) and routinely consider 
opportunities on sites which we already own, to assess 
possible ways of bringing forward the delivery of much 
needed new homes. We balance our culture of driving 
continuous quality improvement with a desire and focus 
on continuing to improve our asset efficiency. Over the 
next year we will be working to ensure a smoother profile 
of completions through the year, which will have a 
significant impact on our internal business efficiency, 
delivery of good customer service and management  
of costs.
Spain Housing
The Spanish market remained stable during 2014.  
Our newly acquired sites performed well due to their 
better quality locations, driving a significant improvement 
in performance. During 2014, we completed 164 homes 
(2013: 118) at an average selling price of €250k (2013: 
€229k). The total order book as at 31 December 2014 
stood at 233 homes (31 December 2013: 195 homes). 
The Spanish business delivered an improved operating 
profit* for 2014 of £4.2 million (2013: £0.1 million). 
Looking ahead, we remain cautiously optimistic whilst 
conscious of the macro European economic environment 
where the majority of customers are based.

Focused on delivering sustainable  
returns through the cycle
Group financial review of continuing operations 
The financial review is presented at Group level, which 
includes Spain.
Income statement
Group revenue from continuing operations increased  
by 17.0% to £2,686.1 million in 2014 (2013: £2,295.5 
million) from completions of 12,618, including joint 
ventures (2013: 11,814). The increase was driven by 
much improved selling prices in the UK, up 11.5% to 
£213k (2013: £191k), and UK volume growth of 6.5%  
to 12,294 completions (2013: 11,547) excluding joint 
ventures. Average selling prices on private completions 
increased by 11.4% to £234k (2013: £210k) in the UK, 
with this increase both a result of our underlying shift  
to better quality locations and capturing market sales 
price increases.
The UK land cost per unit sold at £45.1k is higher than 
£41.2k in the prior year particularly reflecting the better 
quality locations traded from in 2014. This contributes 
positively to the sales price growth and overall profitability 
of the Group. Total UK land cost per completion as a 
percentage of selling prices was 21.2% (2013: 21.5%) 
reflecting the benefits of conversions from the strategic 
land pipeline, partially offset by product mix and an 
increase in volumes from the London market. 
Build cost per unit in the UK increased to £113k  
(2013: £105k) reflecting higher quality mix driven product 
specification and the impact of build cost inflation. Other 
direct costs and selling expenses per unit decreased to 
£5.3k (2013: £5.9k).
We are focused on maximising the contribution per 
completion as we seek to drive the quality of returns. 
Contribution per completion increased by 27.8% to 
£49.6k for 2014, (2013: £38.8k), as a result of better 
quality locations and improving market conditions, 
offsetting land and build cost increases.
Gross profit before exceptional items, of £620.9 million 
(2013: £449.3 million), increased by 38.2% and included 
a positive contribution of £15.9 million (2013: £45.4 
million). Positive contribution represents the amount  
of previously written down inventory allocated to a plot 
which has resulted in a gross profit on completion. This 
can be due to revenue outperformance, cost efficiencies 
or product mix improvements. These amounts are stated 
before the allocation of overheads which are excluded 
from the Group’s net realisable value exercise. 
In 2014, 14% (2013: 32%) of the Group’s UK 
completions were from sites that had been previously 
impaired. In Spain, 50 plots (2013: 95) were completed 
that had previously been impaired. The Group anticipates 
2014 highlights:
 − Operating profit* margin up 430 basis points to 17.9% (2013: 13.6%)
 − Return on net operating assets** up 570 basis points to 22.5% (2013: 16.8%) 
 − Tangible net asset value per share
†
 increased by 11.9% to 77.9 pence  
(2013: 69.6 pence), 15.8% growth in net assets before cash distributions
 − £49.7 million cash returned to shareholders in 2014 (1.54 pence per share),  
with a further c.£250 million (7.68 pence per share) to be returned in  
July 2015 as previously announced, subject to shareholder approval 
 − Maintenance dividend pay-out doubled to 2% of net assets subject  
to shareholder approval

40 that c.7% of short term owned and controlled impaired 
plots will complete in 2015. 
Operating profit* increased to £480.7 million (2013: 
£312.9 million), delivering an operating profit* margin of 
17.9% (2013: 13.6%), an increase of 430 bps. The UK 
operating profit* margin in the second half of the year  
was 19.3% (H2 2013: 14.0%). These improvements have 
been driven by the ongoing benefits of the quality of our 
short term land acquisitions and by our conversion of the 
strategic pipeline. 
Pre-exceptional net finance costs for the period were 
£30.6 million (2013: £44.5 million), reflecting the buyback 
of the outstanding 10.375% Senior Notes at the end  
of 2013 improving net debt efficiency, as well as lower 
average net borrowings of £148.7 million during the  
year (2013: £169.3 million). 
Pre-exceptional profit before tax for the year from 
continuing operations increased by 67.7% to £450.1 
million (2013: £268.4 million). The pre-exceptional tax 
charge was £90.4 million (2013: £53.7 million) with an 
underlying tax rate of 20.1% (2013: 20.0%).
This resulted in a profit, before exceptional items, for 
2014 of £359.7 million (2013: £214.7 million), 67.5%  
up on the prior year.
Basic earnings per share were 11.6 pence (2013: 7.5 
pence). The adjusted basic earnings per share from 
continuing operations
††
 were 11.2 pence (2013: 6.7 
pence), up 67.2%, reflecting the strong improvement  
in trading and more efficient debt structure following  
the Senior Note repurchase in December 2013.
During 2014, in line with improved market conditions,  
the Group recorded a net reversal of £18.7 million of 
inventory write-downs (2013: £45.6 million). The net 
reversal in the year consisted of a release of previous 
impairments (£27.0 million) and additional write-downs 
to the lower of cost and net realisable value (£8.3 million). 
Balance sheet
Net operating assets were £2,265.0 million (31 December 
2013: £1,999.6 million), reflecting a net investment 
of £409.1 million (2013: £92.8 million) year on year 
in land and work in progress, funded mostly by 
increased profitability. Return on net operating assets** 
increased by 570 basis points to 22.5% (2013: 16.8%), 
ahead of our medium term target of 20.0%, reflecting 
improved profitability and balance sheet discipline.
Group net operating asset turn increased to 1.26  
times (2013: 1.23 times), as a result of trading from  
better quality locations and focused land and work  
in progress investment.
Relative to our medium term targets of adding 15% to  
net assets before any cash distributions to shareholders, 
net assets at 31 December 2014 increased by 15.8% 
before cash distributions and 12.6% overall year on year 
to £2,535.3 million (31 December 2013: £2,251.8 million). 
The net asset increase was driven by profitability in the 
period offset by the £23.0 million maintenance dividend 
and the £49.7 million cash return. 
As at 31 December 2014, the Group held inventory that 
had been written down to net realisable value of £296.6 
million (31 December 2013: £490.1 million) of which the 
balance in the UK was £269.6 million (31 December 2013: 
£459.9 million). As at 31 December 2014, the associated

Group Financial Review continued
Cash generation 
At this stage in the cycle and given our strong land 
position, the focus on converting a high proportion  
of our profitability into cash is an important measure.  
The chart below shows cash generated by operations  
on an annual basis.
Retirement benefit obligations of £183.8 million at  
31 December 2014 (31 December 2013: £183.8 million) 
comprise a defined benefit pension liability of £182.4 
million (2013: £182.2 million) and a post-retirement 
healthcare liability of £1.4 million (2013: £1.6 million).  
The deficit in the pension scheme has increased by 
£0.2 million due to changes in actuarial assumptions, 
most notably the discount rate applied to the scheme. 
However, this has been offset by strong asset growth and 
cash contributions in the period. In 2014 we contributed 
£36.3 million in pension contributions (2013: £48.1 million).  
Cash flow
Net cash increased substantially to £112.8 million at  
31 December 2014 from £5.4 million at 31 December 
2013. Total land spend, including land creditors, was 
£795.7 million (2013: £574.7 million). During the year we 
increased our investment in work in progress, including 
increasing our presence in the central London market 
year on year, with work in progress in central London  
of £67.0 million as at 31 December 2014 (31 December 
2013: £39.0 million). In 2014, we paid £14.6 million 
in interest costs (2013: £35.2 million), £72.7 million in 
dividends and purchased £10.0 million of own shares  
for settlement of future vesting of share schemes.  
This improvement in net cash is largely as a result  
of outperformance in underlying trading, whilst at the 
same time continuing to invest in our landbank as we 
approached our optimal scale. Average net debt for  
the year was £148.7 million (2013: £169.3 million).
Pensions
Following the completion of the initial valuation for the 
merged pension scheme as at 31 December 2013, we 
reached agreement with the pension Trustees on the 
future deficit repair contributions. Total contributions 
have been reduced to £23 million per annum from 2015 
onwards, versus the £53 million previously committed. 
This reduction in the funding requirement reflects the 
decrease in the pension deficit since the last triennial 
Trustee valuation, due mainly to asset performance 
and the various liability management initiatives we have 
undertaken in conjunction with the Trustees, as well 
as the improvement in the strength of the business.
In conjunction with the Trustees, the scheme has 
completed a £206.2 million medically underwritten buy-in 
with Partnership Life Assurance Company Ltd of the top 
pension liabilities removing a significant level of mortality 
risk and hence liability volatility. The price paid for the 
insurance policy was £9.4 million below the technical 
provisions for those members insured. Furthermore,  
as part of greater flexibility for the scheme membership, 
we have completed a flexible retirement offer, where 
approximately £25 million of the liability has been 
transferred from the scheme.
These initiatives, coupled with the active liability hedging 
framework we have in place, continue to reduce the risk 
and volatility of the pension obligations.
write-downs were £206.2 million (31 December 2013: 
£265.1 million) of which the balance in the UK was 
£158.1 million and principally related to 15 locations. 
As at 31 December 2014, 7% of our short term owned 
and controlled land was impaired (31 December 2013: 
12%), with 71% of the short term owned and controlled 
landbank purchased after 2009, over half of which was 
sourced through our strategic pipeline, resulting in a land 
cost to average selling price in the owned landbank of 
17.3% (31 December 2013: 18.4%).
We continue to use land creditors as a way of funding 
land acquisitions where this makes the most commercial 
sense and is value-enhancing for the business. Land 
creditors increased to £487.7 million (2013: £349.0 million) 
and, combined with net cash, resulted in adjusted gearing 
of 14.8% (31 December 2013: 15.3%).
The mortgage debtor balance was £104.8 million at  
31 December 2014 (31 December 2013: £107.5 million), 
with the decrease due to £16.8 million of loan redemptions 
in the period being partially offset by a further fair value 
gain of £3.9 million (31 December 2013: £5.5 million gain).
Our deferred tax asset declined to £157.5 million  
(31 December 2013: £246.6 million), due to utilisation 
against profits in the period. There are no further 
unrecognised UK trading tax losses and based on 
forecast profitability we expect the Group to have fully 
utilised its deferred tax asset arising from UK trading 
losses by the end of 2015.

Financing structure
As at 31 December 2014, the Group had total committed 
debt facilities of £650 million providing significant financial 
capacity. During February 2015 agreement was reached 
to extend the existing revolving credit facility to mature  
in 2020 and at reduced margins and fees. This will result 
in an annual interest saving of £2.5 million. The average 
maturity of our committed facilities is now extended to  
five years.
The strength of the Group’s balance sheet and continued 
strong operational and financial performance has been 
reflected in the continued improvement of T aylor Wimpey’ s 
corporate credit ratings, the most recent being the 
investment grade rating by Fitch. 
Going concern
The Directors remain of the view that the Group’s 
financing arrangements and balance sheet strength 
provides both the necessary facilities and covenant 
headroom to enable the Group to conduct its business 
for at least the next 12 months. Accordingly, the 
consolidated financial statements are prepared  
on a going concern basis.
Accounting standards
The consolidated financial statements have been 
produced in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed and adopted  
for use in the EU. There have been no changes to 
International Accounting Standards during 2014 that  
have a material impact on the Group results.

Directors’ Report: Governance p44-91 Financial Statements p92-143 Shareholder Information p144-153 Strategic Report p2-43 Corporate Governance
Achievements for 2014
 − Continuing full compliance with the 2012 edition of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and embracing the key elements  
of the latest (September 2014) edition of the Code which will  
apply to the 2015 financial year.
 − Full compliance with the requirements of the BIS Regulations  
and related legislation on the reporting of remuneration. 
 − Establishing a Diversity and lnclusivity Committee designed  
to drive forward our agenda in these areas.
 − The independent externally-facilitated Board evaluation concluded 
that the Company has a well-functioning and effective Board which 
takes its duties and responsibilities very seriously. 
 − Further embedding of good governance and improvement  
of controls at all levels of the business through completing  
the successful roll-out of enhanced business systems and 
progressing the updating of key process manuals.
2015 T argets
 − To further embed improved Diversity and Inclusivity processes 
across the Group and to better monitor and report on progress 
using an improved HR data capture system.
 − To address the recommendations arising out of the Board  
evaluation including:
 − formalising and refining the comprehensive induction processes  
for new Directors;
 − a continuing focus on succession planning for all key roles across 
the Group;
 − to continue ongoing improvement of the overall quality of Board 
reports and presentations; 
 − To ensure full compliance with the 2014 UK Corporate Governance 
Code which will apply to the 2015 financial year.
“ The Board takes corporate 
governance very seriously  
and this has been  
demonstrated over many  
years with full compliance with 
the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. Good governance should 
be focused on how the Board 
itself operates effectively and 
also the culture within which our  
businesses operate and 
conduct themselves.”
Dear Shareholder
In my capacity as Chairman of the Board, I am very pleased to  
again have this opportunity to make a personal statement on the 
Company’s approach to corporate governance.
As I have said before, the Board takes corporate governance very 
seriously and this has been demonstrated over many years, with full 
compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’) 
and also with its predecessor versions. To demonstrate the Board’s 
proactive approach to corporate governance, the Company has 
consistently sought to comply with planned improvements to the 
Code, and with wider governance initiatives often in advance of their 
formal application to our reporting years. The Board receives regular 
briefings and updates on corporate governance, both at Board and 
Committee meetings and, where necessary in between such 
meetings, which all Directors find very helpful. 
This report on Corporate Governance sets out and explains in clear 
terms the processes in place which are essential for delivery of the 
long term success of the Company, whilst ensuring that we comply 
with all applicable laws and regulations as well as, of course, meeting 
the requirements of our shareholders and their representative bodies, 
with whom we are always very pleased to engage and have once 
again proactively done so during 2014 and into 2015. The Board 
believes that good governance should be focused not only on how 
the Board itself operates effectively but also on the culture within 
which all of our businesses operate and conduct themselves.
The Board welcomed the implementation of the Government’s  
new regulations on the reporting of remuneration which required 
additional disclosure to our shareholders in last year’s Annual Report. 
More generally, 2014 was a year of consolidation in the area of good 
governance, as the improvements set out in the 2012 version of the 
Code bedded in, and the changes proposed in the latest edition  
of the Code, published in September 2014, were considered by  
the Board. 
Taylor Wimpey plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2014
46 These changes, which apply to reporting for 2015 cover a number  
of areas including in the areas of: going concern; risk management 
and internal control; requiring remuneration to be designed to 
promote the long-term success of companies; encouraging greater 
shareholder dialogue and, further ways to improve the functioning  
of a Board through wider areas of diversity. The Board supports each  
of these changes and these areas are discussed in greater detail in 
this Report and also in the separate Reports of the Audit, Nomination 
and Remuneration Committees, which appear later.
Pursuant to best practice, the Board conducts its annual evaluation 
exercise via an independent external facilitator once in every three 
years and it was carried out in this way during 2014 The exercise  
was very comprehensive and involved all Directors, both collectively 
and individually, plus feedback and insight from external advisers and 
senior employees who work closely with the Board. Consistent with 
previous exercises, the evaluation proved to be very useful and whilst 
it was pleasing to note that the report concluded that the Board is 
well-functioning and effective and is one which takes its responsibilities 
and duties very seriously, it also found that there are certain areas for 
improvement. I can confirm that the Board will be focusing on these 
areas during 2015 and more detail is set out on page 50. 
This Report also seeks to explain what your Board of Directors  
does and describes how it is responsible for setting the culture and 
values of the Company, ensuring that the Company is run in the best 
interests of its shareholders as well as other stakeholders, and how  
it interacts with its shareholders in explaining the Company’s strategic 
goals and performance against them. From a governance perspective, 
it is not just a case of what is done but also, and just as importantly, 
how it is done – therefore, we try and avoid a simple box ticking type 
approach, preferring our governance to be something that is properly 
embedded in our people, processes and decision making.
A key part of my role as Chairman of the Board is to ensure that the 
Board retains an appropriate level of independence in order to allow 
the Independent Non Executive Directors to challenge the Executive 
Directors constructively whilst, at the same time, also supporting them 
to implement the strategy and run the business effectively. Another 
key part of my role is to ensure that the Board has the right blend of 
skill, independence and knowledge and this is something that is kept 
under regular review in conjunction with the Nomination Committee.
As a Board we regularly review health, safety and environmental 
performance, our business strategy, key risks, the market, operational 
matters, customer services, human resources, diversity, corporate 
responsibility, community engagement, our financial position and 
performance, governance and legal matters and, shareholder-related 
matters including the make up of our share register. This is done 
through the consideration and discussion of regular reports  
submitted by the Executive Directors and through other reports  
and presentations from our senior management and external 
advisers. The Board and individual Directors also undertake regular 
visits to our regional businesses and also to their development sites. 
In 2014, the Board visited the West Scotland business unit where it 
held a Board Meeting and also met with the local management team 
and staff whilst taking the opportunity to visit a number of 
developments where it received a series of presentations. 
Appointments and succession
As reported last year, Tony Reading stepped down from the Board  
on 17 April 2014 as an Independent Non Executive Director, broadly 
coinciding with the conclusion of his third three-year term of office. 
Margaret Ford succeeded him as Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee from that time and in order to comply with the Code  
and the requirement for there to be three Independent Non Executive 
Directors on the Committee, Kate Barker was also appointed to  
the Committee.
More details on appointments and succession planning, which are 
led by the Nomination Committee, which makes recommendations  
in these areas to the Board, are set out in the Nomination Committee 
Report on pages 56 to 59.
At the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held on  
23 April 2015 (AGM), all Directors will again be subject to re-election 
by shareholders in accordance with the Code. Biographical details  
of each Director can be found on pages 44 to 45.
I believe that the balance of the Board, with myself as Chairman, 
three Executive Directors and four Independent Non Executive 
Directors, will continue to provide the right blend of experience, 
expertise and challenge to ensure good governance so as to enable 
the Company to successfully implement its strategy.

Board Committees
The Board has three Committees: Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration.
During 2014 the Audit Committee completed its schedule of work 
designed to ensure full compliance with the provisions of Section  
C of the Code, in relation to financial reporting and risk assessment.  
Full details are set out in the Audit Committee Report on pages  
60 to 65. In brief, the Committee:
 − established processes to enable it to satisfy itself and recommend 
to the Board that the information presented to shareholders in  
this Report and Accounts is, as a whole, a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment of our position and prospects  
(see page 64);
 − reviewed the performance of the external auditor, Deloitte LLP , 
before recommending to the Board that a resolution be proposed 
for their re-appointment at the AGM (see page 62);
 − undertook its very important role with regard to risk management 
and internal controls so that the Company can closely monitor  
its exposure to risks which could impact upon the future prospects 
of the Company and achievement of its strategic objectives  
(see page 63).
The Committee has, during the year, continued to focus closely  
on these key areas, and will continue to do so throughout 2015.
The Committee also welcomes the new Guidance on Risk 
Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business 
Reporting issued by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) in 
September 2014, which it believes will enhance governance in these 
areas. More details are set out in the Audit Committee Report on 
pages 60 to 65. 
The Nomination Committee has been closely involved during 2014  
in reviewing:
 − the balance, diversity, independence and effectiveness of the Board;
 − a detailed review of succession and contingency planning across 
the Group in order to achieve the Company’s strategic aim of 
attracting, developing and retaining the best quality people at all 
levels of the Company, and to improve our talent management;
 − reviewing strategy; establishing targets; and driving and monitoring 
progress in improving diversity generally throughout the Group.
These remain key priorities for further development during 2015.
Additional reporting on its activities, including more details of progress 
and plans in each of these areas, in line with the Code, is set out in 
the Nomination Committee Report on pages 56 to 59.
Board activities and priorities
Board meetings consist of a mix of regular and standard items considered at each meeting and also special items which arise from time  
to time either annually or as part of key project related work. The latter are set out below. Regular items include: receiving and reviewing the 
business of Board Committee meetings and the minutes of such meetings held since the last Board meeting; a health, safety and environmental 
report; reports from the Chief Executive on trading and investment, people, the political environment and on customer services.

During 2014, the Remuneration Committee has continued its primary 
responsibility of ensuring that executive remuneration is geared to the 
enhancement of shareholder value and the delivery of the Company’s 
strategy; and that the rewards for achieving or exceeding those 
targets are not excessive. Full details are set out in the Remuneration 
Committee Report on pages 66 to 85. Key areas the Committee 
focused on or considered are set out below:
 − the engagement with major shareholders and their representative 
bodies on key remuneration matters in respect of which, the 
Committee very much values and welcomes their input;
 − the further developments in remuneration planning, set out in  
the September 2014 revision to the Code, which were welcomed 
by the Committee and details of the Committee’s plans for their 
implementation are set out in the Remuneration Committee Report 
on pages 66 to 85;
 − the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at last year’s 
AGM (in respect of which no changes are proposed or required), 
details of which are set out in the Remuneration Committee Report 
on pages 66 to 85, and which incorporates some minor updating 
so as to reflect the actual operation of the Policy since its adoption 
and approval by shareholders at the 2014 AGM.
As noted above, due to the fact that there has been no change to  
the Remuneration Policy, the business of the 2015 AGM includes  
only one resolution on remuneration – namely, the advisory vote on 
the way in which the Policy has been applied during 2014, as set  
out in the Remuneration Report on pages 66 to 85. For 2015, the 
Committee has reviewed the performance targets set for the 
Company’s discretionary reward schemes, and has taken into 
account the likely impact of Government support schemes.

Diversity and inclusivity has continued to be a key item on the overall 
UK governance agenda during 2014 and the Company has attended

Taylor Wimpey, diversity and inclusivity has remained a key priority for 
the Board’s agenda and this will continue to be the case during 2015. 
Our ambitions and views are set out in our Diversity Policy which 
can be found on pages 57 to 59 and on the Company’s website:

Board evaluation
Pursuant to the Code, the Board carries out a formal and rigorous 
annual evaluation which is externally facilitated at least once every 
three years. In accordance with this requirement, the 2014 Board 
evaluation was externally facilitated through Independent Board 
Evaluation, a firm which specialises in and which has considerable 
experience in this field, having carried out evaluations on several 
FTSE 100 Boards. The evaluation is an important part of the 
Board’s corporate governance framework and both the process 
and outcome are always taken very seriously by the Board,  
each Committee and by each individual Director.
Performance evaluation of the Board, its Committees  
and other functions
The outcome of the 2013 Board evaluation was reported on  
in detail in last year’s Corporate Governance Report. The main action 
points arising from that exercise, and action taken in respect of each, 
are set out below:
 − a more definitive split between the Chief Executive’s strategic 
reporting on progress and prospects, and more detailed 
operational reviews from senior executives below Board level;
This was addressed during 2014 by appending to the CEO’s report 
to each Board meeting, the operational reports of the Divisional 
Chairmen of our UK operating business and by their attendance  
at certain Board meetings, so as to provide the Board with greater 
insight and granularity into the progress in achieving the Company’s 
strategic goals at a more operational level set out on pages 16 to 17.
 − further work to ensure the progress made in the area of diversity  
is embedded into the Company’s day to day operations and 
forward planning;
This was addressed during 2014 by establishing a Diversity and 
Inclusivity Committee, comprising representatives of the Board  
and representatives of the businesses and HR, to drive the  
diversity improvement strategy forward and help to embed suitable 
processes throughout the business; and by undertaking a number  
of initiatives designed to improve awareness in recruiting, training  
and promotion processes.
 − further work to refine succession planning and related development 
programmes for executives;
This remains an ongoing priority and was addressed in part during 
2014 by the making of four senior appointments: the Group HR 
Director, the Customer Director, the Planning Director and the Group 
Financial Controller, each having diverse backgrounds that provide 
both an appropriate balance of skills, experience and knowledge to 
enable their duties to be discharged effectively and enhance and 
strengthen the overall depth of the management team.
 − additional reporting in three key areas: land investment analysis; 
people development; and operations and prospects in the  
London area.
These were addressed during 2014 by introducing separate reporting 
in each area to each Board meeting, which are considered both in 
their own right and also in relation to the Company’s overall strategic 
direction and operational progress.
As previously mentioned, the 2014 Board evaluation was externally 
facilitated, in compliance with the Code requirement that this exercise 
be undertaken in this way at least once every three years. The Board 
considered a number of external facilitators before appointing 
Independent Board Evaluation (IBE), which has no other connection 
with the Company and which specialises purely in this line of work.
The evaluation process consisted of the following:
 − a comprehensive preliminary briefing of IBE by the Chairman  
and the Group Legal Director and Company Secretary;
 − attendance of a Board and Board Committee meeting by  
IBE as observers, prior to the commencement of interviews;
 − detailed and confidential interviews conducted with each Director 
on an individual basis based on a previously circulated list of topics 
prepared by IBE and also covering other topics raised  
by IBE and by individual Directors;
 − interviews with senior executives who interact with the Board and 
also with key external advisers, namely the Company’s auditor; 
broker; and remuneration advisers;
 − a report was compiled by IBE including recommendations based 
on best practice for boards as described in the Code and other 
appropriate corporate governance guidelines. A report was also 
prepared by IBE on each individual Director covering as 
appropriate, the Chairmanship of the Board and each Board 
Committee (Audit, Nomination and Remuneration);

50  − IBE met with the Chairman to feedback its main findings arising out 
of the overall evaluation, following which the report on the Board 
was discussed by the Board at its December 2014 meeting (which 
was attended by IBE) and progress on the action points at its 
meeting in February 2015.
Following the December Board meeting, and as part of the process, 
IBE also provided independent feedback to each Committee Chairman 
on the performance of the relevant Board Committee; to the Senior 
Independent Director (SID) on the performance of the Chairman; and 
the Chairman on the performance of each individual Director.
Feedback was then provided on an individual basis, by the SID to  
the Chairman (and vice versa); and through the Chairman discussing 
each individual Director’s own performance assessment with the 
relevant Director on a one-to-one basis.
As mentioned earlier, it was pleasing to note that IBE concluded that 
the Board is well-functioning and effective and is one which takes its 
responsibilities and duties very seriously. Nevertheless, there is always 
scope for improvement and the Board has already started focusing 
on the action points identified which include:
 − that there should be a continuing emphasis on succession planning 
across the Group and that this should include Board level 
appointments including the Committee Chairmen;
 − the holding of an additional Nomination Committee meeting each  
year (in addition to any ad hoc meetings), to further consider 
succession planning and related matters;
 − that there should be additional formality around the induction 
process for new Directors as whilst the process is comprehensive, 
it could be more carefully documented;
 − that there should be further additional opportunities for showcasing 
talent with the Board; and
 − to continue the ongoing improvement of the quality of Board 
reports and presentations.
These, and other more administrative action points will be kept  
under regular review by the Board and progress against them  
will be reported on in the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts.
Conclusion
I believe that your Board remains effective and continues to work  
well. I am confident that the Board has the right balance of skills, 
expertise and professionalism to continue to deliver strong governance 
whilst allowing the Executive Directors to implement and deliver the 
strategy set out on pages 16 to 17. I am pleased with the Board’s 
activity with regard to corporate governance, but we continually look 
for ways to learn and improve. As ever, I very much look forward to 
meeting with shareholders at the AGM on 23 April 2015 and, as

AGM), remain available to answer or respond to your questions, 
concerns and suggestions at any time.

2014 Evaluation Actions taken during the year Recommendations for the future
This year’s evaluation, details of which are 
set out on page 50, was facilitated externally 
via an extremely comprehensive process. It 
confirmed that the Board is well-functioning 
and effective with a good balance of skills 
and a positive but not unchallenging 
atmosphere around the board table. 
Inevitably a number of recommendations 
arose from the evaluation and the Board will 
work on these during the course of 2015. 
 
The main action items coming out of  
the 2013 evaluation related to maintaining  
an ongoing focus on succession planning 
throughout Taylor Wimpey, improved 
reporting to the Board on certain key matters, 
to continue to drive the diversity agenda 
forward and giving the Board more exposure 
to senior and upcoming management.
These action items have each been 
addressed during 2014 and details of  
the action taken appear on page 50.
The recommendations from the 2014  
Board evaluation included: the need for  
a continued emphasis on succession 
planning; showcasing talent for succession 
planning purposes; additional formality 
around the induction process for new 
Directors; and to continue the ongoing 
improvement of the overall quality of board 
reports and presentations. These are more 
fully set out on this page.
Each of these key areas will remain firmly  
on the Board’s agenda during 2015 and  
will be reported on in the 2015 Annual 
Report and Accounts.

Former Director 2
(a) Resigned 17 April 2014. 
The Board and its Committees 
As at the date of this Report, the Board consists of eight Directors, 
namely: the Chairman, three Executive Directors and four 
Independent Non Executive Directors. Their names, responsibilities 
and other details appear on pages 44 to 45. On 17 April 2014,  
in line with the Code, Tony Reading retired from the Board, having 
served nine years, including previously on the Board of George 
Wimpey prior to its merger with Taylor Woodrow to create Taylor 
Wimpey plc in 2007. Upon his retirement, Margaret Ford succeeded 
him as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee having been 
appointed to the Board in April 2013. Other changes to Committee 
membership saw Kate Barker join the Remuneration Committee on 
17 April 2014 (so as to ensure that the Committee had at all times 
three Independent Non Executive Directors in line with the Code)  
and Pete Redfern ceased to be a member of the Nomination 
Committee with effect from 1 January 2015. 
The role of the Independent Non Executive Directors is to offer advice 
and guidance to the Executive Directors, using their wide experience  
in business and from their diverse backgrounds, details of which  
are set out in their biographies on pages 44 to 45 and in the Board 
diversity analysis on page 45. They also provide a constructive 
challenge, scrutinising the performance of the Executive Directors  
and satisfying themselves as to the integrity of the financial 
information made available both to the Board and to the Company’s 
shareholders. The Non Executive Directors also play an important 
part in the appointment or removal of Executive Directors and in 
general succession planning for the Board and other executive 
positions below Board level.
The Board met on eight occasions during 2014 and there was full 
attendance at all meetings save for one, as noted opposite. The 
Board has considered the number of Board Meetings that take place 
each year and has concluded that eight meetings remain appropriate 
but will keep the number under review. 
Directors make every effort to attend all Board and applicable 
Committee meetings, as strongly evidenced by the attendance 
records over several years. Where, exceptionally, a Director is unable 
to attend a meeting, it is Board policy that the Chairman and/or the 
Group Legal Director and Company Secretary (the Secretary) will,  
as soon as possible, brief the Director fully on the business transacted 
at the meeting and on any decisions that have been taken. In addition, 
the views of the Director are sought ahead of the meeting and 
conveyed to those attending the meeting by the Chairman and/or  
the Secretary as appropriate. This process was followed in respect  
of the one meeting which Rob Rowley could not attend during the 
year due to illness for that particular meeting. Details of the attendance 
of each Director at Board and Committee meetings are set out in the 
tables on pages 52, 56, 60 and 66.
The Board discharges its responsibilities by providing strategic  
and entrepreneurial leadership of the Company, within a framework  
of strong governance, effective controls and a culture of openness 
and transparency, which enables opportunities and risks to be 
assessed and managed. It sets the Company’s strategic aims; 
ensures that the necessary financial and human resources are  
in place for the Company to meet its objectives; and reviews 
management performance.
The Board is responsible for the Company’s culture and for defining 
and setting the Company’s values and standards, which it does, 
amongst other things, through a number of policies and codes of 
conduct, and ensures that its obligations to its shareholders and 
other stakeholders are clearly understood and met. The Board is led 
in these respects by the Chairman, who ensures the Board operates 
correctly, setting its culture and, by extension, that of the Company  
in its operations and its dealings with all stakeholders.
As also set out in our 2014 Sustainability Report (formerly called  
the Corporate Responsibility Report), the Board is fully committed  
to providing a safe place in which our employees and subcontractors 
can work, and that our customers can visit, and to high standards  
of environmental management. The Board receives detailed reports 
on health, safety and environmental matters at each Board meeting  
in respect of the Company’s operations in the UK and Spain.  
The Company’s detailed carbon reporting, as required by BIS,  
is set out on page 30.
Operational management of the Company’s business is undertaken 
by the Chief Executive who receives advice from the Group 
Management Team (GMT). The GMT is the most senior executive 
committee and, in addition to the Chief Executive, consists of the 
Group Finance Director, the Group Legal Director and Company 
Secretary, the two Divisional Chairmen, the Group HR Director, the 
Land and Planning Director, and the Managing Director of each of the 
Central London Region and Major Developments Division. The GMT 
meets fortnightly, including once each month with the six Divisional 
Managing Directors as a wider Group Operational Team.
General Board Governance
Taylor Wimpey plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2014
52 The Board also receives regular reports and minutes from the 
Treasury Committee, which meets under the chairmanship of the 
Group Finance Director, and also comprises the Secretary, one of  
the two Divisional Chairmen (who rotate periodically) and the Group 
Treasurer. The key activities of the Treasury Committee are, broadly,  
to monitor and keep under review the Group’s financial risks, financial 
policies, financial facilities, covenant compliance and insurance 
programme, and, assisted in this respect by the membership of a 
Divisional Chairman, to review these areas in the light of current and 
proposed strategic and operational requirements.
The following documents are available for review on the Company’s 
website at www.taylorwimpey.co.uk/corporate/investor-relations/
corporate-governance: 
 − schedule of matters specifically reserved for the decision  
of the Board; 
 − terms of reference of the Board Committees: Audit, Nomination 
and Remuneration, which outline their objectives and responsibilities 
and which define a programme of activities to support the 
discharge of those responsibilities; and
 − policies covering operational, compliance, corporate responsibility 
and stakeholder matters, which are reviewed whenever necessary 
to take account of developments in corporate governance, 
changes in legislation and revised processes.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Secretary. 
The Board has an established procedure whereby Directors may  
take independent professional advice at the Company’s expense  
where they judge it necessary to do so in order to discharge their 
responsibilities as Directors.
The Board took advice during the year from Slaughter and May,  
on the preparation of documentation relating to the proposed  
Special Dividend for 2015.
Advice was also received from Deloitte during the year via the  
Audit Committee on the significant governance developments  
during the year. 
The Board receives at each meeting a report from JPMorgan 
Cazenove (Cazenove) on the sector and the relative performance  
of the Company’s share price.
All businesses and employees are expected to operate at all times  
to the highest standards of integrity and conduct in all matters 
concerning the Group. Accordingly, there is a Code of Business 
Conduct, which sets out the standard for individual dealings both 
internally and externally. Formal policies have been adopted, which  
set out the ethical framework within which all Taylor Wimpey 
companies are required to undertake their business – this includes,  
in line with the Bribery Act 2010, an Anti-Corruption Policy which 
requires an annual sign-off by designated senior management.  
These policies are available for review on the Company’s website 
www.taylorwimpey.co.uk/corporate/investor-relations/corporate-
governance and relevant reporting against these is provided to the  
Audit Committee by the Head of Internal Audit.
Board and Committee balance, diversity, independence  
and effectiveness
It is the Company’s policy, in line with the Code, that proposed 
appointments to the Board, and succession planning, are based  
on merit, and judged against objective criteria, whilst also having  
due regard to the benefits of diversity and inclusiveness, including 
gender, age, disability, ethnicity, experience and thinking. The Board 
also continues to recognise its responsibility to comply with the 
recommendations of the Davies Report and has stated that it will 
aspire at least to maintain the current level of representation of women 
on the Board (two out of eight, representing 25% of Directors).
Board and Committee roles and responsibilities
The work of each of the Board Committees (Audit, Nomination  
and Remuneration) is described later in this Report.
Relevant skills and expertise
It is a requirement of the Code that the Board and its Committees 
should have the appropriate balance of skills, experience, independence 
and knowledge of the Company, to enable duties and responsibilities 
to be discharged effectively. The Board considers that each Director 
brings relevant and complementary skills, experience and background 
to the Board, details of which are set out below, and additional 
information is also set out in the biographies on pages 44 and  
45, and also on page 149.
Kevin Beeston, Chairman, has a wealth of commercial, financial  
and high level management experience including being a former  
CEO of a FTSE 100 company. Kevin also has significant experience 
of chairing Boards of both public and private companies and of  
being a non executive director and sitting on audit, nomination  
and remuneration committees.
Pete Redfern, CEO, has operational responsibility for delivering  
the Company’s strategy in a profitable, safe and environmentally 
responsible manner. Pete has significant financial, operational and 
management experience, gained from his various roles in industry  
and from his time at KPMG. In 2014 he joined the Board of Travis 
Perkins plc as an independent non executive director and serves  
on that company’s audit and remuneration Committees, which  
will only add to his breadth of experience at plc Board level;
Ryan Mangold, Group Finance Director, has operational responsibility  
for managing the Company’s finances. Ryan has financial, treasury, 
risk and financial control expertise including that gained from his  
time with Mondi Group and Anglo American plc;
James Jordan, Group Legal Director and Company Secretary,  
is a solicitor and oversees compliance with legal and regulatory 
obligations and manages the Secretariat and Legal Departments. 
James has significant legal, commercial, transactional and regulatory/
governance related experience;
Kate Barker, Independent Non Executive Director, is an industry-
recognised economist and has led policy reviews for the Government  
in the areas of land use, planning and housing supply. Kate also 
brings a wider economic insight gained through her various roles, 
including as a Member of the Oversight Board of the Office for 
Budget Responsibility;

Directors’ Report: Governance p44-91 Financial Statements p92-143 Shareholder Information p144-153 Strategic Report p2-43 Margaret Ford, Independent Non Executive Director, has wide-
ranging experience in a number of sectors and also has extensive 
knowledge of the property sector, gained through various roles. 
Margaret has significant plc experience including the chairmanship  
of both boards and board committees. She also sits in the House  
of Lords; 
Mike Hussey, Independent Non Executive Director, has in-depth 
expertise in land development and marketing, particularly in London, 
gained from his previous roles as a director of Land Securities plc  
and as head of leasing and marketing of the Canary Wharf Group plc. 
Mike is currently CEO of Almacantar, a property development fund  
he founded in 2010;
Rob Rowley, Independent Non Executive Director and Senior 
Independent Director, has a wealth of financial, commercial and 
management expertise, principally from his time as Finance Director 
of Reuters plc and Deputy Chairman of Cable & Wireless plc. Rob 
has substantial experience as a non executive director including the 
chairing of audit committees and has recent and relevant financial 
experience as required by the Code.
Division of responsibilities
The Board has an established framework of delegated financial, 
commercial and operational authorities, which define the scope  
and powers of the Chief Executive and of operational management. 
In line with the Code, the roles and responsibilities of the Chairman  
and the Chief Executive have been clearly defined, set out in  
writing and signed by Kevin Beeston and Pete Redfern in their 
respective capacities.
Ensuring there is no conflict of interest
In order to assist Directors in complying with their duty to avoid 
conflicts (or possible conflicts) of interest, it is standard procedure  
that the Board must first give its clearance to such potential conflicts 
of interest (which would include directorships or other interests in 
outside companies and organisations) following which, an entry is 
then made in the statutory register which the Company maintains  
for this purpose. 
Whenever any Director considers that he or she is, or may be, 
interested in any contract or arrangement to which the Company  
is or may be a party, the Director gives due notice to the Board in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and the Company’s 
Articles of Association. In such cases, unless allowed by the Articles, 
any Director with such an interest is not permitted to participate in  
any discussions or decisions relating to the contract or arrangement. 
During 2014 no such matters arose.
The Board undertakes a regular review of each Director’s interests,  
if any, outside of the Company and is satisfied that, in line with the  
Code, all Directors are able to allocate sufficient time to the Company  
to enable them to discharge their responsibilities as Directors effectively. 
Where there have been any outside commitments, the Board is 
satisfied that they do not detract from the extent or quality of time 
which the Director is able to devote to the Company.
Annual re-election to the Board
The Code now requires every Director to seek election or re-election, 
as appropriate, at each year’s Annual General Meeting (AGM). 
Accordingly, at the 2015 AGM, every Director, irrespective of the  
date of his or her appointment and the length of his or her service  
on the Board, will be submitted for re-election.
Details of the resolutions to be proposed in this respect and 
supporting biographical details of the Directors appear in the  
Notice of Meeting on pages 144 to 151.
As part of the 2014 Board Evaluation process, the Board reviewed  
and re-affirmed that it considers each of the Non Executive Directors  
to be independent in character and judgement and that there are  
no relationships which could affect the Director’s judgement. 
The Chairman, at the time of his appointment on 1 July 2010,  
met the independence criteria as set out in the Code. 
Information and professional development
The Company has procedures whereby newly appointed Directors 
(including Non Executive Directors) receive a formal induction.  
This includes training and continuing familiarisation with the 
Company’s business, strategy, operations (including health and 
safety) and systems, the principles underlying the discharge of  
their duties as Directors and wider issues relating to the housing 
sector. The induction also includes meetings with key executives  
and function heads, advisers and site visits. As part of the 2014 
Board Evaluation the comprehensive induction process will be  
further formalised whilst also being subject to specific tailoring for 
individual Directors as appropriate. 
All Directors visit Group operations on a regular basis, engaging  
with employees at all levels in order to foster and maintain an 
understanding of the business. Board visits are arranged each year  
to operations and at least one Board meeting per annum takes place 
in a regional business over three days. An important outcome of the 
2014 Board evaluation was formally noting the scale of the beneficial 
impact that such visits can have on Group businesses.
The Group Legal Director and Company Secretary acts as  
Secretary to the Board and its Committees and he attends all 
meetings. It is Board policy that wherever possible a formal agenda 
and reports are issued electronically to Directors in respect of all 
Board and Committee meetings at least one week prior to the 
meeting, in order to allow sufficient time for detailed review and 
consideration beforehand. Formal minutes are prepared in respect  
of all Board and Committee meetings and are then circulated and 
submitted for approval at the next meeting. All Board papers are 
circulated electronically and Board meetings have been effectively 
‘paperless’ for several years which has worked well and aided the 
overall efficiency of the overall Board process.
The Secretary provides regular briefings to the Board on regulatory 
and governance matters which are included as part of his formal 
regular reporting to the Board, and are supplemented, as appropriate, 
by briefings from independent advisors. The Board also receives 
regular briefings and updates on environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) matters.
The ESG briefing allows the Board to assess the significant ESG  
risks to the Company’s short and long-term value and to identify  
any opportunities that may arise to enhance value. Details of ESG 
risks and value-enhancement pursuits appear in the Sustainability 
Report which is available on our website www.taylorwimpey.co.uk/
corporate/sustainability
General Board Governance continued
Taylor Wimpey plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2014
54 The Chairman, Chief Executive and Secretary meet sufficiently in 
advance of each Board meeting in order to ensure action points  
from previous meetings have been implemented and to prepare the 
agenda and matters to be covered at the next and at future Board 
and Committee meetings as appropriate. The agenda and minutes 
for the Audit and Remuneration Committee meetings are agreed  
by the Secretary with the relevant Committee Chairman. 
Management 
Progress in achieving the Group Strategy is reviewed at each  
Board meeting and is reported on pages 16 to 17. The Chief 
Executive has responsibility for preparing and reviewing strategic 
plans for the Group and the annual budgetary process. These  
are subject to formal approval by the Board.
Budgets are re-examined in comparison with business forecasts 
throughout the year to ensure they are sufficiently robust to reflect 
the possible impact of changing economic conditions and 
circumstances. The Chief Executive and the Board conduct regular 
reviews of actual results and future projections with comparison 
against budget and prior year, together with various treasury reports. 
Disputes that may give rise to significant litigation or contractual 
claims are monitored at each meeting of the Board, with specific 
updates on any material developments or new matters.
The Group has clearly defined policies, processes and procedures 
governing all areas of the business, which will continue to be reviewed 
and refined in order to meet the requirements of the business and 
changing market circumstances. Defined authority limits continue  
to be closely monitored in response to prevailing market conditions.  
Any investment, acquisition or significant purchase or disposal of  
land requires detailed appraisal and is subject to approval by the  
Board or the Chief Executive, depending on the value and nature  
of the investment or contract. 
There is a clearly identifiable organisational structure and a framework  
of delegated authority approved by the Board within which individual 
responsibilities of senior executives of Group companies are identified 
and can be monitored. The Operating Framework, within which 
delegated authorities, responsibilities and related processes are 
explained in detail, is available for review and guidance online by  
any employee through the Company’s intranet. These activities are 
reinforced through process compliance and other audits conducted  
by Internal Audit.
The annual employee performance appraisal process is  
objective-based, with individual objectives cascaded down  
from the appropriate business objectives. The process also  
identifies training needs to support achievement of objectives.
During 2014 a number of enhancements were made to internal 
controls, designed to reduce or better manage risk across the 
business. These included the embedding of the COINS and  
1B1S ERP business systems, which have improved the accuracy, 
timeliness and uniformity of data used to manage, and report on, 
the Group’s businesses, and further work towards updating the 
Operating Framework and Commercial and Finance Manuals, which 
guide the businesses in ensuring compliance with Group standards.
Relations with shareholders
The Board actively seeks and encourages engagement with  
major institutional shareholders and other stakeholders and  
supports the initiatives set out in both the Code and the  
Stewardship Code, which aim to foster a more pro-active  
governance role by major shareholders. The Board has put  
in place arrangements designed to facilitate contact about  
business, governance, remuneration and other issues. This  
provides the opportunity for meetings with the Chairman, the  
Senior Independent Director as well as the Chief Executive,  
Group Finance Director, Group Legal Director and Company 
Secretary and other executives, in order to establish a mutual 
understanding of objectives. The Company also operates  
a structured programme of investor relations, based on formal 
announcements and publications covering the full-year and  
half-year results. In addition, the Chairman meets with the  
Company’s institutional shareholders from time to time, both 
proactively and upon request in order to discuss the Company  
and its performance, governance and remuneration policies.  
As set out in the Remuneration Report, the Remuneration  
Committee undertakes a consultation exercise each year and  
as part of this exercise, the Committee Chairman also engages 
directly with shareholders. 
All Directors receive formal reports and briefings during the year  
about the Company’s investor relations programme and receive 
detailed feedback through surveys, direct contact and other means, 
through which they are able to develop an understanding of the  
views of major shareholders about the Company.
The Board encourages all shareholders to participate in the Annual 
General Meeting, which is attended by all Directors. Shareholders’ 
attention is drawn to the Notice of Meeting on pages 144 to 151 
which sets out details of the rights of shareholders in connection  
with the notice of, and participation in, general meetings of the 
Company. This year, there are 20 resolutions being submitted  
for shareholder consideration, including, Resolution 19 which is  
a request for approval of a substantial property transaction as  
defined in the Companies Act 2006, between the Company  
and Pete Redfern.
At the 2014 AGM, shareholders representing 57% of the Company’s 
issued share capital voted in the poll. There was a vote in favour  
of 12 of the 19 resolutions of in excess of 99% and an average  
vote in favour across all 19 resolutions of over 98%. 
Information about the Company, including full-year and half-year 
results and other major announcements, and additional information 
about shareholder facilities, is published on the Company’s website 
www.taylorwimpey.co.uk
This 2014 Annual Report and Accounts 
Your Directors have responsibility for preparing this 2014 Annual 
Report and Accounts and for making certain confirmations 
concerning it. In accordance with the Code provision C.1.1  
the Board considers that, taken as a whole, it is fair, balanced  
and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business  
model and strategy.
The Board reached this conclusion after receiving advice from  
the Audit Committee. The processes of review and assessment 
followed by that Committee in that respect, are set out on page 64.

Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to be able to take this opportunity as Chairman  
of the Nomination Committee to summarise the important ongoing 
objectives and responsibilities of the Committee; the work that has 
been carried out during 2014; and its plans for the coming year. 
The Committee’ s key objective is to support the Board in fulfilling its 
responsibilities to ensure that there is a formal, rigorous and transparent 
process for the appointment of new Directors both to the Board and to 
senior management positions, and to ensure that effective succession 
planning processes are in place across the Group. 
In meeting its objectives, both the Committee and the Board take  
into account diversity including gender and fully support the various 
Government initiatives in this key area. For example, I and three 
women colleagues from the business, were very pleased to attend 
and participate in the Women on Boards Conference held by the 
Department for Business Innovation and Skills in February 2015,  
as this was aimed at increasing the number of women considered  
for appointment to FTSE 350 boards in 2015. 
Each objective; the strategy for delivering them; progress made 
towards them during 2014 and targets and plans for 2015; is 
described in more detail in this report.
The Committee’s achievements during 2014 and its plans for 2015, 
are set out opposite. Key priorities are to:
 − drive our diversity and inclusivity agenda at all levels of the  
Group; and
 − to further progress our succession planning, across the Group, 
linking it to career development and professional development.
The Committee will continue to focus on ensuring that the present 
and future composition of the Board and the Group’s executive 
management is appropriate for the delivery of the Group’s strategy 
and that all relevant UK Corporate Governance Code (Code) 
requirements continue to be met.

56 Nomination Committee
The Committee is chaired by the Chairman of the Board and is 
composed of a majority of Independent Non Executive Directors as 
required by the Code. Its members are set out in the table opposite. 
Pete Redfern (Chief Executive) stood down from the Committee with 
effect from 1 January 2015, such that the Committee is now comprised 
of the Chairman and four Independent Non Executive Directors. 
The Committee has procedures in place with regard to maintaining  
a formal, rigorous and transparent process for Board appointments, 
ensuring that appointments to the Board are made on merit and 
assessed against objective criteria. The Committee guides the  
Board in regularly assessing whether there is a correct balance  
of expertise, having regard to the 2011 report from Lord Davies  
of Abersoch on Women on Boards (the Davies Report) and wider 
diversity considerations, and in arranging the orderly succession for 
appointments to the Board and in respect of senior management 
across the Group. A description of how appointments are typically 
made to the Board is set out below.
The Committee oversees on behalf of the Board and advises the 
Board on, the identification, assessment and selection of candidates 
for appointment to the Board. The Committee has a formal, rigorous 
and transparent process against objective criteria. Typically, the 
process of appointment, prior to the decision of the Board, will 
include the engagement of recruitment consultants, interviews  
by the candidate with all members of the Board and the taking  
up of detailed references.
The Nomination Committee also guides the Board in assessing from 
time to time whether the Board has the correct balance of expertise 
and in arranging orderly succession planning for appointments to  
the Board and in respect of senior management across the Group.
As part of this process, management below Board level is regularly 
provided with access to the Board, including the opportunity to  
attend Board Meetings and further Board functions in order to give 
presentations on specialist topics, project work and the performance  
of specific Business Units and Divisions. 
As the only change to the Board in 2014 was Tony Reading’s planned 
retirement after nine years’ service, the Committee only formally met 
on one occasion with the principal agenda items consisting of: longer 
term succession planning, approving the key persons contingency 
plan and considering progress on diversity across the business. In 
addition wider succession planning and diversity remained on the Board 
agenda regularly throughout the year. Going forward, and with effect 
from 2015, the Committee will formally meet at least twice a year.
In addition, and in line with the Code, the Chairman and the Senior 
Independent Director, independent of each other, hold meetings at  
least annually with the Non Executive Directors without the Executive 
Directors present. The Chairman also liaised closely with each 
Director as part of the 2014 Board evaluation process.
Appointments and succession planning
It is the Company’s policy, in line with the Code, that proposed 
appointments to the Board, and succession planning, are based  
on merit, and judged against objective criteria, whilst also having due 
regard to the benefits of diversity and inclusiveness, including gender, 
age, ethnicity, experience and thinking. The Board continues to both 
recognise and support the target set by the Davies Report which 
originally set an overall target of 25% for FTSE 100 boards in 2015. 
Currently, two out of the eight Directors are women, representing 
25% of the Board. Going forward, the Board will aspire to at least 
maintain this level of representation whilst also having due regard  
to other aspects of diversity as outlined above. 
During the year, we have increased our emphasis on succession 
planning and people at all levels of the organisation. As part of this, 
both the Board and the Nomination Committee has visibility of a  
wide range of employees with leadership potential together with  
their development plan. A Talent Management Group comprising  
the Chief Executive, the Group HR Director and the two Divisional 
Chairmen of our UK operating business has been established to 
regularly review succession planning and development and training 
requirements. Further actions to support succession planning have 
been introduced, including the development of career paths linked  
to experience, exposure and education; an assessment and 
development centre; and the promotion of the Company’s mentoring 
scheme. We are also focusing upon recruiting individuals from a wider 
range of backgrounds, experience and industries at all levels. Four 
senior appointments made during the year: the Group HR Director; 
Customer Director; Group Financial Controller; and Head of Planning, 
each have diverse backgrounds that provide both an appropriate 
balance of skills, experience and knowledge to enable their duties  
to be discharged effectively which has enhanced and strengthened 
the strength in depth of the overall management team. 
Succession planning remains a key area of focus across all levels of 
the organisation. The Group Management Team (GMT) regularly 
reviews the Company’s succession plans and talent pipelines, with 
further action to support these areas continuing. 
The Committee considered in detail short and long term succession 
planning for Directors and key executives, together with appropriate 
development plans. There was one change in the composition of  
the Board during 2014 – namely, the retirement of Tony Reading  
on 17 April 2014 after nine years of dedicated service. In addition, 
the planned appointment of Margaret Ford as Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee, in succession to Tony Reading took 
place and also the appointment of Kate Barker as a member  
of that Committee so as to ensure that the Committee had,  
at all times, three Independent Non Executive Directors. 
The composition and performance of the Board was considered 
during the year following these changes and it was concluded that no 
further change was necessary at this stage as it continued to function 
effectively with four Independent Non Executive Directors, following 
Tony Reading’s departure.
The Committee believes that the balance of the Board, consisting 
of a Chairman, three Executive Directors and four Independent  
Non Executive Directors, will continue to provide the right blend of 
experience, expertise and challenge in order to take the Company 
forward in line with its strategy whilst ensuring and maintaining good 
governance and best practice. This will however be kept under 
regular review in line with the requirements of the Code.
Diversity policy
The Board remains committed to the belief that embracing diversity 
and inclusion will enable it to succeed through a workforce that is 
creative and innovative. The Board has adopted a policy on diversity 
which is set out on page 59 and is also available on the Company’s 
website at www.taylorwimpey.co.uk/corporate/investor-relations/
corporate-governance
The Company continues to actively embrace the business and 
local communities in which it operates and will strive to reflect their 
richness and character so as to include such aspects as gender, 
race and religion – and also diversity of thought, background 
and experience.

Directors’ Report: Governance p44-91 Financial Statements p92-143 Shareholder Information p144-153 Strategic Report p2-43 Nomination Committee Report continued
The Company is also committed to ensuring that our people are  
free from any direct or indirect discrimination, harassment or bullying. 
Our grievance and harassment policies ensure that any reported 
incidents are investigated. In addition, our whistleblowing policy 
encourages employees to speak up against any inappropriate 
practices or behaviour.
Diversity and inclusion remained a clear focus throughout 2014  
which will continue into 2015 and future years. A working party  
which includes senior management has been established to create  
a diversity and inclusion strategy. The strategy will focus on the 
challenges faced in developing an inclusive and diverse workforce. 
This includes working with specialist external bodies to maximise  
all opportunities, including:
 − developing our policy and raising the expectations from our 
employees;
 − enhancing our awareness training programme; and 
 − improving how we attract and recruit candidates to enable  
us to succeed through a workforce that is inclusive, creative  
and innovative.
During 2014 a number of key activities have taken place:
 − all members of the GMT have participated in an interactive 
awareness workshop, designed to give them an insight into the 
impact that disabilities have on the ability to undertake normal day 
to day activities;
 − diversity discussion group meetings have taken place with  
the Chief Executive, Group HR Director and different sections  
of the workforce;
 − the new careers website has been completed, including new video 
testimonials promoting our approach to diversity;
 − articles have been placed in The Diversity Group Directory  
and Living with Disability publications, raising awareness  
of opportunities within the Company;
 − we continue to work with our recruitment partners to ensure they 
understand and embrace our diversity and inclusion agenda;
 − we recruited 99 (2013: 43) apprentices, including 29 site 
management apprentices; 50 management trainees (2013: 23) and 
19 graduates (2013: 11). We remain on target with the recruitment 
of our site management apprentices;
 − an increase in the number of employees with disabilities recruited. 
Working with key partners we hope to increase more permanent 
and secondment opportunities for people with disabilities;
 − undertaken reward roadshows across the business to  
ensure that all employees are aware and understand all of the 
Company’s remuneration benefits including holiday purchase  
and childcare vouchers;
 − the Company hosted a “Skills Summit” attended by two 
Government ministers, where a commitment to increasing the 
apprentice and other career opportunities for young people within 
the industry was established;
 − the strategy for further developing diversity and inclusion includes 
plans to:
 − partner with a number of specific diversity partners in 2015 with 
an objective to drive the attraction and development of a more 
diverse and representative workforce;
 − continue the diversity discussion group meetings with the  
Chief Executive, Group HR Director and different sections  
of the workforce; to further embed diversity and inclusiveness  
at all levels of the Company; and
 − introduce a new HR Information System in Q4 of 2015, which 
we believe will better capture data relating to all aspects of 
diversity and inclusion.
The Board believes that by embracing diversity and inclusiveness, 
the Company will better understand how people’s differences and 
similarities can be utilised for the benefit of not only the Company but 
most importantly also for individuals and society as a whole.  
It is the Board’s view that having a diverse workforce will improve  
the Company’s ability to deliver its strategy; the homes that it builds; 
and its services. 
Diversity has continued to be a key item on the overall UK governance 
agenda during 2014. Within Taylor Wimpey, diversity has remained  
a key priority for the Board’s agenda and this will continue to be the 
case during 2015. Although the Board will continue to appoint on 
merit, we recognise that boards will generally perform better when 
they include top quality people from a range of backgrounds and 
perspectives. Diversity will continue to be a key consideration when 
contemplating the composition and refreshing of the Board and 
indeed our senior and wider management.
The Company has put in place systems to measure and monitor 
diversity around the Group more effectively. With regard to gender,  
as at 31 December 2014:
 − the Board consisted of eight Directors, two of whom are  
women (25%);
 − the GMT, which is effectively the executive Board of Taylor Wimpey 
UK Limited, our main operating company, consisted of eight 
executives, two of whom are women (25%);
 − there is one woman out of 24 Regional Managing Directors (4%); 
 − women across the Group account for 32% (2013: 31%)  
of the workforce; 
 − 29% (2013: 27%) of new starters with the Company during 2014 
were women.
While we are making progress, we of course recognise that we still 
have more work to do in order to fulfil our overall diversity ambitions 
and as stated on page 56, it is a priority for 2015 to achieve further 
progress in this area.
Taylor Wimpey plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2014
58 Diversity policy
The Company’s plans and progress in implementing its diversity policy, benchmarked against appropriate targets, are set out below.  
Progress is measured and monitored by the Nomination Committee and the Board.
Diversity policy Strategy Progress
Taylor Wimpey operates in 
diverse communities. We believe 
that embracing this diversity will 
enable us to succeed through  
a workforce that is inclusive, 
creative and innovative. Diversity 
covers many aspects. We have 
defined diversity to mean that  
we actively embrace the 
business and local communities 
in which we operate and will 
strive to reflect their richness  
and character to include  
such aspects as gender, race, 
disability and religion but also 
diversity of thought, background 
and experience.
We will examine our culture and 
practices to determine what further 
actions can be taken to improve 
diversity and inclusion within  
Taylor Wimpey.
In 2014 a working party has been established of senior executives to drive further  
improvement in our diversity and inclusion strategy. The working party will embed suitable 
processes throughout the business; assess a number of initiatives designed to improve 
awareness in recruiting, training and promotion processes; oversee the implementation  
of improvements; and monitor the results and feedback from participants.
In 2014, all members of the GMT participated in an interactive awareness workshop,  
to gain insight into the impact of disabilities on the ability to undertake day to day activities.  
This will be reflected in appropriate business processes and arrangements designed to 
facilitate the employment of disabled people.
Diversity discussions have continued with different sections of the workforce, with the active 
participation of the CEO and the Group HR Director. These discussions help us to frame 
policies and wider diversity strategy in the light of employees’ own experience and practical 
conditions at all levels of the business.
The new careers website went live during 2014 and includes video testimonials promoting  
the diverse nature of our workforce.
Managing diversity is about 
valuing everyone as an  
individual – valuing people  
as our employees, customers 
and clients. People have different 
needs, values and beliefs. Our 
people management practice 
demands that employment 
propositions are both consistently 
fair but also flexible and inclusive 
in ways that assist our people 
while supporting our business 
needs and objectives.
We will identify people  
management practices that  
assist a diverse workforce  
to achieve their full potential. 
We will use our Community 
Engagement Programme  
to heighten awareness of personal 
interaction and valuing individuals.
We will increase the opportunities  
for young people to join the 
Company and will promote 
continuous personal development.
Articles to raise awareness of opportunities within the Company are now being placed  
in appropriate publications, such as The Diversity Group Directory and the Living With  
Disability publication.
We plan to partner with a number of specific diversity partners during 2015 with the intention 
of driving the attraction and development of a more diverse workforce. 
Our flexible holiday purchase scheme was subscribed to by 691 employees (2013: 525) and  
the majority of these were female.
The number of employees with disabilities who were recruited during 2014 increased 
compared to the previous year.
Our intention is to further increase the number of suitable opportunities for both permanent  
and secondment employment during 2015 for people with disabilities. 
In 2014 we recruited 99 apprentices (2013: 43), 50 management trainees (2013: 23)  
and 19 graduates (2013: 11).
We remain on target with the recruitment program for site management apprentices.
We believe that everyone  
should have the right to equal 
access to employment and, 
when in our employ, to equal  
pay and access to training  
and career development.
We will ensure that all managers 
involved in recruitment and  
selection receive training that 
incorporates the areas of diversity 
and promoting equality.
We will extend our recruitment 
sources in order to attract a more 
diverse range of applicants.
During 2014, the Company hosted a ‘skills summit’ attended by two Government ministers, 
where a commitment to increasing apprentice and other career opportunities for young  
people within the industry was established.
We continue to work with our recruitment partners to ensure they embrace our Diversity  
and Inclusion agenda.
The planned introduction during 2015 of an improved HR information system should enable 
improved data capture to more closely monitor the effects of the improvement strategy on  
all aspects of diversity and inclusion and allow our future plans to be amended accordingly. 
We are committed to ensuring 
that our people are free from any 
direct or indirect discrimination, 
harassment or bullying. We will 
not tolerate any behaviour that 
detracts from this.
We will encourage our people to 
speak out and report any direct or 
indirect discrimination, harassment  
or bullying. We will act promptly  
in addressing any inappropriate 
behaviour or practice.
The Company’s whistleblowing campaign specifically focused on diversity, encouraging 
employees to speak up against any inappropriate practices or behaviour, remains in place.
Our grievance policy ensures that any reports of harassment or bullying are investigated  
and acted upon.
We acknowledge that we must 
continue to promote diversity in 
order to create an organisation 
that attracts, supports and 
promotes the broadest range  
of talent. Establishing an 
organisational culture with  
diversity as a core value will  
enable individuals to reach their  
full potential and to provide the 
best service to our customers.
Diversity will be promoted from  
the highest level and we will ensure 
that our people understand the 
benefits of having a diverse and 
inclusive workforce.
Diversity is a core message within our strategy; a main item at our Executive and  
Regional Management meetings; and is a standing agenda item at GMT meetings.
Our employee survey in 2014 sought further feedback on Diversity and Inclusiveness  
and the outcome demonstrated that there is an extremely high level of recognition  
of this issue amongst employees.

Audit Committee
The members of the Audit Committee during 2014 and their 
attendance at meetings of the Committee during that year,  
are as set out on page 60.
Details of the Committee’s activities during 2014 and priorities for 
2015 are contained in the Letter from the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee on the preceding page.
The Audit Committee is chaired by Rob Rowley. All members of the 
Committee are Independent Non Executive Directors as required by  
the Code. During the year, Tony Reading stood down from the Board 
leaving three Independent Non Executive Directors on the Committee 
which is in line with the requirements of the Code. The Board has 
determined that Rob Rowley, who currently chairs the Audit 
Committee at moneysupermarket.com Group PLC, has recent and 
relevant financial experience as required by the Code. The Chairman 
of the Company and other Non Executive Directors, the Executive 
Directors, Head of Internal Audit and other senior executives attend 
Committee meetings by invitation. Deloitte LLP (Deloitte), the external 
auditor, is also invited to attend Committee meetings. The Committee 
also regularly meets privately with representatives from Deloitte during 
at least two Committee meetings per annum, which normally take 
place around the time of the full and half-year financial statements, in 
order to discuss any matters which the auditors may wish to raise in 
confidence, without any Executive Directors (other than the Secretary) 
being present. 
The Audit Committee met on three occasions during the year.  
The meetings around the full and half-year results are typically also 
attended by the Non Executive Directors who are not members  
of the Committee.
At these meetings, the Committee carried out its remit which  
primarily includes:
 − at its February 2014 meeting, reviewing the final draft 2013 Annual 
Report and Accounts together with details of risk management 
process and any significant accounting and audit issues thereon; 
considering issues of materiality and the external auditor’s report  
on the progress of the audit; conducting a formal compliance 
check; and reviewing the draft Preliminary Announcement of the 
Group’s 2013 results;
 − at its July 2014 meeting, reviewing the final draft half-year 
statement for 2014 together with details of the risk management 
process and any significant accounting issues thereon; considering 
issues of materiality and the external auditor’s report on its review  
of that statement; and
 − at its December 2014 meeting, a review of its performance  
against its objectives during 2014; consideration of the 
Committee’s priorities for 2015; approval of updates to the  
Audit Committee framework; Deloitte’s audit plan, and report  
on the progress of the audit to date; monitoring the processes 
whereby the Committee ensures that the 2014 Annual Report  
and Accounts meets the requirements of Code provision C.1,  
and the performance of Deloitte including their recommendation  
for re-appointment at the 2015 AGM. The Committee was also 
briefed on key accounting judgements with regard to the 
Company’s 2014 accounts.
In addition, at each meeting, the Committee also reviewed its other 
areas of responsibility, including:
 − the internal audit process;
 − the risk management and internal control framework;
 − the Company’s whistleblowing procedures and the adequacy  
of any investigations;
www.taylorwimpey.co.uk
61
Directors’ Report: Governance p44-91 Financial Statements p92-143 Shareholder Information p144-153 Strategic Report p2-43  − progress on embedding systems and processes necessary  
to maximise the benefits of the new 1B1S ERP system;
 − checking for any incidences of fraud, actual, alleged or 
precautionary, and ensuring proper controls and a response  
plan are in place; and
 − financial reporting practices.
In carrying out these activities, the Committee places reliance on  
regular reports from executive management, Internal Audit and from 
the Company’s external auditors. In monitoring the financial reporting 
practices, the Audit Committee reviewed accounting policies, areas  
of judgement, the going concern assumptions and compliance with 
accounting standards and the requirements of the Code. During  
the year, the Committee reviewed, prior to publication, other 
statements affecting the Group concerning price sensitive  
information as necessary.
As reported last year, the Audit Committee concluded, in early 2014, 
its constructive dialogue with the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) 
following its review of the Company’s 2011 Annual Report and 
Accounts. The outcome was enhanced reporting in certain areas 
which were addressed in the Company’s previous years’ Annual 
Reports and Accounts. Consequently, the FRC has concluded  
its review. 
External auditor
Re-appointment
As noted earlier, Deloitte LLP is the Company’s external auditor.  
Their performance is kept under regular review by the Board and  
the Audit Committee and the Committee undertook a formal 
assessment of the external audit process during the external audit  
of the Company’s 2014 results and Deloitte’s suitability going forward.
This review took the form of a checklist and questionnaire issued  
to Directors; executives involved in the detailed stages of the audit 
process; and a representative sample of employees in regional 
business units which were subject to audit. The responses were 
augmented by external feedback on the relative performance  
of auditors generally, and from regulatory sources. A summary  
of the findings was prepared by Internal Audit and considered  
by the Audit Committee at its February 2015 meeting.
The outcome of the review was that the Committee recommended  
to the Board, which in turn is recommending to shareholders in 
Resolution 12 on page 144, that Deloitte be re-appointed as the 
Company’s auditors at the 2015 AGM.
Tender
A formal competitive audit tender process was carried out by the 
Company with regard to the 2008 audit, following which Deloitte was 
selected to continue as external auditor to the Company. The current 
lead engagement partner is Edward Hanson, who assumed 
responsibility for the 2014 audit under Deloitte’s partner rotation 
scheme, having been involved in the 2013 external audit, in order to 
familiarise himself with its scope and detail as part of the handover 
process. The Code requires FTSE 350 companies to put the external 
audit contract out to tender at least once in every ten years. The 
Company also notes the guidance issued by the FRC by way of 
transitional arrangements. Therefore, and having due regard to the 
foregoing, having conducted a tender process in 2007/2008, the 
Company presently intends to defer tendering again,until completion 
of Edward Hanson’s rotation in 2019, but will of course keep the 
matter under regular review, taking into account the annual 
performance review to be conducted by the Committee as well as 
other relevant factors. There are no contractual restrictions on the 
Company’s selection of its external auditor.
Appointment of the auditor for non-audit services
The Audit Committee has a formal policy on whether the Company’s 
external auditor should be employed to provide services other than 
audit services. In line with the Code, the Committee has regard to the 
relevant ethical guidance regarding the provision of non-audit services 
by Deloitte. This policy requires that there should be a competitive 
tender process – except in narrowly defined circumstances where it is 
considered that, based on confidentiality, past knowledge and other 
commercial reasons, there is an advantage in using a single tender 
procurement procedure.
The Committee has determined that the following assignments 
should not be undertaken by the auditors:
 − bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records  
or financial statements; 
 − internal audit outsourcing services; 
 − the provision of advice on large Information Technology  
systems; and 
 − services connected with valuation, litigation support, legal, 
recruitment or remuneration. 
The Board is satisfied that this policy is conducive to the maintenance  
of good governance, best practice and auditor independence  
and objectivity. 
Non-audit services in 2014 predominantly related to work undertaken 
as a result of Deloitte’s role as auditors, in particular tax work which 
included some advisory services to the Company and its subsidiaries. 
Deloitte also performed certain real estate advisory work, for which 
they were selected as they were considered to be the best supplier 
for that service. All independence considerations were fully satisfied 
by both the Company and Deloitte for this work.
The Audit Committee fully recognises and supports the importance of 
the independence of auditors. Its review of the auditor’s performance 
during 2014 included non-audit services. The Committee is satisfied 
that the carrying out of the above work did not, and will not going 
forward, impair the independence of the external auditor. It also 
recognises that, from time to time, there is a clear commercial 
advantage based on cost and timetable requirements in using  
the Company’s auditors. As a result, the value of non-audit services 
work was £0.2m in 2014 (2013: £0.2m) as set out in Note 6 to the 
Accounts on page 110.

Annual Report and Accounts 2014
62 Internal Audit
The Internal Audit function reviews the effectiveness and efficiency  
of the systems of internal control in place to safeguard the assets,  
to quantify, price, transfer, avoid or mitigate risks and to monitor  
the activities of the Group in accomplishing established objectives. 
Following each review an Internal Audit report is provided to both  
the management responsible for the area reviewed and the Group 
Management Team (GMT). These reports outline Internal Audit’s 
opinion of the management control framework in place together with 
actions indicating improvements proposed or made as appropriate. 
The Chief Executive, the GMT and senior management consider 
the reports on a regular basis and are responsible for ensuring 
that improvements are made as agreed. A database of audit 
recommendations and improvement initiatives is maintained.  
Follow-up and escalation processes ensure that such improvements 
are implemented and fully embedded in a timely manner.
We belong to and participate in industry-wide forums and other 
initiatives aimed at combating fraud within the construction industry.
Summaries of all key Internal Audit reviews and activity and  
resulting reports are provided to the Audit Committee for review  
and discussion.
The Internal Audit function also formally reviews proposed related 
party transactions, such as purchases by employees from Group 
companies, to ensure proper procedures are followed and that such 
procedures are undertaken strictly in accordance with the formal 
policy in place and, where applicable, company law. 
The most recent independent formal evaluation of the Internal Audit 
function was carried out on behalf of the Audit Committee during 
2011 by PwC and its finding was that Internal Audit is operating 
effectively. The next independent formal evaluation is planned  
to take place during 2015.
A number of initiatives were progressed during 2014 to ensure the  
Internal Audit function continues to meet both current best practice  
and the evolving needs of the Group. The Internal Audit Charter, 
which codifies the aims, modus operandi and outputs of Internal 
Audit, was reviewed by the Committee for ongoing appropriateness. 
During 2014, Internal Audit completed the series of controls reviews 
at each of the 24 UK Regional businesses. That review focused  
on assessing the post-implementation success of the Group-wide 
1B1S ERP system. In 2015, Internal Audit will focus on following  
up the recommendations arising from those reviews, as well as 
considering corporate level activities.
The Head of Internal Audit has direct access at all times, to the 
Chairman of the Audit Committee, the Chairman of the Board  
and also to the Chief Executive and the other Executive Directors.
Risk management and internal control
The Group has established an ongoing process of risk management 
and internal control, applying principle C.2 of the Code. The Board  
is responsible for the effectiveness of the system of internal control, 
which has been designed to meet the requirements of the Group  
and the risks it encounters, including taking account of environmental, 
social and governance considerations. The systems cannot eliminate 
the risk of failure but rather seek to manage both the likelihood of their 
occurrence and the extent of their impact, and can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The principal risks facing the Company, as assessed by the Board, 
are set out on pages 28 to 29, together with information on action 
taken and/or planned to mitigate each one.
The Board makes its assessment of risk half-yearly, after overseeing  
a bottom-up and top-down review of risk in all areas of the business. 
Action to mitigate the effect of each one is led by the Chief Executive 
either directly or indirectly. 
The Board’s assessments use a standard methodology which takes 
into account environmental, social and governance considerations.
In compliance with the Code, the Board also regularly reviews the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control in providing  
a responsible assessment and mitigation of risks. The Board’s 
monitoring covers all controls, including financial, operational, 
compliance and assurance controls which include risk management.
The Group’s system of internal control is primarily exercised  
through an established Operating Framework supported by function 
manuals covering the main disciplines. Adherence to these is required  
and monitored by management and checked independently by 
Internal Audit.
At its half-year and year-end meetings, the Board reviews risk in 
relation to the Company’s strategic objectives and its current plans  
to deliver them. It also reviews progress and performance in action 
taken to mitigate the impact of those risks.
The Board is supported in this by more regular and detailed reviews, 
by the Audit Committee, including the review of progress reports from 
Internal Audit, and by operational reviews led by the GMT.
These reviews during 2014 resulted in a number of enhancements  
to internal controls, designed to reduce or better manage risk across 
the business. These included the embedding of the COINS and  
1B1S ERP business systems, which have improved the accuracy, 
timeliness and uniformity of data used to manage, and report on,  
the Group’s businesses, and further work towards updating the 
Operating Framework and Commercial and Finance Manuals, which 
guide the businesses in ensuring compliance with Group standards.
The Committee reviewed the new Guidance on Risk Management, 
Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting issued 
by the FRC in September 2014. This aims to bring together elements 
of best practice for risk management; to prompt Boards to consider 
how to discharge their responsibilities in relation to principal risks 
faced by the Company; embed risk management and internal  
control in the Company’s business processes; and highlights  
related reporting responsibilities.
The Committee welcomes the new regulations, which it believes  
will enhance sound stewardship by the Board in these areas. The 
guidance applies for the Company’s reporting period commencing  
on 1 January 2015.
At its meeting in February 2015, the Board, after conducting its  
own review and after reviewing more detailed assessments from  
the Audit Committee, remained satisfied that the system of internal 
control continued to be effective in identifying; assessing; and  
ranking the various risks facing the Company; and in monitoring  
and reporting progress in mitigating their potential impact on the 
Company. The Board also approved the statement of the principal 
risks set out on pages 28 to 29 of this Annual Report.

Directors’ Report: Governance p44-91 Financial Statements p92-143 Shareholder Information p144-153 Strategic Report p2-43 Whistleblowing 
The Group’s whistleblowing policy is supported by a clear process  
that includes an externally facilitated hotline through which any  
person, including employees of the Company, may, in confidence,  
raise concerns about possible improprieties in financial reporting, 
other operational matters or inappropriate personal behaviours in  
the work place. All whistleblowing cases are formally investigated  
by the Head of Internal Audit, Group Health and Safety Director 
(where appropriate), Group Human Resources Director and/or  
the Group Legal Director and Company Secretary depending  
on the nature and/or seriousness of the issue. The Chief Executive 
is apprised of all allegations and conclusions of the review.
Whistleblowing incidents and their outcome are reported to the  
Audit Committee. Whistleblowing is a standing item on each Audit 
Committee agenda, which allows the Committee to regularly review 
the adequacy of the policy in line with its requirement to do so under 
the Code. The process is regularly reviewed and the Committee is 
satisfied that it remains effective.
Change of Basis of Accounting
A technical matter to be brought to shareholders’ attention  
is a proposed change in the Company’s basis of accounting.  
The Company’s current basis of accounting is UKGAAP which the  
FRC has announced is to change for reporting periods commencing 
on or after 1 January 2015. There were three alternatives open to the 
Company, and after a detailed review of those alternatives, which 
included consultation with external parties, including the Company’s 
external auditor, it is proposed to use FRS 101 as the Company’s 
basis of accounting for reporting for financial year commencing  
1 January 2015 and thereafter. The reason for choosing FRS 101  
is that it is based on International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS), as used generally throughout the European Union, and 
currently used for the Group financial statements. It is therefore 
proposed that the Company’s basis of accounting be changed  
from UKGAAP to FRS 101 with effect from 1 January 2015.
The Audit Committee supports this change, which is largely a 
technical matter designed to ensure that the Company’s accounts 
continue to be prepared in an appropriate way, which meets the 
standards generally applied by the accounting and auditing bodies of 
the UK, and remains in line with current law, regulation and guidance.
The Group Accounts are not impacted by this change. The Group 
Statutory Accounts are, and will continue to be prepared in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
Formal notice of this change, and details of how shareholders may,  
if they wish, register their views on it, are set out in Statutory, 
Regulatory and Other Information on page 87.
Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Code provision C.1
The Board has responsibility under Code provision C.1 for preparing 
the Company’s Annual Report and Accounts; for ensuring that it 
presents a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the 
Company’s position and prospects; and that it provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.
Process
The review of the Company’s Annual Report and Accounts took  
the form of a detailed assessment of the collaborative process  
of drafting them, which involves the Company’s Investor Relations; 
Finance; Company Secretariat; and Internal Audit Departments, with 
guidance and input from external advisers. It ensured that there is a 
clear and unified link between this Annual Report and Accounts and  
the Company’s other external reporting, and between the three main 
sections of the Annual Report and Accounts – the Strategic Report; 
the Governance Reports; and the Accounts.
In particular, the Committee:
 − reviewed all material matters, as reported elsewhere in this 
Annual Report;
 − ensured that it correctly reflected the Company’s performance  
in the reporting year, as described on pages 10 to 39;
 − ensured that it correctly reflected the Company’s business model, 
as described on pages 18 to 23 ensured that it correctly described 
the Company’s strategy, as described on pages 16 to 17;
 − ensured that it presented a consistent message throughout; and
 − considered whether it presented the information in a clear and 
concise manner, illustrated by appropriate KPIs, to facilitate 
shareholders’ access to relevant information.
Significant items
As part of the above process, the Committee considered the  
following significant items in connection with the preparation  
of the 2014 Annual Report and Accounts:
 − that the carrying value of inventory is reflective of the lower of  
cost and net realisable value and all relevant disclosures are 
included in the accounts. The Company carries out a net realisable 
value assessment for inventory every six months, the process and  
results of which are discussed by the Audit Committee.
 − that the assumptions used in calculating the net pension liabilities 
are reasonable and supported by appropriate data and external 
advice. The Company takes external advice, including market-wide 
comparisons, in valuing pension assets and liabilities. These are 
discussed and agreed by the Committee.
 − the Committee also satisfied itself that the underlying business 
processes that dictate the points of recognition for revenue, and the 
way in which inventory is costed and allocated, remain appropriate.
As part of the year-end process the Audit Committee received 
updates on other judgemental areas including provisions and 
taxation. The presentation of exceptional items, as well as changes  
to IFRS, were also considered when reviewing the 2014 Annual 
Report and Accounts.

Annual Report and Accounts 2014
64 Conclusion
A summary of the process and of the Committee’s findings, was 
considered by the Board at its meeting on 25 February 2015.
The outcome of that review was that the Committee confirmed  
to the Board that the 2014 Annual Report and Accounts met the 
requirements of Code provision C.1, and the Board’s formal 
statement to that effect, to meet the requirements of the Code,  
is set out on page 55.
Going concern
The Group has prepared forecasts, including certain sensitivities, 
taking into account the principal risks identified on pages 28 to  
29. Having considered these forecasts, the Directors remain of the  
view that the Group’s financing arrangements and capital structure 
provides both the necessary facilities and covenant headroom to 
enable the Group to conduct its business for at least the next  
12 months. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements  
have been prepared on a going concern basis.

Directors’ Report: Governance p44-91 Financial Statements p92-143 Shareholder Information p144-153 Strategic Report p2-43 Remuneration Report
Dear Shareholder
I am delighted to take this opportunity, as the first year of my 
Chairmanship of the Remuneration Committee comes to an end,  
to summarise the Company’s remuneration strategy and the way  
it has been implemented during 2014. 
As always, the Committee remains very mindful of the interest in 
executive remuneration and has sought to ensure that the remuneration 
policies and practices at Taylor Wimpey drive behaviour that is in the 
long term interests of the Company and its shareholders. 
Shareholders approved the Remuneration Policy (the Policy),  
as set out in the 2013 Directors’ Remuneration Report at the 2014 
AGM, and this Policy will apply until replaced by a new or amended 
policy. As confirmed last year, it is the Committee’s intention that it will 
submit its policy to shareholders for approval once every three years 
unless circumstances dictate otherwise. The Remuneration Committee 
is of the view that the Policy continues to remain appropriate and 
should therefore continue to operate for 2015. There are no changes 
proposed to the Policy other than minor differences in the way in 
which the Policy will be implemented in 2015 compared with 2014. 
Where additional information has been included this has been clearly 
indicated for ease of reference for shareholders, namely, the pay 
scenario chart on page 72 and the additional information for 2015  
set out on pages 72 and 73 in italicised text. 
Although no changes are proposed, the Policy has, nevertheless, 
been included in this Report in full, for ease of reference, so as to 
assist shareholders in reviewing the Company’s implementation  
of the Policy during 2014. The Annual Report on Remuneration  
which describes the implementation of the Policy during the year  
will again be subject to an advisory vote, and this will take place  
at the forthcoming AGM in 2015.
The Committee has continued its much valued practice of engaging 
with key institutional investors and shareholder representative  
bodies with regard to Director remuneration. As in previous years,  
the Committee has taken into account the feedback which it has 
received and is, as ever, very grateful for the constructive engagement 
and feedback.
“ Remuneration policies and 
practices must drive behaviour that 
is in the long term interests of the 
Company and its shareholders.”

(a)  appointed to the Committee on 17 April 2014.
(b)  resigned from the Board on 17 April 2014.
With regard to salaries, the general increase throughout the  
Company to take effect from 1 April 2015 will be 3%. This will  
also apply to Pete Redfern (Chief Executive) and James Jordan 
(Group Legal Director and Company Secretary). As disclosed to 
shareholders in previous years and in line with our policy of, where 
appropriate, setting the starting salaries of new promotions to the 
Board at a below market level and increasing them to a mid-market 
level as they prove themselves in the role, the Committee intends  
to carry out a one-off realignment of Ryan Mangold’s salary to reflect 
his performance and development. Accordingly, an increase of 12.4% 
will be awarded taking his salary from £355,744 to £400,000 with 
effect from 1 April 2015.
With regard to the 2014 short term incentive (cash bonus) in place  
for Executive Directors, the Company performed strongly against 
certain of the Group KPIs during the year, particularly in respect  
of the Earnings Before Interest and Tax, ROCE and Operating Margin 
targets. Accordingly, the actual bonus outturn was towards the upper 
end of the performance range and as a result, bonuses of 90% of the 
maximum bonus potential have been awarded in respect of 2014. 
One-third of this incentive will be deferred into shares to be held on 
trust for three years with no matching element. 
With regard to the Performance Share Plan, the ROCE and Margin 
performance conditions of the 2011 and 2012 awards are measured 
at different times to the relative TSR performance conditions for these 
awards with the consequence that the ROCE and Margin elements 
and relative TSR elements of each award are included in the single 
figures of different financial years. We reported last year that the 
ROCE and Margin elements of the 2011 award would vest at levels  
of 74.4% and 100% respectively and I can now report that 100%  
of the relative TSR vs FTSE 250 element vested and that 93.85% of 
the relative TSR vs Sector Peers element vested. As a result 91.09% 
of the 2011 PSP award vested in April 2014.
The level of vesting under these plans reflects the continuing 
improvement in the Group’s performance including Return on Capital 
Employed and Operating Margin from 14.6% to 20.6% and 13.6%  
to 17.9%, respectively, between 2011 and 2014 achieved as a result 
of management’s focus on these key measures. This improvement  
in financial performance has contributed to a c.267% increase  
in Taylor Wimpey’s share price over the same period (from 37.5p  
on 31 December 2011 to 137.8p on 31 December 2014) and total 
Taylor Wimpey plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2014
66 shareholder return of c.282% over the same period, resulting  
in a significant increase in value for our shareholders and this  
is reflected in the value of the awards that vest. 
For the 2012 PSP award which vested in 2015, 100% of the  
ROCE and Margin performance measures have been achieved.  
The outcome of the other two measures, namely TSR relative to the 
FTSE 250 and TSR relative to the Sector Peer Group are dependent 
on the Company’s TSR to 5 March 2015 and the level of vesting will 
be reported next year. These are currently forecast to be 100% and 
68.9% respectively.
Vested shares are subject to the enhanced shareholding guidelines 
which we put in place for our Executive Directors in 2013 and details 
of each Director’s shareholding are set out on page 84. The 
Committee strongly believes in ensuring strong alignment between 
Executive Directors and senior management with shareholders. 
The Committee has reviewed both the setting and the achievement  
of targets for both short-term and long-term incentive plans in respect 
of 2014, taking into account the impact of Government support 
schemes such as Help to Buy upon volumes, selling prices, cost  
of sales, cash flow and carrying value of inventory, and is satisfied  
that there has been no significant distortion of incentive target 
performance based on these factors in 2014. 
The levels of achievement under both plans therefore reflect the 
Company’s excellent underlying performance described elsewhere  
in this Annual Report, including the Chairman’s Statement on page  
8 and the Chief Executive’s Review on page 10. In setting incentive 
targets for 2015, the Committee has also factored in the potential 
impact of such support schemes, and the Committee will keep this 
under review in 2015 and beyond. Further details on the vesting  
of the April 2011 PSP together with an update on the 2012 PSP 
award are set out on page 81.
The operation of the incentive arrangements for 2015 will be largely 
unchanged, save for some changes to the weighting of metrics  
used in the short-term incentive where there will be a greater 
weighting on a challenging customer service measure, and changes 
to the metrics and their weightings used for the PSP awards granted 
in April 2015. The Margin metric used in the PSP in recent years will 
be replaced by a Cash Conversion metric which will apply to 25%  
of the 2015 awards. A greater focus on cash conversion is a key 
element of the strategy that has been previously outlined to 
shareholders. Margin remains an important KPI for the Company  
and Margin performance will be taken into consideration as part  
of the Committee’s assessment of the financial underpin that applies 
to awards under the PSP . In addition, in light of the growth in the 
Group’s market capitalisation, the FTSE 250 peer group used for one 
of the TSR components of the PSP awards will be replaced by a peer 
group comprised of the 50 companies ranked above and 50 ranked 
below Taylor Wimpey by market capitalisation.
Executive Directors’ interests continue to be sufficiently aligned  
with those of the Company’s shareholders through the shareholding 
requirements described on page 83, and also via the bonus deferral 
into shares requirement described in more detail on page 70. This is 
being further enhanced for PSP awards made in 2015 by the 
introduction of a requirement to not sell shares within two years of 
their vesting other than to pay tax on exercise.
The Committee continues to believe that the remuneration policy set 
out in the Remuneration Policy Report will both support and motivate 
the senior team whilst aligning them both to the Company’s strategic 
objectives and to achieving long term growth for our shareholders. 
We also believe that the remuneration of executives and the whole 
Main objective
 − To establish and maintain formal and transparent procedures for 
developing policy on executive remuneration and for agreeing the 
remuneration packages of individual Directors and senior 
executives and to monitor and report on them.
In 2014 the Committee has
 − Supported delivery of the Company’s strategy through a 
remuneration policy which links a significant proportion of 
executive reward to the achievement of defined and stretching 
strategic goals;
 − Obtained shareholder approval for the Company’s first binding  
vote on its Remuneration Policy at the 2014 AGM;
 − Engaged with major shareholders and shareholder bodies and 
took into account their views in assessing the continued 
appropriateness of the current Remuneration Policy;
 − Reviewed the 2014 edition of The UK Corporate Governance 
Code (Code) including the requirement for remuneration to be 
designed to promote the long-term success of companies; 
 − Reviewed and updated the malus and clawback provisions  
to comply with the 2014 edition of the Code and, following the 
consultation with shareholders (referred to above) taken steps to 
apply those provisions to the Company’s long term Performance 
Share Plan (PSP);
 − Continued to support employee participation, as either 
shareholders or participants in all-employee share plans, in excess 
of 50%, with a small increase during the year.
Priorities and actions for 2015
 − To carefully monitor Company performance in relation to the 
achievement of its strategic goals, and to ensure executive 
reward is closely linked to those achievements;
 − To further align employees’ and shareholders’ interests through:
 − extending participation in the PSP to members of the Company’ s 
Regional Boards, who are a key determinant of the Group’ s 
success through performance at business unit level; and
 − further increasing participation in all-employee share plans and  
the percentage of employee shareholders.

performance that have been awarded during the year, support the 
Company’s strategy to deliver enhanced returns to shareholders,  
and that the short term incentive payments and the proportionate 
vesting of awards under the Company’s Performance Share Plan 
reflect our success to date in the delivery of that strategy.
I do hope that you will feel able to support the level of remuneration 
paid with respect to 2014 at this year’s Annual General Meeting.

Directors’ Report: Governance p44-91 Financial Statements p92-143 Shareholder Information p144-153 Strategic Report p2-43 Introduction
This Report has been prepared to comply with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006 and other applicable legislation, including the 
regulations covering remuneration reporting (the BIS Regulations), 
and has also been prepared in line with the recommendations of  
the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code) and the UKLA 
Listing Rules. 
This Report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee  
on behalf of the Board.
The 2014 Remuneration Report includes again disclosures which 
reflect in full the BIS regulations on remuneration reporting, divided 
into two sections: 
 − Remuneration Policy Report, setting out the framework within 
which the Company remunerates its Executive Directors and other 
senior executives. This was approved by shareholders at the 2014 
AGM and is binding on the Company from the 2014 AGM;
 − Annual Report on Remuneration, setting out how the Company’s 
present remuneration policy was applied during 2014 and how  
the policy will be implemented in 2015. The Annual Report on 
Remuneration will be subject to an advisory resolution at the  
AGM on 23 April 2015. Details of the resolution and its status  
as an advisory vote are set out in the Notes to the Notice of 
Meeting on page 150. 
The BIS Regulations require that the Company’s auditors report  
to shareholders on certain parts of this Report and state whether  
in their opinion those parts of it have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the BIS Regulations. The Remuneration Policy 
Report, which describes the Committee’s remuneration policy for 
Executive Directors for the year commencing 1 January 2014 and 
future years, contains unaudited information. Elements of the Annual 
Report on Remuneration, which describes how the Committee has 
implemented its existing policy in 2014, contains audited information.
Remuneration Policy Report
Unaudited information
This part of the Report has been prepared in accordance with Part 4 
of the revised Schedule 8 set out in The Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2013.
The Company’s Remuneration Policy was put to a shareholder 
vote at the 2014 Annual General Meeting of the Company (AGM) 
and was approved by 98% of shareholders who voted. There is no 
requirement to vote on the Policy in 2015 unless any changes to the 
policy are proposed, and the Committee does not intend to make any 
changes to the Policy at this time. The Policy is set out below for 
information only; the chart, showing remuneration scenarios on page 
72 has been updated to reflect proposed 2015 remuneration levels 
and minor changes to the text of the policy have been made to reflect 
the fact that the policy was approved by shareholders. In order to 
assist shareholders, we have also added additional explanations 
where there are any differences in the way in which the policy will be 
implemented in 2015 compared with 2014. Where additional 
information has been included this has been clearly indicated in 
italicised text.
Policy Overview
A key part of the Committee’s role is to ensure that the remuneration 
of Executive Directors and senior management is aligned to the 
Company’s strategic objectives. It is, of course, key that the 
Company is able to attract and retain leaders who are focused  
and also appropriately incentivised to deliver the Company’s strategic 
objectives within a framework which is aligned with the interests of 
the Company’s shareholders. This alignment is achieved through a 
combination of deferral into shares of a percentage of the short term 
incentive arrangements and also via share ownership guidelines 
which require executives to build up holdings of Taylor Wimpey 
shares by retaining vested share awards. These guidelines were 
increased in 2012 so as to require Executive Directors to put in place 
a plan to accumulate a holding in the Company of twice their basic 
salary within a specified period. 
The Committee’s remuneration policy ensures that a significant 
percentage of the overall package of Executive Directors and senior 
management remains at risk. With all packages substantially geared 
towards share incentive schemes and performance, the Committee 
believes that the pay and benefits of its Executive Directors and 
senior management adequately takes account of reward versus risk. 
In line with The Investment Association’s (formerly the ABI) Guidelines 
on Responsible Investment Disclosure, the Remuneration Committee 
ensures that the incentive structure for Executive Directors and senior 
management will not raise environmental, social or governance (ESG) 
risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.  
More generally, the Committee under its terms of reference may, 
where it considers appropriate, take ESG matters into account  
when considering the overall remuneration structure. The Committee 
considers that no element of the remuneration arrangements, which 
are all very carefully considered, will encourage inappropriate risk 
taking or behaviour by any executive. The table below summarises 
the Committee’s Policy for the Remuneration of Executive Directors 
which, since being approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM, 
became effective from the conclusion of the 2014 AGM and will be 
binding until the AGM in 2017. It also summarises the remuneration 
position of the Chairman and Non Executive Directors and the 
Company’s all-employee share schemes.

However, larger increases may be 
awarded in certain circumstances 
including but not limited to:
 − increase in scope or responsibilities

Director fees
The Chairman’ s and 
Non Executive Director fees 
should be in line with 
recognised best practice 
and be sufficient to attract 
and retain high calibre 
non executives.
Fees consists of a single consolidated fee for the 
Chairman plus the payment of a cash amount to 
cover his office expenses
1
, an annual fee for the 
other Non-Executives and additional fees for the 
Chairman of the Audit Committee and the 
Remuneration Committee. An additional fee is 
also paid to the Senior Independent Director in 
recognition of the responsibilities of that role.
Set by reference to the responsibilities 
undertaken by the non-executive, taking into 
account that each Non Executive Director is 
expected to be a member of the Nomination 
Committee and/or the Audit Committee and/or 
Remuneration Committee. 
Reviewed periodically but generally annually and 
at least every other year. Takes into account 
levels in comparably-sized companies and other 
major housebuilders.
Fees are paid monthly in cash.
Non Executive Directors do not participate in any 
incentive, share scheme, benefits-in-kind or 
pension arrangements. The Chairman is entitled 
to participate in the Company’s private medical 
insurance scheme.
Aggregate annual limit of £1 million 
imposed by the Articles of 
Association.
N/A
Other 
benefits, 
including 
benefits-in-
kind
Provides a competitive 
package of benefits to 
assist with recruitment and 
retention of staff.
The main benefits offered include:
 −company-provided car or a cash allowance  
in lieu;
 −provision of a fuel card;
 −life assurance;
 −private medical insurance; and
 −a 5% discount on the price of a new or part 
exchange home acquired from the Group  
in the UK or Spain.
Benefits-in-kind are not pensionable.
Life assurance of up to four times 
basic salary and a pension of up  
to two-thirds of the member’s 
entitlement for a spouse on death  
in service, or in retirement, are 
provided, together with a children’s 
allowance of up to 100% of the 
dependant’s pension for three or 
more eligible children. The cost of 
these benefits is not predetermined.
The value of a company-provided 
car or a cash allowance in lieu is of  
a level appropriate to the individual’s 
role and is subject to review from 
time to time. The fuel card covers 
the cost of all fuel, for both business 
and personal use.
For home purchases, the price 
discount is calculated at the plot 
release price less the average 
discount to third party buyers for 
that house type, less a further 5%.

Element
Purpose and Link 
to strategy Operation Maximum Performance targets
Short term 
incentive 
arrangement 
(STIA)
Rewards the achievement 
of stretching objectives that 
support the Company’s 
annual and strategic goals.
Compulsory deferral in 
shares (with no matching)  
is designed to further align 
the interests of Directors 
with shareholders.
Bonus awards are determined by the Committee 
after the year end, based on annual performance 
against targets set at the beginning of each year.
One-third of any bonus payable is deferred into 
shares for three years. No further performance 
conditions apply.
Dividends or other distributions will accrue in 
favour of participants during the three year 
deferral period and will be received with any 
shares that vest after the applicable deferral 
period. 
A clawback mechanism applies to all participants 
in the event of a material misstatement of the 
Group’s accounts and also for other defined 
reasons. The period of the clawback is three 
years from the date of payment.
No element of any STIA is pensionable.
The maximum STIA opportunity  
for Executive Directors is set at 
150% of base salary. Target is  
set at 75% of salary and threshold  
at 0%.
The STIA measures are based  
on a scorecard of key annual 
financial, operational and 
environmental measures and  
the measures for 2015 are 
described in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration.
The Committee may vary the 
metrics and weightings from year 
to year according to strategy and 
the market, however financial 
measures will normally have the 
most significant weighting.
Long term 
incentive plan 
(LTIP)
Annual grants of share-
based long term incentives 
assist with retention and 
help to incentivise senior 
executives to achieve 
returns for shareholders 
through the inclusion of 
relative Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR) as a measure, 
driving further UK operating 
margin progression and 
improving return on net 
operating assets through 
the cycle. The use of 
shares and the introduction 
in 2014 of a post-vesting 
share holding period, helps 
align the interests of senior 
executives with those of the 
Company’s shareholders.
Executive Directors and other designated  
senior executives can receive annual awards of 
performance shares or share options
2
, although  
it is the Company’s normal policy to grant 
performance shares only.
Awards of performance shares provide alignment 
with shareholders as they deliver (subject to 
meeting performance conditions) the full value  
of the shares, which can increase and decrease 
over the three year performance period.
Dividends or other distributions will accrue for 
Directors during the performance period and  
will be received with any shares that vest in 
favour of participants after the applicable 
performance period. 
For awards made in 2014 there was a 
requirement to hold net after tax shares  
resulting from any vesting for at least one  
year post-vesting, rising to two years for  
awards made in 2015 and beyond.
Performance measures are currently measured 
over three financial years.
The maximum award (currently  
in performance shares) is normally 
over shares with a face value of 
200% of base salary. In exceptional 
circumstances this can be increased 
up to 300%.
If share options were to be  
granted in addition to or instead of 
performance shares then the limits 
would be doubled to reflect the 
relative fair value of options to 
performance shares.
Measures for 2014 are based  
on: ROCE (RONA); Relative  
TSR measured against the FTSE  
250; TSR measured against an 
unweighted industry peer group; 
and Margin. Vesting of awards is 
also subject to the achievement 
of a financial underpin. 
The Committee may vary the 
measures that are included in  
the plan and the weightings 
between the measures from  
year to year. Any changes to the 
metrics would be subject to prior 
consultation with the Company’s 
major shareholders. 
The targets and weightings for 
2015 are described in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration.

Directors’ Report: Governance p44-91 Financial Statements p92-143 Shareholder Information p144-153 Strategic Report p2-43 Additional information for 2015: Malus and clawback
As disclosed in the summary of the Committee’s activities in 2014 
on pages 66 and 67, the Committee has reviewed and updated the 
malus and clawback provisions to ensure compliance with the 2014 
Code and has taken the opportunity to extend these provisions so 
that they apply, in addition to future STIA awards, to all Long Term 
Incentive Plan (PSP) awards made in 2015 and future years.  
Where there has been a misstatement of results; error in calculating 
the incentive payment; or misconduct on the part of the individual,  
the Committee will have the ability to seek to recover any overpaid 
bonus or PSP award. This will apply for a period of up to three years 
following the determination of the performance conditions applying to 
the award and can be effected by reducing (if necessary to zero) the 
payment or vesting of any future STIA or PSP award or by requiring 
the individual to repay the overpaid amount. 
Committee discretion
The Committee fully recognises that the exercise of discretion must 
be undertaken in a very careful and considered way and that it is an 
area that will quite rightly come under scrutiny from shareholders and 
other stakeholders. It is however important for the Committee to 
retain some discretion to make payments outside of its Remuneration 
Policy in exceptional circumstances. The Committee confirms that 
any exercise of discretion in such circumstances would be within the 
available discretions set out in this Report and the maximum levels 
available set out in any plans would not be exceeded.
With regard to the STIA and LTIP , the Committee, consistent with 
market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating  
to the operation and administration of these plans but in all cases 
within the rules. These include (but are not limited to) the following 
(albeit with the level of award restricted as set out in the policy table 
on pages 69 to 71):
 − who participates in the plans;
 − the timing of grant of award and/or payment;
 − the size of an award and/or a payment, subject to the limits  
of the rules;
 − discretion relating to the measurement of performance in the event 
of a change of control or reconstruction;
 − determination of a good leaver (in addition to any specified 
categories) for incentive plan purposes based on the rules of each 
plan and the appropriate treatment chosen;
 − discretion to dis-apply time pro-rating in the event of a change  
of control or good leaver circumstances;
 − adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issues, 
corporate restructuring, acquisition, divestment, change of control, 
special dividend or a change in prevailing market conditions); and
 − the ability to adjust existing performance conditions for exceptional 
events so that they can still fulfil their original purpose.

Annual Report and Accounts 2014
72 How shareholder views are taken into account
The Remuneration Committee considers very seriously all shareholder 
feedback received in relation to remuneration each year and guidance 
from shareholder representative bodies more generally. Shareholder 
views are key inputs when shaping the remuneration policy and the 
Committee welcomes any comment or feedback on any aspects  
of remuneration and will always consider and respond. 
The Committee regularly engages with its largest shareholders 
regarding the ongoing remuneration policy and implementation and 
will take into account any feedback when determining any changes 
that might apply. The last such consultation took place in early 2015 
and included the performance targets and weightings of the PSP  
and STIA and salary proposals for 2015.
The Committee follows the principles of good governance relating to 
Directors’ remuneration as set out in the Main Principles, Supporting 
Principles and Code Provisions of the Code. The Committee reviews 
and takes into account any governance related developments and 
guidance that arise, on an ongoing basis. 
How performance measures were chosen
The performance metrics that are used for each of the short and 
long-term incentive plans have been selected to reflect the Group’s 
key strategic goals and are designed to align the Directors’ interests 
with those of the Company’s shareholders. 
The STIA performance metrics include a mix of financial and personal 
metrics reflecting the key annual priorities of the Group. The financial 
metrics will generally determine at least 50% of the bonus and include 
profit before interest and tax as this reflects the Company’s strategic 
objective to increase profit. The other metrics, selected on an annual 
basis, will be measurable and will ensure that executives are 
motivated to deliver across a scorecard of key objectives.
The performance conditions applicable to the LTIPs were selected  
by the Remuneration Committee as they are consistent with the 
overall longer term success of the Company. TSR provides an 
external assessment of the Company’s performance against its 
competitors via an unweighted industry peer group and relative TSR 
measured against the FTSE 250. It also aligns the rewards received 
by executives with the returns received by shareholders. The Margin 
and ROCE targets ensure that returns to shareholders are the result 
of long-term sustainable financial performance.
The Committee will review the choice of performance measures and 
the appropriateness of the performance targets each year. Targets  
are set based on a sliding scale that takes account of internal 
planning and external market expectations for the Company. Only 
modest rewards are available for delivering threshold performance 
levels with maximum rewards requiring substantial out-performance 
of our challenging plans approved at the start of each year.
Additional information for 2015
As referred to in the letter from the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee on page 67, the Margin metric used in the PSP in recent 
years, has been replaced by a Cash Conversion metric which will 
apply to 25% of the 2015 awards. A greater focus on Cash 
Conversion is a key element of the strategy that has been outlined  
to shareholders during 2014. However, Margin remains an important 
KPI for the Company and Margin performance will be taken into 
consideration as part of the Committee’s assessment of the financial 
underpin that applies to awards under the PSP and remains a key 
performance target under the 2015 STIA. In addition, in light of the 
growth in the Group’s market capitalisation, the FTSE 250 peer  
group used for one of the TSR components of the PSP awards will 
be replaced by a peer group comprised of the 50 companies ranked 
above and 50 ranked below Taylor Wimpey by market capitalisation. 
This comparator group is felt to be more appropriate given the 
Company’s current size than the FTSE 250.
External non executive director positions
Subject to Board approval and provided that such appointments fall 
within the general requirements of the Code (and do not give rise to 
any conflict issues which cannot be managed by the Board and the 
Executive Director), Executive Directors are permitted to take on non 
executive positions with other companies. Executive Directors are 
permitted to retain their fees in respect of such positions. In early 
2014, none of the Executive Directors held an external directorship  
of a disclosable nature. Any such appointments would be the subject 
of a public announcement to the London Stock Exchange.
Additional information for 2015
On 11 November 2014 Pete Redfern was appointed as an 
independent non executive director of Travis Perkins plc where  
he also serves on its Audit and Remuneration Committees.  
He will receive fees totalling £55,000 per annum for this position.
Remuneration policy for the wider workforce
When setting the policy for Executive Directors, the Committee is 
made fully aware of pay structures across the workforce. In addition, 
the Committee will conduct a formal review of remuneration across 
the Group and for all levels of employee every three years. 
Virtually all of the Company’s employees participate in incentive 
arrangements and many employees can elect to take their performance 
related payment in shares rather than cash (further enhancing the link 
and alignment between shareholder value and employee reward 
throughout the Company, which both the Company and the 
Committee remain keen to promote. In addition, the Company has 
operated a long-term incentive arrangement – the Land Value Plan 
(LVP) for senior divisional and functional roles with payouts in shares. 
The LVP is open to designated senior executives below Executive 
Director level and is designed to reward participants for managing  
the landbank in a way which adds value, through a combination of 
managing and adding value to the existing land portfolio and buying 
land and adding value over and above the base case for each 
acquisition. Performance is measured over a three year period and 
awards to senior participants are in shares which are required to then 
be retained for 12 months. At the time this policy was approved, the 
Committee retained discretion to consider linking part of the long-
term incentive awards to the Executive Directors to similar measures, 
subject to a prior and comprehensive shareholder consultation. The 
Company also offers both Sharesave and SIP schemes to all eligible 
UK employees with more than three months’ service.
Additional information for 2015
The Committee reviewed the operation of the LVP at the end of 2014. 
The LVP was introduced in 2012 and has operated for three years 
with the last awards made in 2014. During the period of its operation 
the land bank has improved significantly. It is not intended to make 
any further awards under the LVP and participants will instead 
participate in the PSP . Executive Directors have not participated in 
the LVP .

Directors’ Report: Governance p44-91 Financial Statements p92-143 Shareholder Information p144-153 Strategic Report p2-43 Remuneration policy on recruitment or promotion
Base salary levels will be set in accordance with the current 
remuneration policy, taking into account the experience and calibre of 
the individual. Where appropriate, the Company may offer a below 
market salary initially with a view to making above market and 
workforce increases over a number of years to reach the desired 
salary positioning, subject to individual and Company performance. 
Benefits and pension will be provided in line with those offered to 
other Executive Directors, with relocation expenses/arrangements 
provided for if necessary. Tax equalisation may also be considered if 
an executive is adversely affected by taxation due to their 
employment with the Company. Legal fees and other costs incurred 
by the individual may also be paid by the Company, if considered 
appropriate and reasonable to do so.
The variable pay elements that may be offered will be subject to the 
maximum levels described in the policy table above. The Company 
may also apply different performance measures if it feels these 
appropriately meet the strategic objectives and aims of the Company 
whilst incentivising the new appointment. 
The above policy applies to both an internal promotion to the Taylor 
Wimpey plc Board or an external hire.
In the case of an external hire, the Company may choose to buy-out 
any incentive pay or benefit arrangements which would be forfeited 
on leaving the previous employer. This will only occur where the 
Company feels that it is a necessary requirement to aid the 
recruitment. The replacement value would be provided for, taking into 
account the form (cash or shares) and timing and expected value (i.e. 
likelihood of meeting any existing performance criteria) of the 
remuneration being forfeited. Replacement share awards, if used, will 
be granted using Taylor Wimpey’s existing share plans wherever and 
to the extent possible, although in exceptional circumstances awards 
may also be granted outside of these schemes if necessary and as 
permitted under the Listing Rules. 
In the case of an internal hire including a promotion, as previously 
reported, the Company will honour any commitments entered into 
prior to their appointment to the Board even where it is not consistent 
with the policy prevailing at the time such commitment is fulfilled.
Directors’ contracts
It is the Company’s policy that Executive Directors should have 
contracts of employment providing for a maximum of one year’s 
notice either way. Service contracts for all Executive Directors and 
letters of appointment for all Non Executive Directors are available  
for inspection as described in the Notice of Annual General Meeting.
Each of the Executive Directors’ service contracts provides for:
 − the payment of a base salary (details of which are set out on  
page 76);
 − an expensed Company-provided car or a cash allowance in lieu;  
a fuel allowance; life assurance; and private medical insurance 
(details of which are set out on page 78);
 − employer’s contribution to a pension scheme (details of which  
are set out on page 78);
 − a notice period by either side of 12 months; and
 − a provision requiring a Director to mitigate losses on termination.
The service contract for each of Pete Redfern and James Jordan 
additionally provides for a pension allowance.
Each service contract contains the following performance-related 
provisions:
 − participation in the STIA; and 
 − participation in one or more LTIP . 
In respect of pay in lieu of notice (PILON), it is the Company’s policy 
that liquidated damages should not automatically apply on the 
termination of an Executive Director’s contract. Such contracts do 
provide for PILON to be paid, with the amount determined having 
regard to normal legal practices. In accordance with this approach, 
payment for early termination of contract (without cause) by the 
Company is to be determined, in the case of each Executive Director, 
having regard to normal legal principles which require mitigation of 
liability on a case-by-case basis. Any such payment would typically 
be determined by reference to the main elements of a Director’s 
remuneration, namely: salary, STIA entitlement (subject to Committee 
discretion as appropriate), benefits-in-kind and pension entitlements. 
Phased payments will be considered by the Company where 
appropriate. There are no change of control provisions that apply in 
relation to the service contract of any Executive Director. 
Other than in certain ‘good leaver’ circumstances (including, but not 
limited to, redundancy, ill-health or retirement), no STIA would usually 
be payable unless the individual remains employed and is not under 
notice at the payment date. Any STIA paid to a ‘good leaver’ would 
be based on an assessment of their and the Company’s performance 
over the applicable period and pro-rated for the proportion of the 
STIA year worked.
Where an Executive Director is considered by the Remuneration 
Committee to be a good leaver, deferred bonus awards (shares) 
would vest. In other circumstances, awards would lapse.
With regard to long term incentive awards, the LTIP rules provide that 
other than in certain ‘good leaver’ circumstances, awards lapse on 
cessation of employment. Where an individual is a ‘good leaver’, the 
Committee’s normal policy is for the award to vest on cessation of 
employment following the application of performance targets no later 
than the normal vesting date of the award and a pro-rata reduction to 
take account of the proportion of the applicable performance period 
outstanding post the cessation. The Committee has discretion to 
deem an individual to be a ‘good leaver’. In doing so, it will take 
account of the reason for the departure and the performance  
of the individual through to the time of departure. 
In situations where an Executive Director is dismissed, the Committee 
reserves the right to make additional exit payments where such 
payments are made in good faith:
 − in discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages 
for breach of such an obligation); or
 − by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in 
connection with the termination of Director’s office or employment. 
The terms of engagement of the Chairman and the Non Executive 
Directors are regulated by letters of appointment over a term of three 
years, which are reviewed annually. Both the Company and the 
aforementioned Directors have a notice period of six months and the 
Directors are not entitled to compensation on termination other than 
for the normal notice period if not worked out.
Service contracts and letters of appointment may be inspected  
at the Company’s Registered Office during normal business hours.

has been audited.
Remuneration Committee
The role of the Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’) is to 
recommend to the Board a strategy and framework for remuneration 
for Executive Directors and senior management in order to attract 
and retain leaders who are focused and incentivised to deliver the 
Company’s strategic business priorities within a remuneration 
framework which is aligned with the interests of our shareholders and 
thus designed to promote the long-term success of the Company.
The Remuneration Committee has clearly defined terms of reference 
which are available on the Company’s website www.taylorwimpey.
co.uk/corporate/investor-relations/corporate-governance. 
The Committee’s main responsibilities are to:
 − establish and maintain formal and transparent procedures for 
developing policy on executive remuneration and for fixing the 
remuneration packages of individual Directors, and to monitor  
and report on them;
 − determine the remuneration, including pension arrangements,  
of the Executive Directors;
 − monitor and make recommendations in respect of remuneration  
for the tier of senior management one level below that of the Board;
 − approve annual and long term incentive arrangements together 
with their targets and levels of awards;
 − determine the level of fees for the Chairman of the Board; and 
 − select and appoint the external advisers to the Committee.
The Committee currently comprises three Independent Non Executive 
Directors and the Chairman of the Board. Margaret Ford is the 
Committee Chairman, having been appointed after Tony Reading 
stood down from the Board in April 2014 after nine years’ service. 
The other members of the Committee are Kevin Beeston, Rob 
Rowley and Kate Barker, who became a member with effect from 
17 April 2014. Membership of the Committee is, and was throughout 
2014, in line with the Code. 
Details of attendance at Remuneration Committee meetings held 
during 2014 are set out below.

No Director or other executive is involved in any decisions about  
his/her own specific remuneration.
Advice to the Committee
The Committee keeps itself fully informed on developments and best 
practice in the field of remuneration and it seeks advice from external 
advisers when appropriate.
The Committee appoints its own independent remuneration advisers 
and during the year it continued to retain the services of New Bridge 
Street (an Aon Hewitt company which is not connected to Taylor 
Wimpey). New Bridge Street’s ultimate parent company is Aon PLC.
New Bridge Street is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants’ 
Group Code of Conduct. It provides no other services to the 
Company. Although the wider Aon PLC group of companies provide 
insurance broking and pension administration support services to the 
Company, the Committee is entirely satisfied that the provision of 
such services does not create any conflicts of interest. New Bridge 
Street was appointed in February 2009 following a comprehensive 
tendering process. The Committee reviews the performance and 
independence of its advisers on an annual basis.
The Committee also receives legal advice from Slaughter and May  
as and when necessary. This generally relates to technical advice on 
share schemes and also with regard to any senior appointments and 
termination arrangements.
The fees paid to the Committee’s advisers in 2014 were: New  
 Bridge Street £80,000 (2013: £96,000) representing a full year’s 
appointment. No significant amount of advice was sought from 
Slaughter and May during the year.
Pete Redfern, the Chief Executive; James Jordan, the Group Legal 
Director and Company Secretary; and the Group Human Resources 
Director each attend Committee meetings by invitation only but  
are not present for any discussions that relate directly to their  
own remuneration.

Directors’ Report: Governance p44-91 Financial Statements p92-143 Shareholder Information p144-153 Strategic Report p2-43 How the Remuneration Policy will be applied in 2015
Base Salary
The Committee reviewed the Executive Directors’ salaries in February 
2015 and has decided to award increases of 3% for Pete Redfern and 
James Jordan, with effect from 1 April 2015, in line with the equivalent 
general increase made to all employees (subject to a very small 
number of exceptions). As indicated to shareholders previously, Ryan 
Mangold’s salary was set at a below market level on his appointment 
to the Board in 2010 with a view to increasing it to a market level  
over time as he developed in the role. Ryan Mangold’s salary will be 
increased by 12.4% to reflect his strong performance and development. 
This will bring his salary to a broadly mid-market level. Following this 
realignment of his salary it is anticipated that his future increases will 
be in-line with increases awarded to the general workforce.
The salaries of the Executive Directors effective from 1 April 2015 will 
be as follows:
Name
Salary at  
1 April 2014
Salary at  
1 April 2015 Increase 
Pete Redfern £772,669 £795,849 3%
Ryan Mangold £355,744 £400,000 12.4%
James Jordan £358,739 £369,501 3%
Short term incentive arrangements (STIA)
The STIA performance metrics and their weightings for 2015 are 
shown in the table below. The targets themselves, as they relate to 
the current financial year, are deemed to be commercially sensitive. 
However, detailed, retrospective disclosure of the targets and 
performance against them will be provided in next year’s 
Remuneration Report. 
Measure Strategic objective Weighting
Group EBIT T o increase profit 35%
Cash generated Delivering sustainable growth 20%
Margin
Driving further UK operating  
margin progression 25%
Customer Service Caring about our customers 20%
The above metrics and weightings have been reviewed from previous 
years to reflect the Company’s move to a new phase of its strategy,  
with the removal of the previous ROCE and energy reduction metrics, 
on the basis that the key strategic imperatives lie elsewhere, although  
each will of course remain a key priority for the Company. Customer 
Service is an area of particular focus by the Company and challenging 
targets have been put in place, in order to reflect this and the 
additional weighting attached to this measure. 
Long Term Incentive Plans

unweighted index comprised of Barratt Developments, Bellway, 
Berkeley Homes, Bovis Homes Group, Crest Nicholson, Galliford

Remuneration Report continued
Taylor Wimpey plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2014
76 An underlying requirement for any vesting under the current share-
based incentive plans is that at the time of approving the vesting,  
the Committee must be satisfied with the overall financial performance 
of the Group. This will include inter alia the Company’s ROCE and 
Margin performance.
The Committee also retains the right (as part of its overall discretion) 
to reduce the vesting of the award if it considers that volumes (i.e. the 
number of homes sold) have not been satisfactory during the relevant 
performance period.
Dividends and other distributions will accrue on all awards during the 
performance period and be released in cash when, and to the extent 
that, the relevant awards vest.
Non Executive Directors’ and Chairman’s fees
Fees of Non Executive Directors are determined by the Board in their 
absence taking into account the research carried out by independent 
remuneration consultants of fees paid to Non Executive Directors. 
The fees of the Chairman are determined by the Remuneration 
Committee in his absence. A summary of the current fees are set out 
below. The fees of the Chairman and the Non Executive Directors are 
reviewed every other year with any increases taking place with effect 
from 1 July. Fees were last reviewed in 2013 and are unchanged 
since then but will be reviewed during 2015:
Fees at  
1 April 2015
Chairman £256,250
Basic Non Executive Director fee £55,000
Senior Independent Director fee £10,000
Audit Committee Chairman £15,000
Remuneration Committee Chairman £15,000
All Directors will submit themselves for re-election at the AGM in 
accordance with the Code.

includes the STIA and LTIP awards which vested based on performance in those years. The STIA and LTIP percentages show the payout  
for each year as a percentage of the maximum.

(a) The 2013 single figure includes the value of the August 2010 PSP awards and the ROCE and Margin elements of the 2011 PSP awards. Due to the timing of the grant of the 2009  
and 2010 awards the performance periods for the August 2010 and elements of the 2011 PSP awards both ended during 2013 and they are therefore included in the 2013 single 
figure. As the 2011 PSP awards did not vest until April 2014, the final value of these awards at vesting was not known at the time the 2013 report was prepared and therefore  
an estimated value was used. The 2013 single figure in this report has been restated to show the actual value of the shares at the vesting date. Details of the percentage of each  
award vesting are summarised in the table on page 79.
(b) The 2014 single figure includes the ROCE and Margin elements of the 2012 PSP awards. Due to the timing of the grant of those awards, the performance periods for the two TSR 
elements will not conclude until later in March 2015 and will be included in a revised 2014 single figure in next year’s Report.

(a) Benefits include non-cash payments such as private medical insurance, life insurance, company car provision, fuel allowances, and cash payments such as car allowance taken  
in lieu of a car. 
(b) The Company also paid £10,000 (2013: £25,000) as a contribution towards the Chairman’s annual office and related administration costs incurred in carrying out his role.  
(c) Ryan Mangold is a member of the salary exchange scheme operated by the Company and the amount exchanged during the year was £9,000 (2013: £34,000). The Flexible Pension 
Arrangement is a voluntary arrangement, the effect of which is to allow members and the Company to benefit from savings in National Insurance contributions through the sacrifice  
of a portion of salary, which would then be paid into a pension scheme as a Company contribution, prior to NIC being calculated. The Scheme therefore reduces the effective salary  
of the individual.
(d) This column shows the vesting during 2014 and 2013 of LTIPs as set out in the table at the top of page 79. Note that the 2013 figures reported last year were based on estimates  
of the value of the shares at vesting. These have been restated to reflect the actual value of the shares at the point of vesting.
(e) The 2013 LTIP figure includes the value of the August 2010 PSP awards and the ROCE and Margin elements of the 2011 PSP awards. Due to the timing of the grant of the 2009  
and 2010 awards the performance periods for the August 2010 and 2011 PSP awards both ended during 2013 and they are therefore included in the 2013 single figure.  
Details of the percentage of each award vesting are summarised in the table at the top of page 79.
(f) These figures represent the cash allowances payable as described in the Remuneration Policy ‘Pension’ section. For Pete Redfern this is 20% of salary up to a scheme specific cap 
and 25% of salary above the cap; for Ryan Mangold this is 15.6% of salary as reported in Non-Group Pension Arrangements on page 85; and for James Jordan this is 20% of salary 
up to a scheme specific cap and 28% of salary above the cap.

Vesting of long-term incentive awards in 2014
The BIS regulations require the value of long-term incentives vesting, by reference to performance period ending in the financial year being 
reported on, to be included in the single figure. This applies to the TSR elements of the April 2011 TWPSP awards and the ROCE and Margin 
elements of the March 2012 TWPSP award.
The performance period for the TSR elements of the 2011 award ended on 31 March 2014, which was after publication of the 2013 Annual 
Report and Accounts, and was independently calculated by New Bridge Street.
The performance period for the ROCE element of the 2012 award ended on 31 December 2014 and the final measurement was undertaken 
at this date. The TSR elements will be tested at the conclusion of their three year performance period on 5 March 2015 and the final 
measurement will be undertaken at this date. 
For 2013 LTIP awards and onwards, testing of all performance targets (including TSR) will be based on the position as at 31 December  
of the final performance year.

In deciding whether, and to what extent, any vesting of awards should take place under any LTIP , the Committee also considers the overall 
financial performance of the Company during the period. The Committee has determined that the overall financial performance of the 
Company has been very strong in respect of the performance periods of the above LTIPs.

Directors’ interests in shares of the Company
Share ownership guidelines
These guidelines are designed to encourage greater levels of shareholding by executives at various levels within the Company for the purpose 
of alignment with the Company’s shareholders which the Committee strongly believes is very important. The guidelines cover the Board and  
a number of executives who participate in long term incentive plans, namely the TWPSP , TWSOP and the LVP , with all participating executives 
required to build up shareholdings through the retention of shares vesting under the Company’s share plans. 
The level of shareholding for Executive Directors to attain under the current guidelines is two times base salary. Executive Directors are 
expected to achieve a holding equivalent to one times base salary within five years of their appointment and although there will be no set time 
limit for achieving a two times salary holding, each Executive Director is required to agree a personal plan with the Chairman on the target to 
be achieved within an agreed time frame. Executive Directors are also required to retain at least 50% of their net of taxes gain arising from  
any shares vesting or acquired pursuant to the Company’s long term incentive share plans, until such time as the guidelines have been met. 
Only beneficially owned shares count toward the guidelines. Members of the Group Management Team and other designated executives are 
currently expected to maintain a shareholding of generally equivalent to 50% and 20% of their base salaries respectively, and will accordingly 
also be required to retain at least 50% of shares vesting or acquired net of taxes pursuant to the Company’s long term incentive plans until 
such guidelines are met.

Directors’ Report: Governance p44-91 Financial Statements p92-143 Shareholder Information p144-153 Strategic Report p2-43 The Committee will keep the guidelines under regular review. As mentioned earlier in this Report, any shares that vest under the 2014  
award must, as a standard requirement, be retained by executives for at least 12 months and for at least 24 months under later awards.  
The Chairman and the Non Executive Directors are also encouraged to hold shares in the Company in order to align their interests with  
those of shareholders. Directors’ interests in 1p ordinary shares held (fully paid) (ordinary shares) are as set out in the table below:

(a) The George Wimpey Staff Pension Scheme (GWSPS) closed to future accrual on 31 August 2010 so pension accrual ceased on that date. Members of the GWSPS were transferred 
into the TWPS on 1 October 2013 and there was no change to members’ benefit entitlement. Pension accrual shown above is the amount which would be paid annually on retirement 
based on service to 31 August 2010. Pension benefits include a two thirds spouse’s pension. Pensions accrued up to 5 April 2006 are guaranteed to increase in payment in line with 
inflation limited each year to 5%. Pensions accrued after 5 April 2006 are guaranteed to increase in payment in line with inflation limited each year to 2.5%. Pensions accrued up to  
5 April 2009 will revalue in deferment in line with inflation subject to an overall cap of 5% per annum. Pensions accrued after 5 April 2009 will revalue in deferment in line with inflation 
subject to an overall cap of 2.5% per annum. We have only taken into account defined benefits accrued over the period to 31 August 2010 and have not included any Defined 
Contribution pension benefits accrued after this date.
(b) Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with the Occupational Pension Schemes (Transfer Value) Regulations 2008.
(c) The increase in the transfer value includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and Directors, such as financial  
market movements.
(d) The 31/12/13 figure has been adjusted due to a change in the Director’s entitlement at the end of 2013.
Note: The GWSPS closed to future accrual on 31 August 2010 and so no contributions were made after 31 August 2010.
There was no change to benefits during the year and consequently no difference between the changes to any Director’s pension benefits  
in comparison with those of other employees.

Retirement and re-election
The Company has determined that in accordance with the Code,  
all Directors should seek re-election at this year’s AGM as explained  
in the Notes to the Notice of Meeting and on page 54 of the 
Corporate Governance Report.
Each of the Directors proposed for re-election at the AGM is being 
unanimously recommended by all of the other members of the 
Board. This recommendation follows the completion of the annual 
performance evaluation process, which included a detailed appraisal  
of the Board, its Committees and in respect of each Director. Further 
information relating to the evaluation is set out below and in the 
Corporate Governance Report on page 50.
The Articles of Association of the Company further regulate the 
appointment and removal of Directors, as does the Companies Act 
2006 and related legislation. The Company’s Articles of Association  
may be amended by special resolution of the shareholders. The powers 
of the Directors are described in the Corporate Governance Report.
Qualifying third party indemnity
The Company has granted an indemnity in favour of its Directors  
and officers and those of its Group companies against the financial 
exposure that they may incur in the course of their professional duties 
as Directors and officers of the Company and/or its subsidiaries/
affiliates. The indemnity has been put in place in accordance with 
section 234 of the Companies Act 2006 in respect of which the 
Company took advice from Slaughter and May.

86 Audit and auditor
Each Director has, at the date of approval of this Report, formally 
confirmed that:
 − to the best of his/her knowledge there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
 − he/she has taken all the steps that they ought to have taken  
as a Director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditor  
is aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance  
with the provisions of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Deloitte LLP (Deloitte) have confirmed their willingness to continue  
in office as auditor of the Company. Following a review by the Audit 
Committee of their effectiveness, details of which are set out on page 
62, a resolution to re-appoint Deloitte will be proposed at the AGM.
It is the Company’s general policy that its auditors will not carry out 
non-audit services except where it is appropriate to do so and in 
accordance with the Company’s formal policy for the carrying out  
of such work. In addition, and in line with the Code, the Committee 
takes into account the relevant ethical guidance regarding the 
provision of non-audit services by the external auditor. The Company 
notes the consultation currently under way to consider designating 
further areas for which the auditor should not be allowed to provide 
non-audit services. Any revision to current regulations or guidelines 
which result, will be taken into account in framing the Company’s 
policy going forward and reported on in future Annual Reports. 
Deloitte provided non-audit services to the Group during the year 
within the policy framework as described in the Audit Committee 
Report, details of which are set out in Note 6 on page 110.
Basis of Accounting
The Company’s current basis of accounting is UKGAAP , which the 
Financial Reporting Council has announced is to change for reporting 
periods commencing on or after 1 January 2015. The Company has 
chosen FRS 101 as its basis of accounting going forward, and that 
will be adopted for reporting from 2015. Further details may be found 
in the Audit Committee Report on page 64.
FRS 101 paragraph 5(a) requires the Company to give its shareholders 
notice of the adoption of the new standard, and to proceed with the 
proposal provided that a shareholder or shareholders holding in 
aggregate 5% or more of the Company’s issued shares do not object 
to the proposal, which they may do in writing to the Company at its 
Registered Office by no later than 21 April 2015.
Annual General Meeting
The AGM will be held at 11:00 am on 23 April 2015 at The British

Formal notice of the AGM including details of special business is  
set out in the Notice of Meeting on pages 144 to 151 and on the 
Company’s website www.taylorwimpey.co.uk. In line with recent 
practice, voting on all resolutions at this year’s AGM will again be 
conducted by way of a poll as the Board believes this gives as many 
shareholders as possible the opportunity to have their votes counted, 
whether their votes are tendered by proxy in advance of, or in person 
at the AGM.
Web communication
With shareholders’ consent, the Company has adopted Web 
communication. The benefits of Web communication are that it:
 − enables the Company to significantly reduce its printing and 
postage costs;
 − enables shareholders to access information faster, on the day 
documents are published on the Company’s website; and
 − reduces the amount of resources consumed, such as paper,  
and lessens the impact of printing and mailing activities on  
the environment.
Shareholder communications (including the 2014 Annual Report and 
Accounts) are available electronically through the Company’s website.
The Company provides hard copy documentation to those  
shareholders who have requested this and is, of course, happy  
to meet any such requests.
Registrar
The Company’s registrar is Capita Asset Services. Their details,  
together with information on facilities available to shareholders,  
are set out in the Shareholder Facilities section on page 153.

Directors’ Report: Governance p44-91 Financial Statements p92-143 Shareholder Information p144-153 Strategic Report p2-43 The Company has two classes of shares: Ordinary Shares of 1p,  
each of which carries the right to one vote at general meetings of  
the Company and such other rights and obligations as are set out  
in the Company’s Articles of Association, and Deferred Shares  
which carry no voting rights.
As part of the debt restructuring announced on 21 April 2009 the 
Company issued Warrants to certain of its lenders giving the holders  
the right, up to 15 May 2014, to subscribe for up to an aggregate of 
approximately 58 million Ordinary Shares (representing approximately 
5% of the Company’s issued share capital at the time the Warrants  
were issued). The conversion entitlement ceased in full on 15 May 
2014, by which time approximately 57 million ordinary shares of 1p 
each had been issued on aggregate conversions since issue, at the 
conversion price of 17.4473 pence per Ordinary Share.
The authority given by shareholders at the AGM held on 17 April 2014 
for the Company to purchase a maximum of 325 million of its own 
shares remained valid at 31 December 2014. The authority was not 
exercised during 2014 or prior to the date of this Report. The Company 
has no current intention of exercising the authority but will nevertheless 
be seeking the usual renewal of this authority at the AGM and the 
Board will keep the position under regular review. The Company 
currently holds no shares in treasury.
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding, the exercise  
of voting rights, nor on the transfer of shares, which are governed by  
the Articles of Association and prevailing legislation. The Directors are 
not aware of any agreements between holders of the Company’s  
shares that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities  
or on voting rights.
Details of employee share schemes are set out in the Remuneration 
Report on page 71. The Employee Share Ownership Trusts generally 
abstain from voting in respect of shares held by them.
No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s share 
capital and all issued shares are fully paid.
Substantial interests
The persons set out in the table below have notified the Company 
pursuant to Rule 5.1 of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules

withdraw from the DRIP or the DRIP is suspended or terminated in 
accordance with the Terms and Conditions. The Board will keep the 
availability of the DRIP under regular review.
Your attention is drawn to important information which may 
require your action and which is included with regard to the 
operation of the DRIP on the 2014 Final Dividend and the  
2015 Special Dividend. Please refer to pages 148 to 149.
The right to receive any dividend has been waived in part by the 
Trustee of the Company’s Employee Share Ownership Trusts 
(ESOTs) over those Trusts’ combined holding of 13,056,005 shares. 
More details of these ESOTs are contained in Note 12 on pages 140 
and 141.
Research and development
During 2014 the Company continued to build its new standard  
house type range in significant numbers. This enabled us to validate  
the work that been undertaken in developing them. This is delivering  
the customer offering, urban design, cost and process benefits that  
had been targeted. Feedback from customers and our regional 
business units will be supported by new projects planned on Post-
Occupancy Evaluation. During 2015 we will be looking at how our 
homes may change in response to the Housing Standards review, 
particularly in respect of space and accessibility.
We continue to work with our supply chain to identify new products  
and techniques available to us and appraise them before they will be 
needed. We are beginning more focused research over the coming 
year into how we will meet the anticipated changes to Part L of the 
Building Regulations in 2016. As an adjunct to our research and 
development we continue to contribute to several industry working 
groups looking at energy efficiency, changes to building regulations 
and standards and how to close the gap between design and 
performance.

Taylor Wimpey plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2014
88 Taylor Wimpey sat on the Advisory Board of HOMBRE (Holistic 
Management of Brownfield Regeneration), a four year Seventh 
Framework EU funded research project looking at sustainable 
brownfield re-use. The project was completed in 2014.
The Company commissioned research work on ‘Carbon Futures’, 
looking into development scale whole life carbon assessment.
Taylor Wimpey also supported Newcastle University on their 
SUCCESS (Sustainable Urban Carbon Capture; Engineering Soils  
for Climate Change) proposal, which has now received funding.  
The Company will participate in this project to determine how  
carbon capture in engineered soils (e.g. land restoration) can  
be adopted from an operational perspective.
Employee involvement and communication
We are proud of how committed our employees are to Taylor Wimpey 
and the long term success of our business. We strive to listen to and 
engage with staff. During 2014, we undertook an employee 
engagement survey and the feedback from our employees is shaping 
our plans and priorities for the future. We believe that inviting and 
listening to employee feedback is essential and we will conduct 
employee surveys on an annual basis going forward. 
We have active employee consultation committees in our regional 
business units and communicate with employees via our half-yearly 
Teamtalk employee magazine and regular Teamtalk Express email 
newsletter. Our intranet includes a wide range of employee 
information from human resources policies to advice for employees 
on sustainable living. It also includes an ‘Open Door’ forum that puts 
employees directly in touch with our Chief Executive. During 2015  
we introduced a new customer services forum on our intranet and 
invited employees to voice their thoughts on key customer questions. 
Employees could post comments within the forum or send an email 
our Chief Executive or Customer Director.
The Company is committed to ensuring open and regular 
communication throughout the Group on both business-related  
issues and issues of general interest. There is a formal Employee 
Consultative Committee structure in place in all operations and  
elected representatives meet with management to consult on 
appropriate issues. Intranet systems are continually updated which 
provide a valuable communication tool across the Group and an 
important facility for providing employees with access to a wide  
range of information. Information is regularly cascaded throughout  
the Group via e-mail – including regular communications from the 
Chief Executive – and via verbal briefings and by management 
presentations. The Company’s internal magazine provides further 
communication.
The Company promotes share ownership as widely as possible.  
In addition to the various share-related reward plans described in  
the Remuneration Report on pages 66 to 85, the Company also 
offers a scheme whereby employees (i.e. generally those who do not 
participate in the Executive Incentive Scheme (cash bonus scheme))
are offered the opportunity each year to exchange part of any cash 
bonus for exceptional performance, into shares of the Company, 
offering a 20% enhancement to the value if taken entirely in shares 
with a holding period of 12 months. The scheme has operated since 
2012 and in 2014 resulted in 724,297 shares (2013: 697,185) being 
acquired by 326 employees (2013: 294).
In addition, the Company maintains all-employee share plans, 
including the Save As You Earn share option plan and the Share 
Incentive Plan (SIP), which are offered as widely as possible across 
the Group. Over half of our eligible employees participate in one or 
both plans or are otherwise already shareholders of the Company.
Equal opportunities
We strive to treat our employees fairly and with respect at all times. 
We have policies and processes in place to ensure that we act in 
accordance with our cultural values which encompass equal 
opportunities, anti-corruption and whistleblowing. We encourage our 
employees and subcontractors to speak up about concerns over any 
wrongdoing at work and provide access to an independent reporting 
hotline service.
We remain committed to the belief that embracing diversity and 
inclusion will enable Taylor Wimpey to succeed through a workforce 
that is creative and innovative. We continue to actively embrace the 
business and local communities in which we operate and will strive  
to reflect their richness and character to include such aspects as 
gender, race and religion but also diversity of thought, background 
and experience.
As set out in our Diversity Policy, we remain committed to equality  
of opportunity in all of our employment practices, policies and 
procedures across the Group. To this end, within the framework  
of applicable law, we are committed, wherever practicable, to 
achieving and maintaining a workforce which broadly reflects that  
of the local catchment area within which we operate.
No employee or potential employee will receive less favourable 
treatment due to their race, creed, colour, nationality, ethnic  
origin, religion, political or other opinion, affiliation, gender, sexual 
orientation, marital status, family connections, age, membership  
or non-membership of a trade union, or disability, unless justifiable  
in exceptional circumstances, for example due to health and safety 
considerations particularly on construction sites. Instruction on equal 
opportunities is part of the induction programme and diversity is also 
promoted through awareness training locally and by its inclusion as  
a business priority at strategy presentations around the business.

Directors’ Report: Governance p44-91 Financial Statements p92-143 Shareholder Information p144-153 Strategic Report p2-43 Employment of people with disabilities
It is our policy that people with disabilities should have fair 
consideration for all vacancies within the Group.
The Company is therefore committed, where possible, to ensuring  
that people with disabilities are supported and encouraged to apply  
for employment and to achieve progress once employed. They  
will be treated so as to ensure that they have an equal opportunity  
to be selected, trained and promoted. In addition, every reasonable 
effort is made for disabled persons to be retained in the employment  
of the Group by investigating the possibility of making reasonable 
adjustments to the job, workplace or equipment.
Charitable donations
The Company has a Charity Committee, which operates within  
written terms of reference and charitable guidelines approved by the 
Board. The Committee’s aims are to monitor and review charitable 
donations made by regional businesses as against the guidelines and  
to assess and administer larger donations centrally. The members of  
the Committee are the Chief Executive (Chairman), Group HR 
Director, Group Legal Director and Company Secretary, UK Land and 
Planning Director, Group Financial Controller, Head of Marketing, and 
Head of Investor Relations. The Company and the Committee 
encourage non-financial contributions also and for employees to 
participate in charitable causes.
During the year, Group companies donated £272,790 (2013: £255,000) 
to various charities in the UK. In addition, many employees at all levels 
around the country gave up their work and free time to participate  
in overnight sleep-outs and weekend trekking to generate additional 
sponsorship and fundraising for charitable causes including Centrepoint; 
Motor Neurone Research; and The Youth Adventure Trust.
Further information on the Group’s donations, activities and initiatives 
can be found in the Sustainability Report 2014 which is available on 
the Company’s website: www.taylorwimpey.co.uk/corporate/
sustainability
Political donations
The Company has a policy of not making donations to political 
parties,and has not made any this year and neither does it intend  
to make any going forward. The Company does support certain 
industry-wide organisations which directly assist the housebuilding 
industry such as the Home Builders Federation and the Confederation 
of British Industry (CBI). Whilst we do not regard this support as 
political in nature in any way, the Companies Act 2006 definition of 
‘political organisations’ and related terms is very wide and in certain 
circumstances a donation or a subscription to such organisations  
or to charities could retrospectively be categorised as a political 
donation in the eyes of the law. Accordingly, as a matter of prudency, 
the Company will be seeking the usual annual dispensation from its 
shareholders at the 2015 AGM so as to be able to continue with the 
above memberships and make charitable donations without 
inadvertently breaching legislation.
Agreements
Apart from a small number of borrowing agreements, pursuant to  
which the Company borrows or is able to borrow money, which could 
potentially be terminated by the other party upon a change of control 
of the Company, there are no significant contracts or agreements 
which take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of  
the Company. 
Important events since the year end
There have been no important events affecting the Company or any  
of its subsidiary undertakings since 31 December 2014.
Directors’ responsibilities statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
Accounts in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to 
prepare the Group Financial Statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected 
to prepare the Parent Company financial statements in accordance 
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company 
law the Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.
In preparing the Parent Company financial statements, the Directors  
are required to:
 − select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
 − make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
 − state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
 − prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis  
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting 
Standard 1 requires that Directors:
 − properly select and apply accounting policies;
 − present information, including accounting policies, in a manner  
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information;
 − provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions 
on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
 − make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue  
as a going concern.

records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection  
of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of  
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s  
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation  
in other jurisdictions.
In accordance with Provision C.1 of the Code, the Directors are 
required, inter alia, to ensure that the Annual Report and Accounts 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess  
the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
Details of how this was addressed are set out in the Audit Committee 
Report on page 64.
Responsibility statement
The Directors confirm that to the best of their knowledge:
 − the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant 
financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole;
 − the strategic report includes a fair review of the development  
and performance of the business and the position of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face; and
 − the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced 
and understandable and provide the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy.

Opinion on financial statements of Taylor Wimpey plc 
In our opinion: 
 the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 
2014 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
 the Group financial statements have been properly prepared  
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union; 
 the Parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practices; and 
 the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with  
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
The financial statements comprise the Consolidated Income 
Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive  
Income, the Consolidated and Parent Company Balance Sheets,  
the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated 
Cash Flow Statement and the related Notes 1 to 33 and 1 to 16.  
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the Group Financial Statements is applicable law 
and IFRSs, as adopted by the European Union. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation 
of the Parent Company Financial Statements is applicable law and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice). 
Going concern 
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ 
statement on page 65 that the Group is a going concern.  
We confirm that: 
 we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going  
concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the  
financial statements is appropriate; and 
 we have not identified any material uncertainties that may 
cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as 
a going concern. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s  
ability to continue as a going concern. 
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement 
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below  
are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy,  
the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts  
of the engagement team. 
As part of our audit of the Group, in addition to substantive tests, 
we also test the design and implementation of internal controls over 
financial reporting in each of the risk areas. In addition we also tested 
the operating effectiveness of these controls in relation to the first risk 
presented in the table below: inventory costing.  
 
Risk  How the scope of our audit responded to the risk 
Inventory costing 
We consider the appropriate recognition of costs into inventory and the 
allocation of these between different sites, phases and plots, including 
shared costs such as land and infrastructure to be a significant risk.  
These affect the appropriateness of the margin recognised on each legal 
completion which directly impacts the level of profit that is recorded on 
each plot. The accounting policy that relates to this risk is on page 103. 
 
We tested a sample of sites as part of our visit to business units. This
included testing the allocation of costs across sites with multiple phases 
to determine that the transfer of these costs was appropriate. We 
also tested that shared costs were allocated across phases and plots 
appropriately by assessing the reasonableness of the methodology 
used and we independently recalculated this.  
We tested the operating effectiveness of controls over this area in relation 
to the movement of costs across different phases and sites. 
For a sample of individual plots, we tested additions to the inventory 
balance to determine whether the costs have been appropriately 
capitalised, by tracing these additions to supporting supplier invoices. 
We also tested a sample of journals adding to the inventory balance 
to highlight any costs that should have been expensed.

Risk  How the scope of our audit responded to the risk 
Carrying value of inventory 
The value for inventory as at 31 December 2014 is £3,490.1 million 
(2013: £2,928.8 million) and as such is the most significant value on 
the Balance Sheet (page 99). 
The carrying value of inventory at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value is dependent on key judgements and estimates that are made by 
management. During the year the Group recorded net exceptional income 
of £18.7 million (2013: £45.6m) in relation to the write-back of inventory 
which was written down in value in previous years due to the deterioration 
of wider market conditions and other site specific factors.  
The judgements relating to inventory include an estimation of future 
expected average sales prices and costs. These judgements also 
include consideration of site specific factors and the developments 
that individual locations have seen throughout the year. The accounting 
policy in relation to inventory is on page 105 and this is highlighted as 
a critical accounting judgement by management and the Audit 
Committee on page 106 and 64 respectively. 
 
 
Management conduct a detailed exercise in the assessment of the carrying 
value of sites. We performed testing on the model completed as part of this 
and critically assessed the judgements and estimates that had been made 
within this. This work included: 
 Reviewing the accuracy of the calculations within the model and 
identification of any anomalies in inputs; 
 Performing a sensitivity analysis on the key judgements relating to 
the future expected sales price and costs; 
 Assessing the estimated future sales prices used by management 
by testing the historical sales prices that have been achieved and 
independent forecasts of anticipated future movements; 
 Testing a sample of inputs into the management prepared model by 
reference to internal site specific information such as the costs incurred to 
date and the estimation of costs required to complete the sites; 
 As part of the audit we visit units throughout the business and we tested 
the specific movements and accounting entries made in 
relation to these sites;  
 Obtaining evidence to support the current status of a sample of sites and 
that the site specific developments at each site are reflected in 
the valuation; and 
 For sites where the value has been written back we have obtained the 
specific calculation prepared by management, corroborated the inputs 
that have led to the write-back and recalculated the value that should 
have been recorded as income. 
Defined benefit pension scheme accounting 
The total value of the defined benefit pension scheme at the balance 
sheet date is a liability of £182.4 million (2013: £182.2 million) 
(page 127) and the liabilities specifically are valued at £2,186.2 million 
(2013: £2,035.2 million) (page 127). 
Accounting for a defined benefit pension scheme and the value of liabilities 
is dependent on significant assumptions, including an assessment of the 
discount rate, price inflation and key demographic figures including life 
expectancy and mortality rates. 
These accounting judgements are inherently complex and require a high 
level of management judgement and specialist input by an actuary in the 
calculation of the value of the liabilities. 
The accounting policy in relation to the accounting for employee benefits 
is on page 106. Both management and the Audit Committee assess this 
to be a critical accounting judgement as detailed on page 106 and 64 
respectively.  
We assessed the competence, capabilities and objectivity of the qualified 
independent actuary engaged by the Group and the use of this expert 
by management to perform the valuation of the scheme’s liabilities. 
We engaged our internal actuarial specialists to assess the appropriateness 
of the methodology and assumptions used to account for the defined 
benefit scheme. This included comparison of key data with market 
benchmarks and to challenge the methodology used by the scheme 
actuary. We considered whether each of the key assumptions was 
reasonable in isolation and collectively in determining the pension 
liability at the balance sheet date.  
Revenue recognition 
We consider there to be a risk in the revenue recognised in relation to 
social housing. Different sources of revenue have different accounting 
policies (see page 102) and management have highlighted the revenue 
recognised in relation to social housing as an area of increased judgement 
on page 106. The assessment of this risk by the Audit Committee is on 
page 64.This is because elements of the social housing revenue is 
accounted for on the basis of long term contract accounting.  
This accounting requires management judgement to determine the 
appropriateness of calculating the revenue and profit to be recognised. 
This includes estimating the total expected costs to complete each site, 
the future profitability of the site and also the percentage of completion 
at the balance sheet date. These judgements directly influence revenue 
that can be recognised in relation to social housing. 
 
We conducted testing in relation to the revenue recognised for social 
housing revenue. This testing involved both test of details and analytical 
procedures.  
For a sample of contracts the following procedures were performed: 
 We tested the level of costs that have been recognised in relation 
to the site and obtained the certification for the works that have 
been completed; 
 Assessed the judgements in relation to the future profitability of 
the site with reference to the site budget; and 
 Recalculated the value that should be recognised at the balance 
sheet date based on the percentage completion. 
In addition we developed an expectation of the income that should be 
recognised in the year from this revenue stream with reference to the 
completion of plots across sites.

of wider market conditions and other site specific factors.  
The judgements relating to inventory include an estimation of future 
expected average sales prices and costs. These judgements also 
include consideration of site specific factors and the developments 
that individual locations have seen throughout the year. The accounting 
policy in relation to inventory is on page 105 and this is highlighted as 
a critical accounting judgement by management and the Audit 
Committee on page 106 and 64 respectively. 
 
 
Management conduct a detailed exercise in the assessment of the carrying 
value of sites. We performed testing on the model completed as part of this 
and critically assessed the judgements and estimates that had been made 
within this. This work included: 
 Reviewing the accuracy of the calculations within the model and 
identification of any anomalies in inputs; 
 Performing a sensitivity analysis on the key judgements relating to 
the future expected sales price and costs; 
 Assessing the estimated future sales prices used by management 
by testing the historical sales prices that have been achieved and 
independent forecasts of anticipated future movements; 
 Testing a sample of inputs into the management prepared model by 
reference to internal site specific information such as the costs incurred to 
date and the estimation of costs required to complete the sites; 
 As part of the audit we visit units throughout the business and we tested 
the specific movements and accounting entries made in 
relation to these sites;  
 Obtaining evidence to support the current status of a sample of sites and 
that the site specific developments at each site are reflected in 
the valuation; and 
 For sites where the value has been written back we have obtained the 
specific calculation prepared by management, corroborated the inputs 
that have led to the write-back and recalculated the value that should 
have been recorded as income. 
Defined benefit pension scheme accounting 
The total value of the defined benefit pension scheme at the balance 
sheet date is a liability of £182.4 million (2013: £182.2 million) 
(page 127) and the liabilities specifically are valued at £2,186.2 million 
(2013: £2,035.2 million) (page 127). 
Accounting for a defined benefit pension scheme and the value of liabilities 
is dependent on significant assumptions, including an assessment of the 
discount rate, price inflation and key demographic figures including life 
expectancy and mortality rates. 
These accounting judgements are inherently complex and require a high 
level of management judgement and specialist input by an actuary in the 
calculation of the value of the liabilities. 
The accounting policy in relation to the accounting for employee benefits 
is on page 106. Both management and the Audit Committee assess this 
to be a critical accounting judgement as detailed on page 106 and 64 
respectively.  
We assessed the competence, capabilities and objectivity of the qualified 
independent actuary engaged by the Group and the use of this expert 
by management to perform the valuation of the scheme’s liabilities. 
We engaged our internal actuarial specialists to assess the appropriateness 
of the methodology and assumptions used to account for the defined 
benefit scheme. This included comparison of key data with market 
benchmarks and to challenge the methodology used by the scheme 
actuary. We considered whether each of the key assumptions was 
reasonable in isolation and collectively in determining the pension 
liability at the balance sheet date.  
Revenue recognition 
We consider there to be a risk in the revenue recognised in relation to 
social housing. Different sources of revenue have different accounting 
policies (see page 102) and management have highlighted the revenue 
recognised in relation to social housing as an area of increased judgement 
on page 106. The assessment of this risk by the Audit Committee is on 
page 64.This is because elements of the social housing revenue is 
accounted for on the basis of long term contract accounting.  
This accounting requires management judgement to determine the 
appropriateness of calculating the revenue and profit to be recognised. 
This includes estimating the total expected costs to complete each site, 
the future profitability of the site and also the percentage of completion 
at the balance sheet date. These judgements directly influence revenue 
that can be recognised in relation to social housing. 
 
We conducted testing in relation to the revenue recognised for social 
housing revenue. This testing involved both test of details and analytical 
procedures.  
For a sample of contracts the following procedures were performed: 
 We tested the level of costs that have been recognised in relation 
to the site and obtained the certification for the works that have 
been completed; 
 Assessed the judgements in relation to the future profitability of 
the site with reference to the site budget; and 
 Recalculated the value that should be recognised at the balance 
sheet date based on the percentage completion. 
In addition we developed an expectation of the income that should be 
recognised in the year from this revenue stream with reference to the 
completion of plots across sites.

Our assessment of risks of material misstatement continued 
These risks remain consistent with the prior period with the exception 
of the implementation of the new business system. We no longer 
consider this to have a significant impact on the financial statements 
as the system has been fully implemented across all business units. 
The description of the risks above should be read in conjunction with 
the significant issues considered by the Audit Committee discussed 
on page 64. The accounting policies and critical judgements that form 
part of these risks can be found in Note 1 and 2 respectively. 
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the 
context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and not 
to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our 
opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect to 
any of the risks described above, and we do not express an opinion 
on these individual matters. 
Our application of materiality 
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial 
statements that make it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. 
We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and 
in evaluating the results of our work. 
We determined materiality for the Group to be £22.5 million  
(2013: £20.0 million), which is calculated based on 5% (2013: 7.5%) 
of pre-tax profit for the year excluding exceptional items of £450.1 
million on page 97. The exceptional income is excluded as this directly 
relates to the write-back of the value of inventory rather than the core 
business of the sale of properties. This basis has been chosen as this 
is the measure by which stakeholders and the market assess the 
wider performance of the entity.  
We have reduced the percentage basis for the calculation of 
materiality from 7.5% to 5%. The continued improvement in the wider 
economic environment and the impact on the profitability of the Group 
means that, in our judgement, a level of 5%, is more appropriate.  
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the 
Committee all audit differences in excess of £0.45 million (2013: 
£0.4 million), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our 
view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report 
to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified 
when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
An overview of the scope of our audit  
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the 
Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and 
assessing the risks of material misstatements at the Group level. 
Based on that assessment, we focused our Group audit scope 
primarily on the audit work at the UK Housing division (excluding 
joint ventures) which represents the principal segment within the 
Group and accounts for 98% (2013: 98%) of the Group’s net 
operating assets, 99% (2013: 99%) of the Group’s revenue 
and 99% (2013: 99%) of the Group’s profit on ordinary activities 
before exceptional income. 
We audit all of the Group’s UK subsidiaries, which are subject  
to audit at statutory materiality level, which in most cases is 
substantially lower than Group materiality. This is performed 
subsequent to the audit of the Group accounts. 
For the Spanish operations, component auditors report to us  
on the risk in relation to the carrying value of the inventory located  
in Spain. This was based on our assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement and of the materiality of the Group’s operations  
within Spain. 
For joint ventures specified audit procedures are conducted by the UK 
team. This is based on our assessment of risk within these entities.  
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process  
and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion  
that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of 
the aggregated financial information of the remaining components 
not subject to audit or audit of specified account balances. 
The audit is performed centrally and includes all of the regional 
business units within the Group’s UK Housing division. We choose 
to visit a sample of regional business units selected on a rotational 
basis and with reference to size and complexity among other factors. 
In addition we also visit other business units throughout the entity 
which are chosen on a random basis. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
 the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and 
 the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception  
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records

from branches not visited by us; or 
 the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with

1. Significant accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on 
a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention 
except as otherwise stated below. 
The principal accounting policies adopted, which have been 
applied consistently, except as otherwise stated, are set out below. 
Going concern 
The Group has prepared forecasts, including certain sensitivities taking 
into account the principal risks identified on pages 28 to 29. Having 
considered these forecasts, the Directors remain of the view that 
the Group’s financing arrangements and capital structure provide 
both the necessary facilities and covenant headroom to enable the 
Group to conduct its business for at least the next 12 months. 
Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared on a going concern basis. 
Basis of accounting 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). 
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance 
with IFRS adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group 
financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. 
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial 
statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company 
(its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control is 
achieved where the Company has the power to direct the relevant 
activities of an investee entity and obtain variable returns from its 
activities. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are 
currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing 
whether the Group controls another entity. 
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities  
of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of 
acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair 
values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as 
goodwill. Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair 
values of the identifiable net assets acquired (i.e. discount on 
acquisition) is credited to the income statement in the period of 
acquisition. The interest of non-controlling shareholders is stated 
at the non-controlling interest’s proportion of the fair values of the 
assets and liabilities recognised. Subsequently, all comprehensive 
income is attributed to the owners and the non-controlling interests, 
which may result in the non-controlling interest having a debit balance.  
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the  
year are included in the Consolidated Income Statement from the 
effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, 
as appropriate. Where a subsidiary is disposed of which constituted 
a major line of business, it is disclosed as a discontinued operation. 
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements  
of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with 
those used by the Group. All intra-Group transactions, balances, 
income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.  
Joint ventures 
Undertakings are deemed to be a joint venture when the Group  
has joint control of the rights and assets of the undertaking via either 
voting rights or a formal agreement which includes that unanimous 
consent is required for strategic, financial and operating decisions. 
Joint ventures are consolidated under the equity accounting method. 
On transfer of land and/or work in progress to joint ventures, the 
Group recognises only its share of any profits or losses.  
Joint operations arise where the Group has joint control of an 
operation, but has rights to only its own assets and obligations related 
to the operation. These assets and obligations, and the Group’s 
share of revenues and costs, are included in the Group’s results. 
Segmental reporting 
The Group is divided into two operating divisions for management 
reporting and control: 
 Housing United Kingdom 
 Housing Spain 
Revenue 
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received  
or receivable, net of value added tax, rebates and discounts and 
after eliminating sales within the Group. Revenue and profit are 
recognised as follows: 
(a) Private housing development properties and land sales 
Revenue is recognised in the income statement when the significant 
risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the 
purchaser. Revenue in respect of the sale of residential properties 
is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable on legal completion. 
(b) Part exchange 
In certain instances, property may be accepted in part consideration  
for a sale of a residential property. The fair value is established by 
independent surveyors, reduced for cost to sell. Net proceeds 
generated from the subsequent sale of part exchange properties 
are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales.  
The original sale is recorded in the normal way, with the fair value 
of the exchanged property replacing cash receipts. 
(c)  Cash incentives 
Cash incentives are considered to be a discount from the purchase 
price offered to the acquirer and are therefore accounted for as 
a reduction to revenue. 
(d) Contracting work and social housing contracts  
Where the outcome of a long term contract can be estimated  
reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage  
of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date.  
This is normally measured by surveys of work performed to date. 
Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are 
included to the extent that it is probable that they will result in  
revenue and they are capable of being reliably measured.

1. Significant accounting policies continued 
Where the outcome of a long term contract cannot be estimated 
reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract 
costs incurred that it is probable will be recoverable. Contract costs 
are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. 
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract 
revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.  
Cost of sales 
The Group determines the value of inventory charged to cost of sales 
based on the total budgeted cost of developing a site. Once the total 
expected costs of development are established they are allocated 
to individual plots to achieve a standard build cost per plot. 
To the extent that additional costs or savings are identified as the 
site progresses, these are recognised over the remaining plots 
unless they are specific to a particular plot, in which case they 
are recognised in the income statement at the point of sale. 
Positive contribution 
The positive contribution presented on the face of the Income 
Statement represents the amount of previous write-down allocated 
to inventory on a plot that has resulted in the gross profit achieved 
on completion. This is due to the combination of selling prices 
and costs, or product mix improvements exceeding our market 
assumptions in the previous net realisable value (NRV) exercise. 
These amounts are stated before the allocation of overheads 
excluded from the Group’s net realisable value exercise. 
Exceptional items 
Exceptional items are defined as items of income or expenditure 
which, in the opinion of the Directors, are material and unusual in 
nature or of such significance that they require separate disclosure  
on the face of the income statement in accordance with IAS 1 
‘Presentation of Financial Statements’. 
Interest receivable 
Interest income on bank deposits is recognised on an accruals basis. 
Also included in interest receivable are interest and interest-related 
payments the Group receives on other receivables.  
Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs are recognised on an accruals basis and are payable 
on the Group’s borrowings. Also included in borrowing costs is the 
amortisation of fees associated with the arrangement of the financing. 
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or 
redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals 
basis to the income statement using the effective interest method 
and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the 
extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise. 
Capitalised finance costs are held in other debtors and amortised 
over the period of the facility. 
Foreign currencies 
The individual financial statements of each Group company are 
presented in the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which it operates (its functional currency). Transactions in 
currencies other than the functional currency are recorded at 
the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. 
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are 
denominated in foreign currencies other than the functional currency 
are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.  
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing 
at the date when the fair value was determined. Gains and losses 
arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period. 
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas 
operation are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the 
balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated 
at an appropriate average rate for the year. Exchange differences 
arising are recognised within other comprehensive income and 
transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation 
differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the 
period in which the operation is disposed of. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of  
a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign  
entity and translated at the closing rate. The Group enters into forward 
contracts in order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange 
transaction risks relating to the functional currency in accordance with 
Group policy. It also uses foreign currency borrowings and derivatives 
to hedge its net investment exposure to certain overseas subsidiaries 
(see page 105 for details of the Group’s accounting policies in respect 
of such derivative financial instruments). 
Operating leases 
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income 
on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Benefits 
received and receivable (and costs paid and payable) as an incentive 
to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line 
basis over the lease term. 
Intangible assets 
Brands 
Internally generated brands are not capitalised. Acquired brands are 
capitalised. Their values are calculated based on the Group’s valuation 
methodology, which is based on valuations of discounted cash flows. 
Brands are stated at cost, less accumulated amortisation and any 
accumulated impairment losses. 
Software development costs  
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable 
and unique software controlled by the Group, and that generate 
economic benefits beyond one year, are recognised as intangible 
assets. Computer software development costs recognised as 
assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over three to five 
years from the time of implementation, and are stated at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.

1. Significant accounting policies continued 
Property, plant and equipment 
Land and buildings held for use in the production or supply of goods 
or services, or for administrative purposes, are stated in the balance 
sheet at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated 
impairment losses. Freehold land is not depreciated. Buildings are 
depreciated over 50 years. 
Plant and equipment is stated at cost less depreciation.  
Depreciation is charged so as to expense the cost or valuation 
of assets over their estimated useful lives. Other assets are 
depreciated using the straight-line method, on the following bases: 
 Plant and equipment 20-25% per annum; 
 Computer equipment 33% per annum; and 
 Leasehold improvements over the term of the lease. 
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset 
is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds, less 
any selling expenses, and the carrying amount of the asset. This 
difference is recognised in the income statement.  
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets  
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts 
of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is 
any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. 
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset 
is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment 
loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are 
independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and 
value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
are discounted to their present value, using a pre-tax discount rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future 
cash flows have not been adjusted. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than  
its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced 
to its recoverable amount. If the recoverable amount of a cash-
generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, 
impairment losses are allocated first to the intangible assets in the 
cash-generating unit.  
If the full impairment of intangible assets is not sufficient to reduce 
the carrying value of the cash-generating unit to its recoverable 
amount, tangible fixed assets must then be impaired. If the 
recoverable amount of tangible fixed assets exceeds their carrying 
value, no further impairment is required. An impairment loss is 
recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset 
is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss 
is treated as a revaluation decrease to the extent that previous 
revaluations have increased the value of the asset. 
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying  
amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying 
amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or 
cash-generating unit in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is 
recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried 
at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment 
loss is treated as a revaluation increase. 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s 
balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. 
Trade receivables and other receivables 
Trade receivables on normal terms excluding derivative financial 
instruments do not carry any interest and are stated at their 
nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated 
unrecoverable amounts. Trade receivables on extended terms, 
particularly in respect of land, are measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method, less any impairment. Interest income 
is recognised by applying the effective interest rate. Derivative 
financial instruments are measured at fair value. 
Mortgage receivables 
Mortgage receivables relate to sales incentives including shared  
equity loans. The receivable is recorded at amortised cost.  
Shared equity loans are separated into a loan receivable and a  
non-closely related embedded derivative asset for accounting 
purposes as allowed under IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments’. The 
loan is measured at amortised cost and the embedded derivative 
is measured at fair value through profit or loss with any subsequent 
impairment charged through profit and loss. The fair value of the 
derivative is based on a national house price index.  
Financial liabilities and equity instruments 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according  
to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.  
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual  
interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded as the 
proceeds are received, net of direct issue costs. 
Borrowings 
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded as the 
proceeds are received, net of direct issue costs.  
Trade payables 
Trade payables on normal terms are not interest-bearing and are 
stated at their nominal value. Trade payables on extended terms, 
particularly in respect of land, are recorded at their fair value at the  
date of acquisition of the asset to which they relate. The discount  
to nominal value is amortised over the period of the credit term and 
charged to finance costs.

derivative is based on a national house price index.  
Financial liabilities and equity instruments 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according  
to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.  
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual  
interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded as the 
proceeds are received, net of direct issue costs. 
Borrowings 
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded as the 
proceeds are received, net of direct issue costs.  
Trade payables 
Trade payables on normal terms are not interest-bearing and are 
stated at their nominal value. Trade payables on extended terms, 
particularly in respect of land, are recorded at their fair value at the  
date of acquisition of the asset to which they relate. The discount  
to nominal value is amortised over the period of the credit term and 
charged to finance costs.

1. Significant accounting policies continued  
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting 
The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge transactions 
denominated in foreign currencies. The Group also uses foreign 
currency borrowings and derivatives to hedge its net investment 
exposure to movements in exchange rates on translation of certain 
individual financial statements denominated in foreign currencies other 
than Sterling which is the functional currency of the Parent Company. 
Interest rate derivatives are used to manage interest rate risk in 
respect of borrowings. The Group does not use derivative financial 
instruments for speculative purposes. 
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value. Changes 
in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated 
and effective as hedges of net investments in foreign operations 
are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the 
ineffective portion, if any, is recognised immediately in the 
Consolidated Income Statement.  
For an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in fair value,  
the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable 
to the risk being hedged with the corresponding entry in the 
Consolidated Income Statement. Gains or losses from remeasuring 
the derivative, or for non-derivatives the foreign currency component 
of its carrying amount, are also recognised in the income statement. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that 
do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income 
statement as they arise. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument 
expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for 
hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the 
hedging instrument recognised in other comprehensive income 
is retained in accumulated other comprehensive income until the 
forecasted transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in 
accumulated other comprehensive income is transferred to the 
income statement for the period. If a derivative financial instrument 
does not meet the specific criteria of IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments’ for 
hedge accounting it is presented as a held for trading asset or liability. 
Customer deposits 
Customer deposits are recorded as a liability within ‘other payables’  
on receipt and released to the income statement as revenue upon 
legal completion. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation  
as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be 
required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the 
Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the 
obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to present 
value where the effect is material. 
Inventories 
Inventories are initially stated at cost or at the fair value at acquisition 
date when acquired as part of a business combination and then 
held at the lower of this initial amount and net realisable value. 
Costs comprise direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour 
costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the 
inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable 
value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs 
of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and 
distribution. Land is recognised in inventory when the significant 
risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the Group. 
Non-refundable land option payments are initially recognised in 
inventory. They are reviewed regularly and written off to the income 
statement when it is probable that they will not be exercised. 
Taxation 
The tax charge represents the sum of the tax currently payable  
and deferred tax. 
Current tax  
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. 
Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are 
taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that 
are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax 
is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax  
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on 
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in 
the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the 
computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance 
sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised 
for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits 
will be available against which deductible temporary differences 
can be utilised. 
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary 
difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other 
than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a 
transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit. 
Deferred tax liabilities are also recognised for taxable temporary 
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint 
ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the 
temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis using the 
tax rates and laws that have then been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance 
sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset 
to be recovered. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income 
statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly 
to other comprehensive income or equity, in which case the deferred 
tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income or equity.

1. Significant accounting policies continued  
Share-based payments 
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 ‘Share-based 
payments’. The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments  
to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments 
are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value is 
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based 
on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest after 
adjusting for the effect of non-market vesting conditions. 
Employee benefits 
The Group accounts for pensions and similar benefits under  
IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’ (amended 2011). In respect of defined 
benefit plans, a finance charge is determined on the net defined 
benefit pension liability. The operating and financing costs of  
such plans are recognised separately in the income statement;  
service costs are spread systematically over the lives of employees; 
and certain liability management costs and financing costs are 
recognised in the periods in which they arise. Actuarial gains and 
losses are recognised immediately in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income. 
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an 
expense as they fall due. 
2. Key sources of estimation uncertainty and critical  
accounting judgements 
Estimation of revenue recognised  
In order to determine the profit that the Group is able to recognise  
on the proportion of completions in respect of social housing 
contracts for the period, internal site valuations are carried out 
for each development at regular intervals throughout the year. 
This is to ensure any funding advances are only recognised 
as revenue when the work has been completed including 
the appropriate allocation of infrastructure. 
The valuations include an estimation of the costs to complete 
and remaining revenues which may differ from the actual costs 
incurred and revenues received on completion. 
Carrying value of inventory 
In order to assess the appropriateness of the carrying value of 
inventory, the Group is required to make estimations of sales prices, 
costs and margins expected on sites in order to determine whether 
any write-downs or reversals are required to ensure inventory is 
stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.  
Following previous significant impairments of inventories, the Group 
has again undertaken a detailed review on a site-by-site basis of 
the net realisable value of its land and work in progress. The net 
realisable value exercise is highly sensitive to the assumptions 
used and we therefore also consider when the inventory is likely 
to be realised, whether or not there has been a sustained change 
in market conditions that previously caused the inventory to be 
written down and the wider economic environment existing at 
the balance sheet date.  
The Group has reversed a net £18.7 million of inventory write-downs 
in the year. This consists of a UK reversal of £27.0 million and further 
write-downs of £8.3 million. See Note 15. 
Employee benefits 
The value of plan assets and liabilities is determined on various long 
term actuarial assumptions, including future rates of inflation, growth, 
yields, returns on investments and mortality rates. Changes in these 
assumptions over time and differences to the actual outcome will be 
reflected in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Note 21 details 
the main assumptions in accounting for the Group’s defined benefit 
pension schemes. 
Tax and deferred tax  
Aspects of tax accounting require management judgement and 
interpretation of tax legislation across many jurisdictions, in some 
cases relating to items which may not be resolved with the relevant  
tax authority for many years. 
In determining the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets, 
management is required to assess the timing of the utilisation of 
provisions for tax purposes and whether it is probable that sufficient 
taxable profits will be available to enable the asset to be recovered. 
Adoption of new and revised standards and interpretations  
The following new standards, amendments to standards or 
interpretations have been adopted by the European Union and  
are mandatory for the first time for the year ending on or after  
1 January 2014. 
IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’ – this standard 
establishes a single, control-based model for assessing control 
and determining the scope of consolidated entities. It replaced 
the corresponding requirements of both IAS 27 ‘Consolidation 
and Separate Financial Statements’ and SIC – 12 ‘Consolidation – 
Special Purpose Entities’. IFRS 10 does not alter the basic principles 
of consolidation; however, it does introduce a new concept of how 
control should be assessed, focusing on the ability to direct the 
activities that most affect returns. IFRS 10 also provides clarity on 
areas which were previously unclear under IAS 27 and SIC-12. 
IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ – this standard has replaced IAS 
31 ‘Interests in Joint Ventures’. The most significant change to 
accounting for joint arrangements will be as a result of the change 
to the definition of control required by IFRS 10 meaning entities 
may require accounting for in line with IFRS 11 which were 
previously outside the scope. 
IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities’ – the objective of 
this standard is to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate 
an entity’s interest in other entities through requiring the disclosure 
of the nature and risks associated with the interests in other entities 
and how those interests affect the entity’s financial position, financial 
performance and cash flows. 
The Group has reviewed all significant joint venture arrangements 
to establish whether the change of the definition of control under 
IFRS 10 has affected how the entity should be accounted for in  
the consolidated financial statements or if the arrangement now  
falls within the scope of IFRS 11. There are no material adjustments 
required to the consolidated financial statements as a result of these 
new standards.

2. Key sources of estimation uncertainty and critical  
accounting judgements continued 
The following new and revised standards and interpretations  
have also been adopted in the current year. Their adoption has 
not had any significant impact on the amounts reported in these 
financial statements but may affect the accounting for future 
transactions and arrangements: 
 Amendment to IAS 32 ‘Financial instruments: presentation’,  
on offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities; 
 Amendments to IAS 36 ‘Impairment of assets’; 
 Amendment to IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments: Recognition  
and measurement’, on novation of derivatives and hedge 
accounting; and 
 IFRIC 21 ‘Levies’. 
Standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective 
or requiring mandatory adoption 
At the date of publishing these financial statements the following 
new and revised standards and interpretations were in issue but 
were not yet effective or requiring mandatory adoption (and in 
some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU).  
None of these new and revised standards and interpretations 
have been adopted early by the Group: 
 Amendment to IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’ regarding defined  
benefit plans; 
 Annual improvements to IFRS 2010-2012 cycle; 
 Annual improvements to IFRS 2011-2013 cycle; 
 Annual improvements to IFRS 2012-2014 cycle; 
 Amendment to IFRS 11 ‘Joint arrangements’ on acquisition 
of an interest in a joint operation; 
 Amendment to IAS 16 ‘Property, plant and equipment’ and 
IAS 38, ‘Intangible assets’ on depreciation and amortisation; 
 IFRS 14 ‘Regulatory deferral accounts’; 
 Amendments to IAS 27 ‘Separate financial statements’  
on the equity method; and 
 Amendments to IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’ 
and IAS 28 ‘Investments in associates and joint ventures’. 
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed 
above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the 
Group in future periods. 
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ is effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 (subject to 
EU endorsement). IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’, with associated 
amendments, is effective for annual periods beginning on or after  
1 January 2018 (subject to EU endorsement). The Group has begun, 
but not yet completed, its assessment of the potential impacts of 
these two standards. This assessment will be completed well ahead 
of the EU endorsed implementation dates so any impacts can be 
understood prior to adoption.

Closing deferred tax on UK temporary differences has been calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply for the period when  
the asset is realised or the liability is settled. Accordingly, the majority of the temporary differences have been calculated at the rate of 20% 
(2013: 20%), the rate effective from 1 April 2015 and substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The effect of the reduction 
in the UK corporation tax rate from 23% to 20% is nil (2013: £28.3 million reduction in deferred tax asset).

The Group has not recognised temporary differences relating to tax losses carried forward and other temporary differences amounting 
to £1.0 million (2013: £17.4 million) in the UK and £104.2 million (2013: £103.9 million) in Spain. The UK losses have not been recognised 
as they are predominantly non-trading in nature and sufficient uncertainty exists as to their future utilisation. The losses in Spain have not 
been recognised due to uncertainty of sufficient taxable profits in the future against which to utilise the losses.  
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused UK capital losses of £255.4 million (2013: £255.3 million), all of which are agreed 
as available for offset against future capital profits. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the capital losses at 
31 December 2014 because the Group does not believe that it is probable that these capital losses will be utilised in the foreseeable future.

In 2014 we saw the continued positive benefit of the improved environment in all of our regional markets. This is underpinned by solid 
consumer confidence and good mortgage availability.  
During 2014 we saw a continued trend to a healthier and more balanced market. This has meant that, whilst we have seen profitability 
increase on previously impaired sites, this has not been as significant as in the prior year. The stabilising of house prices along with 
a reduction in the number of actively trading sites which are impaired has resulted in a net reversal of impairment write-downs in the 
year of £18.7 million (2013: £62.3 million) in the UK.  
The net reversal in the UK consists of a reversal of previous write-downs of £27.0 million (2013: £107.1 million) and additional write-downs 
to the lower of cost and net realisable value of £8.3 million (2013: £44.8 million) on previously impaired sites.  
In the year 14% (2013: 32%) of the Group’s UK completions were from sites that had been previously impaired.  
At the balance sheet date the Group held inventory in the UK that had been written down to net realisable value of £269.6 million 
(2013: £459.9 million) with associated impairments of £158.1 million (2013: £206.8 million).

The average credit period taken on sales is eight days (2013: 14 days). An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts 
from trade receivables of £2.5 million (2013: £3.2 million). This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience. 
Included within trade receivables are mortgage receivables of £104.8 million (2013: £107.5 million) including shared equity loans. Shared 
equity loans are provided to certain customers to facilitate their house purchase. They are accounted for as a host contract representing a  
loan receivable and a non-closely related embedded derivative asset, as allowed under IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments’. The loan is measured  
at amortised cost and the embedded derivative is measured at fair value through profit or loss. 
The embedded derivative fair value movement is established by reference to a published national house price index. The fair value of the 
derivative is £9.4 million (2013: £5.5 million) and is included in the amount above.

The Group has designated the carrying value of €34.0 million (2013: €34.0 million) foreign currency forward contracts as a net investment  
hedge. The fair value of the forward contract is based on observable forward exchange rates at the end of the period taking into account 
any adjustment required for credit risk (level 2). At the year end the carrying value is considered to approximate its fair value as the value 
of the derivative is neglible. 
The Group has no financial instruments with fair values that are determined by reference to significant unobservable inputs (level 3), nor have 
there been any transfers of assets or liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy. There are no non-recurring fair value measurements. 
The Group has the following types of derivatives:

Notional

Designated as hedging instruments:  
Currency forward contract to sell € against £ €34.0m n/a €34.0m n/a
In addition, forward contracts have been entered into to hedge transaction risks on intra-Group loans to buy/(sell) against Sterling: 
€26.0 million and C$(0.6) million (2013: €22.0 million and C$(0.7) million). The fair values of the forward contracts are not materially 
different to their book values as they were entered into on or near 31 December in each year and mature not more than one month 
later, hence the value of the derivative is neglible. 
Market risk 
The Group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in both foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Group  
aims to manage the exposure to these risks by the use of fixed or variable rate borrowings, foreign currency borrowings and derivative  
financial instruments. 
(a) Interest rate risk management  
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as the Group borrows funds at variable interest rates. The exposure to variable rate borrowings 
fluctuates during the year due to the seasonal nature of cash flows relating to housing sales and the less certain timing of land payments. 
Group policy is to manage the volatility risk by a combination of fixed rate borrowings and interest rate swaps such that the sensitivity to 
potential changes in variable rates is within acceptable levels. Group policy does not allow the use of derivatives to speculate against changes 
to future interest rates and they are only used to manage exposure to volatility. This policy has not changed during the year. 
In order to measure the risk, variable rate borrowings and the expected interest cost for the year are forecast on a monthly basis and compared 
to budget using management’s expectations of a reasonably possible change in interest rates. Interest expense volatility remained within 
acceptable limits throughout the year. The Group does not currently have any outstanding fixed rate borrowings or interest rate swaps.

(b) Foreign currency risk management 
The Group’s overseas activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Spain is the only foreign 
operation of the Group. 
The Group is not materially exposed to transaction risks as all Group companies conduct their business in their respective functional 
currencies. Group policy requires that transaction risks are hedged to the functional currency of the subsidiary using foreign currency 
borrowings or derivatives where appropriate.  
The Group is also exposed to the translation risk of accounting for both the income and the net investment held in a functional currency  
other than Sterling. The net investment risk is hedged using foreign currency borrowings and derivatives. Assets and liabilities denominated  
in non-functional currencies are retranslated each month using the latest exchange rates. Income is also measured monthly using the latest 
exchange rates and compared to a budget held at historical exchange rates. Other than the natural hedge provided by foreign currency 
borrowings the translation risk of income is not hedged using derivatives. The policy is kept under periodic review. 
The Group’s exposure to, and the way in which it manages, exchange rate risk has not changed from the previous year. 
Hedge accounting 
Hedging activities are evaluated periodically to ensure that they are in line with Group policy. Forward contracts are currently being used 
to hedge the net investment risk in the Spanish operations.  
The Group has designated the carrying value of €34.0 million (2013: €34.0 million) foreign currency forward contracts held at the balance  
sheet date as a net investment hedge of part of the Group’s investment in Euro denominated assets. 
The change in the carrying amount of the derivatives which were effective hedging instruments and the change in the carrying value 
of the borrowings offset the exchange movement on the foreign currency net investments and are presented in the translation reserve.  
Foreign currency sensitivity 
The Group is only exposed to the Euro due to its Spanish operations. The following table details how the Group’s income and equity would 
increase/(decrease) on a before tax basis to a 5% change in the currency’s value against Sterling, and in accordance with IFRS 7, all other 
variables remaining constant.  
The 5% change represents a reasonably possible change in the specified Euro exchange rates in relation to Sterling.

(b) Foreign currency risk management 
The Group’s overseas activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Spain is the only foreign 
operation of the Group. 
The Group is not materially exposed to transaction risks as all Group companies conduct their business in their respective functional 
currencies. Group policy requires that transaction risks are hedged to the functional currency of the subsidiary using foreign currency 
borrowings or derivatives where appropriate.  
The Group is also exposed to the translation risk of accounting for both the income and the net investment held in a functional currency  
other than Sterling. The net investment risk is hedged using foreign currency borrowings and derivatives. Assets and liabilities denominated  
in non-functional currencies are retranslated each month using the latest exchange rates. Income is also measured monthly using the latest 
exchange rates and compared to a budget held at historical exchange rates. Other than the natural hedge provided by foreign currency 
borrowings the translation risk of income is not hedged using derivatives. The policy is kept under periodic review. 
The Group’s exposure to, and the way in which it manages, exchange rate risk has not changed from the previous year. 
Hedge accounting 
Hedging activities are evaluated periodically to ensure that they are in line with Group policy. Forward contracts are currently being used 
to hedge the net investment risk in the Spanish operations.  
The Group has designated the carrying value of €34.0 million (2013: €34.0 million) foreign currency forward contracts held at the balance  
sheet date as a net investment hedge of part of the Group’s investment in Euro denominated assets. 
The change in the carrying amount of the derivatives which were effective hedging instruments and the change in the carrying value 
of the borrowings offset the exchange movement on the foreign currency net investments and are presented in the translation reserve.  
Foreign currency sensitivity 
The Group is only exposed to the Euro due to its Spanish operations. The following table details how the Group’s income and equity would 
increase/(decrease) on a before tax basis to a 5% change in the currency’s value against Sterling, and in accordance with IFRS 7, all other 
variables remaining constant.  
The 5% change represents a reasonably possible change in the specified Euro exchange rates in relation to Sterling.

Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss where counterparties are not able to meet their obligations.  
Group policy is that surplus cash, when not used to repay borrowings, is placed on deposit with the Group’s main relationship banks 
and with other banks or money market funds based on a minimum credit rating and maximum exposure.  
Land receivables arise from sales of surplus land on deferred terms. A policy is in place such that, if the credit risk is not acceptable, then the 
deferred payment must have adequate security, either by the use of an appropriate guarantee or a charge over the land. The fair value of any 
land held as security is considered by management to be sufficient in relation to the carrying amount of the receivable to which it relates. 
Trade and other receivables comprise mainly amounts receivable from various housing associations and other housebuilders. Management 
considers that the credit quality of the various receivables is good in respect of the amounts outstanding and therefore credit risk is considered 
to be low. There is no significant concentration of risk.  
Mortgage receivables, including shared equity loans, are in connection with the various promotion schemes to support sales on a selective 
basis. The mortgages are mostly secured by a second charge over the property and are held at amortised cost. The embedded derivative 
related to shared equity is held at fair value. 
The carrying amount of financial assets, as detailed above, represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date 
assuming that any security held has no value. Details of guarantees and bonds are given in Note 29. 
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group does not have sufficient financial resources available to meet its obligations as they fall due. The Group 
manages liquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, matching the expected cash flow timings of financial assets 
and liabilities with the use of cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, overdrafts and committed revolving credit facilities with a minimum of 12 
months to maturity. Future borrowing requirements are forecast on a monthly basis and funding headroom is maintained above forecast peak 
requirements to meet unforeseen events. The Group has a range of maturities with an average life of 3.7 years (2013: 4.7 years). On 12 February 
2015, the term of the revolving credit facility was extended to February 2020 and as such the average life of maturity extended to 5.0 years from 
31 December 2014. 
In addition to fixed term borrowings, the Group has access to committed revolving credit facilities and cash balances. At the balance sheet  
date, the total unused committed amount was £550.0 million (2013: £550.0 million) and cash and cash equivalents were £212.8 million  
(2013: £105.4 million). 
The £100.0 million term loan matures in November 2020, with repayments commencing in November 2017. 
The maturity profile of the anticipated future cash flows, including interest using the latest applicable relevant rate based on the earliest date 
on which the Group can be required to pay financial liabilities on an undiscounted basis, is as follows:

21. Retirement benefit obligations 
Retirement benefit obligations comprise a defined benefit pension liability of £182.4 million (2013: £182.2 million) and a post-retirement  
healthcare liability of £1.4 million (2013: £1.6 million). 
The Group operates the Taylor Wimpey Pension Scheme (TWPS), a defined benefit pension scheme, which is closed to new members  
and future accrual. The Group also operates defined contribution pension arrangements in the UK, which are available to new and existing  
UK employees. 
Defined contribution pension plan 
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays contributions to an independently administered fund – such 
contributions are based upon a fixed percentage of employees’ pay. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further 
contributions to the fund once the contributions have been paid. Members’ benefits are determined by the amount of contributions paid by  
the Group and the member, together with investment returns earned on the contributions arising from the performance of each individual’s 
chosen investments and the type of pension the member chooses to buy at retirement. As a result, actuarial risk (that benefits will be lower  
than expected) and investment risk (that assets invested in will not perform in line with expectations) fall on the employee.  
The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset 
to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available. 
The Group’s defined contribution plan, the Taylor Wimpey Personal Choice Plan (TWPCP), is offered to all new and existing monthly paid 
employees. The People’s Pension is used for auto enrolment purposes for weekly and monthly employees not participating in the TWPCP. The 
People’s Pension is provided by B&CE, one of the UK's largest providers of financial benefits to construction industry employers and individuals. 
The Group made contributions to its defined contribution arrangements of £9.0 million in 2014 (2013: £7.7 million), which is included 
in the income statement charge. The Group expects to make contributions of around £9.3 million in 2015. 
Defined benefit pension schemes 
The Group’s defined benefit pension scheme in the UK is the TWPS which replaced the Taylor Woodrow Group Pension and Life Assurance 
Fund (TWGP&LAF) and the George Wimpey Staff Pension Scheme (GWSPS) in 2013. The TWPS is a funded defined benefit pension scheme 
which provides benefits to beneficiaries in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life. The level of benefits provided depends 
on members’ length of service and their salary in the final years leading up to retirement or date of ceasing active accrual if earlier. Pensions 
payments are generally increased in line with inflation.  
The Group operates the TWPS under the UK regulatory framework. Benefits are paid to members from a Trustee-administered fund and 
the Trustees are responsible for ensuring that the scheme is sufficiently funded to meet current and future benefit payments. Scheme assets 
are held in trust.  
The TWPS Trustees’ other duties include managing the investment of scheme assets, administration of scheme benefits and exercising 
of discretionary powers. The Group works closely with the Trustees to manage the TWPS. The Trustees of the TWPS are required to 
act in the best interests of the TWPS’ beneficiaries. The appointment of the Trustees is determined by the TWPS trust documentation.  
The Trustees must agree a funding plan with the Group such that any funding shortfall is expected to be met by additional contributions and 
investment outperformance. In order to assess the level of contributions required, triennial valuations are carried out using prudent assumptions. 
The first funding valuation of the TWPS was performed during 2014, with a reference date of 31 December 2013. Subsequently, the Group 
agreed to make contributions of £18.0 million in 2015. This includes £2.0 million in respect of administrative costs of the scheme. 
In 2013, the Group introduced a £100.0 million Pension Funding Partnership utilising show homes, as well as four offices which are owned,  
in a sale and leaseback structure. This will provide an additional £5.1 million of annual funding for the TWPS. The assets held within this scheme 
do not affect the IAS 19 figures as they remain assets of the Group, and are not assets of the TWPS. As at 31 December 2014, there was 
£93.8 million of property and £17.2 million of cash held within the structure (2013: £92.9 million of property and £18.1 million of cash). 
On 8 December 2014, the Trustee completed a medically underwritten buy-in covering around 10% of the liability exposure for £206.2 million. 
This medically underwritten buy-in significantly derisks the pension scheme and hence further volatility. 
Furthermore, in conjunction with the Trustee, the Group completed a flexible retirement offer for deferred members. Approximately £25.0 million 
of future liability has been transferred from the scheme. 
The Group continues to work closely with the Trustee in managing the pension exposure.

The table below sets out the details of the funding valuations for the TWPS, carried out in September 2014, with reference to the position 
at 31 December 2013.  
Assumptions  TWPS
RPI inflation 3.40%
Discount rate – pre/post-retirement 6.05%/4.05%

Market value of assets £1,921m
Past service liabilities £2,112m
Scheme funding levels 91%
Deficit repair contributions (per annum) £16.0m
Period of payment Until November 2018
The defined benefit obligation is measured using the projected unit actuarial cost method. 
The duration, or average term to payment for the benefits due, weighted by liability, is approximately 15 years for the TWPS. 
Accounting assumptions 
The assumptions used in calculating the accounting costs and obligations of the TWPS, as detailed below, are set by the Directors after 
consultation with independent, professionally qualified actuaries. The basis for these assumptions is prescribed by IAS 19 and they do not 
reflect the assumptions that may be used in future funding valuations of the TWPS.  
The discount rate used to determine the present value of the obligations is set by reference to market yields on high-quality corporate bonds 
with regard for the duration of the TWPS. The assumption for RPI inflation is set by reference to the Bank of England’s implied inflation spot 
curve with regard for the duration of the TWPS, with appropriate adjustments to reflect distortions due to supply and demand for inflation-linked 
securities. CPI inflation is set by reference to RPI inflation as no CPI-linked bonds exist to render implied CPI inflation directly observable. 
The life expectancies have been derived using mortality assumptions that were based on the results of a recent investigation into the mortality 
experience of the scheme. The base tables used are the S2NXA tables with CMI_2013 improvements and 1.25% trend rate.

Risks and risk management 
The TWPS, in common with the majority of such defined benefit pension schemes in the UK, has a number of areas of risk. These areas 
of risk, and the ways in which the Group has sought to manage them, are set out in the table on page 128. 
The risks are considered from both a funding perspective, which drives the cash commitments of the Group, and from an accounting 
perspective, i.e. the extent to which such risks affect the amounts recorded in the Group’s financial statements. 
Although investment decisions in the UK are the responsibility of the Trustees, the Group takes an active interest to ensure that pension 
scheme risks are managed efficiently. The Group has regular meetings with the Trustees to discuss investment performance, regulatory 
changes and proposals to manage the deficit actively.

21. Retirement benefit obligations continued  
The key risks of the defined benefit pension scheme are detailed below along with the Group’s approach to them. 
Risk Description 
Asset volatility The funding liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to government bond yields, 
with allowance for additional return to be generated from the investment portfolio. The defined benefit 
obligation is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields. 
The TWPS holds a large proportion of its assets in equities and other return-seeking assets. The returns 
on such assets tend to be volatile and are not correlated to government bonds or corporate bonds. This 
means that the funding level is likely to be volatile in the short-term, potentially resulting in short-term cash 
requirements and an increase in the net defined benefit liability recorded on the balance sheet. 
However, the Group believes that equities offer the best returns over the long term with an acceptable level of risk. 
The TWPS’ assets are well-diversified by investing in a range of asset classes, including property, government 
bonds and corporate bonds. There are a number of hedging strategies in place (these are mentioned below). 
A summary of the target asset allocations of the TWPS, excluding hedging and insurance policies, is shown below: 
 TWPS
Liability matching assets 37.0%
Equity 28.4%
Alternative return-seeking assets  34.6%
These target allocations were revised in December 2014. 
Changes in  
bond yields 
Falling bond yields tend to increase the funding and accounting liabilities. However, the investment in corporate 
and government bonds offers a degree of matching, i.e. the movement in assets arising from changes in bond 
yields partially matches the movement in the funding or accounting liabilities. In this way, the exposure to 
movements in bond yields is reduced. 
Investing in 
foreign currency 
In order to maintain appropriate diversification of investments within the TWPS’ assets and to take advantage of 
overseas investment returns, a proportion of the underlying investment portfolio is invested overseas. To balance  
the risk of investing in foreign currencies while having an obligation to settle benefits in Sterling, a currency hedging 
programme, using forward foreign exchange contracts, has been put in place to reduce the currency exposure 
of these overseas investments to the targeted level. 
Asset/liability 
mismatch 
In order to maintain (and increase) the TWPS’ economic exposure to interest rates and inflation rates, a liability 
hedging programme has been put in place. Repurchase agreements are being used to achieve the TWPS’ agreed 
target level of liability hedging in an unfunded way and hence to reduce the investment risk of the TWPS’ assets 
relative to the liabilities.  
Illiquidity Insurance policies and real estate make up £265.6 million (13%) of the asset portfolio of TWPS. Excluding these 
amounts approximately 73% of assets are managed either in segregated accounts or daily/weekly dealt pooled 
funds and can therefore be realised within a few business days under normal market conditions. Of the remaining 
investments a further 20% are in pooled funds with monthly redemption dates. The remainder could be redeemed 
within approximately three months of notification in normal market conditions. 
Life expectancy The majority of the TWPS’ obligations are to provide a pension for the life of the member, so increases in life 
expectancy will result in an increase in the TWPS’ liabilities. The inflation-linked nature of the benefit payments 
from the TWPS result increases the sensitivity of the liabilities to changes in life expectancy.  
Additional areas of risk management 
In general, the creation of the TWPS from the two legacy schemes will simplify scheme management, reduce administration costs 
by approximately £0.8 million per annum and improve the management of future deficit repair contributions. 
During the last quarter of 2014, the Group reached agreement with Partnership Life Assurance Company Limited to insure the benefits 
of certain members through a medically underwritten buy-in. These members represent the 10% of members with the greatest anticipated 
liability of the scheme. By insuring these members, the Group has removed more than 10% of risk from the scheme by significantly reducing 
the longevity of a large proportion of the liabilities. The Group remains ultimately liable for the payments, and as such the obligation is unchanged; 
however the medically underwritten insurance policy has been recognised as a scheme insured asset. The price paid for the policy was 
£9.4 million below the technical provision which it covers. 
During 2014, scheme deferred members were offered flexible retirement options under the scheme rules, which allowed participants to realise 
part of their pension at an earlier date than previously anticipated. By discharging some liabilities at an earlier date, the actuarial risks attached  
to the scheme reduce.

21. Retirement benefit obligations continued  
During the last quarter of 2013, in conjunction with the transfer of assets and obligations into the newly formed TWPS, the Group conducted 
a trivial-commutation exercise, offering lump sums to deferred and pensioner members with total benefits small enough for this to be permitted 
by pensions legislation. This resulted in an income statement settlement gain in 2013 of £4.1 million.

Employee Share Ownership Trusts (ESOTs) are used to hold the Company’s shares which have been acquired on the market. These shares are 
used to meet the valid exercise of options and/or vesting of conditional awards and/or award of shares under the Executive Incentive Scheme, 
Bonus Deferral Plan, Performance Share Plan, Executive Share Option Scheme, Savings-Related Share Option Scheme and the matching 
award of shares under the Share Purchase Plan.  
During the year, Taylor Wimpey plc purchased £10.0 million of its own shares which are held in the ESOTs (2013: £15.1 million). 
The ESOTs’ entire holding of shares at 31 December 2014, aggregating 14.3 million shares (2013: 28.1 million), was covered by outstanding 
options and conditional awards over shares at that date. 
27. Discontinued operations  
In 2011, the Group sold the North American division. As part of the disposal, the Group provided certain indemnities to the buyers. 
No provision was released during the year as the outstanding indemnities remained valid (2013: £31.3 million released).

31.Share-based payments continued 
For share plans with non-market conditions granted during the current and preceding year, the fair value of the awards at grant date 
was determined using the Binomial model. The inputs into that model were as follows: 
2014 2013
Weighted average share price £1.17 £0.94
Weighted average exercise price £0.67 £0.58
Expected volatility 34% 39%
Expected life 3/5 years 3/5 years
Risk free rate 1.5% 1.1%
Expected dividend yield 5.7% 0.8%
The weighted average fair value of share awards granted during the year is £0.52 (2013: £0.49). 
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the expected term. 
For share awards with market conditions granted during the current year, the fair value of the awards was determined using the 
Monte Carlo simulation model. The inputs into that model were as follows: 
2014 2013
Weighted average share price £1.25 £0.83
Weighted average exercise price Nil Nil
Expected volatility 34% 40%
Expected life 3 years 3 years
Risk free rate 0.8% 0.5%
Expected dividend yield 0.0% 0.9%
The weighted average fair value of share options granted during the year is £0.79 (2013: £0.54). 
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the expected term. The expected 
life used in the model is based on historical exercise patterns. 
The Group recognised total expenses of £6.2 million related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in 2014 (2013: £6.4 million).

Notes to the Company Financial Statements 
for the year to 31 December 2014 
 
 137
1. Significant accounting policies 
The following accounting policies have been used consistently, unless 
otherwise stated, in dealing with items which are considered material. 
Basis of preparation 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards (UK GAAP) 
under the historical cost convention. As permitted by Section 408 of the 
Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own profit 
and loss account. 
Under Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 1, the Company is  
exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement  
on the grounds that consolidated financial statements, which include 
the Company, are publicly available.  
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained  
in FRS 8 ‘Related Party Disclosures’ and has not reported transactions 
with wholly owned subsidiaries. The Company has also taken advantage of 
the exemption contained within FRS 29 ‘Financial Instrument Disclosures’ 
and has not presented any disclosures required by that standard, as 
disclosures that comply with FRS 29 are included within the Taylor Wimpey 
plc consolidated financial statements in Note 20 on pages 120 to 123. 
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below. 
Going concern 
The Group has prepared forecasts, including certain sensitivities taking 
into account the principal risks identified on pages 28 to 29. Having 
considered these forecasts, the Directors remain of the view that the 
Group’s financing arrangements and capital structure provide both 
the necessary facilities and covenant headroom to enable the Group 
to conduct its business for at least the next 12 months. 
Accordingly, the Company financial statements have been prepared 
on a going concern basis. 
Investments in Group undertakings 
Investments are included in the balance sheet at cost less any provision 
for impairment. The Company assesses investments for impairment 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
value of an investment may not be recoverable. If any such indication of 
impairment exists, the Company makes an estimate of the recoverable 
amount of the investment. If the recoverable amount is less than the value 
of the investment, the investment is considered to be impaired and is 
written down to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised 
immediately in the profit and loss account; if the impairment is not 
considered to be a permanent diminution in value, it may reverse in 
a future period to the extent it is no longer considered necessary.  
The Company values its investments in subsidiary holding companies 
based on a comparison between the net assets recoverable by the 
subsidiary company and the investment held. Where the net assets 
are lower than the investment an impairment is recorded. For trading 
subsidiaries, the investment carrying value in the Company is assessed 
against the net present value of the discounted cash flows from the 
subsidiary in accordance with FRS 11. 
Borrowing costs 
Capitalised finance costs are held in other debtors and amortised  
over the period of the facility. 
Taxation 
The tax charge represents the sum of the tax currently payable  
and deferred tax. 
Current tax 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable 
profit differs from profit before tax because it excludes items of income 
or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further 
excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.  
The Company’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates  
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance  
sheet date. 
Any liability or credit in respect of Group relief in lieu of current tax  
is also calculated using corporation tax rates that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date unless a different 
rate (including a nil rate) has been agreed within the Group. 
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences that result in  
an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right 
to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when 
they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.  
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded  
as more likely than not that they will be recovered.  
Overseas currencies 
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in Sterling 
at actual rates as of the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are reported 
at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end.  
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to 
the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the 
profit and loss account. Unrealised exchange differences on intercompany 
long term loans and foreign currency borrowings, to the extent that they 
hedge the Company’s investment in overseas investments, are taken to 
the translation reserve. 
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting 
The Company uses foreign currency borrowings and currency  
swaps to hedge its investment in overseas operations. Changes in  
the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated  
and effective as hedges of investment in overseas operations are 
recognised directly in reserves and the ineffective portion, if any, is 
recognised immediately in the profit and loss account. The hedged 
items are adjusted for changes in exchange rates, with gains or  
losses from remeasuring the carrying amount being recognised directly 
in reserves.  
Share-based payments 
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain 
employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant. The fair value is expensed on a straight-line 
basis over the vesting period, based on the estimate of shares that 
will eventually vest. The cost of equity-settled share-based payments 
granted to employees of subsidiary companies is borne by the employing 
company, without recharge. As such the Company’s investment in the 
subsidiary is increased by an equivalent amount.

146 Notes to the Notice of Meeting
Procedural notes
1.  To be entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting 
(and for the purpose of the determination by the Company of  
the votes which shareholders may cast), shareholders must be 
registered in the Register of Members of the Company at 6:00 pm 
on 21 April 2015 (or, in the event of any adjournment, on the date 
which is two days before the time of the adjourned meeting). 
Shareholders then on the Register of Members shall be entitled 
to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting in respect of 
the number of shares registered in their name at that time. 
Changes to entries on the relevant Register of Members after  
that deadline shall be disregarded in determining the rights of  
any person to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting.
2.  As at 4 March 2015 (being the latest practicable date prior  
to the publication of this notice) the Company’s issued share  
capital consisted of 3,253,461,531 ordinary shares, carrying one 
vote each. Therefore, the total voting rights in the Company as 
at 4 March 2015 were 3,253,461,531.
3.   If you are a shareholder of the Company at the time and date  
set out in note 1 above, you are entitled to appoint a proxy to 
exercise all or any of your rights to attend and to speak and vote 
on your behalf at the meeting. Shareholders may appoint more 
than one proxy in relation to the Annual General Meeting provided 
that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to  
a different share or shares held by that shareholder. A proxy  
need not be a shareholder of the Company but must attend  
the Annual General Meeting to represent you. A proxy form  
which may be used to make such appointment and give proxy 
instructions accompanies this notice. If you do not have a proxy 
form and believe that you should have one, or if you require 
additional forms, please contact Capita Asset Services as soon 
as possible on 0871 664 0300 (calls cost 10p per minute plus 
network extras; lines are open 8:30 am to 5:30 pm Monday to 
Friday). In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the 
joint holders purports to appoint a proxy, only the appointment 
submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority  
is determined by the order in which the names of the joint holders 
appear in the Company’s register of members in respect of the 
joint holdings (the first-named being the most senior).
4.   To be valid any proxy form or other instrument appointing a  
proxy must be received by Capita Asset Services at PXS 1, 34 
Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent, BR3 4ZF , or, if you want  
to use an envelope the address to use is simply FREEPOST 
CAPITA PXS, or, if you prefer, electronically via the internet at 
www.capitashareportal.com or, if you are a member of CREST, 
via the service provided by Euroclear UK and Ireland Limited at 
the electronic address provided in note 9, in each case no later 
than 11:00 am on 21 April 2015. Please note that all forms of 
proxy received after this time will be void. A form of proxy sent 
electronically at any time that is found to contain any virus will  
not be accepted.
5.  The return of a completed proxy form, other such instrument  
or any CREST Proxy Instruction (as further described in notes 8 
and 9 below) will not prevent a shareholder attending the Annual 
General Meeting and voting in person if he/she wishes to do so.
6.   Any person to whom this notice is sent who is a person 
nominated under Section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 to 
enjoy information rights (a ‘Nominated Person’) may, under an 
agreement between him/her and the shareholder by whom he/
she was nominated, have a right to be appointed (or to have 
someone else appointed) as a proxy for the Annual General 
Meeting. If a Nominated Person has no such proxy appointment 
right or does not wish to exercise it, he/she may, under any such 
agreement, have a right to give instructions to the shareholder as 
to the exercise of voting rights. Such persons should direct any 
communications and enquiries to the registered holder of the 
shares by whom they were nominated and not to the Company 
or its registrar.
7.   The statement of the rights of shareholders in relation to the 
appointment of proxies in notes 3 and 4 above does not apply  
to Nominated Persons. The rights described in these notes can 
only be exercised by shareholders of the Company.
8.   CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through 
the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so by 
using the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST 
personal members or other CREST sponsored members, and 
those CREST members who have appointed a service provider(s), 
should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), 
who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
9.  In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the 
CREST service to be valid, it must be properly authenticated  
in accordance with Euroclear UK and Ireland Limited’s 
specifications, and must contain the information required  
for such instruction, as described in the CREST Manual  
(available via www.euroclear.com/CREST). The message, 
regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a  
proxy or is an amendment to the instruction given to a previously 
appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as 
to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID RA10) by 11:00 am on  
21 April 2015. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken 
to be the time (as determined by the time stamp applied to the 
message by the CREST Application Host) from which the issuer’s 
agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in  
the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change  
of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should  
be communicated to the appointee through other means.
10.   CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors  
or voting service providers should note that Euroclear UK and 
Ireland Limited does not make available special procedures  
in CREST for any particular message. Normal system timings  
and limitations will, therefore, apply in relation to the input of 
CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST 
member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a 
CREST personal member, or sponsored member, or has 
appointed a voting service provider, to procure that his CREST 
sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall 
be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means 
of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, 
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors 
or voting system providers are referred, in particular, to those 
sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations  
of the CREST system and timings.

in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the 
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
12.   Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more 
corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all  
of its powers as a member provided that they do not do so  
in relation to the same shares.
13.   Under Section 527 of the Companies Act 2006 members 
meeting the threshold requirements set out in that section  
have the right to require the Company to publish on a website  
a statement setting out any matter relating to:
 (i)  the audit of the Company’s accounts (including the Auditor’s 
Report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid 
before the Annual General Meeting; or
 (ii)  any circumstance connected with an auditor of the 
Company ceasing to hold office since the previous meeting 
at which annual accounts and reports were laid in 
accordance with Section 437 of the Companies Act 2006. 
  The Company may not require the shareholders requesting any 
such website publication to pay its expenses in complying with 
Sections 527 or 528 of the Companies Act 2006. Where the 
Company is required to place a statement on a website under 
Section 527 of the Companies Act 2006, it must forward the 
statement to the Company’s auditor not later than the time when  
it makes the statement available on the website. The business 
which may be dealt with at the Annual General Meeting includes 
any statement that the Company has been required under 
Section 527 of the Companies Act 2006 to publish on a website.
14.   Any member attending the meeting has the right to ask questions 
and participate in the meeting. The Company must cause to be 
answered any such question relating to the business being dealt 
with at the meeting but no such answer need be given if: (i) to do  
so would interfere unduly with the preparation for the meeting or 
involve the disclosure of confidential information; (ii) the answer  
has already been given on a website in the form of an answer to  
a question; or (iii) it is undesirable in the interests of the Company  
or the good order of the meeting that the question be answered.
15.   A copy of this Notice, and other information required by  
Section 311A of the Companies Act 2006, can be found  
at www.taylorwimpey.co.uk/corporate 
16.   Voting on all resolutions at this year’s Annual General Meeting  
will be conducted by way of a poll, rather than on a show of  
hands. The Board believes that a poll is more representative  
of shareholders’ voting intentions because it gives as many 
shareholders as possible the opportunity to have their votes 
counted (whether their votes are tendered by proxy in advance  
of, or in person at, the Annual General Meeting). The results of  
the poll will be announced via a Regulatory Information Service  
and made available at www.taylorwimpey.co.uk/corporate as 
soon as practicable after the Annual General Meeting.
Explanatory notes to the resolutions
Ordinary Business
Ordinary Resolutions
Ordinary resolutions require more than half of the votes cast  
to be in favour.
Resolution 1: To receive the annual report and financial statements
English company law requires the Directors to lay the Financial 
Statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December  
2014 and the reports of the Directors, namely the Strategic  
Report, Directors’ Report and the Directors’ Remuneration  
Report; and Auditors; before a general meeting of the Company  
(the Annual Report). 
Resolution 2: To declare a final dividend
The Directors recommend the payment of a final dividend of 1.32 
pence per share in respect of the year ended 31 December 2014.  
If approved at the Annual General Meeting, the dividend will be paid 
on 20 May 2015 to shareholders who are on the Register of 
Members at the close of business on 10 April 2015.
Resolution 3: To declare a Special Dividend
Taylor Wimpey has announced its intention to return cash to its 
shareholders, through the payment of annual Special Dividends, 
always subject to market and performance fluctuations. The first  
such dividend was paid in 2014 at the rate of 1.54 pence per share.
The Company now proposes a much larger Special Dividend for 
2015, at the rate of 7.68 pence per share, and believes it is 
appropriate to seek prior shareholder approval for its payment.
Further details on the rationale for paying Special Dividends and  
the link to the Company’s current strategy, can be found on pages  
12 and 16.
The aggregate cost of the Special Dividend for 2015 will be around 
£250 million and will be met from profits and surplus cash generated 
during 2015. If approved, it will be paid on 3 July 2015 to shareholders 
on the register at the close of business on 22 May 2015.
Dividend Re-Investment Plan
Subject to shareholders approving either or both of the dividends  
as set out in Resolutions 2 and 3 at the Annual General Meeting 
scheduled for 23 April 2015, the Company will be offering a Dividend 
Re-Investment Plan (DRIP) on each one. The DRIP is provided and 
administered by the DRIP plan administrator, Capita IRG Trustees 
Limited, which is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA). The DRIP offers shareholders the opportunity to  
elect to invest cash dividends received on their ordinary shares, in 
purchasing further ordinary shares of the Company. These shares 
would be bought in the market, on competitive dealing terms.
The DRIP will operate automatically in respect of the Final Dividend  
for 2014 (unless varied beforehand by shareholders) and all future 
dividends, including Special Dividends, until such time as you 
withdraw from the DRIP or the DRIP is suspended or terminated  
in accordance with the Terms and Conditions.
Important: Please Read: Action May Be Required:
Please note that if you have already elected to participate in the  
DRIP , unless you take positive action to cancel your participation,  
the DRIP will operate automatically in respect of this and future 
special dividends, as it does already for interim and final dividends.

Shareholder Information p144-153 Directors’ Report: Governance p44-91 Financial Statements p92-143 Strategic Report p2-43 Resolution 12: Re-appointment of Deloitte LLP (Deloitte)  
as auditors of the Company 
The Company is required to appoint auditors at each general meeting  
at which accounts are laid before the shareholders. It is therefore 
proposed that the auditors are appointed from the conclusion of the 
2015 Annual General Meeting until the conclusion of the next general 
meeting at which accounts are laid before shareholders. Following an 
annual review of Deloitte’s performance, details of which are set out  
on page 62, the Board recommends the re-appointment of Deloitte  
as the Company’s auditors.
Resolution 13: Authorisation of the Audit Committee to agree  
on behalf of the Board the remuneration of Deloitte as auditors
The Board seeks shareholders’ authority for the Audit Committee  
to determine on behalf of the Board the remuneration of Deloitte  
for their services. The Board has adopted a procedure governing  
the appointment of Deloitte to carry out non-audit services, details  
of which are given in the Audit Committee Report. Details of non-
audit services performed by Deloitte in 2014 are given in Note 6  
on page 110 of the Report and Accounts.
Resolution 14: Authority to allot shares
The Directors wish to renew the existing authority to allot unissued 
shares in the Company, which was granted at the Company’s last 
Annual General Meeting held on 17 April 2014 and is due to expire  
at the conclusion of this Annual General Meeting. Accordingly, 
Paragraph (A) of resolution 14 would give the Directors the authority 
to allot ordinary shares or grant rights to subscribe for or convert any 
securities into ordinary shares up to an aggregate nominal amount 
equal to £10,844,871 (representing 1,084,487,100 ordinary shares). 
This amount represents approximately one-third of the issued 
ordinary share capital of the Company as at 4 March 2015, the  
latest practicable date prior to publication of this notice of meeting. 
In line with guidance issued by The Investment Association (formerly 
the Association of British Insurers) (TIA), paragraph (B) of resolution 
14 would give the Directors authority to allot ordinary shares or grant 
rights to subscribe for or convert any securities into ordinary shares  
in connection with a rights issue in favour of ordinary shareholders  
up to an aggregate nominal amount equal to £21,689,743 
(representing 2,168,974,300 ordinary shares), as reduced by the 
nominal amount of any shares issued under paragraph (A) of 
resolution 14. This amount (before any reduction) represents 
approximately two-thirds of the issued ordinary share capital of the 
Company as at 4 March 2015, the latest practicable date prior to 
publication of this notice of meeting.
The Company does not hold any shares in Treasury.
The authorities sought under paragraphs (A) and (B) of resolution 14  
will expire at the earlier of 22 July 2016 and the conclusion of the  
Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held in 2016.
The Directors have no present intention to exercise either of the 
authorities sought under this resolution. However, if they do exercise  
the authorities, the Directors intend to follow TIA recommendations 
concerning their use (including as regards the Directors standing  
for re-election in certain cases).
Special Resolutions
Special resolutions require at least a 75% majority of votes cast  
to be cast in favour. 
Resolution 15: Authority to dis-apply pre-emption rights
The Board wishes to renew the existing authority from shareholders 
to allot shares or sell any shares held in treasury for cash otherwise 
than to existing shareholders pro rata to their holdings. Resolution 15, 
which will be proposed as a special resolution and therefore requires 
a 75% majority of votes to be cast in favour, would give the Directors 
the authority to allot ordinary shares (or sell any ordinary shares which 
the Company elects to hold in treasury) for cash without first 
offering them to existing shareholders in proportion to their 
existing shareholdings.
This authority would be, similar to previous years, limited to  
allotments or sales in connection with pre-emptive offers and offers  
to holders of other equity securities if required by the rights of those 
shares or as the Board otherwise considers necessary, or otherwise 
up to an aggregate nominal amount of £1,626,730 (representing 
162,673,000 ordinary shares). This aggregate nominal amount 
represents approximately 5% of the issued ordinary share capital  
of the Company as at 4 March 2015, the latest practicable date  
prior to publication of this notice. In respect of this aggregate nominal 
amount, the Directors confirm their intention to follow the provisions 
of the Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of Principles regarding 
cumulative usage of authorities within a rolling three-year period 
where the Principles provide that usage in excess of 7.5% should  
not take place without prior consultation with shareholders.
The authority will expire at the earlier of 22 July 2016 and the 
conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the Company  
held in 2016.
Resolution 16: Authority to make market purchases of shares 
Any purchases under this authority would be made in one or more 
tranches and would be limited in aggregate to 10% of the ordinary 
shares of the Company in issue at the close of business on  
4 March 2015.
The maximum price to be paid on any exercise of the authority  
would not exceed the highest of (i) 105% of the average of the  
middle market quotations for the Company’s ordinary shares for the 
five business days immediately preceding the date of the purchase; 
and (ii) the higher of the price of the last independent trade and the 
highest current independent bid on the trading venues where the 
purchase is carried out. Shares purchased pursuant to these 
authorities could be held as treasury shares, which the Company can 
re-issue quickly and cost-effectively, and provides the Company with 
additional flexibility in the management of its capital base. The total 
number of shares held as treasury shall not at any one time exceed 
10% of the Company’s issued share capital. Accordingly, any shares 
bought back over the 10% limit will be cancelled. The Company 
currently holds no shares in treasury.
This is a standard resolution, sought by the majority of public listed 
companies at Annual General Meetings. The Board’s current intention  
of utilising this authority is generally limited to acquiring shares for the 
various share scheme arrangements. The Board would only consider  
a more formal share purchase programme if it would result in an 
increase in earnings per share and was in the best interests of 
shareholders generally, having regard to all relevant circumstances.
The total number of options and conditional share awards to 
subscribe for ordinary shares outstanding as at the close of business 
on 4 March 2015 was 42,999,919, representing approximately  
1.3% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at  
that date and approximately 1.5% of the Company’s issued ordinary 
share capital following any exercise in full of this authority to make 
market purchases.
This authority will last until the earlier of 22 October 2016 and the 
conclusion of the Company’s Annual General Meeting in 2016.
Special Business
Ordinary Resolutions
Resolution 17: Approval of the Directors’ Remuneration Report  
for the year ended 31 December 2014 
The Directors are required to prepare an annual report detailing the 
remuneration of the Directors and a statement by the Chairman of  
the Remuneration Committee (together the “Directors’ Remuneration 
Shareholder Information
Notes to the Notice of Meeting continued
Taylor Wimpey plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2014
150 Report”). The Company is required to seek shareholders’ approval in 
respect of the contents of this report on an annual basis. The vote is 
an advisory one.
The Company’s Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders 
at last year’s AGM and remains unchanged. In such circumstances, 
the Policy need not be re-submitted to shareholders for three years 
(unless amendments are proposed to it) and accordingly, there is  
no equivalent resolution at this year’s AGM.
The Directors’ Remuneration Report is set out on pages 66 to 85 of 
the Annual Report and Accounts.
The Company’s current Remuneration Policy is available on the 
Company’s web site at: www.taylorwimpey.co.uk/corporate/investor-
relations/corporate-governance
Resolution 18: Authority to make political donations
In order to comply with its obligations under the Companies Act 2006 
and to avoid any inadvertent infringement of that Act, the Board 
wishes to renew its existing authority for a general level of political 
donation and/or expenditure. Resolution 18 seeks to renew the 
existing authority for the Company to make political donations and 
incur political expenditure. The Companies Act 2006 requires this 
authority to be divided into three heads (as set out in Resolution 18) 
with a separate amount specified as permitted for each. An amount 
not exceeding £250,000 for each head of the authority has been 
proposed. In accordance with the Companies Act 2006, Resolution 
18 extends approval to all of the Company’s subsidiaries.
This authority will expire at the conclusion of the Annual General 
Meeting of the Company in 2016, unless renewal is sought at  
that meeting.
The Company and the Group do not make any donations to political 
parties or organisations and do not intend to going forward, but do 
support certain industry-wide bodies such as the Home Builders 
Federation in the UK. Whilst the Board does not regard this as 
political in nature, in certain circumstances such support together  
with donations made for charitable or similar purposes could possibly 
be treated as a donation to a political organisation under the relevant 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006. For example, a donation to  
a humanitarian charity which may also operate as a political lobby, 
sponsorship, subscriptions, paid leave to employees fulfilling public 
duties and payments to industry representative bodies could 
constitute a donation to a political organisation within the current 
definitions in the Companies Act 2006. 
Details of the Company’s and the Group’s charitable donations 
appear on page 90 of the Report and Accounts.
Resolution 19: Substantial property transaction
Mr. Pete Redfern, a Director of the Company, intends to enter into  
a contract to purchase Vivienda 5-5, Parcela A, Urbanización 38, 
Servera Deya, Es Port Vell, 07559 Son Servera, Mallorca, at Taylor 
Wimpey de España S.A.U.’s development at Costa Beach, Port Vell, 
Mallorca for the sum of €484,500 subject to approval having been 
obtained for the transaction from the Company’s shareholders at  
the Annual General Meeting, from Taylor Wimpey de España S.A.U.,  
a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
As the transaction is in excess of £100,000, it constitutes a 
substantial property transaction with a Director of the Company  
under sections 190 and 191 of the Companies Act 2006 and 
therefore requires the prior approval of shareholders, which is being 
sought at this Annual General Meeting.
The Costa Beach development comprises a residential scheme built 
by Taylor Wimpey de España S.A.U. The purchase price being paid 
by Pete Redfern is €484,500 (representing £353,650 at the exchange 
rate of £1 = €1.37 on 4 March 2015, being the latest practicable date 
prior to the completion of this Notice of Meeting) for the purchase of a 
single storey terraced house. In addition, the purchase includes the 
supply of standard optional fitted extras, available routinely to 
independent purchasers on similar commercial terms, comprising 
domestic electrical appliances for the kitchen and fixtures for the 
bathroom. The purchase price was agreed following a rigorous review 
of the prices already obtained in the open market for similar 
properties, less a discount of 5 per cent. pursuant to the Company’s 
employee discount scheme. Other than the standard employee 
discount, the price being paid by Pete Redfern assumes that the 
transaction is an arm’s length sale.
The calculation of the price payable by Mr. Redfern (excluding VAT)  
is as follows:
Price upon reservation (January 2015): €510,000
Standard employee discount (5%) available  
to all T aylor Wimpey employees: €25,500
Price payable by Pete Redfern (excluding extras): €484,500
Extras at full price: €5,816
T otal price payable by Pete Redfern: €490,316
Standard reservation fee paid: €6,000
Balance to be paid by Pete Redfern  
(if shareholder approval is given): €484,316
The agreement between Taylor Wimpey de España S.A.U. and Pete 
Redfern will be a standard form sale and purchase agreement used 
by Taylor Wimpey de España S.A.U. for the Costa Beach 
development. Pete Redfern has paid a standard reservation fee to 
Taylor Wimpey de España S.A.U. prior to the Annual General Meeting 
but the transaction shall be subject to obtaining shareholder approval.
The terms of the proposed purchase have been subjected to the 
usual level of scrutiny and review applied to proposed purchases  
by other employees, has included a review by Internal Audit and  
also by the Group Legal Director and Company Secretary. 
The Board believes the terms of the proposed agreement are fair  
and reasonable and that the price being paid by Pete Redfern will  
be the market value of the Costa Beach property (less the standard 
discount of 5 per cent. as described above) as at the date of 
exchange of contracts.
Special Resolution
Resolution 20: Notice of general meetings
Special resolutions require at least a 75% majority of votes cast  
to be cast in favour. 
This resolution will be proposed as a special resolution and therefore 
requires a 75% majority of votes to be cast in favour. The Companies 
(Shareholders’ Rights) Regulations 2009 have increased the notice 
period required for general meetings of the Company to 21 clear days 
unless shareholders agree to a shorter notice period, which cannot  
be less than 14 clear days. At the 2014 Annual General Meeting, a 
resolution was passed approving the Company’s ability to call general 
meetings (other than Annual General Meetings, which will continue to  
be held on at least 21 clear days’ notice) on not less than 14 clear 
days’ notice. As this approval will expire at the conclusion of this 
Annual General Meeting, Resolution 20 proposes its renewal. The 
shorter notice period of 14 clear days would not be used as a matter 
of routine for any general meeting, but only where the flexibility is 
merited by the business of a particular meeting and is thought to be 
to the advantage of shareholders as a whole. The renewed approval 
will be effective until the Company’s Annual General Meeting in 2016, 
when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed.
Note that in order to be able to call a general meeting on less than  
21 clear days’ notice, the Company must in respect of that meeting 
make available electronic voting to all shareholders.

Web communications
Shareholders have previously passed a resolution enabling the Company 
to make documents and information available to shareholders by 
electronic means and via a website, rather than by sending hard  
copies. This way of communicating is enabled in accordance with  
the Companies Act 2006, Rule 6 of the Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules and the Company’ s Articles of Association.
Making documents and information available electronically:
 − enables the Company to reduce printing and postage costs;
 − allows faster access to information and enables shareholders  
to access documents on the day they are published on the 
Company’s website; and 
 − reduces the amount of resources consumed, such as paper,  
and lessens the impact of printing and mailing activities on  
the environment.
The Company provides hard copy documentation to those 
shareholders who have requested this and is, of course, happy  
to provide hard copies to any shareholders upon request.
The Company’s website url is www.taylorwimpey.co.uk and 
shareholder documentation made available electronically is  
generally accessible at www.taylorwimpey.co.uk/corporate/
shareholder-information

The Company also encourages shareholders to elect to receive

Dividend Re-Investment Plan
You can choose to invest your cash dividends, including any special 
dividend, in purchasing Taylor Wimpey shares on the market under 
the terms of the Dividend Re-Investment Plan. For further information 
on the Plan and how to join, contact Capita Asset Services.
Important: Please Read: Action May Be Required:
The DRIP will operate automatically in respect of the Final Dividend  
or 2014 (unless varied beforehand by shareholders) and all future 
dividends, including Special Dividends, until such time as you 
withdraw from the DRIP or the DRIP is suspended or terminated  
in accordance with the Terms and Conditions.
Please note that if you have already elected to participate in the  
DRIP , unless you take positive action to cancel your participation,  
the DRIP will operate automatically in respect of this and future 
special dividends, as it does already for interim and final dividends.
It is therefore very important to note that a DRIP election or the 
revocation of a DRIP election, received or already in place 25 days 
before a dividend payment date will apply to all future dividends, 
whether interim, final or special dividends, until such time as a valid 
new election or revocation of an election is received. 
To assist, please note the following important dates:
Final dividend: 
Record date – Friday 10 April 2015
Last day for DRIP elections (to apply, or to revoke an election,  
to the 2014 Final Dividend) – Saturday 25 April 2015
Pay date – Wednesday 20 May 2015
Special dividend: 
Record date – Friday 22 May 2015
Last day for DRIP elections (to apply, or revoke an election,  
to the 2015 Special Dividend) – Monday 8 June 2015
Pay date – Friday 3 July 2015
Please note than an election or revocation of an election applies 
to all dividends thereafter until such time as further instructions 
are received,
CREST
The company offers shareholders who hold their Taylor Wimpey 
shares in CREST a facility for the receipt of dividends through the 
CREST system. 
For shares held in uncertificated form (CREST), please note that 
elections continue to apply only to one dividend and a fresh election 
must be made, via CREST, for each dividend. 
Full details of the terms and conditions of the DRIP and the actions 
required to make or revoke an election, both in respect of 
Maintenance Dividends (i.e. in this case, the 2014 Final Dividend) and 
any Special Dividends, are available at www.capitashareportal.com  
or on request from the Registrar, Capita Asset Services, The Registry, 
34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent, BR3 4TU, e-mail: shares@
capita.co.uk tel: 0871 664 0381 (UK) or +44 20 8639 3402 
(overseas).
Dividend mandates
We strongly encourage all shareholders to receive their cash 
dividends by direct transfer to a bank or building society account. 
This ensures that dividends are credited promptly to shareholders 
without the cost and inconvenience of having to pay in dividend 
cheques at a bank. If you wish to use this cost-effective and simple 
facility, complete and return the dividend mandate form attached to 
your dividend cheque. Additional mandate forms may be obtained 
from Capita Asset Services. 
Duplicate share register accounts
If you are receiving more than one copy of our Annual Report, it may  
be that your shares are registered in two or more accounts on our 
Register of Members. You might wish to consider merging them into 
one single entry. Please contact Capita Asset Services who will be 
pleased to carry out your instructions in this regard.

Taylor Wimpey and ‘CREST’
Taylor Wimpey shares can be held in ‘CREST’ accounts, which do  
not require share certificates. This may make it quicker and easier for 
some shareholders to settle stock market transactions. Shareholders 
who deal infrequently may, however, prefer to continue to hold their 
shares in certificated form and this facility will remain available for the 
time being, pending the likely general introduction of dematerialised 
shareholdings in due course.
Taylor Wimpey share price
Our share price is printed in many of the UK daily newspapers and  
is also available on our website www.taylorwimpey.co.uk/corporate/
share-price-centre. It appears on BBC Text and other digital television 
interactive services. It may also be obtained by telephoning the  
FT Cityline service on telephone +44 (0)9058 171690 and ask for  
‘Taylor Wimpey’ on the voice activated response (calls cost 75p  
per minute from a BT landline, other networks may vary).
Gifting shares to charity
If you have a small holding of T aylor Wimpey plc shares, you may wish  
to consider gifting them to charity . Y ou can do so through ‘ShareGift’, 
which is administered by a registered charity , Orr Mackintosh Foundation 
Limited. Shares gifted are re-registered in the name of the charity , 
combined with other donated shares and then sold through stockbrokers 
who charge no commission. The proceeds are distributed to a wide 
range of recognised charities. For further details, please contact Capita 
Asset Services or approach ShareGift directly on www.sharegift.org or 
telephone them on +44 (0)20 7930 3737.
Unsolicited approaches to shareholders  
and “Boiler Room” Scams
We receive reports from time to time from T aylor Wimpey shareholders 
who have each received what appear to be fraudulent approaches from 
third parties with respect to their shareholding in the Company. In some 
cases these are ‘cold calls’ and in others correspondence. They 
generally purport to be from a firm of solicitors or an investment 
company and offer, or hold out the prospect of, large gains on T aylor 
Wimpey shares or other investments you may hold.
The approaches normally include the seeking of an advance payment 
from the shareholder, the disclosure of the shareholder’ s bank details  
or the sale of an unrelated investment. Shareholders are advised to  
be extremely wary of such approaches and advised to only deal with 
firms authorised by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). You  
can check whether an enquirer is properly authorised and report scam 
approaches by contacting the FCA on www.fca.org.uk/consumers/ or 
by calling 0845 606 1234.

Annual report 2005
■ ENTERPRISE THREAT PROTECTION “This year has seen the attainment of a long
standing goal of becoming a circa $100m
revenue company occupying a leadership
position within our target market. It is 
the culmination of years of work and an
excellent platform from which to launch
into the next stage of the Company’s
development. With the addition of 
Pat Sueltz to our management team 
we have significantly strengthened our
ability to take full advantage of the market
opportunity open to us. Accordingly, I look
forward to the future with confidence.”

■ The Internet is critical to organisations worldwide.
■ It is also their biggest security threat.
■ Malicious threats such as spam, phishing and
spyware constantly and cumulatively assault
companies – with new threats emerging
almost daily.
■ These threats impact employee productivity,
drain network resources, create financial losses 
and increase liability risks.

02. SurfControl plc Annual report 2005
Your company grew revenue and EBITDA,
and generated significant levels of cash 
flow during the year ending 30 June 2005.
We have broadened our product line and
enhanced its function and effectiveness, our
products have won a number of awards and
we have solidified our position as a global
leader in Enterprise Threat Protection. With all
this I am pleased but with one measure of our
performance I am not satisfied; we grew our
invoicing volumes by just 2%, a result which
demands improvement.
Your Board began a thorough review of our
activities in December 2004 and concluded
that we needed to enhance the experience 
of the executive team. The most significant
result of this is the appointment of 
Patricia C. Sueltz as CEO with effect from 
1 July 2005. Pat brings years of experience in
senior executive roles at IBM, Sun Microsystems
where she led the global services business
and most recently SalesForce.com where she
was President of Global Operations. Pat has
lived and worked in the UK as well as the 
USA and has begun the task of upgrading 
our capabilities and  of putting in place 
the  organisational structure, systems and
processes which will allow us to realise our
growth ambitions. We are delighted that an
executive of Pat’s calibre and experience has
chosen to lead us at this exciting time.
We have a very strong platform from which to
accelerate the growth in our market position.
Our balance sheet is strong; we are a leader in
a large and growing market and our product
line has never been stronger. In addition 
our customers, partners and employees 
are valuable assets, for their support I thank
them sincerely.
Great credit for this strength is due to the
outstanding leadership of Steve Purdham
whose passion, insight and entrepreneurial
flair has driven our Company for the last five
years. Steve’s efforts and achievements have
been a major factor in establishing our
leadership in Unified Threat Management,
his foresight in anticipating market needs 
and in driving our response in products and
services have been invaluable.
We are determined to make the investments
in our “go to market” capabilities which will fit
us for future growth. Your Board and the
executive team are committed to make the
changes necessary to compete vigorously
and delight our customers and partners;
we shall be both relentless and rigorous in 
our execution as we strive to make your
Company more valuable.

04. SurfControl plc Annual report 2005
The Company’s financial position is strong.
We have no debt, are profitable and strongly
cash generative, and in most areas of the
business we made significant progress.
However, the slow down in new business 
in the Americas has caused disapointingly
low billings growth.
Growth is the main challenge and focus 
of our attention. With the convergence 
of the market towards Unified Threat
Management, our market positioning and
messaging, and the strength of our award
winning technologies, we firmly believe
that we have a solid foundation to attain 
and recapture growth.
We are very excited to have recruited 
Pat Sueltz as CEO, who brings a new level 
of experience and expertise to drive the
business  in a growing market where
SurfControl enjoys a strong market position.
Changing Threat Landscape is
driving Market Change – and
enhances opportunity.
The Internet is critical to organisations
worldwide. It is also their biggest security
threat. Organisations are assaulted daily by
an ever-increasing, complex host of threats
targeting their computer networks. Yesterday
it was porn, web abuse, viruses and spam.
Today it’s phishing and spyware. Tomorrow,
it will be something else. Once spawned,
these threats are cumulative and often
morph into something new.
Once these threats were pests or
distractions, now they are
malicious hazards.
With inadequate protection, the success
organisation is jeopardised by significant
productivity and financial losses, hijacking of 
network resources and increased legal
liability. With the proliferation of wireless
technologies, the boundaries of the
organisation disappear. It is now easier than
ever for these malicious threats to enter an
organisation, rendering traditional security
technologies ineffective.
Regulatory compliance and information
confidentiality are high on CEO agendas.
Threats from ”outbound” traffic such as sent
e-mails, attachments, and instant messaging
are as serious as traditional inbound threats.
This has led to the development of a new
approach so that organisations have
maximum protection from the threats from
the minimum number of vendors. This type
of approach, and this market, is known as
Unified Threat Management.
SurfControl has evolved into one of the
leading Internet security companies,
protecting enterprises from bi-directional
threats with multiple layers of protection.
We have invested in the quality, effectiveness
and design of our products such that we can
deliver more layers of threat protection to our
customers. These layers continuously manage
inbound, outbound and internal Internet-
based traffic to stop known, emerging and
customer-specific threats.
We have signiﬁcantly invested in
increasing the quality, effectiveness
and appeal of our products.

SurfControl has redefined traditional filtering
to encompass the ever-increasing and
cumulative impact of Internet blended
threats. We have merged our award winning
products into our new Enterprise Protection
Suite™, which continuously expands an
organisation’s layers of threat protection,
eliminating the need to deploy and manage
multiple products from multiple vendors.
SurfControl differs from and complements
other Internet Security themes by focusing on
both the content and protocols that are sent
and received over web, e-mail, IM and P2P
mechanisms – delivering higher quality“Best of
Breed” protection in these areas. SurfControl’ s
layered threat protection stops porn, viruses,
phishing, spam, spyware and company specific
threats from coming into the business. It also
keeps confidential, non-compliant and legal
liability items from going out of the business.
Another significant area of progress has been
the strengthening of our Adaptive Threat
Intelligence Service™. This is a combination
of technology, people and historical
databases which constantly monitors the
Internet for existing and emerging threats.
This service produces daily updates to
protect our customers effectively and
efficiently, and underpins our subscription
model providing for our increasing financial
forward visibility and strong cash generation.
SurfControl’s Adaptive Threat
Intelligence Service™ powers the
SurfControl Enterprise Protection
Suite™ to proactively identify and
stop threats as they attempt to
enter or exit an enterprise.
Centrally administered policies can be
defined to ensure that the right level of
protection is delivered at a company, group,
or individual level, with relevant graphical
reporting systems to identify risk areas, trends
and overall usage. Protection is delivered at
the perimeter, network and endpoint, even 
if that endpoint is a mobile PC. SurfControl
customers avoid significant business
downtime that might impact productivity
and the bottom line, while also limiting their
legal liability and ensuring regulatory
compliance and confidentiality.
During the year we acquired SpyWare
technology from Apreo Limited. This
acquisition is part of our response to 
the changing nature of threats, and has 
already enabled the launch of a major new
component, Enterprise Threat Shield which
delivers end point security protecting
companies from the impacts of spyware,
games, IM and P2P .
Business development and 
new customers
We have added over 4,000 customers during
the year with more penetration into larger
enterprises than ever before.
New customers include Camelot, Royal
Skandia, Arriva, Avis, the British Library, Hilton
Group plc, Lovells, Roehampton University
and Cable and Wireless.
Given our subscription model, each new
customer delivers longevity and future
revenue. The integration of our products 
into the Enterprise Protection Suite will 
also provide a strong platform to sell more
product and services to the installed base.
Partnership has been a key part of our business
development strategy. Today we partner with
the world’s major organisations as technology
or OEM partners, including BlueCoat, Cisco,
IBM, Juniper, Microsoft, Nokia, Finjan, GT A,
Openwave and PowerNet.

Appointment of Pat Sueltz as
Chief Executive Officer
In order to capitalise on our global position 
in the Internet Security arena, we decided
some time ago that we required a world class
executive with the relevant experience and
knowledge to drive the Company forward 
to its next stage of development. I was
therefore delighted that we were able to
announce the appointment of Pat Sueltz as
our new Chief Executive Officer effective from
30 June 2005. She has an excellent pedigree
and I believe we are fortunate to attract
someone of this calibre to SurfControl. I look
forward to working with Pat in my new role
where I can focus purely on strategy and
technological direction.
Outlook
This year has seen the attainment of a long
standing goal of becoming a circa $100m
revenue company occupying a leadership
position within our target market. It is the
culmination of years of work and an excellent
platform from which to launch into the next
stage of the Company’s development. Whilst
we have not delivered the levels of growth
we might have wished for this year, we are
extremely well positioned to take advantage
of the opportunities in this market and
leverage our current position. With the
addition of Pat Sueltz to our management
team we have significantly strengthened our
ability to take full advantage of the market
opportunity open to us. Accordingly, I look
forward to the future with confidence.

$1 00m
This year has represented an
attainment of a long standing
goal of becoming a circa
$100m revenue company. Financial Review Simon Wilson
07. SurfControl plc Annual report 2005 www.surfcontrol.com
The financial results for 2005 reflect the
underlying strength of SurfControl’s annuity-
based business model. The Group continues
to have no debt, and generates profits with
strong levels of operating and free cash flow.
The deferred income position has continued
to grow and provides a high visibility of
future turnover.
At the same time the growth in invoicing 
(a more immediate measure of sales activity)
has slowed and is currently below the industry
growth rate as a whole. The low rate of growth
in invoicing has primarily arisen from a slow
down in the levels of new business growth in
the Americas. The strength of SurfControl’ s
business model and hence its balance sheet
provides financial stability upon which to
rebuild our invoicing growth rates in the future.
It also provides financial resources to continue
investing in new technology and capital
projects, as well as returning cash to our
investors through stock purchases.
During the year the Group has again
strengthened its position in the Enterprise
market and has steadily improved its renewal
rates with its customers. It has also diversified 
its business mix both geographically outside 
of the Americas, and with products to
complement Web filtering. Currently 39% of
revenue is generated outside of the Americas
and the Group sells a range of web, e-mail, and
spyware products within its Enterprise
Protection Suite.
The challenge of rebuilding invoicing growth
rates is central to the Group’s business strategy.
The strength of the Group’s financial position
will underpin the actions necessary to meet
that challenge.
Acquisitions
On 28 February 2005, the Group acquired
spyware and extended threat technology
from Apreo Limited. The technology controls
file and application distribution in order to 
secure enterprise networks from threats
arising from spyware, games, IM, P2P , music,
games, etc.
The key terms and the accounting for the
acquisition are set out on pages 47 and 48.
The operational results relating to the
acquired assets were consolidated from the
effective date of the acquisition but were not
significant to the results of the Group and
have been included in continuing operations.
Intangible assets arising on consolidation will
be amortised over a 24 month period, and this
started in the third quarter of the year under
review. The purchase consideration was
settled in cash.
Exchange rate fluctuations
The reporting currency of the Group is the
US dollar, indicative of the principal trading
region and hence currency of the Group.
Several other currencies are used for trading
areas outside of the Americas. The Group is
therefore exposed to exchange differences
arising from the translation of the underlying
regional financial statements to the Group’s
reporting currency of the US dollar. The
business has significantly expanded in non-
US denominated currency regions over the
period thereby increasing the potential
exposure to translation differences. The
Group however is not exposed to significant
realised exchange differences arising from 
>>>
An attractive business model,
leading to a sound balance sheet. Financial Review continued
08. SurfControl plc Annual report 2005
day to day transactions, as its policy is to
conduct and settle the majority of trading
transactions in the relevant currency of the
geographic region.
It is also the Group’s policy to seek to
minimise the level of assets and/or liabilities
held in currencies other than the trading
currency of the entity to which such assets
and liabilities relate. In this way the Group
minimises its exposure to mark-to-market
adjustments at any given balance sheet date.
The relative weakness of the US dollar has
had a number of translation effects on the
financial statements in 2005, none of which
have been material.
Turnover
Group turnover increased by 12% to $97.8m
(2004: $87.3m) (2003: $73.2m). All Group
turnover arose from sales of the Group’s
Enterprise Protection Suite of products:
A unified set of web, e-mail and messaging
security solutions. Growth rates outside the
Americas remained strong as did customer
renewal rates throughout the world.
However the rate of growth in Group
turnover in financial year 2005 was less than
in previous years because of slower new
business growth rates in the Americas.
Invoicing, and to a lesser degree turnover,
continued to exhibit patterns of seasonality
within the year, with Q2 and Q4 typically
producing stronger sequential rates of
growth than Q1 and Q3. The Enterprise
sector is the key target market and customer
segment of the Group and includes the
licensing of technology via software
developer kits to Original Equipment
Manufacturers (“OEMs”). OEM turnover
was $3.0m (2004: $4.0m) (2003: $4.0m).
OEM turnover decreased by 25%, as the
Group was in transition from historical 
OEM contracts to a combination of 
revenue share or “meet in the channel”
business relationships.
The charts below show the percentage of
turnover by destination for the Americas and
non-Americas geographic areas for each of
the three years under review. The Americas
remains the Group’s largest market and
generated $59.8m or 61% of the overall Group
turnover. Non-Americas however exhibited a
high annual growth rate in turnover of 27%,
compared to 4% for the Americas. This reflects
investment in sales and marketing in the
various regions around the world outside of
the Americas, and the decline in rates of new
business in the Americas.
Invoicing and deferred income
The Group invoiced $108.2m in the year,
a 2% increase on invoicing of $106.6m for 
the financial year 2004 (2003: $92.1m).
A proportion of the Group’s invoicing is 
not immediately recognised as turnover,
and is deferred over the period of the
contract to which it relates. Such deferred
income typically relates to threat database
subscriptions and software maintenance
contracts. Full details of the Group’s
accounting policies, including those relating
to turnover and deferred income, are given
in note 1 to the financial statements. As at 
30 June 2005, deferred income increased by

$37.5m, or 69%) is due to be released to
turnover over the year to 30 June 2006.
The volume and proportion of the Group’s
business generated via its indirect channel
partners continued to increase in the year.
The Company views this progress as key
success factor in achieving scalable and
profitable growth. The chart below shows
the Group’s invoicing profile by channel
segment for each of financial years
under review.
Selling and distribution 
The Group’s largest area of expenditure is
that of selling and distribution. Costs in this
section of the business amount to $47.4m
(2004: $44.0m) (2003: $39.7m). The business
became more efficient in 2005, with these
costs declining to 48.4% of turnover (2004:
50.4%) (2003: 54.3%), reflecting growth
economies of scale, as well as management
of expenditure. It is management’s
intention to continue to seek economies
of scale combined with more effective
management and leverage of global sales
and marketing costs through common
global messaging, improved sales channel
performance, and increased sales of
multiple or bundled products within the
Enterprise Protection Suite.
The main areas of increased spend compared
to prior years were salaries and benefits for
more experienced sales management
and staff recruited in the period. Overall
headcount was 309 at 30 June 2005
(2004: 309) (2003: 259).
Research and development (“R&D”)
R&D expenditure increased to $13.0m (2004:
$9.7m) (2003: $7.5m) being 13.3% of turnover
(2004: 11.1%) (2003: 10.3%). Cost efficiencies
continue to be achieved through location of
staff in lower-cost employment areas within
the Group relative to the US, and outsourcing
of certain non-core activities, enabling this
increased R&D investment to be targeted 
at key growth areas such as spyware and
appliances. The associated increases in salary
and benefit costs is the principal area of
increased spend compared to prior years.
Headcount increased by 13% to 153
employees at 30 June 2005 (2004:136)
(2003:113).
Other administrative expenditure and
intangible asset amortisation
Other administrative expenses were $19.0m
(2004: $16.8m) (2003: $14.6m), holding steady
at 19.5% (2004: 19.3%) (2003: 19.9%) of
turnover. These expenses have kept pace 
with turnover growth in order to support 
the expansion of infrastructure necessary to
support an expanded global organisation with
a growing portfolio of products. Headcount
increased 3% to 79 (2004: 77) (2003: 71).
The acquisition of assets from both SecureM
Inc in April 2004 and from Apreo Limited in
February 2005 gave rise to an amortisation
charge of $7.8m during the year (2004: $1.4m).
The unamortised balance of these intangible
assets as at 30 June 30 2005 was $9.8m.
Equity based compensation
Equity based compensation comprises 
an employment tax provision and costs in
respect of long term incentive plan share
grants (“L TIPs”). The equity employment tax
provision relates to the potential tax liability
that may crystallise on the exercise of
outstanding options and L TIP shares held 
by directors and employees at 30 June 2005,
based on the then closing middle market
share price of £4.59 (2004: £6.10) (2003: £6.38).
The L TIP share charge of $0.1m (2004: $nil)
(2003: $nil) has been credited to profit and
loss reserve. The balance sheet employment
tax provision of $0.16m (2004: $0.45m) (2003:
$0.54m) declined over the year, reflecting 
the reduction in the Company’s share price.

been charged to the profit and loss account.
Profit on sale of a business
The Group sold its MultiView business unit 
in February 2001 and has in prior years
received deferred payment of sale proceeds.
Net proceeds recognised in the profit and 
loss account were $nil in 2005 (2004: $0.31m)
(2003: $0.38m). Under the terms of the sale
agreement, no further proceeds will 
be received.
Profit before taxation
Profit before taxation declined in the financial
year 2005 to $7.6m (2004: $14.4m) (2003:
$8.9m). This was a direct result of the increase
in intangible asset amortisation charges arising
from the SecureM and Apreo transactions.
Taxation
A net tax charge of $1.2m was recorded for
the year (2004: $2.9m) (2003: $2.5m), and
represents an effective rate of 15% of 
pre-tax profits. Note 8 to the financial
statements on page 46 gives details 
of matters affecting the current tax 
charge, and how it reconciles to the 
charge predicted by applying the UK
standard corporation tax rate to the 
Group profit on ordinary activities 
before taxation.
In accordance with tax authority
requirements around the world and 
OECD guidelines, the Group follows
documented arms-length transfer pricing
methodologies to reflect both the domicile
of its intellectual property and the various
functions performed on behalf of other
Group entities. The Group is currently
generating corporation tax liabilities in 
the UK, Australia and certain US states.
This regional pattern is expected to
continue for the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets of $4.5m (2004: $6.9m)
(2003: $4.2m) have been recognised in the
Group balance sheet. The reduction in the
value of deferred tax assets principally
reflects a prudent and therefore reduced
assessment of the forecast rate at which US
tax losses are expected to be utilised in the
foreseeable future. This assessment reflects
the reduced level of current year invoicing 
in the US.
Liquidity, capital resources and
treasury management
The Group continues to be highly cash
generative with strong levels of both
operating and free cash flow relative to
its levels of profits. Net cash inflow from
operating activities (before cash flows
from exceptional items) was $23.8m (2004:
$32.4m) (2003: $24.1m). Net cash inflow
from returns on investments and servicing
of finance was $2.7m. (2004: $1.8m) (2003:
$0.7m). The net inflow from returns on
investments in all years came primarily 
from bank interest, which amounted to
$2.7m (2004: $1.8m) (2003: $0.8m). The
Group funded the purchase of all tangible
fixed assets in the year from its own cash
resources, and as in previous years has
minimal finance lease commitments. Cash
outflow from capital expenditure was
relatively stable at $2.2m (2004: $2.3m) 
(2003: $1.6m). Overall free cash flow
remained strong at $21.9m (2004: $26.6m)
(2003: $22.1m) as set out in the table opposite.
The Group continues to be highly
cash generative with strong levels
of both operating and free cash flow
relative to its levels of profit. 11. SurfControl plc Annual report 2005 www.surfcontrol.com
Net cash outflow from financing was $11.6m
(2004: Inflow $2.9m) (2003: Inflow $1.2m).
During the year the Company significantly
increased its treasury share programme,
spending $11.8m of cash in purchasing its
own shares (2004: $0.8m) (2003: $nil). The
Board believes that purchase of own shares
is in the best interests of the Company’s
shareholders and plans to continue to do
so. At 30 June 2005 the Group had total
cash holdings of $89.0m (2004: $87.5m)
(2003: $61.7m) earning a current weighted
average rate of return on closing cash of
2.8% p.a (2004: 2.3%) (2004: 2.4%). Net
interest receivable and similar items,
primarily bank interest, was $2.5m (2004:
$1.9m) (2003: $1.1m) reflecting yield
enhancement from both rising interest 
rates in the US and improvements in
treasury management.
Employee share-based incentive schemes
The potential dilution of equity from
granted options varies to the extent 
that they are in-the-money or under water.
As at 30 June 2005, there were 1,036,840
options with an exercise price at or below
£4.59, which was the closing middle 
market price on that day. These options
represent 3.3% of the issued share capital 
as at 30 June 2005. In addition there 
are a further 2,108,598 outstanding options
with a grant price above £4.59 which will 
dilute equity if the share price rises. During
the year the Company issued rights to
272,881 shares under its Long Term
Incentive Plan.
Transition to International Financial
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”)
Listed companies in the UK are required 
to adopt IFRS for accounting periods
commencing on or after 1 January 2005. The
Board considers that it will be ready to adopt
IFRS compliant accounting policies during
the financial year 2006, and be in a position 
to prepare Group IFRS financial statements 
for that year. The Board intend to maintain 
the Group’s voluntary practice of presenting 
a three year profile giving an IFRS transition
date of 1 July 2003. Quarterly comparative 
re-stated financial statements will also be
prepared for fiscal year 2005 to maintain 
the quarterly reporting profile for investors
and analysts.
As at the date of this Report the expected
effects of IFRS are as set out in the Group
Annual Report for 2004.
In accordance with emerging best practice
and the recommendations from the “100
Group of Finance Directors” a reconciliation 
of the 2004 and 2005 financial statements
from UK GAAP to IFRS will be published prior
to the release of the Group’s first quarter 2006
IFRS financial statements in November 2005.
Summary
Rebuilding invoicing growth rates is central 
to the Group’s business strategy. These
financial statements demonstrate and explain
the strength of the Group’s financial position,
which has been generated by its annuity-
based business model. This strong financial
position will underpin the actions necessary
to achieve our goals.

Principal activities and offices
The Group’s principal activity is the development and sale of Internet security products that provide enterprise threat protection, shielding organisations
from known and emerging Internet dangers through Layered Threat Protection
SM
.The Company has redefined traditional “filtering” into a unified set of Web,
e-mail and messaging security solutions that continuously filter inbound and outbound Internet traffic to eliminate spam, spyware, phishing and Web and 
e-mail abuse. SurfControl provides Adaptive Threat Intelligence
SM
from its Global Threat Experts
SM
to respond quickly with automatic, proactive security
updates to protect customers. “SurfControl” is the Group’s primary brand for its Internet security products.
In the third quarter of the year the Group acquired enterprise spyware and extended threat technology from Apreo Limited, for a total estimated cost 
of $7.0m. In the fourth quarter the Group successfully launched its own enterprise threat protection product incorporating this technology.
The Group’s principal go-to-market distribution channel is channel partnerships with resellers, distributors, and a range of OEM partners. These partners may
sell the Company’s products individually or incorporated into a broader unified threat management solution. The Group also sells its products directly via
inside sales and via e-commerce from its website.
Financial results and review of developments
The results for the year are set out in the attached audited financial statements on pages 35 to 62. The directors do not recommend the payment of a
dividend and the retained profit for the year of $6,445,000 is transferred to reserves.
A full review of the operations of the Group during the year, together with an indication of current and future developments can be found in the Chairman’s
and Operating Review statements on page 2 and pages 4 to 6, and in the Financial Review on pages 7 to 11.

purchases were completed at an average price of £5.71 ($10.58) per share. Following these purchases the Company holds 1,195,500 shares in treasury
representing 3.84% of issued share capital at 30 June 2005. At this date the Company has remaining authorisation up to the conclusion of the forthcoming
Annual General Meeting to purchase 2,474,174 ordinary shares. The Board believes that the acquisition of treasury shares is an effective use of shareholder
funds given the Company’s current share price.

Employment policy and involvement
The Group believes in developing and maintaining a diverse, multi-talented and highly motivated workforce. The Group is therefore committed to providing
equal employment opportunities by establishing discrimination-free recruitment and employment practices, and maintaining an environment that is free
from any form of discrimination. The Group companies give full consideration to all employment applications from disabled persons. Disabled employees,
and employees who may become disabled during the course of their employment with the Company or Group, are eligible to participate in all appropriate
training and career development generally available to staff.
The directors acknowledge their responsibilities to consult staff and communicate relevant information to them. All employees have access to the internal
corporate website. The Company also uses other methods of communication such as staff meetings, web casts, video conferencing, instant messaging, and
e-mail, such that the views of employees can be taken into account in making decisions that may affect their interests.
Creditor payment policy
It is Group policy to pay suppliers in accordance with agreed terms and conditions of purchase, provided that the supplier complies with all relevant terms
and conditions. The policy developed is specific to the Group’s businesses and, consequently, adoption of an external code of payment to suppliers is
considered unnecessary. The average time taken to pay purchase invoices by the Group is 28 days (2004: 28 days) (2003: 23 days). Company creditor days
were 26 days (2004: 35 days) (2003: 28 days).
Political and charitable contributions
The Group and Company made no political contributions during the year (2004: $nil) (2003: $nil). Donations to UK charities amounted to $85,108 
(2004: $97,849) (2003: $172,249). In addition the Group donated $9,553 to charities outside of the UK (2004: $10,173) (2003: $4,147).
Directors’ Report
15. SurfControl plc Annual report 2005 www.surfcontrol.com Corporate responsibility
The Group conducts its business having regard to its various stakeholders and the wider community. The directors are committed to a management culture
that promotes the health, safety, and general welfare of employees. As mentioned above full and timely communication is maintained with employees. The
Group aims to foster fair and transparent relations with all its customers, whilst maintaining a clear commercial basis to its business transactions. The Group
ensures payment is made promptly to suppliers, irrespective of their size, unless there are sound business reasons to withhold payment. Group companies
support their communities with involvement in local initiatives, and through charitable contributions. The Board recognises its responsibility to consider
social and environmental issues as these arise and to ensure compliance with relevant local statutory regulations. The Board believes it has adequate
information systems in place to assess any environmental and social concerns that may arise from time to time. These matters will, where relevant, form 
part of the Group’s risk management strategy although as a software developer the Group has no manufacturing facilities that pose environmental issues.
Waste products are recycled in all offices and management aim to ensure responsible use of energy as far as it is economic and practical to do so. The
Group’s website includes a section dedicated to corporate, ethical, employment and environmental issues.
Going concern 
The directors have reviewed budgets and have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue as an operational business for
the foreseeable future. The financial statements have therefore been prepared on a going concern basis.
Auditors
An ordinary resolution to re-appoint KPMG Audit Plc as auditors of the Company is to be submitted to the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Statement of directors’ responsibilities
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year, which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
Company and of the Group and of the profit or loss for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to:
> select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
> make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
> state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
> prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company and the Group will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the
Company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They have general responsibility for taking such
steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Company and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be held at Riverside, Mountbatten Way, Congleton, Cheshire CW12 1DY on 20 October 2005 at 11.30am.
Included in the ordinary business of the meeting are resolutions 3 and 4 to re-appoint Greg Lock and George Hayter respectively as Non-executive Directors.
They each have agreements without a specified fixed term, which are terminable by the Company or the director with three months’ notice. Greg Lock has 
a wide experience in the technology sector having previously worked in several countries as IBM’s Global General Manager, Industrial Sector. George Hayter
has a number of contacts in the technology sector through current and past directorships including most recently the E*Trade Group, Inc, which is quoted
on NASDAQ. Neither director holds any executive position and is able to devote the time required of him as a Board director. Greg Lock is the Non-executive
Chairman of the Group. George Hayter is the Senior Independent Non-executive Director.
The biographical details of the directors that are submitted for re-election may be found on pages 12 to 13.
As well as the ordinary business of the Meeting, resolutions will be proposed to renew for a further year the authority to allot un-issued shares in the
Company, to allot shares for cash free from the pre-emption rights set out in the Companies Act 1985, and to give the Company authority to make market
purchases of it shares.
Directors’ Report
16. SurfControl plc Annual report 2005 Resolution 8 will renew the directors’ authority to allot un-issued shares in the Company in accordance with section 80 of the Companies Act 1985.
The resolution authorises the directors to allot shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of £1,659,443 (being one-third of the issued ordinary share 
capital of the Company at one month prior to the date of this notice plus the maximum current options). The authority will expire at the conclusion 
of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company or on the day 15 months from the date of the passing of this resolution (whichever is the earlier).
The directors have no immediate intention to exercise this authority other than in connection with the Group’s employee share schemes.
Under Section 89 of the Companies Act 1985, equity securities in the Company may not be allotted for cash (otherwise than in respect of an employee
share scheme) without first being offered pro rata to existing shareholders, unless the prior approval of the shareholders is given in a general meeting. The
directors consider that it is in the best interests of the Company to renew the relevant authority given at the Annual General Meeting in 2004. Accordingly,
a Special Resolution to this effect is proposed as Resolution 9 in the notice of the Annual General Meeting. The proposed authority will expire at the
conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company or on the day 15 months from the date of the passing of this resolution (whichever is the
earlier) and permits the directors during this period to issue up to an aggregate nominal amount of £155,572 (representing 5% of the issued share capital 
at one month prior to the date of this notice) without first offering them to existing shareholders.
Under the terms of the Companies Act 1985 and its Articles of Association, the Company has power to purchase its own shares provided that this power has
first been sanctioned by shareholders. Resolution 10 authorises the Company to make purchases of up to 3,111,457 shares (representing 10% of the issued
ordinary share capital of the Company at one month prior to the date of this notice) at a minimum price of 10p and a maximum price (exclusive of expenses)
of not more than 5% above the average of the middle market quotations for the ordinary shares of the Company as derived from the London Stock Exchange
Daily Official List for the 5 business days prior to the purchase. The authority will expire at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company
or on the day 15 months from the date of the passing of this resolution (whichever is the earlier). As at 5 September 2005 (being the last practicable date 
prior to publication of this Report) 3,145,438 options to subscribe for ordinary shares in the Company, pursuant to the SurfControl Executive Share Option
Schemes were outstanding. If exercised as at the date of this document, those options would represent 9.18% of the total issued share capital of the Company
inclusive of shares issued under option. If the full authority to buy back shares is invoked, the same options would represent 10.10% of the total issued share
capital of the Company inclusive of shares issued under option. The fact that the directors are seeking this authority should not be taken as an indication that
the Company will purchase its own shares at any particular price or indeed at all and the directors would only consider making purchases if they believed that
such purchases would be in the best interests of shareholders generally, having regard to the effect on earnings per share.
All of the above resolutions are set out in the separate notice of Annual General Meeting.

Directors’ Report
17. SurfControl plc Annual report 2005 www.surfcontrol.com Corporate Governance
Introduction
The Board supports the principles of the 2003 Combined Code on Corporate Governance (“the Combined Code”). As required by the Listing Rules of the UK
Listing Authority this report describes how the Group has applied the principles of section 1 of the Combined Code.
1. The Board of Directors
The Group is controlled by a Board of Directors that currently comprise the four executive directors and four independent non-executive directors 
(including the Non-executive Chairman). The Non-executive Chairman is Greg Lock. The other Non-executive Directors are George Hayter, Rene Schuster,
and Jane Tozer.
The Board’s responsibilities include setting overall business and market strategy for the Group as a whole. This involves approving significant strategic
decisions such as acquisitions, product and market diversification, and capital structure. It also involves approving annual operating budgets and monitoring
performance against budget, establishing a risk framework and setting risk tolerances, and monitoring executive and management performance. All
operational decisions within this business and market framework are delegated to executive management.
George Hayter, Greg Lock, Rene Schuster and Jane Tozer are shareholders in the Company. All the non-executive directors are considered by the Board to 
be independent of the Company and Group, as defined in section A3.1 of the Combined Code. Each non-executive director possesses considerable outside
expertise, and is able to exercise detached judgement in dealing with matters before the Board. The Senior Independent Director is George Hayter, who 
was appointed to the Board as a non-executive director on 15 June 1998. Although George Hayter holds vested share options from January 2000, the Board
does not consider that this affects his ability to exercise independent judgement.
Board meetings were held on nine separate occasions during the year. In advance of each meeting, the Board is furnished with timely information to enable
it to discharge its duties, including inter-alia reports covering local operating performance and activities, a Group operational summary, management
accounts with budget variance analysis, most recent forecasts, and selected periodic status reports on taxation, working capital management, human
resources, information systems, internal control reviews and changes, treasury and strategic matters. Newly introduced in April 2005, the Board also receives
selected periodic in-depth presentations from departmental management as to the functional operations. The non-executive directors also meet from time
to time, outside of Board and committee meetings, without the presence of executive directors.
The Board has adopted a Schedule of Matters reserved for its approval. Directors have access to the advice of the Company Secretary at all times, and may
seek independent professional and legal advice. Although there is no formal training programme, training is provided to directors on induction and from
time to time on request.
All Board directors are subject to re-election in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, which require no less than one third of directors 
to be eligible for re-election in each calendar year. A director is also subject to re-election at the Annual General Meeting following their initial appointment 
to the Board.
Professional commitments of the Chairman of the Board
Greg Lock is also chairman of Nexagent Limited and held directorships in Target Group Limited and Liberata Limited throughout the year.
The biographies of all of the Board’s directors, and their continuing outside directorships if any, are set out on pages 12 to 13.
18. SurfControl plc Annual report 2005 Board Committees
There are three committees of the Board, which are:
(a) Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee consists of the three Non-executive Directors: Rene Schuster (Chairman), George Hayter, and Jane Tozer. Other board
directors and senior Human Resource managers are from time to time invited to attend remuneration committee meetings at the request of the chairman.
The Committee’s responsibilities are to set the remuneration for the executive directors, and to set the remuneration policy for the Group so as to enable the
recruitment and retention of high calibre executives and senior management. The Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 23 to 33 provides further details
of the Committee’s responsibilities and work. The Committee meets no less than twice each year, and has met four times in the year under review. The full
text of the Committee’s terms of reference may be found on the Company’s website at www.surfcontrol.com/company/corporategovernance.
(b) Audit Committee
The Audit Committee consists of the three Non-executive Directors: Jane Tozer (Chairman), George Hayter and Rene Schuster. In the Board’s opinion, Jane
Tozer has relevant up to date financial experience, and is suitably qualified to chair this committee. Other Board directors and senior accounting managers
are invited to attend audit committee meetings at the request of the chairman.
The Committee is responsible for monitoring all accounting, reporting, control and financial aspects of the executive management’s activities, and for
ensuring that an appropriate risk management framework is in place for the Group. It is also responsible for ensuring that the financial performance of the
Company and Group is properly reported with regard to compliance with UK Company law, accounting standards and best practice requirements of the
Combined Code.
The Committee meets no less than four times a year, and meets with the external auditors each quarter to review their reports in relation to the Group’s
accounts and internal controls. The Committee also reviews significant areas of business and financial risk, and assumptions or judgements made by
management in assessing these risks, and maintains a regular direct dialogue with the finance director. In addition the Committee and/or the chairman
meet periodically with the external auditors without the presence of the finance director or other executive directors. In the year under review, the
Committee met five times.
The Board reviews the need for an internal audit function annually. At present an internal audit function is not considered necessary for a number of reasons:
the size of the Group, the relative simplicity of the nature and type of transactions entered into by the Group, significant executive involvement in the day to
day business, the ongoing improvement of internal controls and the operation of key financial controls via peer review. As the Group increases in size, global
reach, and complexity of business mix, the possible need for an internal audit function will continue to be reviewed at least annually.
The Company has always encouraged open communication between staff, HR, senior management and executive directors. In addition, the Audit
Committee established written guidelines to encourage any employee or executive director to communicate matters of concern directly to the chairman 
or non-executive directors if they wish. These “whistleblowing” procedures were formally adopted on 2 September 2004 and will be reviewed annually to
measure their effectiveness. During the year all contacts made by employees under the policy were recorded in a register and reviewed and discussed at
Board meetings. Appropriate follow up action was taken and recorded in the register.
The Committee is responsible for making recommendations to the Board on the appointment, re-appointment and removal of the external auditors. The
Committee keeps under review the cost effectiveness, independence and objectivity of the external auditors, as well as maintaining a policy governing the
use of external auditors for non-audit services. The policy’s objective is to avoid potential conflicts of interest or circumstances where the external auditor’s
judgement or independence may be compromised, and only to retain the external auditors where their knowledge and expertise provides service over and
above other professional service providers of similar standing. In the year under review, the majority of non-audit services provided by the external auditors
related to tax compliance and planning. Details of the non-audit services, together with their cost, are set out in note 6 on page 45.
The full text of the Committee’s terms of reference, its policy on the use of external auditors for non-audit services, and the whistleblowing policy may be
found on the Company’s website at www.surfcontrol.com/company/investors/corporategovernance.

The Nominations Committee consists of the Chairman and the three Non-executive Directors: Greg Lock (Chairman), George Hayter, Rene Schuster, and
Jane Tozer. The Committee’s responsibilities are to identify, evaluate and select candidates for Board positions, and to review annually the composition and
size of the Board. It makes recommendations on appointments and changes to the composition of the Board.
During the year under review the Committee recommended one executive appointment to the Board: Patricia C Sueltz as Chief Executive Officer. The
recommendation was accepted by the Board. In making this appointment the Board utilised the services of an external search firm. The prime qualities
sought for the position were integrity, extensive experience in running mid- to large-cap organisations in the technology sector, US experience, and a
demonstrable track record of success.
The full text of the Committee’s terms of reference may be found on the Company’s website at www.surfcontrol.com/company/investors/corporategovernance.

Annual performance evaluations
The Combined Code requires that the Board conducts formal annual performance evaluations of the Board as a whole, the individual non-executive
directors, the Chairman, and the Board committees. The Board conducted an evaluation of its effectiveness in a separate meeting with all members present.
Attendance at Board and Committee meetings was reviewed and each Board member provided his or her assessment of the Board’s performance. Input
was obtained from the auditors on the performance of the Audit Committee.
Whilst the assessment results were broadly positive, select areas for improvement were identified, together with specific recommended actions. The Group
is committed to continuous improvement in its business operations, and this same ethos applies to the Board.
Separately the Senior Independent Director conducted an assessment of the performance of the Chairman with input from each member of the Board. The
Chairman was absent from the discussions. This assessment was shared with the Chairman and suggestions made for improvement were accepted by him.
For the year under review, as in prior years, the executive directors’ performance is appraised by the Chairman (who also obtains input from the
independent Non-executive Directors) in conjunction with the Chief Executive. This follows the Chief Executive’s own evaluation of their performance 
and contribution to the Company. The Chairman also evaluates the performance against objectives of the Chief Executive. The Remuneration Committee
considers these evaluations in their decisions of awards of bonuses for the year, and in the setting of future compensation for the executive directors.
Corporate Governance
20. SurfControl plc Annual report 2005 2. Shareholder relations
The Group keeps in contact with investors through a regular communication programme involving a variety of analyst, institutional and retail shareholder
meetings, recorded telephone conference calls, and technology bank conference presentations. On a pre-set schedule, the Group publishes unaudited
results each quarter via Reuters News Service. The Group’s annual and interim reports are circulated to shareholders, all known interested parties, and
through the Financial Times/Daily Telegraph subscription service. The pre-set publication schedule, together with downloadable copies of all financial results
and summaries of operating metrics is also published on the Group’s website. The Group also publishes on the Company’s website downloadable copies of
all presentations made to investors or analysts. These activities are an integral part of the Company’s policy of maintaining a high level of transparency with
investors and complying with its obligations as a listed company. The Company also hosts an annual Analyst Day where non-financial aspects of the Group’s
operations and products are discussed. The CEO and Finance Director are the primary points of contact for shareholder relations, and the Chairman and
Senior Independent Director are available on an ongoing basis to meet with major shareholders, and will promptly respond to any ad hoc requests for
meetings. In addition, the Chairman extends an offer to meet all of the Company’s top 10 major shareholders each year, together with the CEO. Regular
feedback is given to the full Board on governance, strategy or any other significant issues that have been raised by institutional shareholders.
Save in exceptional circumstances, all Board directors attend the Annual General Meeting and shareholders are invited to ask questions concerning the
formal business, or meet with the Board afterwards for more general questions. Notice of the meeting and any related documents are sent to shareholders
at least 20 working days in advance of the meeting. The level of proxy votes lodged for each resolution is announced at the meeting and a copy of the
related Stock Exchange announcement is available at www.surfcontrol.com/company/investors/RNS announcements.
3. Internal control
The directors acknowledge their responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control. Internal control systems are designed to meet the particular needs
of the Group and the risks to which it is exposed, and by their nature can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement
of financial information or safeguarding of assets.
Guidance for directors, “Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code” was published in September 1999. The Group considers that it
complied with this guidance for the year ending 30 June 2005, and through to the date of the approval of the financial statements.
A review of the business risks faced by the Group and the effectiveness of its internal controls has been undertaken in the year and will be updated annually.
Business risks and internal controls are assessed by a number of methods, including regular departmental management interviews, in-depth Board reviews
of selected functional areas, and the periodic use of external consultants to independently assess areas of potential risk.
(i) Control environment
The Group’s control environment is the responsibility of the Board, however the implementation and day to day monitoring of internal controls is delegated
to the operational managers. Operational matters are communicated to the Board through operating unit or global function reports at each board meeting.
The effectiveness of financial internal controls is assessed annually and reported to the Board by the Chief Financial Officer. Any change to effectiveness of
the financial internal controls is reported at each board meeting. The Board also receives a quarterly review from the external auditors, in addition to the 
year end review, covering the scope of controls that they have sought to rely on in order to review, or form an opinion on, the financial statements.
(ii) Risk assessment
The Board has established a formal procedure to monitor the risk environment and reviews how controls are developed and adapted to minimise the Group’s exposure.
(iii) Financial reporting
The monthly results of the operating units are reported monthly to the Board and compared to the current budget. In addition, key performance indicators
(“KPIs”) relevant to the Group are monitored more frequently; on a daily and weekly basis by senior management, for example invoicing levels and sales mix,
cash flows and collections efficiency, and leads generated by marketing. Any trend in the KPIs away from budget is brought to the attention of the Board.
A comprehensive budget is produced once a year and is reviewed and approved by the Board. Rolling quarterly operating forecasts are completed and reported 
to the Board each month. Budgets are devolved to local and regional operational management who are responsible for managing their operating units within
budgetary constraints. Individual department managers are aware of and accountable for their authorisation limits with regard to expenditure and staff recruitment.
Corporate Governance
21. SurfControl plc Annual report 2005 www.surfcontrol.com (iv) Non-financial reporting
The executive directors meet twice monthly to discuss operational and strategic matters. Once per quarter these meetings cover strategic matters with a
time-frame extending beyond the current operating plans and budgets.
Senior management meet monthly via telephone or video link to review and discuss short-term tactical and operational matters. These meetings are global
in nature and bring all disciplines together at each meeting. Issues that affect multiple departments and communication are explicitly targeted as important
agenda items.
Management in sales, marketing, product management, engineering, technical support, human resources and legal meet at least monthly as teams to
monitor and assess progress against current operating plans, as well as opportunities to improve inter-operation.
(v) Treasury policy
The Board has a formal policy governing its treasury function, which is reviewed annually by the Board. The policy’s objective is to produce a competitive
yield on Group funds without exposing the Group to a significant level of risk, such that sufficient cash is preserved for working capital and investment
needs. The following risks are explicitly addressed: liquidity, counterparty, product, interest, and foreign exchange.
4. Provisions of the Code
Throughout the financial year ended 30 June 2005, and through to the date of approval of these financial statements, the Board consider that the Group has
complied with Section 1 of the Combined Code except to the extent described below:
Non-executive Director’s share options
The Company has in the past granted options over ordinary shares to George Hayter and currently he holds 800 outstanding options at a price of £8.49. The
Board believes that this interest in share options has not compromised his independence and George Hayter has subsequently been appointed the Senior
Independent Director.

Introduction
This Report sets out the remuneration policy operated by the Company in respect of the Executive Directors, together with disclosures on Directors’
remuneration required by the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (“the Regulations”). The auditors are required to report on the “auditable”
part of this Report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the Report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 
(as amended by the Regulations). The Report is therefore divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
The Board have reviewed the Group’s compliance with section 1 of the 2003 Combined Code on Corporate Governance (“the Combined Code”) on
remuneration related matters and it is the opinion of the Board that the Group complied with all remuneration related aspects of section 1 of the Combined
Code during the year.
Unaudited information
1. Remuneration committee
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing policy on remuneration for executive directors and senior management below Board level 
and for determining specific remuneration packages for each of the executive directors.
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Rene Schuster and its other members are George Hayter and Jane Tozer. The Remuneration Committee
members have no material personal financial interest other than as shareholders in matters to be decided, no potential conflicts of interests arising from
cross directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
During the year the Committee consulted Steve Purdham and Greg Lock about its proposals relating to the remuneration of other executive directors. The
Committee also consults with other senior members of staff on an occasional basis. Where executive directors have attended a Remuneration Committee
meeting there was no discussion relating to their own remuneration and benefits. No executive is involved in determining his or her own remuneration.
The Committee receives market data on competitive levels of compensation from New Bridge Street Consultants and Radford US. These firms, which were
not appointed by the Committee, provide general remuneration information to the Human Resources department from time to time but are not retained to
provide any other consulting services to the Committee or the Group generally.
The Committee has taken advice from Halliwell Consulting during the year in respect of the design, implementation and operation of the new Long Term
Incentive Plan (LTIP). The Company also took advice from Halliwell Consulting in respect to accounting for share-based payments under IFRS 2.
Halliwell Consulting was appointed by the Committee in respect to work on the LTIP .
2. Terms of reference
The Committee works within detailed terms of reference, which are set by the Board. Copies of the Committee’s terms of reference are available from the
Group’s website, www.surfcontrol.com/company/corporategoverance and are summarised below:
> The scale and structure of all aspects of remuneration for the executive directors and the Non-executive Chairman.
> The Group’s overall policy on senior management remuneration.
> The level and performance basis for share option or other share-based awards to executive directors, senior management and staff.
> The maintenance of service agreements with the Chairman and executive directors.
The fees for non-executive directors are a matter reserved for a Committee of the Board consisting of the Chairman and executive directors.
3. Remuneration policy overview
The Remuneration Committee’s overall policy aim is to provide a remuneration package which supports the achievement of the Company’s three year
roadmap to success. Specifically this involves providing a performance based remuneration package through the operation of annual and long-term
performance plans which are focused on motivating and encouraging executive directors and other senior management to achieve the relevant Group
growth and financial performance targets set out in the roadmap to success.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee is mindful of the following requirements for the Company’s remuneration policy; namely that the policy should:
> allow the Company to retain the talent needed to execute its business strategy;
> enable the Company to be competitive when recruiting appropriate skilled and experienced newcomers; and
> align rewards with the interests of shareholders.
Directors’ Remuneration Report 24. SurfControl plc Annual report 2005
When mapping out the levels of each element of the remuneration package for executives the Remuneration Committee looks at other comparable
companies in the global software technology sector. The following table sets out the broad policy position for each element of the Company’s remuneration
package compared to these companies:
Base Salary Bonus potential Share incentives Pension Total package
Median Upper Quartile Upper Quartile Lower Quartile Median – Upper Quartile
The policy is designed only to provide an upper quartile total package if bonus is earned and share incentives vest. It should be noted that the real value
received by the executives under the share incentive arrangements will be dependent upon the degree to which the associated performance conditions
have been satisfied at the end of the three year performance period and the share price of the Company at this time.
The Committee, when setting remuneration for the executives, also takes into account practice applicable to other employees within the Group.
The Remuneration Committee will continue to review the policy on an annual basis to ensure that it is in line with the Company’s objectives and 
shareholders’ interests.
Throughout the year under review the Committee has adopted the principle that the greater the potential award the more stretching the relevant
performance target.
No specific information for Pat Sueltz or Kevin Blakeman is included in the unaudited section of this report, as neither director was on the Board for the full
financial year.
The Company encourages executive directors to take one outside appointment to broaden their experience. Executive directors are allowed to keep the
fees earned from these outside appointments. Steve Purdham was paid $5,575 for his non-executive position on the board of Manchester Technology Fund
Limited. Patrick Jolly was paid $59,470 for his non-executive position on the board of Findel plc.
4. Remuneration
The Committee is of the view that a significant proportion of executive remuneration should be linked to corporate performance so that the interests of 
the executives are aligned as far as possible with those of shareholders. Performance related payments for the executive directors for the financial year
ended 30 June 2005 consisted of a combination of cash bonuses and LTIP awards. The following pie charts show the elements of the total expected
remuneration package set out in the table on page 28.

Basic salary
Policy: median
When determining the salary of the executive directors the Remuneration Committee takes into consideration:
> levels in pay and annual increases within other comparable companies in the global software sector;
> the performance of the individual executive director;
> the individual executive director’s experience and responsibilities; and
> pay and conditions throughout the Group.
The following table sets out the salary information for the executive directors in the currency of the country in which the executive resides:
Salary year ending Salary year ending Percentage rise 
Name 30 June 2004 30 June 2005 2004 to 2005
Steve Purdham £195,000 £195,000 0
Simon Wilson $285,000 $308,000 8
Patrick Jolly £200,000 £208,000 4
Bonus
Policy: upper quartile
Annual bonus arrangements are intended to incentivise the executive directors to achieve the Group’s pre-determined operational objectives for the year
under review, which are stepping stones to the achievement of the three year roadmap for success.
Executive bonuses are based on a mix of financial objectives relating to regional or Group revenue and Group EBITDA. The minimum threshold achievement
levels are that 75% of on-target bonuses become payable for achieving 90% of annual EBITDA targets and 95% of quarterly EBITDA targets. The use of
EBITDA as a performance measure closely aligns the executives with corporate strategy and the attainment of these targets is considered important in
attaining growth in shareholder value. The Remuneration Committee feels strongly that at this stage of the Company’s development the bonus performance
targets should also encourage growth in revenue, which will enhance the value of the Company in the medium- to long-term, and not act as a disincentive
to acquisitions which, although revenue enhancing, may in the short-term have an impact on earnings per share or return on capital employed.

Performance measure (percentage of salary) (percentage of salary) (percentage of salary) 
Group or regional revenue 52 24 28

Total as percentage of salary 66 31 35
Bonus targets and measures are reviewed and agreed by the Remuneration Committee at the beginning of each financial year to ensure that they are
appropriate to the current market conditions and position of the Company, so that they continue to remain challenging. The structure of the bonus targets
for the year ending 30 June 2006 will be similar to those operated for 2005. The maximum bonus potential for the year ending 30 June 2006 is 100% of the
relevant executive director’s salary. Bonuses are not pensionable.
Share incentives
Policy: upper quartile
Overview
During the previous year the Remuneration Committee reviewed its share incentive policy and concluded that the interests of shareholders and executives
would be better aligned through awarding whole shares under an LTIP (which was approved by shareholders at the 2004 Annual General Meeting) rather
than using options. Share options will only be granted to executive directors on recruitment, although options may be granted to other senior management.
This difference in policy between the executive directors and other senior management is mainly due to greater familiarity with options in the United States,
although this policy will be kept under review as local practice changes over time.
The Company’s share incentive schemes are operated without any significant cost.
Shareholding requirements
In order to further align the interests of shareholders with those of the executives, the Remuneration Committee has introduced minimum shareholding
guidelines to encourage substantial long-term share ownership by the executive directors. By encouraging the executive directors to build up shareholdings
it will demonstrate their ongoing commitment to, and confidence in, the Company. The guidelines will require that over a five year period executive
directors build up and retain a holding of shares based on a percentage of salary as per the table below:
Position Recommended shareholding requirement as 
percentage of salary (built up over five years)
CEO 200% 
All other executive directors 100%
The Remuneration Committee expects this requirement to be built up through the retention of some shares acquired by the executive directors under the
Company’s share schemes or through individual market purchases. If the executive directors do not build up such percentages, the Remuneration
Committee may take this into account when considering the level of future incentive awards.
Dilution
In common with a number of companies in the technology sector the Company sought an overall dilution limit greater than the standard ABI limits of 10%
of issued share capital for its share schemes. A limit of 20% was approved by the Company’s shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting on 14 July
2000. The Remuneration Committee recognises that practice has changed over the last three years and that this level of dilution is no longer seen as in line
with corporate governance best practice. It is clearly impractical to reduce the Company’s current level of dilution immediately.Therefore the Company
intends to address the situation by granting fewer options over newly issued shares and using market purchased shares to satisfy awards under the LTIP .
These changes, coupled with historical share incentives falling out of the dilution calculation, will move the Company closer to the 10% limit over time.

Benefits
Policy: market practice
The Company provides market practice benefits for executives of this level of seniority. Benefits in kind include a Company car (or allowance) for UK based
directors, access to Group employee medical schemes and life assurance cover for all directors.
Pension
Policy: lower quartile
The Group operates defined contribution schemes for its executive directors, consistent with its policy for its employees. The parent company contributes
up to 10% of basic salary into the UK based money purchase scheme in respect of Patrick Jolly and amounts as agreed by the Committee into a separate
executive money purchase pension scheme for Steve Purdham.
During the year SurfControl Inc. provided 401k employer contributions for US based executives at the lower of 3% of annual salary or 50% of the personal
contributions paid by the executive. For FY06, the contribution has been increased to the lower of 6% of annual salary or 100% of personal contributions.
Personal contributions for all US employees are subject to a cap set annually by the IRS which is currently $14,000.
These schemes are administered independently of the Company or any group company. Details of contributions made by the Group on behalf of directors
are given on page 31.
The Company does not anticipate the change in pension legislation in the UK on 6 April 2006 will affect its current pension provision. The Company would
not, in any case, provide executives with compensation for loss of tax relief on pension contributions.
No director received any payment from Group pension arrangements in the year.

* The LTIP award is an estimate of the potential intrinsic value of the award made in the year. This cost has been spread over a three-year vesting period in the profit and loss account as
required by UITF 17 abstract, Employee Share Schemes. It should be noted that the value of LTIP awards is based on the profit and loss account charge, which includes an assessment of 
the likelihood of the performance conditions being satisfied. The actual benefit provided by the LTIP awards will only be determined three years after the date of grant, and will be based on
the Company’s comparative TSR performance at that point. 29. SurfControl plc Annual report 2005 www.surfcontrol.com

liable to make a payment to any of the executive directors is on cessation of employment. No payment is due on either a Company takeover or liquidation.
In addition, executive directors will be expected to mitigate their loss. Further, the Remuneration Committee ensures that there have been no unjustified
payments for failure. None of the executive directors’ contracts provides for liquidated damages. There are no special provisions contained in any of the
executive directors’ contracts which provide for longer periods of notice on a change of control of the Company. Further, there are no special provisions
providing for additional compensation on an executive director’s cessation of employment with the Company.

Directors’ Remuneration Report 34. SurfControl plc Annual report 2005
We have audited the financial statements on pages 35 to 62. We have also audited the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described
as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been
undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Directors’ Remuneration Report. As described on page 16, this includes responsibility 
for preparing the financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards. Our responsibilities, as independent
auditors, are established in the United Kingdom by statute, the Auditing Practices Board, the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and by our
profession’s ethical guidance.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our
opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and transactions
with the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 18 to 22 reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal
control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control
procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report, including the Corporate Governance Statement and the unaudited part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. We consider the implications for our report if we
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis,
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited. It also
includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with
sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
> The financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the group as at 30 June 2005 and of the profit of the 
group for the year then ended.
> The financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 1985.

1. Accounting policies
The following principal accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items considered material in relation to the Group’s 
financial statements.
Accounting convention
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
The functional currency of the Group is US dollars as the majority of the Group’s business is conducted in the United States and accordingly amounts in the
financial statements are denominated in that currency.
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of SurfControl plc and its subsidiary undertakings made up to 30 June 2005. Unless
otherwise stated, the acquisition method of accounting has been adopted. Under this method, the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired in the year
are included in the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account from the date of acquisition.
Under section 230 (4) of the Companies Act 1985 the Company is exempt from the requirements to present its own profit and loss account.
Turnover and deferred income
Turnover represents the value of goods and services (net of VAT and other regional sales tax) delivered in the normal course of business. Turnover from
software and appliance perpetual licence sales is recognised once the licence is delivered, all significant obligations in relation to the sale have been fulfilled,
and where the sales price is fixed and determinable. Sales made via channel partners are neither invoiced, nor recognised as turnover, until the product or
service is delivered to the end customer. Turnover from the following items are recognised over the relevant period of the contract on a straight-line basis:
software/appliance support and maintenance, threat database subscriptions, Cyber Patrol home product subscriptions, and OEM contract licences. Turnover
from services is recognised upon completion. Where the proportion of the total sale price attributable to different elements of the sale is not specifically
identified, an estimate is made based upon the published list prices for each of the individual elements.
Deferred income represents the value of goods and services (net of VAT and other regional sales tax) that has been invoiced but not considered delivered 
or completed, plus the unrecognised portion of turnover from software/appliance support and maintenance, threat database subscriptions, Cyber Patrol
home product subscriptions, and OEM contract licences. Deferred income is carried forward within creditors, and released to turnover in the Profit and Loss
Account in future periods on a straight-line basis.
Research and development
All research and development expenditure is written off as incurred.
Technical support
All pre- and post-sales support expenditure is written off as incurred.
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year, and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment 
of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes. Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the
treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise
required by FRS 19.
Pensions
The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes, the assets of which are held separately from those of the Group in independently
administered funds. Contributions are charged to the Profit and Loss Account as incurred.
Equity compensation
The employment tax charge arising on the future potential exercise of Inland Revenue unapproved options and LTIP shares is charged to the Profit and 
Loss Account over the period from the date of grant to the date the equity based benefits unconditionally vest. The charge is based upon the difference
between the grant price and the closing middle market price at the balance sheet date. Provision is also made for the intrinsic value of LTIP shares,
which is charged to the Profit and Loss Account over the vesting period (which is the same as the performance period) and credited to reserves.

1. Accounting policies continued
Intangible assets and goodwill
Intangible assets include the fair value of acquired intellectual property and goodwill. Acquired goodwill (representing the excess of the fair value of the
consideration and associated costs over the fair value of the separable net assets acquired) arising on consolidation is capitalised. Acquired intellectual
property is also capitalised, where in the opinion of the directors it satisfies the recognition criteria given in FRS 10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Acquired
intellectual property and positive goodwill is amortised to nil by equal annual instalments over its estimated useful economic life, unless impaired, in which
case it is written down to its recoverable amount. For acquisitions to date, the estimated useful economic life of these assets has been two years.
On the subsequent disposal or termination of the business, the profit or loss on disposal or termination is calculated after charging the unamortised amount
of any related goodwill.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
Tangible fixed assets are recorded at cost. The carrying value of such assets is written down by the amount of any impairment, and the loss is recognised 
in the Profit and Loss Account in the period in which this occurs.
Included within tangible fixed assets are the project costs associated with the construction of various software and hardware systems for use within 
the Group’s internal systems. Cost includes basic salary, related employer tax costs, and travel expenses for computer engineers, for the duration of the
development stage of the application. Also included in the asset cost is any related external consultancy or engineering fees. All costs relating to initial
planning or aborted projects are written off to Profit and Loss Account as incurred.
Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until they are completed, at which time the final asset cost is transferred to Computer equipment
and software or Fixtures and fittings.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of tangible fixed assets over their estimated useful
economic lives as follows:
Computer equipment and software – over 3 years
Motor vehicles – over 4 years
Fixtures and fittings – over 5 years
Investments
Fixed asset investments, which principally relate to the Company’s investment in subsidiary undertakings, are stated at cost less any provisions for
impairment in value.
Cash and liquid resources
Cash, for the purpose of the cash flow statement, comprises cash in hand, deposits repayable on demand and investments in instant access money market
managed funds. Liquid resources are current asset investments which are disposable without curtailing or disrupting the business and are either readily
convertible into known amounts of cash at or close to their carrying values or traded in an active market. Liquid resources comprise term deposits of one
year or less and certificates of deposit.

1. Accounting policies continued
Leasing and hire purchase commitments
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and are depreciated over their useful lives. The corresponding
liability for the capital element is recorded as borrowings, and the interest element of the rental obligations is charged to the Profit and Loss Account over
the period of the lease on a straight-line basis.
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the Profit and Loss Account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Provision is made for onerous leases relating to vacant properties.
Foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities of each entity denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Group are translated at the rates of
exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Transactions in such currencies are recorded at the average rate ruling during the period of the transaction.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the opening net assets of entities which principally operate in currencies other than US dollars to the
exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date, and the difference between the profit and loss accounts of such entities translated at an average rate and at
the closing rate, are recorded as movements on reserves.
All other differences are taken to the Profit and Loss Account.
Relevant rates of exchange were:

2. Segmental analysis continued
Analysis by product group
During the current and preceding financial years the Group had one product group and one class of business, the development and sale of Internet 
security products.
Analysis by continuing operations
The Company acquired technology and certain assets from Apreo Limited on 28 February 2005. It is not possible to separately identify the post acquisition
profit before tax and interest relating to the acquired technology assets because they were immediately integrated with other like Group operations.
Intangible asset amortisation of $1,173,000 has been charged to the UK segmental results shown above in respect of this acquisition.

On 28 February 2005 the Group completed the purchase of Spyware and extended threat protection technology from Apreo Ltd, a company incorporated
in Israel, together with assets relating to a software engineering unit based in Israel. The aggregate consideration was $7,017,000, comprising $6,902,000
purchase consideration and acquisition costs of $115,000. Included in the purchase consideration is deferred consideration of $70,000 in respect to a sales
related earn-out that may be payable in February 2006.

(b) Adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill and appliance technology
During the fourth quarter the Group finalised the value of an earn-out in respect to the acquisition of appliance technology acquired from SecureM, Inc 
and its China based sales and distribution operation. The estimated earnout of $3,123,000 at 30 June 2004 was reduced by $1,808,000 to $1,315,000. As at 
30 June 2005 the amount of the earn-out that remained payable was $589,000. During the fourth quarter the Group also made completion and hindsight
period adjustments in respect to the provisional fair value of assets and liabilities of the sales and distribution operation. These adjustments amounted to 
a reduction in acquired net liabilities, and of acquired goodwill of $174,000. The adjustments related to payroll compensation and general accruals. 49. SurfControl plc Annual report 2005 www.surfcontrol.com

The equity based compensation provision for UK Employer’s National Insurance and other non UK employment taxes relates to amounts payable on the
potential profit arising from the future exercise of unapproved options and long-term incentive share rights (“LTIPs”) granted to directors and employees.
The provision is charged to the Profit and Loss Account on a straight line basis over the relevant vesting period of the outstanding options and LTIPs. The
provision is based upon the Company’s closing share price on techMARK as at 30 June 2005 of £4.59. The above charge may vary as it is dependent upon
prevailing tax law, future share price movements and the number of options/LTIP shares in issue.

Total called up share capital 5,032 5,027 4,946
The authorised share capital is denominated in UK sterling and consists of 54,000,000 10p ordinary shares with a nominal value of £5,400,000. Fluctuations 
in the reported US dollar value wholly arise from exchange rate fluctuations.
The issued ordinary share capital of the Company in UK sterling at 30 June 2005 was £3,111,457. The Company’s share capital has been translated into 
US dollars on a cumulative basis, at exchange rates prevailing as and when capital flows occurred. Movements in issued share capital over the period 
wholly arose from the exercise of Company share options.
The ordinary shares of 10p each carry one vote and have no fixed rights to dividends. They are entitled to participate equally in the assets of the Company
on a winding up.
Employee share schemes
The Group operated two share option schemes and a long-term share incentive plan (“LTIP”) during the financial year.
On 2 April 1992 the “JSB Computer Systems Executive Share Option Scheme” was adopted by the Board of Directors. The scheme has not been approved 
by the Inland Revenue. No options were granted during the financial year and there is no intention to grant further options under this scheme.
On 11 September 1998 the Board adopted the “JSB Software Technologies 1998 Executive Share Option Scheme” (“the 1998 scheme”). The scheme is
approved by the Inland Revenue although a schedule is incorporated into the rules allowing the grant of unapproved options. The scheme is administered
by the Remuneration Committee.
On 14 July 2000 in an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company shareholders approved minor amendments to the 1998 scheme including revision 
to the maximum limit on the number of shares for which options may be granted from 15% to 20% of the issued ordinary share capital.
On 21 October 2004 the Board adopted the “SurfControl long-term incentive plan” . The LTIP is administered by the Remuneration Committee and is not
approved for Inland Revenue purposes. The practical operation of the LTIP and Company share option schemes is described in the Directors’ Remuneration
Report on pages 23 to 33. 56. SurfControl plc Annual report 2005

The principal financial risks faced by the Group are counterparty, exchange rate, interest rate and liquidity risks. Counterparty risk is managed by placing cash
deposits with banks principally in the UK and US, which have satisfactory credit ratings. To balance interest rate and liquidity risk the Group places its cash
balances in excess of immediate requirements on deposit with the intention of maximising income whilst ensuring funds are available to meet the Group’s
expenditure requirements. Exchange rate risk is managed by minimising balances in currencies other than those of local operations. The Group’s policy is 
not to enter into forward exchange contracts.
Cash and other liquid resources consist of cash held in current/deposit accounts, money market funds, certificates of deposit, and money market term
deposits. Liquid resources at 30 June 2005 had a weighted average period to maturity of eight weeks and earned interest at a weighted average rate of
3.08% per annum.
There was no significant differences between book value and fair value (determined by discounting future cash flows at current interest rates) for these
funds. No details regarding financial exposure of the short-term debtors and creditors have been included. The Group does not engage in any hedging 
in respect of interest rate risks. There are no material committed undrawn facilities at year end. 61. SurfControl plc Annual report 2005 www.surfcontrol.com

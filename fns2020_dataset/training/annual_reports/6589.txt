GKN at a Glance
www.gkn.com I am pleased to be able to report that our results for the
year demonstrate a further increase in profitability and
earnings per share with particularly strong contributions
from our two largest businesses, Driveline and Aerospace.
Consistent with our objective of increasing the dividend
progressively in line with the long term trend in earnings,
your Board recommends that the dividend for 2007
should be increased from 12.8p to 13.5p per share.
GKN continued to make significant progress against its
strategic objectives in 2007. Whilst the economic
uncertainty that characterised the end of 2007 looks set
to continue, I believe GKN is as well placed as it can be to
withstand the effects of this and to continue on its course
to provide long term shareholder value. Our Aerospace
order book is strong. Despite the declining rates of growth
in some of our Automotive markets, there remain
considerable growth opportunities particularly in the
emerging markets of Asia Pacific, South America and
Eastern Europe. GKN’s foresight in reorganising its asset
base and making long term investment in these regions
leaves the Group well positioned to take advantage of this
growth. In addition, product developments in torque
technology and off-highway driveline systems together
with a strong order book at Sinter Metals provide
opportunities for further progress.
Equally, the economic conditions should not prevent
continuing growth through careful strategic acquisitions.
An example of this is the proposed acquisition of the
Airbus wing component and sub-assembly plant at Filton
in the UK for which we were selected as preferred partner
by Airbus in the closing weeks of 2007, and which would
substantially increase the size of our Aerospace business.
GKN has always valued having a strong Board of
Directors. In this context it was particularly pleasing to
announce in 2007 the appointment of three new executive
Directors: Marcus Bryson as Chief Executive Aerospace,
Andrew Reynolds Smith as Chief Executive Powder
Metallurgy, OffHighway and Industrial Services, and Bill
Seeger as Finance Director. All of these were internal
appointments and demonstrate the continuing strength of
our management succession planning. Also during the
year Nigel Stein, formerly Finance Director, was
appointed Chief Executive Automotive. All major business
areas are now represented on the Board, with a good
balance being maintained between non-executive and
executive Directors.
I am delighted to welcome Richard Parry-Jones to the
Board as a non-executive Director with effect from
1 March 2008. Richard retired from Ford Motor Company
at the end of 2007, after 38 years’ service, where he was
responsible for global production development and group
technology. I am sure he will make a significant
contribution to GKN’s future development.
Sir Ian Gibson retired from the Board at the end of 2007.
Sir Ian had been a non-executive Director of the Company
for six years, for two of which he was Senior Independent
Director. Sir Ian made an invaluable contribution to the
strategic development of the Group during a time of
significant change. We thank him for his wise counsel and
support and wish him well in the future. I am pleased that
Sir Peter Williams has taken over the role of Senior
Independent Director.
We remain committed to maintaining a high quality,
balanced Board of Directors at the head of your Company.
This commitment to quality in people extends throughout
the organisation and I am particularly pleased with the
progress that has been made towards ensuring that GKN
employees worldwide feel they are part of a single family
with common, well understood goals and values. This is
an important ingredient in our strategy to deliver long
term shareholder value and ensure the continued
sustainability of our business.
I share Sir Kevin’s pride in the achievements of our
employees worldwide who, in 2007, did something truly
extraordinary and contributed an additional $1.7 million
to their local communities. The project was called GKN
Mission Everest and is described on pages 46 to 47.
I urge you to read about it.
I am conscious that this is the 249th year since our
inception — a remarkable achievement by anybody’s
standards. In the true spirit of sustainability, I see no
reason why we should not now have an eye to the next
250 years. For the immediate future, however, based on
our performance in 2007, the continuing competitiveness
of our product technologies and the strength of our
market positions, I am confident that GKN has the
resilience to continue to make progress even in the
current challenging economic conditions.

Committed to growth
GKN has made excellent progress in 2007.
Strong contributions from Driveline and Aerospace helped
the Group deliver another year of increased sales and a
significant improvement in profits and earnings per share.
Our strategic restructuring programme has been
concluded, repositioning our Automotive and Powder
Metallurgy businesses to take advantage of high growth
markets and enabling them to compete from a lower
cost base.
Exceptional levels of new business have been secured
across the Group, giving us continuing confidence in our
ability to increase market shares and grow revenues.
GKN technology has contributed to a number of customer
product breakthroughs in the automotive, off-highway
and aerospace sectors. They will provide value to GKN
shareholders for many years to come.
And GKN people all over the globe have gone that extra
mile to support a major social responsibility programme
— GKN Mission Everest.
Dedicated to perform
Our Driveline businesses made a strong recovery from a
difficult 2006 second half.
Global automotive production grew by 5.3% in 2007 and
our restructured and revitalised Driveshaft business was
able to take full advantage of its excellent market
positioning. Sales and profits improved markedly and the
division won over 80% of global driveshaft business
sourced externally, with the level in the emerging markets
of Asia Pacific and South America even higher.
Demand for our torque products was also strong,
particularly in the growing Asian sports utility vehicle
market and a number of important high volume
programmes were won in Asia, Europe and North America.
Powder Metallurgy suffered from higher input costs and
significantly lower North American demand for
components for large V8 engines. Two planned plant
closures completed in the second half created operational
disruption which also impacted profitability. So, although
sales revenues showed growth, profits were slightly down.
With restructuring now complete, strong order books and
a range of new product launches under way, we expect
Powder Metallurgy to resume progress in 2008.
Off-highway markets have been favourable with solid
demand for agricultural machinery in both Europe and
North America. Demand for heavy construction and
mining equipment more than offset a weakening in the
North American light construction segment. The Rockford
Powertrain business made an excellent first full year
contribution and the Liuzhou wheels acquisition in China,
which completed in November 2006, has integrated well.
Aerospace has again performed strongly and, with some
contribution from acquisitions, produced double digit
sales and profits growth. Order books were also
strengthened in buoyant commercial markets, with Boeing
and Airbus having a record sales year, and the US defence
markets also providing much new opportunity. Additional
business was gained on existing programmes and
significant work packages won on a number of new
programmes. The most notable new programme wins
included the aft fuselage structure for the new Sikorsky
CH-53K military helicopter and blended winglets for
retrofit to Boeing 767 and 737 airliners to aid improved
fuel efficiency. The Teleflex acquisition which completed in
June strengthened GKN’s position in the engine
component sector and secured access to ‘hot section
components’ for the first time.
In December we were pleased to be selected by Airbus as
the preferred partner for the acquisition of the wing
component and sub-assembly facility on their Filton site,
including the potential award of major design and
manufacturing packages for the Airbus A350 XWB wing.
There is much work to be done over the coming months to
turn the selection into definitive contractual agreements
— we are, however, extremely excited by the opportunity
offered by this major strategic partnership with Airbus.

Chief Executive’s Statement
The Group delivered another year of increased
sales and a signiﬁcant improvement in proﬁts
and earnings per share.
www.gkn.com A passion to innovate
Our continued success can only be assured through the
sustained development of innovative technologies
and products.
This year sees the introduction into the marketplace of
GKN’s highly acclaimed countertrack™ constant velocity
joints which are fitted to a number of new vehicles being
launched during 2008. These joints have set new
standards for size, weight and efficiency, supporting
vehicle manufacturers’ drive for lower emissions.
GKN’s technologies for the 21st century are being applied
across the vehicle spectrum. The new Tata Nano, launched
in India this year, is the world’s lowest cost car with a price
tag equivalent to $2,500. Our new driveshaft for low cost
vehicles is a key component within the new car.
Meanwhile, BMW are launching the X6, a new premium
vehicle which utilises GKN’s electronic torque vectoring
technology — the most advanced traction control system
in the world. 
In Powder Metallurgy our technology enabled the launch
of a world first high performance manual transmission
gear application.
In OffHighway we have developed the Hydromech gearbox
which improves the efficiency of combine harvesters. The
new gearbox has been introduced on a range of European
harvesters.
And in Aerospace we have validated, through our work on
the Airbus A400M, the design and manufacture of
composites for large aircraft primary wing structures. This
work will impact directly on the next generation of
airliners. Our work on composites will also help improve
the fuel efficiency of new jet engines. As part of an EU
programme we have also developed production processes
for composite products which do not require high
temperature curing ovens.
The development of technologies in tune with the times is
at the heart of how we will create a sustainable growth
path for GKN.
United by common goals
Within GKN we expect much from our people. Our leaders
are tasked with growing the business on a global basis,
focusing on delivering value to our customers and
managing teams often spread across continents. They
work in a business environment which is highly
competitive and typified by complex supply chains and
constantly developing technologies.
At plant level, supervisors and operators are at the front
line of our implementation of a Lean Enterprise culture
where continuous improvement and innovation is
becoming routine.
GKN people, however, know that they can count on high
levels of support both in helping the Group achieve its
strategic objectives and in developing their own abilities
and aspirations.
A key feature which has emerged during recent years is
what we call The GKN Way. At its heart is a common
language and a common set of values, metrics,
management processes and a core principle that
development opportunities will be available for all GKN
employees. In 2007, as part of an intensive programme of
employee development, we completed a training
programme for 1,000 leaders in the principles and
practices of Lean Enterprise as part of our ongoing
training in continuous improvement techniques.
GKN people are no longer separated by geographic,
business or market boundaries — increasingly they have 
come to feel and to act as one team. 
Pledged to help those in need
This has been the year of GKN Mission Everest when we
supported adventurer Bear Grylls in his successful quest
to fly a powered paraglider higher than Mount Everest. 
GKN people have a tradition of supporting their
communities but we used GKN Mission Everest to inspire
them to do even more. In return, we pledged to donate
funds to children’s charities in Africa. 
6 GKN plc Annual Report 2007
Chief Executive’s Statement
continued
The development of innovative technologies is 
at the heart of how we will create a sustainable
growth path for GKN. During 2007 our people contributed $1.7 million of extra
support to their local communities in the Americas,
Europe and Asia Pacific. The Group gave $500,000 to
African charities in 2007 and in 2008 we will donate a
further $500,000.
Leading a team which has taken such a compassionate
challenge to its heart has been deeply moving. Thousands
of GKN people across the world have proven themselves
to be truly extraordinary and I am proud of them all. 
Outlook
The outlook for our major markets remains positive
despite continuing uncertainty around the global
economy.
Automotive production in the emerging markets of Asia,
Eastern Europe and Latin America is projected to
experience continuing strong growth. North American and
Western European markets are set to soften leaving
overall growth in global production at around 3%.
OffHighway and Aerospace markets are forecast to 
remain strong.
Raw material costs are expected to remain both volatile and
high, with scrap steel costs, which have risen sharply in
recent weeks, presenting a potential headwind for the year.
Conversely, if sterling were to remain at current levels
against major international currencies there would be a
significant translational benefit to Group results.
Against this background, the Group expects to see further
solid improvement in its Automotive and Powder
Metallurgy businesses and continued strong growth in
OffHighway and Aerospace.
Our strategic restructuring is complete, leaving Driveline
and Powder Metallurgy with excellent global positioning
and a stable operating footprint from which to deliver
their strong order backlogs.
OffHighway order books are at record levels and its end
markets remain robust.
Aerospace order books continue to be very strong and the
full year impact of the Teleflex acquisition will support
further good progress in 2008.
The Filton acquisition, which will significantly 
strengthen our Aerospace business, should complete
around mid year.
Overall we expect 2008 to be another year of progress 
and growth for GKN.

Chief Executive’s Statement
GKN Mission Everest
2007 saw the launch of GKN Mission Everest 
— a powerful symbol of the Group’s ambition,
innovation and teamwork.
The daring feat to fly a paraglider higher than Mount
Everest was successfully completed on 14 May and
acted as the focal point of a global challenge for GKN
employees to increase their charitable activities.
The response has been extraordinary. Across the world and in all
manner of ways GKN employees have taken up the challenge to
do even more for their local communities and to bring new hope
to some of Africa’s most deprived children.

performance of the business of the Company during the 2007 financial year and the
position of the Company at the end of the 2007 financial year, consistent with the
size and complexity of its business. It has been prepared for the whole Group and
therefore gives greater emphasis to those matters which are significant to GKN plc
and its subsidiaries when viewed as a whole. The business review is addressed to

Business Review
01
02 Group activities
GKN is a global engineering business serving mainly the
automotive, industrial, off-highway and aerospace
markets. The bulk of our sales are made to vehicle and
aircraft manufacturers as well as, in Aerospace, to other
major tier one suppliers. We operate in four different
business areas:
Automotive activities comprise GKN Driveline and Other
Automotive companies which supply driveshafts, geared
components, torque management devices, structural and
engine components and substrates for catalytic
converters, largely to vehicle manufacturers in the global
car and light vehicle markets.
Powder Metallurgy produces powdered metal and
sintered components for automotive and other industrial
customers.
OffHighway mainly designs and manufactures steel wheels
and driveline systems for the global agricultural,
construction and mining, and industrial machinery markets.
Aerospace activities are concentrated on the production
of airframe and engine structures, components and
assemblies for both military and civil aerospace markets.
The Group has operations in over 30 countries with
38,300 employees in subsidiary companies and a further
3,800 in joint ventures.
Strategy and business objectives
GKN is committed to providing long term shareholder
value in the form of steadily growing earnings per share
and dividends. We aim to achieve this through the supply
of outstanding products and services to our customers to
produce sustained growth in sales, profitability and 
cash flow. 
Our strategy for achieving this growth is based on: 
 focusing our activities in the industries we know and
having market leadership positions in those chosen
business segments;
 delivering advanced technology and first-class
engineering capability to our customers;
 providing exceptional levels of customer service,
including achieving the highest delivery and quality
standards in our industries;
 operating on a truly global basis so that we are best
placed to service our customers wherever they may be;
 achieving world class manufacturing standards and
being the lowest total cost producer through the
application throughout the Group of ‘Lean’ business
processes;
Measurement and reporting of performance 
In this review, in addition to statutory measures of profit, we have made
reference to profits and earnings excluding the impact of:
 strategic restructuring and impairment charges;
 amortisation of non-operating intangible assets arising on business
combinations;
 profits and losses on the sale or closures of businesses; and 
 changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments, 
since we believe they show more clearly the underlying trend in business
performance.
Trading profit is defined as operating profit before any of the above. The 2006
trading profit of the Group and the Other Automotive segment has been 
re-analysed and adjusted by £9 million in respect of the results of GKN
Sheepbridge Stokes Ltd, the UK cylinder liner business which formed a
significant part of the segment result. The closure of this operation was
announced in January 2007 and production ceased at the end of the third
quarter. Its trading results are shown as a separate component of operating
profit within the caption ‘profits and losses on sale or closures of businesses’.
Sales in the year of £22 million (2006 – £27 million) remain included in total
Group sales. 
In the segmental analysis, comparative figures for the Driveline and
OffHighway segments have been restated by equal and opposite amounts in
respect of two businesses now included in OffHighway but formerly reported
in Driveline, where the customer and product base has become increasingly
focused on off-highway applications.
Where appropriate, reference is also made to results excluding the impact of
both 2006 and 2007 acquisitions and divestments as well as the impact of
currency translation on the results of overseas operations.
Exchange rates used for currencies most important to the Group’s operations are:
Average Year End
2007 2006 2007 2006
Euro 1.46 1.47 1.36 1.48
US dollar 2.00 1.84 1.99 1.96
The approximate impact on 2007 trading profit of subsidiaries and joint
ventures of a 1% movement in the average rate would be euro — £1.6
million, US dollar — £0.7 million.
In our internal performance reporting we aggregate our share of sales and
trading profits of joint ventures with those of subsidiaries. This is particularly
important in assessing sales and profit progress in our Driveline and Other
Automotive businesses where significant activity takes place in joint
ventures. Reference to these combined figures is made, where appropriate,
as ‘management sales’ and ‘management trading profits’.

continued
 generating an environment where highly skilled and
motivated people can operate to the exacting standards
demanded in our business segments, can develop their
careers and provide the Group with a sustainable
competitive advantage;
 completing focused acquisitions which meet strict rates
of return criteria, add to our technology, global
presence or customer base and thereby accelerate our
growth; and divesting businesses where we no longer
see optimum value as part of the Group; and
 managing the Group in a controlled governance
environment with due regard for financial and other
business risks.
A key element of this strategy centres on the emerging
markets of Asia Pacific, South America and Eastern
Europe. We have invested significantly in those regions
through the strategic restructuring which has taken place
over the last three years and which is now complete. We
continue to invest in those markets, particularly in China
and India, and reference is made to 2007 investments in
the relevant sections of this review.
Key performance indicators
We implement and monitor performance against this
strategy through a number of key performance indicators
and objectives, both financial and non-financial. The
principal ones and our performance against them in 2007
are shown below for the Group. Divisional information is
given in the relevant section of this review.
In defining financial indicators we use management sales
and management trading profit as defined on page 9 as
this better reflects the underlying performance of the
Group and respective divisions. 
Financial key performance indicators
1. Growth in Group earnings and dividends per share 
We aim to achieve absolute growth in earnings per share
each year (as measured on a management basis) and,
recognising the nature and cyclicality of our major
markets, have a longer term target of achieving average
compound annual growth of at least 6%. 
Our objective is to increase progressively the dividend in
line with the long term trend in earnings, targeting a
sustainable earnings to dividend cover ratio of between 
2 and 2.5 times.
For 2007 the Group has reported a 17% improvement in
management earnings per share and this follows a 29%
increase in 2006. These increases reflected both an
improved profit performance in each year and lower tax
charges. Using the cash tax rates (see page 15) of 17% 
in 2007 and 18% in 2006 would give an increase of 
13% in 2007.
Dividends per share have increased progressively over the
last five years and, demonstrating continuing confidence
in the future prospects of the Group, the Board has
proposed a 5.5% increase in the 2007 annual dividend to
13.5p. The proposed dividend is covered 2.6 times by
earnings on a management basis or 2.3 times using the
cash tax rate of 17%.
2. Growth in sales and trading margins 
We aim to achieve growth in sales at both a Group and
divisional level in excess of that seen in our major markets
both in absolute terms and on a like-for-like basis, i.e.
excluding the effects of currency translation, acquisitions
or divestments.
In 2007 sales of subsidiaries rose by 6% to £3,869 million,
while joint ventures, the sales of which are not
consolidated in these accounts, have shown growth of
22%. Our total Group sales on a management basis
increased by £280 million to £4,122 million. The organic
change in this latter figure was £275 million, an increase
of 7%, with all divisions exhibiting solid growth. As a
result of its strong business wins in 2007 and earlier
years, the Group expects to see continuing growth in 2008
and thereafter.
As regards trading margins, the Group expects to operate
with a margin of between 8% and 10% for its Driveline
and Powder Metallurgy businesses, 6% and 10% for Other
Automotive, 7% and 10% for OffHighway and 10% or
higher for the Aerospace division, giving an overall Group
target of 8% to 10%. During 2007, the overall Group
trading margin on a management basis increased to 7.5%
from 7.1% largely reflecting improvement in Driveline.

3. Return on average invested capital
Return on average invested capital (ROIC) is defined as
the ratio of management trading profit to average total net
assets including the appropriate share of joint ventures
and excluding current and deferred tax, cash, borrowings
and post-employment obligations. We aim to achieve
ROIC, at both a Group and divisional level, above the
weighted average cost of capital of the Group.
To ensure our goals are clearly understood across the
Group, we use 12% as the pre-tax threshold for all our
internal ROIC measures and target all divisions to meet or
exceed that level. On a post-tax basis we estimate this to
be close to the Group’s long term weighted average cost
of capital of between 8% and 9%.
For the Group as a whole ROIC rose to 15.1% from 14.4%
in 2007 with all divisions except Powder Metallurgy
exceeding the threshold.
4. Group cash flow 
The Group aims to generate sufficient cash flow each year
to cover dividend payments and fund above sector organic
growth. For these purposes cash flow is defined as after
capital expenditure but before dividends, acquisitions,
share buybacks, special contributions to the UK pension
scheme, currency movements in overseas borrowings and
the cash cost of the strategic restructuring programme. In
2007, the Group was once again able to achieve this goal.
With significantly lower spending on strategic
restructuring, reduced capital expenditure and continued
emphasis on working capital, the Group expects to
improve cash generation in 2008 and future years.
Non-financial key performance indicators
The key non-financial indicators that we currently report
relate to our health, safety and environmental
performance and employee turnover. 
1. Health and safety performance
Our ultimate goal is zero preventable accidents. We
measure our progress against this goal by reference to
accident frequency rate (AFR), which is the number of lost
time accidents per 1,000 employees, and accident
severity rate (ASR), which is the number of days/shifts
lost due to accidents and occupational ill health per 1,000
employees. Both the AFR and ASR demonstrate
continuing performance improvement over the last five
years with AFR falling from 8.3 in 2003 to 3.4 in 2007 and
ASR falling from 181 in 2003 to 99 in 2007 (see charts on
page 43). We are able to benchmark our AFR performance
externally and against this measure we have significantly
outperformed industry averages in the UK, Germany and
the US and our performance compares favourably with
that of our peer companies in the UK and the US where
comparative data is available.
2. Environmental performance
Our focus remains on the key performance indicators of
energy consumption and associated carbon dioxide (CO
2
)
emissions, waste generation and recycled waste, and
water usage. Given the diverse range of business
processes across the Group, performance against these
indicators is measured on a divisional basis (in the main,
relative to production measured in terms of tonnes of
product shipped). This also allows the use of an
alternative metric for our Aerospace business; the drive
towards ever lighter components means that sales, rather
than weight of product shipped, is a more appropriate
measure of activity. Performance data for CO
2
emissions
includes direct emissions from our plants and indirect
emissions from power stations that generate the
electricity we use. Overall, as shown in the charts on
pages 44 and 45, most divisions have maintained or
slightly improved their performance in 2007 compared
with the two prior years.

3. Employees 
Employees at the end of 2007 totalled 42,100 compared
with 40,500 at the end of 2006, an increase of 4%. Of the
total, 38,300 were employed in subsidiaries (a 3.5%
increase over 2006) and 3,800 in joint ventures (an 8.6%
increase over 2006).
For 2007, employee turnover represented 8% of the
average number employed during the year. Of this, 4.7%
was accounted for by voluntary leavers and 3.3% by
company instigated action.
Further information on health and safety, environmental
and employee issues is given on pages 40 to 47. 
Changes in the composition of the Group
Results for the year contain a full 12 month contribution
from the 2006 acquisitions of Hytecomp AB (June),
Rockford Powertrain Inc (August) and Liuzhou Steel Rim
Factory (November), all for OffHighway, and Stellex
Aerostructures (September) for Aerospace.
At the beginning of March 2006 the Group ceased its
involvement in the management of Fujiwa Machinery
Industry (Kunschan) Company Ltd (Fujiwa), a non-core
subsidiary of GKN Driveline Torque Technology KK and
effectively disposed of its 60% shareholding from 
that date.
On 29 June 2007, Aerospace acquired the Teleflex
Aerospace Manufacturing Group of Teleflex Inc for 
£68 million.
Group performance
Management sales (subsidiaries and joint ventures)
£4,122 million (2006 – £3,842 million)
Combined sales of subsidiaries and share of joint ventures
totalled £4,122 million compared with £3,842 million in
2006. Excluding the impact of currency, the increase was
£395 million (11%). Excluding acquisitions and
divestments as well as currency, the increase was £277
million (7%) with benefits from solid demand in emerging
markets and Europe for Driveline, new programmes in
Powder Metallurgy and Aerospace, and good growth 
in the Emitec joint venture.
Sales of subsidiaries £3,869 million
(2006 – £3,634 million)
Sales of subsidiaries were £3,869 million compared 
with £3,634 million in 2006, an increase of £235 million
(6%). Excluding the impact of currency translation,
acquisitions and divestments, there was an increase of
£226 million (6%).
In Automotive businesses, subsidiaries’ sales of £2,031
million compared with £2,004 million a year earlier.
Currency was £48 million adverse, and excluding this and
a £5 million negative impact for 2006 divestments, the
underlying increase was £80 million (4%). On a
management basis, including our share of joint ventures,
sales were £2,281 million (2006 – £2,209 million) and the
underlying increase was £131 million (6%).
Powder Metallurgy sales were £602 million compared with
£582 million in 2006. Currency was £22 million adverse so
that the underlying increase was £42 million (8%) as new
programmes commenced towards the end of the year.

In OffHighway, subsidiaries’ sales improved to £416
million from £353 million in 2006. The full year impact of
2006 acquisitions was £27 million and, excluding these
and the adverse impact of currency (£6 million), sales
increased by £42 million (12%) with good market
conditions in both Europe and North America for
agricultural and heavy construction equipment.
Aerospace sales increased to £820 million from £695
million in 2006. The impact of both 2006 and 2007
acquisitions was £96 million and, excluding this and
currency (£33 million negative), the improvement was £62
million (9%) reflecting strong demand in both civil and
military markets and a number of new programmes
coming on stream. 
Management trading profit (subsidiaries and joint
ventures) £309 million (2006 restated –£272 million)
The aggregated trading profit of subsidiaries and our
share of joint ventures was £309 million, an increase of
£37 million (14%). The net positive impact of currency,
acquisitions and divestments was £11 million and
excluding these factors, the increase was £26 million
(10%) reflecting the impact of higher sales in Driveline
and Aerospace, essentially level underlying results in
Powder Metallurgy and OffHighway as well as growth in
Other Automotive joint ventures. Margin improved to
7.5% (2006 – 7.1%).
Trading profit of subsidiaries £277 million
(2006 restated –£251 million)
Group trading profit was £277 million compared with
£251 million in 2006, an increase of £26 million (10%).
The currency impact on the translation of overseas 
profits was £4 million negative. There was a net benefit 
of £15 million from 2006 and 2007 acquisitions and
divestments and excluding these factors the increase 
was £15 million (6%).
Automotive subsidiaries’ trading profit totalled £146
million compared with £137 million (restated) in 2006.
There was no impact of currency and the net effect of
divestments was £1 million negative. Excluding this,
profits rose by £10 million (7%). Driveline benefited from
higher sales and fixed cost reductions which were partially
offset by the impact of raw material costs and shortages
of speciality steels. In Other Automotive weakening
demand, cost pressures and an asset impairment charge,
which was related to a reorganisation, led to an increased
loss. For Automotive as a whole, subsidiaries’ margin of
trading profit to sales was 7.2% (2006 – 6.8%). On a
management basis, including our share of joint ventures,
trading profit was £178 million (2006 restated –£158
million) with the underlying increase £21 million (13%).
Return on sales was 7.8% (2006 – 7.2%).
Powder Metallurgy profits of £29 million were £2 million
lower than 2006. £1 million of the reduction was due to
currency, with the remainder largely a consequence of
higher raw material costs, the absence of some favourable
copper and nickel commodity contracts in the powder
business which had benefited 2006 and operational
inefficiencies in the second half of the year associated
with the final restructuring and plant closure actions.
Return on sales was 4.8% compared with 5.3% in 2006.
OffHighway profit improved to £29 million from £25
million in 2006 with the increase coming from
acquisitions. The benefit from higher underlying sales was
offset by capacity related inefficiencies in the Wheels
business, some under recovery of material price increases
due to timing and, in Driveline Systems, additional costs
caused by supply chain disruption, all of which intensified
in the second half of the year. Margin was 7.0% compared
with 7.1% in 2006.
Aerospace profit rose to £83 million from £70 million in
2006. Currency was £3 million negative while there was 
a £12 million benefit from 2006 and 2007 acquisitions
leaving an underlying improvement of £4 million (6%).
Margin remained level with 2006 at 10.1% reflecting, in
part, the impact of new programmes in the early stages 
of production.
Corporate and unallocated costs of £10 million (2006 –
£12 million) represent stewardship, legacy, governance
and compliance costs relating to the overall Group rather
than individual businesses, with the reduction primarily
arising from a non-recurring credit of £3 million relating to
a legacy business.
The overall margin of subsidiaries was 7.2% compared
with 6.9% in 2006.

continued
Restructuring and impairment costs £31 million
(2006 – £74 million)
Net charges in the year relating to the strategic
restructuring programme totalled £33 million (2006 –
£63 million) with £19 million (2006 – £37 million) in
Driveline and £14 million (2006 – £24 million) in Powder
Metallurgy. Within the total figure, there was a charge of
£39 million in respect of redundancy and other
reorganisation costs which was partially offset by a net 
£6 million credit from the reversal of charges taken in
earlier years on assets brought back into use on 
profitable activities.
The charge for 2007 is within the total anticipated at the
start of the year and costs of some £4 million which under
accounting rules cannot be accrued in 2007 will be
charged in 2008. Benefits also remain in line with earlier
expectations.
In addition to the costs of strategic restructuring, there
was a £2 million credit (2006 – £11 million charge) from
the reversal of an impairment charge taken in prior years
in respect of Other Automotive assets.
Amortisation of non-operating intangible assets arising
on business combinations £8 million (2006 – £3 million)
In accordance with IFRS 3, the Group has recognised
intangible assets arising on businesses acquired in 2006
and 2007. The amortisation of non-operating intangible
assets (e.g. customer contracts and relationships,
trademarks, non-compete agreements and intellectual
property rights) increased during the year as a result of
the full year impact of the 2006 acquisitions of Stellex and
Rockford and the acquisition of Teleflex in June 2007. 
Profits and losses on sale or closures of businesses 
£7 million charge (2006 – £4 million charge)
The loss on closure of businesses of £7 million arose at
the UK cylinder liner business (Sheepbridge) which
ceased trading in September. The 2006 net charge of £4
million consisted of a charge in respect of Sheepbridge
trading losses of £9 million, partially offset by a profit on
the disposal of the Group’s controlling interest in Fujiwa. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial
instruments £10 million charge 
(2006 – £33 million credit)
The Group enters into foreign exchange contracts to
hedge much of its transactional exposure. At 1 January
2007 the net fair value of such instruments was an asset
of £27 million and at the end of 2007 the figure was an
asset of £18 million. 
Transactional hedge accounting has been applied to a
small proportion of these transactions. Where
transactional hedging has not been applied, the difference
of £9 million has been charged (2006 – £39 million
credited) separately as a component of operating profit. In
addition, there was a £1 million charge in respect of
commodity hedges in Powder Metallurgy (2006 – £1
million charge) with no overall change in the value of
embedded derivatives (2006 – £5 million charge) leaving
a net charge of £10 million (2006 – £33 million credit).
Operating profit £221 million (2006 – £203 million)
Operating profit of £221 million compared with £203
million in 2006, reflecting the movements discussed
above.
Post-tax earnings of joint ventures £24 million
(2006 – £17 million)
There was an increase of £7 million in the Group’s share of
post-tax earnings of joint ventures. Within this figure,
trading profit rose to £32 million from £21 million in 2006,
an increase of 52%. There was a small negative impact
from currency and the underlying improvement was 57%
with improved profitability at Driveline’s Chinese joint
ventures, at Chassis Systems which benefited from both
slightly higher sales and a one off benefit from the
finalisation of contractual pricing arrangements, and at
Emitec, where sales again improved as a consequence of
the 2006 legislation in Germany requiring the retrofitting
of particulate filters to diesel powered vehicles.
Net financing costs £46 million (2006 – £38 million)
Interest payable totalled £62 million (2006 – £57 million)
and arose mainly on the £675 million of bonds and £30
million debenture in issue. This was partially offset by
interest receivable of £19 million (2006 – £23 million)
which arose on short term deposits, together with the
benefits of lower borrowing costs on foreign currency debt
instruments used to hedge the Group’s overseas
investments. The year on year movement mainly reflected
the full year effect of acquisitions made in 2006 together
with the second half impact of the Teleflex acquisition
made on 29 June 2007. 
Other net financing costs were £3 million (2006 – £4
million) and related to post-employment obligations. 
The reduction of £1 million is the net benefit arising from
higher scheme asset values which increased the expected
return on scheme assets by £10 million, offset by a £9
million increase in interest on post-employment
obligations from the higher discount rate assumption.
Details of the assumptions used in calculating post-
employment costs and income are provided in note 27
to the financial statements.

Profit before tax
Profit before tax on a statutory basis was £199 million
(2006 – £182 million). On a management basis (i.e.
excluding restructuring and impairment charges,
amortisation of non-operating intangible assets arising on
business combinations, profits and losses on the sale or
closures of businesses and changes in the fair value of
derivative financial instruments), the figure of £255
million was £25 million higher than the £230 million (as
restated) in 2006. The post-tax share of joint ventures
contributed £24 million (2006 – £17 million) and
subsidiaries £231 million (2006 restated – £213 million).
Taxation
The tax charge on management profits of subsidiaries of
£231 million (2006 – £213 million as restated) was 
£6 million (2006 – £17 million), representing a 2.6% rate
(2006 restated – 8.0%). 
The significant reduction in rate is due principally to
deferred tax credits arising on the recognition of certain
previously unrecognised deferred tax assets (mainly tax
losses), the utilisation of other previously unrecognised
deferred tax assets and changes in the statutory rate of
tax affecting both current and deferred tax in certain of
the jurisdictions in which we operate. The impact of these
beneficial factors was partly offset by an increase in
provisions for uncertain tax positions.
GKN’s tax strategy is aimed at creating a sustainable ‘cash
tax’ charge (which excludes deferred taxes, movements in
provisions for uncertain tax positions and tax relating to
those non-trading elements of operating profit separately
identified in the income statement) that balances the
shareholders’ interest of minimising tax payments with
the need to comply with the tax laws for each country in
which we operate. In 2007 the cash tax charge was 17%
and we expect cash tax to average 20% or less for the
near term as we continue to make use of prior years’ tax
losses, allowances and deductions in the various
countries in which we operate. 
For 2008, we now anticipate that the reported rate is
again likely to be somewhat lower than the cash tax rate
of 17%. For 2009 and beyond, the overall reported tax
rate is likely to continue to be volatile, being influenced by
the possible further recognition of currently unrecognised
deferred tax assets and the settlement of prior year tax
disputes. These unrecognised, potential deferred tax
assets principally relate to brought forward tax losses in
the UK and US which, due to the structure of the Group
and the geographic mix of profitability, have so far not
been seen as realisable for tax purposes. 
The total effective tax rate of subsidiaries was 0.6% 
(2006 – 3.0%).
Discontinued operations
There were no discontinued operations in the period. 
Minority interests
The share of profit relating to minority interests was 
£2 million compared with £nil in 2006 and arose as
businesses in emerging markets moved into profit.
Earnings per share
Earnings per share were 27.9p (2006 – 25.0p). Before
restructuring and impairment charges, amortisation of
non-operating intangible assets arising on business
combinations, profits and losses on the sale or closures of
businesses and changes in the fair value of derivative
financial instruments, the figure was 35.1p (2006 restated
– 30.1p), an increase of 17%. 
Cash flow
Operating cash flow, which GKN defines as cash
generated from operations (£299 million; 2006 – £117
million) adjusted for capital expenditure (£192 million;
2006 – £230 million) and proceeds from the disposal of
fixed assets (£21 million; 2006 – £13 million), was an
inflow of £128 million compared with a £100 million
outflow in 2006. Included within the 2006 figure is the
£200 million contribution to the UK pension scheme made
in April of that year.

continued
The outflow on working capital and provisions totalled
£49 million (2006 – £3 million) largely reflecting inventory
increases in support of higher sales in the year and, in
Aerospace, projected sales in 2008. The figure also
included a £9 million outflow in respect of a legacy
environmental obligation (2006 – £5 million) where a
further £6 million is expected to be spent in 2008.
Capital expenditure (on tangible and intangible assets)
totalled £192 million (2006 – £230 million). Of this, £172
million (2006 – £197 million) was on tangible assets
representing property, plant and equipment and was 1.2
times (2006 – 1.4 times) the charge for depreciation. The
ratio of capital expenditure to depreciation is expected to
reduce slightly in 2008.
Expenditure on intangible assets totalled £20 million
(2006 – £33 million) and mainly reflected initial non-
recurring costs on Aerospace programmes which will
underpin future performance.
Net interest paid totalled £44 million compared with £33
million in 2006 with the increase largely due to a
combination of the cash outflow relating to businesses
acquired during the second half of 2006 and in 2007.
Tax paid in the year was £28 million (2006 – £31 million).
Dividends received from joint ventures totalled £13
million (2006 – £7 million).
Free cash flow
Free cash flow, which is cash flow excluding acquisitions,
share buybacks and currency translation but including
capital expenditure and dividends paid, is a key
performance indicator of the Group. Free cash flow for the
year was an outflow of £23 million (2006 – £246 million)
after £40 million (2006 – £57 million) of expenditure on
strategic restructurings. The Group’s balance sheet
remains strong and with profit improvement, lower
restructuring spend and reduced capital expenditure it is
anticipated that, from 2008 onwards, cash generation
should improve markedly. 
Acquisitions and divestments
The net expenditure on acquisitions and divestments in
the year was £71 million (2006 – £113 million). £68
million was in respect of Teleflex with further payments of
£3 million in respect of 2006 acquisitions.
Net borrowings
At the end of the year the Group had net debt of £506
million (2006 – £426 million). This included the benefit of
£42 million (2006 – £33 million) from customer advances
in the Aerospace businesses which are shown in creditors
in the balance sheet. The Group’s share of net funds in
joint ventures was £14 million (2006 – £3 million).
Pensions and post-employment obligations
GKN operates a number of defined benefit and defined
contribution pension schemes together with retiree
medical arrangements across the Group. The total charge
to trading profit in respect of current and past service
costs of defined benefit schemes and retiree medical
arrangements was £19 million (2006 – £40 million), whilst
other net financing charges included in net financing costs
were £3 million (2006 – £4 million). 
The decrease in the charge to trading profit mainly reflects
a total of £14 million past service and curtailment credit
(largely related to changes to retiree medical
arrangements in the US) and a £6 million reduction in the
current service cost (mainly due to the increases in
discount rates in the US and Europe together with lower
salary growth assumptions in the UK). The ongoing annual
benefit of these changes is £2 million to trading profit
with a further £1 million benefit to financing charges.
Further information including asset, liability and mortality
assumptions used is provided in note 27 to the financial
statements.
UK pensions
The UK defined benefit scheme is considered to be
relatively mature since fewer than 4,400 of its 53,400
members are currently in service. As a UK defined benefit
scheme, this is run on a funded basis with funds set aside
in trust to cover future liabilities to members. A scheme
specific funding valuation as at April 2007 was completed
during the year and included an agreement with the
Trustees to a deficit recovery plan and a revised schedule
of contributions. The schedule of contributions does not
call for any deficit funding.

Following a consultation period, a number of changes to
future service benefits were introduced in the year and
included a move away from a final salary based pension to
that of a pension based on each year’s earnings (Career
Average Revalued Earnings). In addition, the financial
impact of changes in longevity assumptions for active
members is to be shared between the Company and
employees. 
The charge relating to the UK defined benefit scheme
reflected in trading profit in respect of current and past
service costs/curtailments was £17 million (2006 – £20
million), whilst other net financing credits included in net
financing costs were £13 million (2006 – £12 million).
The deficit at 31 December 2007 of £3 million (2006 –
£174 million) was significantly lower than that at the 
end of 2006 as a result of a beneficial impact from 
higher yields on long dated corporate bonds which are
used to determine the net present value of future
liabilities, partly offset by changes in other assumptions
including mortality. Because of the size and profile of the
scheme, longevity is reviewed annually against actual
experience. During the year mortality assumptions were
strengthened, the age rating to PA92 (year of birth) tables
was improved by 0.5 of a year to 2.5 years, whilst the rate
of future improvement in longevity was strengthened to
medium cohort.
Overseas pensions
The principal countries involved are the US, Germany 
and Japan.
The net charge to trading profit in respect of current 
and past service costs/curtailments was £13 million
(2006 – £19 million), whilst other net financing charges
included in net financing costs were £12 million (2006 –
£12 million).
The reduction in the deficit of £30 million to £281 million
(2006 – £311 million) was largely a result of the lower net
present value of liabilities from increases in discount rates
partly offset by the translational impact of currency.
Retiree medical
GKN operates retiree medical arrangements in the
Americas and has a closed scheme in the UK.
The credit to trading profit of £11 million (2006 – £1
million charge) arose largely as a result of a past service
credit of £12 million from changes in retiree medical
arrangements in the US, whilst other net financing
charges included in net financing costs were £4 million
(2006 – £4 million).
Largely as a result of these changes, the obligation in
respect of all schemes at the end of the year was £47
million compared with £76 million at the end of 2006.
Summary
At 31 December 2007 the post-employment obligations of
the Group totalled £331 million (2006 – £561 million).
Shareholders’ equity
Shareholders’ equity at the end of 2007 was £1,177
million compared with £892 million at the end of 2006. 
Proposed dividend
A final dividend of 9.2p per share is proposed, payable on
14 May 2008 to shareholders on the register on 25 April
2008. Together with the interim dividend of 4.3p, the total
dividend for the year will be 13.5p, an increase of 5.5%
over the equivalent figure for last year. The cash cost to
the Group is some £95 million. The dividend is covered 
2.6 times (2006 – 2.4 times) by management earnings 
(i.e. before the impact of restructuring and impairment
charges, amortisation of non-operating intangible assets
arising on business combinations, profits and losses on
the sale or closures of businesses and changes in the fair
value of derivative financial instruments). Using the cash
tax rate for the year of 17%, the dividend would have
been covered 2.3 times by earnings (2006 on the same
basis – 2.1 times).
The proposed full year dividend of 13.5p per share
represents an increase of 5.5% over 2006 and
reﬂects our continuing conﬁdence in the future. Business Review

Automotive comprises:
GKN Driveline
Other Automotive Markets
Approximately 62% of GKN’s combined sales of
subsidiaries and joint ventures are to the world’s
passenger car and light vehicle original equipment
markets. Production levels in these markets are a key
driver of Group performance and, in particular, of our
Automotive and Powder Metallurgy operations. The
forecast compound annual growth rate in global
production for 2007 to 2011 is 3.9%, somewhat higher
than the longer term trend (1990–2012) of 2.7%.
Within this global picture, future growth is likely to vary
significantly by region with generally stable production in
the mature markets of Western Europe, North America
and Japan and strong increases in the emerging markets
of Asia Pacific, South America and Eastern Europe. This
pattern was evident in 2007.
Western Europe
In Western Europe (where sales to vehicle manufacturers
accounted for approximately 32% of Group sales in the
year) overall production in 2007 was 16.1 million
compared with 15.7 million in 2006, an increase of
approximately 2.5%. There were increases in Italy (10%),
Germany (6%), Spain (7%) and the UK (3%) somewhat
offset by reductions in France (6%) and other smaller
producing countries.
North America
In North America (where sales to vehicle manufacturers
accounted for approximately 15% of Group sales in the
year) production in 2007 was 15.0 million, a reduction of
2.0% from the 15.3 million in 2006. Within the overall
figure there was again a significant change in market
share with Chrysler, Ford and General Motors continuing
to lose share to foreign manufacturers. Consumer
preference also continued to move from light trucks 
and sports utility vehicles (SUVs) to crossovers and
passenger cars.
Emerging markets
Asia Pacific (excluding Japan where the year on year
increase in production was 1% to 11.2 million vehicles)
showed very significant growth. In China, production of
8.1 million vehicles was 22% above 2006, while
production in India rose by 14% to 1.9 million. 
In Brazil, production increased by 16.5% to 2.7 million
vehicles.
Market trends in 2008
Following the ‘credit crunch’ in the second half of 2007
there is some uncertainty about market conditions in
2008, particularly in North America where sales to the car
and light vehicle market account for approximately 15% of
Group sales. The current view of Global Insight Inc, a
leading economic forecaster, is for similar conditions to
prevail in 2008 with Western European production
essentially flat, North America weakening by around 4.5%
but with China, India and Brazil growing by around 14%,
20% and 15% respectively.
Input costs
The major costs in our Automotive businesses are labour,
steel (either as scrap, bar or purchased steel based
components), other metals including copper, nickel and
molybdenum and other materials such as grease. There has
been significant volatility in many raw material prices over
the last two or three years which has exacerbated the
pressure on margins. Our close relationships with
customers and continuing emphasis on technical
development and productivity improvement, together with
the restructuring initiatives already noted, have enabled us
largely to mitigate these and, notwithstanding their impact,
we remain committed to achieving our targeted margins.
GKN Driveline
GKN Driveline specialises in the manufacture of
components for light vehicle drivelines (defined as the
components that transfer torque between a vehicle’s
transmission and its driven wheels). These include geared
components (transfer cases, power transfer units and final

Source: Global Insight GKN Driveshafts
GKN Driveshafts is the global leader in the production of
constant velocity jointed (CVJ) products for use in light
vehicle drivelines. The majority of CVJs are used in
sideshafts for front wheel drive, rear wheel drive and four
wheel drive vehicles; CVJ sideshafts are required for every
driven axle with independent suspension. Some, but not
all, longitudinal propshafts are also fitted with CVJs. 
In 2007, based on internal estimates, GKN Driveshafts’
businesses, including its joint ventures, produced
approximately 40% of CVJs for the global light vehicle market.
The market share of the next largest independent producer is
estimated to be less than half this level, with around 24% of
CVJs produced by Vehicle Manufacturers’ (VMs) in-house
operations. The strong order win rate achieved during 2007
continues to underpin our expectations of increased market
share in 2008 and future years.
GKN Driveshafts manufactures CVJs and related products
in 21 countries across all major vehicle producing regions
of the world and has enjoyed considerable success in
developing markets, with strong market shares of some
84% in South America and 51% in the developing Asia
Pacific region (excluding Japan and South Korea).
GKN Driveshafts is also one of the largest suppliers of
premium propshafts, which we define as those propshafts
with sophisticated joints, materials or other features. We
estimate that in 2007 premium propshafts represented
approximately 38% of global light vehicle propshaft
demand, or some 11 million propshaft assemblies. GKN
Driveshafts’ share of this segment was in the region of 20%.
Torque Technology Group
TTG develops and manufactures a broad range of 
driveline products which deliver power to a vehicle’s
wheels and manage that power to control the dynamic
performance of the vehicle. We offer a complete range 
of power transfer (geared) components and power 
control (torque management) products as both stand-
alone and integrated devices to VMs and to certain tier
one suppliers. 
Geared components include products enabling the
distribution of power on all wheel drive/four wheel drive
(AWD/4WD) and two wheel drive (2WD) vehicles and
include power take-off units (PTUs), final drive units
(FDUs) and differentials. TMDs are mechanical (passive) 
or electro-mechanical (active) devices that improve
vehicle performance and handling by controlling the flow
of torque throughout the driveline.
Geared components, which are sold principally to VMs in
the Asia Pacific region but increasingly in the Americas
and Europe, currently account for approximately half of
TTG’s annual sales. Our products are enjoying continued
growth above overall market levels as VMs increasingly
introduce new ‘crossover’ vehicles that combine four
wheel drive with car-like dynamics, comfort and improved
fuel economy. 
We estimate that in 2007 GKN supplied approximately
14% of TMDs for light vehicle applications globally. 
Sales volumes of our electronically controlled coupling
devices (ETM, EMCD and ETV) are increasing
progressively, building upon our established passive
product range which includes the Viscodrive and Super
Limited Slip Differential (LSD) product families.
Other Driveline businesses
Other Driveline businesses operate manufacturing plants,
warehouses and service facilities throughout Europe and
provide a comprehensive range of new and
remanufactured sideshafts and other components for the
passenger vehicle aftermarket. They also provide services
to repair and replace heavy truck and other industrial
propshafts, as well as engineering, producing and selling
low volume, highly specialised propshafts and driveline
components for non-automotive applications such as
industrial, marine, defence and all-terrain vehicles. 
GKN Driveline divisional strategy
Key long term drivers in Driveline’s markets are customer
demographics, safety legislation, rising global fuel
consumption, and rapidly growing personal mobility
which is forecast to result in emerging markets continuing
to provide the growth in new vehicle demand. Overall, 
this is likely to lead to some slowing of growth in the
4WD/AWD markets (with reductions in North America 
but increases elsewhere), increasing penetration of AWD
on smaller vehicles, and some consumer shift from 
4WD to AWD.

development of the Driveshafts, TTG and other Driveline
businesses.
GKN Driveshafts, which as noted above already has a high
market share, aims to achieve profit growth through:
 maintaining technological leadership by focused
product development;
 expansion in emerging markets both through overall
market growth and by leveraging existing relationships
with both global and local VMs;
 low cost, high quality manufacturing on a global
basis; and
 selective business acquisitions where they are
complementary to our core competencies, including
outsourcing of CVJ manufacture by VMs.
TTG is focused on growth and aims to generate increasing
shareholder value by:
 extending its position in global AWD/4WD markets, to
deliver growth in core geared products;
 leveraging product technology and vehicle engineering
skills to maintain leadership in TMDs, largely for AWD
applications;
 capitalising on opportunities in high volume
differentials for AWD and 2WD vehicles; 
 increasing margins to the average level of Driveline as a
whole; and
 pursuing acquisition opportunities to strengthen
market positions in core products and in adjacent
product markets which can benefit from our technology.
Our other Driveline businesses are focused on developing
and growing sustainable and value creative niches for our
Driveline technologies.
2007 Highlights
On a management basis GKN Driveline sales increased to
£2,052 million from £1,997 million in 2006. Excluding the
adverse impact of currency (£53 million) and the small
effect of the 2006 divestment of Fujiwa (£5 million), the
underlying increase was £113 million (6%). 
Within this, subsidiaries’ sales in the year totalled £1,922
million compared with £1,884 million in 2006. The
negative impacts of currency translation and 2006
divestment were £47 million and £5 million respectively
so that the underlying increase was £90 million (5%). This
increase arose in GKN Driveshafts in South America and
Europe reflecting the high level of business wins over the
past two years, in TTG where there was strong demand
from Japanese customers and in other Driveline
businesses where market conditions were favourable.
The share of joint venture sales (which are not
consolidated in the Group income statement but are set
out in note 12 to the financial statements) also grew
significantly to £130 million from £113 million in 2006,
with the underlying increase £23 million (21%). This arose
mainly in the Chinese companies where the organic sales
growth was 31%, ahead of the overall market.
Trading profit on a management basis increased by £15
million from £151 million to £166 million. There was no
overall translational impact from currency but a £1 million
negative impact from 2006 divestments. Excluding this,
the increase was £16 million (11%) and margin improved
to 8.1% from 7.6%. Return on invested capital was 18.5%
(2006 – 17.2%).
Subsidiaries’ trading profit was £149 million compared
with £138 million in 2006. Excluding the impact for 2006
divestments noted above, the increase was £12 million
(9%) with increases in both GKN Driveshafts and TTG as a
result of the higher level of sales. In GKN Driveshafts,
however, the profit improvement was held back somewhat
by the net impact of higher than anticipated raw material
costs and the shortage of certain steel products which
caused significant operational inefficiencies and led to
additional costs in Europe. These were mitigated
somewhat by the profits arising from property
rationalisation actions and non-recurring credits arising
from changes to the retiree medical arrangements in the
US. Return on sales improved from 7.3% to 7.8%.
The Group’s share of trading profit of joint ventures
increased from £13 million to £17 million with the
underlying increase, excluding minor adverse currency
impacts, £4 million (31%). The increase arose almost
entirely in China, mainly as a consequence of higher sales.
The strategic restructuring programme announced in 2004
was effectively completed and charges in the year totalled
£19 million (2006 – £37 million). A final charge of
approximately £4 million will be made in the 2008
accounts in respect of costs which, under accounting
rules, cannot be accrued in 2007.
Capital expenditure on tangible assets in the year totalled
£94 million (2006 restated –£96 million) and was 1.3
times (2006 – 1.3 times) depreciation. 
GKN Driveline spent £57 million in the year on research
and development. £55 million was charged to profit and
£2 million capitalised. This latter figure was incurred by
TTG and represented investment on programmes the first
of which has gone into production early in 2008.
In GKN Driveshafts there has been continued development
of crosstrack™ and countertrack™ technology for mature
markets and low cost joints for specific applications (such
as the Tata Nano, launched in India in early 2008) in
emerging markets.
Countertrack™, which is used in fixed CVJ applications,
offers reduced size, weight and CO
2
emissions. Firm
agreements have been reached with seven vehicle
manufacturers to supply countertrack™ joints for up to 
4 million vehicles (at annualised rates) with the first of
these entering production in 2008.
Crosstrack™ offers improved NVH (noise, vibration and
harshness) characteristics as well as lower weight, and
negotiations are at an advanced stage with a leading
European vehicle manufacturer.
Demand for low cost vehicles will be significant in
emerging markets and we have made considerable
investment in developing a low cost driveshaft for use in
such vehicles. These are now available and are
manufactured in Brazil, India and China for use on the Tata
Nano and Indica and Dacia Logan. Although selling prices
on such products tend to be somewhat lower, margins are
similar to those on traditional designs.

Other Automotive
Our Other Automotive subsidiary activities, which are
predominantly UK based, but with small facilities in the
US and China, manufacture structural components,
chassis and engine cylinder liners for the passenger car,
SUV and light vehicle and truck markets in Western

Emitec which manufactures metallic substrates for
catalytic converters in Germany, the US, China and India.
Divisional strategy
Our Other Automotive businesses aim to create

strengths and driving a cost-effective manufacturing base
that will allow them to take advantage of opportunities for
growth in their specific regional or global markets. 
Through our investment in Emitec and, in conjunction with
our partner in the joint venture, Continental, we aim to

global application of Emitec’s metallic substrate
technology to meet increasingly stringent emissions
legislation in petrol and diesel automotive, truck and
two/three wheel vehicle applications. 
2007 Highlights
Sales on a management basis totalled £229 million
compared with £212 million in 2006. Excluding
Sheepbridge, which was closed during the year, the
combined sales of continuing subsidiaries and joint
ventures were £207 million compared with £185 million in
2006 with an underlying increase of £23 million (13%).
Sales of subsidiaries in the year were £109 million
compared with £120 million in 2006. Excluding
Sheepbridge, sales of £87 million were £6 million (6%)
below 2006.
The share of sales of joint ventures increased from £92
million to £120 million with particularly strong growth in
Emitec in Germany as a result of legislation enacted in
2006 requiring the retrofitting of particulate filters to
diesel powered vehicles. 
Trading profit of continuing businesses on a management
basis rose to £12 million from £7 million in 2006. Within
this figure, there was a loss at subsidiaries of £3 million
(2006 – £1 million), largely as a result of lower demand in
the AutoStructures business coupled with the impact of a
severe breakdown in pressing capacity which cost some
£1 million. As a result of these capacity issues,
operational activity is being reorganised and this has led
to a non-cash asset impairment charge of £1 million. The
Chinese cylinder liner business was just above break even
in the year and modest improvement is expected in 2008.
Return on invested capital was 18.8% (2006 – 10.4%).
Both joint ventures performed well and the Group’s share
of profits improved from £8 million to £15 million. CSL
benefited both from higher sales and the one time impact
of the finalisation of contractual pricing arrangements.
Emitec profits reflected the strong sales performance
noted above.

Business Review
Powder Metallurgy comprises:
GKN Sinter Metals
Hoeganaes Products
GKN’s Powder Metallurgy business has two elements:
GKN Sinter Metals which produces sintered components
and Hoeganaes which produces metal powders. They are
largely iron based, although growth is also being seen in
the use of aluminium and other alloys. 
GKN Sinter Metals
GKN Sinter Metals utilises powdered metals to
manufacture precision automotive components for
engines, transmissions, and body and chassis
applications as well as a range of components for other
industrial and consumer applications.
Although market statistics are somewhat imprecise due to
the significant number of small producers, GKN estimates
that it has in the region of 15% global market share in the
sintered product business. Approximately 80% of sales
are made to automotive customers with around 35%,
either directly or indirectly, to the North American
operations of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors. 
GKN Sinter Metals is significantly larger than any of its
competitors and as such is well placed to drive technology
leadership in product and process through the leverage of
global resources. Component production takes place in
the Americas, Europe, South Africa and Asia Pacific. This
global manufacturing footprint continues to develop with
the establishment of further operations in India and
China, together with expansion in Argentina, to support
new business secured in both local and other markets.
Hoeganaes
Hoeganaes produces principally ferrous based metal
powder, the raw material for ferrous based sintered
components. It is the largest producer of metal powder in
North America with approximately 50% market share. It
has also continued its development outside the US,
particularly in Europe where sales growth in 2007 was
some 30% due to increased usage by GKN’s own sintering
companies in this region. Approximately 50% of powder
produced by Hoeganaes is shipped to external customers,
mainly in the US, and accounts for some 13% of the
Powder Metallurgy division’s sales. 
Markets
Approximately 80% of divisional sales are to automotive
markets which are discussed in detail on page 20. The
balance of 20% is to a range of other industries, including
office equipment, white goods and home and garden.
These markets were generally good in 2007 and, whilst
the overall economic outlook for 2008 is less certain, the
trend for continued penetration of powder metallurgy into
these sectors is expected to continue.
Input costs
The main raw material is scrap steel where prices were
approximately 10% higher in 2007 than 2006. Other
important input costs relate to nickel and copper (where a
substantial element of our anticipated requirement is
hedged), molybdenum and energy. Overall, these costs
were also higher than last year although there was a
downward trend in nickel prices in the second half.
Divisional strategy
Growth in the powder metallurgy market is expected to
continue, driven primarily by substitution for cast or
forged components and a developing trend for
components to be ‘designed for Powder Metal’ to take
advantage of net shape and performance capabilities.
Forecasts for the sintered component market anticipate
an increase from approximately £3.5 billion in 2007 to
around £5 billion in 2012, a compound annual growth rate
of some 5%. In addition, technology advances are
expected to open up new product applications which
should lead to growth above this level. Both operations
share a similar strategy which aims to capitalise on this
growth. 
Over the past two years GKN Sinter Metals has focused 
on maintaining the profitable expansion of its European
sintering business whilst returning its US operation to
profitability following a number of years of heavy losses. 
It has also sought to establish a global operational
footprint. Hoeganaes has focused on growing profitability
in its European business, improving operating
performance in North America and developing its
business cost-effectively in the rapidly growing emerging
markets of Asia. With good progress now achieved in each
of these areas the division has a short term goal to
achieve profit margins in the same range as in GKN’s
Automotive businesses and to increase top line growth in
the range of 6% to 8% annually.

 customer base diversification, particularly in Asia
Pacific, so reducing the dependency on a number of
customers in the US;
 broadening the manufacturing footprint in a cost-
effective way, particularly through the expansion of
facilities in the Asia Pacific region; and 
 continuing operational improvement through the
implementation worldwide of best practice and
continuous improvement through the GKN Lean
Enterprise programme, focused on both manufacturing
and business processes. 
2007 Highlights
Sales in the year were £602 million compared with £582
million in 2006. The impact of currency on translation was
£22 million negative so that underlying growth was £42
million (8%).
Half of the improvement arose in GKN Sinter Metals in
Europe where there was good demand from non-
automotive customers and a number of new automotive
programmes came on stream towards the end of the year.
There was also strong growth in GKN Sinter Metals in the
emerging markets of South America and Asia, though
from a smaller base. In North America the growth was
slower with the benefit from new business more than
offsetting the adverse impact of reduced US automotive
production. The geographical mix of GKN Sinter Metals’
business thus continued the trend away from North
America towards other regions with 42% of sales being
made in North America in 2007. Hoeganaes’ sales
improved by over 10%, with the increase predominantly
reflecting higher surcharges to customers.
Trading profit in the year was £29 million compared with
£31 million in 2006, with currency accounting for £1
million of the reduction. The balance was more than
accounted for by a fall in profits at Hoeganaes North
America where raw material costs were significantly
higher than the previous year and there was an absence
of favourable copper and nickel commodity contracts
which had benefited the second half of 2006. In GKN
Sinter Metals, a volume-led improvement in Europe was
offset by reductions in North America and Asia. GKN Sinter
Metals North America was impacted in the second half by
costs associated with the introduction of new
programmes as well as some operating inefficiencies as a
consequence of the final stages of restructuring. Profits
ended level with 2006. GKN Sinter Metals’ operations in
Asia made a small loss by comparison with a small profit
in 2006, primarily due to new plant start up costs in China.
Return on sales fell to 4.8% from 5.3% last year but is
anticipated to improve towards the target of 8% to 10% in
2008 as operations in North America stabilise post
restructuring and new programmes are implemented.
Return on invested capital in the period was 6.9% (2006 –
7.4%) against the target of 12%, reflecting the impact of
the North American issues noted above.
Net restructuring costs and asset impairments in 2007
totalled £14 million (2006 – £24 million). These related to
the closure in the year of plants in North America and
Germany and the run out of closures announced in earlier
years. This completed the strategic restructuring and no
further charges are anticipated in 2008.
Capital expenditure on tangible fixed assets in the period
totalled £38 million (2006 – £49 million) with depreciation
of £28 million (2006 – £28 million). The ratio of 1.4 times
(2006 – 1.8 times) is expected to reduce again in 2008 to
around 1.2 times.
Research and development activities continued to be
focused on increasing density and improving surface
finish which has led to a number of new applications for
gear components in diesel engines and transmissions. A
number of potential applications are being explored with
automotive VMs which will increase the powder
metallurgy content of automatic transmissions.
There were significant new business wins in the year in 
all regions which totalled approximately £115 million at
annualised rates and support the targeted sales growth 
of 6% to 8% per annum.

Major customers include many of the world’s major off-
highway equipment manufacturers such as John Deere,
Caterpillar, Case New Holland, CLAAS and AGCO, with a
large percentage of sales going to a wide range of
component users.
Markets
During 2007, approximately 63% of divisional sales were
to the agricultural market, 23% to the construction and
mining equipment market and the balance to the
industrial machinery market. The wheels operation
accounts for over 43% of divisional revenue and has
around a 31% market share in North America and 44% in
Western Europe. The power take-off (PTO) shafts and
gearbox operation accounts for around 33% of sales, with
market shares of 27% and 51% in those regions. 
Agriculture
In Europe (46% of 2007 divisional sales) the overall
agricultural machinery market continued its upward trend.
In North America (14% of divisional sales) demand was
strong, driven predominantly by high crop prices as a
direct result of biofuel demands.
Both markets are experiencing some of the highest
commodity prices for many years and historically this has
been directly linked to increased agricultural equipment sales.
Construction and mining
The European construction and mining machinery market
(12% of divisional sales) remained solid throughout the
year and continued its upward trend.
In the US (9% of divisional sales), well publicised
reductions in housing starts reduced demand in some
areas (mainly local light construction machinery sales) but
this was more than offset by exports and continued
growth in demand for heavy construction equipment.
Our positioning within emerging markets has increased with
the acquisition in 2006 of Liuzhou Wheels in China and
market opportunities in 2008 look positive in this region.
Industrial machinery
This sector (14% of divisional sales) includes products for
material handling and a range of other industries.
Demand in this segment in 2007 was flat and the outlook
for 2008 is for little or no change.

The cost structure in GKN OffHighway is similar to
Automotive with the major costs being steel, energy and
labour. In general, the business has been successful in
mitigating fully the effect of steel price increases during a
period when end markets for both agricultural and
construction equipment have been generally firm, though
the timing of price increases from suppliers or to
customers may have an impact on a particular reporting
period. 
Divisional strategy
GKN OffHighway’s strategy is to achieve value creating
growth whilst at the same time reducing its dependence
on the Western European agricultural market through
increasing its global exposure and broadening its end
markets by:
 new, technology-led product development in existing
businesses;
 supporting original equipment manufacturers as they
relocate production to emerging markets in Eastern
Europe, Asia Pacific and South America; and
 making selective bolt-on acquisitions which serve
developing markets or provide adjacent product
technologies.
2007 Highlights
Sales of subsidiaries in the year were £416 million
compared with £353 million (restated) in 2006. There was
a £6 million reduction from currency translation and a
benefit of £27 million from 2006 acquisitions. The
underlying increase of £42 million (12%) mainly reflected
good conditions in most markets.
Trading profit of subsidiaries of £29 million was £4 million
above 2006. Within this, the Wheels business experienced
capacity related inefficiencies in Europe and North
America and under recovery of material costs in the period
due to timing, whilst in Driveline Systems there were
additional costs from supply chain disruption which
intensified during the second half of the year. Liuzhou, 
the wheels business acquired towards the end of 2006,
moved out of loss in the year but its low level of
profitability diluted divisional margins. The other
businesses benefited from higher sales and performed
well, with a good contribution from Rockford, the 2006
acquisition which services construction and mining.
Margins reduced to 7.0% from 7.1% in 2006 and return 
on invested capital was 17.0% compared with 16.4% 
in 2006.
Capital expenditure on tangible fixed assets of £11 million
(2006 restated –£12 million) was 1.1 times (2006 – 1.3
times) depreciation.
During the year, the division was successful in attracting 
a high level of orders and enters 2008 with order books 
at record levels. 
The 2006 acquisitions, notably Rockford, were
successfully integrated and are performing in line with 
or ahead of plan.
The division continued its focus on research and
development and the newly developed Hydromech
gearbox was successfully tested with a European
customer and has entered into initial production.

Business Review Products
GKN Aerospace is a leading supplier of airframe and
engine structures, components, assemblies and
engineering services to aircraft prime contractors and
other first tier suppliers and operates in three main
product areas: aerostructures, propulsion systems and
special products.
At the end of 2007 the analysis of business by sales
revenue was approximately 53% aerostructures (2006 –
50%), 33% propulsion systems (2006 – 30%) and 14%
special products (2006 – 20%). The increases in
aerostructures and propulsion systems were largely the
result of businesses acquired in 2006 and 2007 whilst the
reduction in special products group was mainly due to the
ending of a number of military transparencies spares
contracts. The aftermarket business spans all three and
equates to approximately 15% of overall revenues. 
As a leader in the design and manufacture of advanced
composites, transparencies and complex metal structures
at the component and assembly level, GKN Aerospace
serves all the major airframe and engine original
equipment manufacturers. The business is focused on the
creation of value through technological excellence in
composite technologies (19% sales), lightweight, highly
stressed metallic components (43% sales), integrated
systems and aftermarket service (23% sales) and other
areas, including aircraft canopy and ice protection
systems (15% sales). It operates through 20
manufacturing facilities across the world supported by a
worldwide network of design and support facilities.
The customer base is relatively concentrated with the top
three customers representing some 50% of divisional
sales. Current annualised sales are approximately 58% to
defence and 42% to civil customers. Some 65% of sales
by origin are in the US.
Markets 
The overall aerospace market was buoyant in 2007, with
sustained strength in both the civil and military sectors. 
In the civil airliner market, Airbus and Boeing delivered in
aggregate 894 aircraft in the year compared with 832 in
2006. At the end of the year there were some 6,800
aircraft on order worth $750 billion at current list prices
and equivalent to 6 years’ production. Looking forward to
2008, order levels for civil airliners are forecast to be
below 2007 levels, although still ahead of current
production rates and, with the order backlog noted above,
the entry into service of the A380 and B787 and the
launch of the A350 XWB (extra wide body), production is
likely to remain high. 
Demand for regional and business jets was good and
higher than 2006. The regional aircraft market is forecast
to remain fairly stable with a resurgence in demand for
turbo prop aeroplanes. Business jets are expected to
show sustained growth with new entrants in the existing
market and considerable activity in the emerging very
light jet sector.
The defence market was also strong in the year and US
spending is likely to remain solid in the short term with
fighter production stabilising at around 100 per year,
slowly consolidating around the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF)
platform. Growth in non-US defence spending on aircraft
procurement is strengthening and during 2007 there have
been additional orders for the C-130J, F-18 and F-15, all of
which have significant GKN content. 
Within these markets, there is continuing growth in
demand for lightweight materials and advanced
composites and complex titanium structures which
provide opportunities for increased passenger load and
fuel efficiency.

supply agreements has, to a large extent (around 70% at
the end of 2007), secured both supply and price. In some
cases sales contracts contain arrangements for the
automatic adjustment of prices if input costs change. 
Divisional strategy
GKN Aerospace’s strategic priorities are to:
 continue to increase presence in the commercial sector
and aftermarket through organic growth and
acquisitions;
 establish meaningful positions on future defence and
commercial platforms, with particular focus on the next

2007 Highlights
GKN Aerospace sales were £820 million compared with
£695 million in 2006. The impact of currency on
translation was £33 million negative while acquisitions
added £96 million. The underlying increase was £62
million (9%) and arose as a consequence of the overall
strong markets, in particular for regional aircraft, and a
number of new programmes which entered or increased
production during the year.
Trading profit of £83 million was £13 million higher than
2006. Excluding the benefit from acquisitions of £12
million and the negative impact of currency (£3 million),
the underlying increase of £4 million was 6% above 2006
reflecting the benefit of higher sales.
The margin of 10.1% was the same as 2006, in line with
the target margin for the business, and return on invested
capital was 15.3% (2006 – 15.1%).
Capital expenditure on tangible assets in the year was £28
million (2006 – £30 million) which represented 1.2 times
(2006 – 1.4 times) depreciation. Of this figure £9 million
was in respect of new programmes, including the B787.
Capital expenditure on intangible assets (mainly non-
recurring costs) totalled £16 million (2006 – £27 million)
and reflected investment in a number of important
programmes including B787, A400M and JSF.
In 2007, GKN Aerospace secured a number of new
programmes, including:
 a system design and development contract for the
fuselage aft transition for the Sikorsky CH-53K; 
 the design, development and manufacture of the B767-
300 ER (extended range) blended winglet, with first
deliveries commencing in the fourth quarter of 2008.
The agreement covers the supply of up to 300 767-300
ER and 200 737-300/500 blended winglet shipsets; and
 the development and supply of advanced titanium
metal matrix composite (TMMC) thrust links for the
B787. This represents the first use of TMMC in a
commercial application and offers major weight savings
of up to 40% over traditional material. 
In addition, we have extended our content on a range of
existing programmes where there is strong market
demand including the F-18, JSF, B787 and a range of other
commercial aircraft.
GKN now has established positions on a wide range of
programmes that show substantial growth over the next
10 years.
In 2007 research programmes made considerable
progress. Our involvement in a number of funded
programmes to develop the wing for the next generation
single aisle aircraft (including VITAL, Integrated Wing and
ALCAS) has moved forward with speed and generated
significant intellectual property. Two new programmes
have been approved to commence in 2008 — the Next
Generation Composite Wing with Airbus and a potential
programme with Rolls-Royce to develop a lightweight
composite engine fan. 
The integration of the Stellex businesses acquired in 
2006 was completed, in line with the acquisition plan,
during 2007.
In June 2007, GKN acquired the Teleflex Aerospace
Manufacturing Group of Teleflex Inc. The business is a
leading manufacturer of complex engine components for
the aerospace industry and increases the division’s
presence in civil aerospace, giving positions on a range of
established engine programmes such as the CFM56 and
GE90 as well as new programmes for the light jet market
and also the F-135 Joint Striker Fighter engine for the
military market. The business has both a range of cold
section products that are complementary to GKN in engine
cases and fan blades, and hot section core activities in
blisks, compressor airfoils and guide vanes. 
On 19 December 2007, GKN was selected as the preferred
partner for the acquisition from Airbus of their Filton wing
aerostructures site including the potential award of
design and manufacturing packages for the A350 XWB
wing programme. The combination of Filton with our
existing capability would enable us to create a globally
competitive centre of excellence for the design and
manufacture of composite aircraft wing structures.
Going forward into 2008, sales revenue is expected to
continue to grow organically as a result of new
programmes moving into production, notably the B787
and the A380, together with increased levels of
development work including the CH-53K and the A350
XWB. Margins in the existing business are expected to
improve based on the further implementation of lean
manufacturing practices and the progression of a number
of recent programmes into full production.

Financing and Risk
Business Review
Financing
The following section describes the way in which the
Group manages and controls its treasury function and
ensures it is financed in an appropriate and cost-effective
manner.
Treasury management
All treasury activities are co-ordinated through a central
function (Group Treasury), the purpose of which is to
manage the financial risks of the Group as described
below and to secure short and long term funding at the
minimum cost to the Group. It operates within a
framework of clearly defined Board-approved policies and
procedures, including permissible funding and hedging
instruments, exposure limits and a system of authorities
for the approval and execution of transactions. It operates
on a cost centre basis and is not permitted to make use of
financial instruments or other derivatives other than to
hedge identified exposures of the Group. Speculative use
of such instruments or derivatives is not permitted. 
Group Treasury prepares reports at least annually to the
Board, and on a monthly basis to the Finance Director and
other senior executives of the Group. In addition, liquidity,
interest rate, currency and other financial risk exposures
are monitored daily and the gross and net indebtedness of
the Group is reported on a weekly basis to the Chief
Executive and the Finance Director. The Group Treasury
function is subject to an annual internal and external
review of controls.
Funding and liquidity
The Group funds its operations through a mixture of
retained earnings and borrowing facilities, including bank
and capital markets borrowings and leasing. The relative
proportions of equity and borrowings are governed by
specific Board-approved parameters. These are designed
to preserve prudent financial ratios, including interest,
dividend and cash flow cover, whilst also minimising the
overall weighted average cost of capital to the Group.
All the Group’s borrowing facilities are arranged by Group
Treasury and the funds raised are then lent to operating
subsidiaries on commercial arm’s length terms. In some
cases operating subsidiaries have external borrowings,
but these are supervised and controlled centrally. The
Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between
continuity of funding and flexibility through borrowing at a
range of maturities from both capital markets and bank
sources. Bank borrowings are principally in the form of
five year committed multi-currency bilateral revolving
credit facilities that mature in 2010 with a group of
relationship banks. There were no borrowings against
these facilities as at 31 December 2007.
Capital market borrowings of £705 million include
unsecured issues of £350 million 6.75% bonds maturing
in 2019 and £325 million 7% bonds maturing in 2012,
together with £30 million debenture stock of Westland
Group plc, maturing in 2008, which is secured on assets of
that company and certain of its subsidiaries. 
At the year end the Group had committed borrowing
facilities of £1,090 million, of which £734 million was
drawn. The weighted average maturity profile of the
Group’s committed borrowings was 7.9 years. This leaves
the Group well placed to withstand sudden changes in
liquidity in the financial markets.
The Group also has access to significant lines of
uncommitted funds which are used principally to manage
day-to-day liquidity. Wherever practicable, pooling,
netting or concentration techniques are employed to
minimise gross debt.
At the year end the Group had £145 million on deposit in
the UK mainly held in money market funds or with banks
at maturities of three months or less. 
Financial resources and going concern
At 31 December 2007 the Group had net borrowings of
£506 million. In addition, it had available, but undrawn,
committed borrowing facilities totalling £356 million.
Having assessed the future funding requirements of the
Group and the Company, the Directors are of the opinion
that it is appropriate for the accounts to be prepared on a
going concern basis.
Risks and uncertainties
Our business is exposed to a number of risks and
uncertainties. 
As part of the Group’s risk management process each
business assesses the likelihood and potential impact of a
range of events in the light of their current circumstances
and processes, to determine the overall risk level and to
identify actions necessary to mitigate their impact. A
detailed description of the Group’s procedures to manage
risk is given in the corporate governance statement on
pages 54 and 55. 
This section highlights those risks which could have a
material impact on our future financial performance and
cause results to differ materially from expected and
historical results. Additional risks not currently known or
which are regarded as immaterial could also affect future
performance.
www.gkn.com Financial risk
The Group is exposed to a variety of market related risks,
including the effects of changes in foreign currency
exchange rates and interest rates. In the normal course of
business, the Group also faces risks that are either non-
financial or non-quantifiable, including country and
credit risk.
The Group uses interest rate swaps, swaptions, forward
rate agreements, netting techniques and forward
exchange contracts as required to manage the primary
market exposures associated with its underlying assets,
liabilities and anticipated transactions.
Currency risk
The Group has transactional currency exposures arising
from sales or purchases by operating subsidiaries in
currencies other than the subsidiaries’ functional
currency. Under the Group’s foreign exchange policy, such
transaction exposures are hedged once they are known,
mainly through the use of forward foreign exchange
contracts. The Group has a significant investment in
overseas operations, particularly in continental Europe
and the Americas. As a result, the sterling value of the
Group’s balance sheet can be affected by movements in
exchange rates. The Group therefore seeks to mitigate the
effect of these translational currency exposures by
matching the net investment in overseas operations with
borrowings denominated in their functional currencies,
except where significant adverse interest differentials or
other factors would render the cost of such hedging
activity uneconomic. This is achieved by borrowing either
directly (in either the local domestic or euro-currency
markets) or indirectly through the use of rolling annual
forward foreign exchange contracts. Borrowings created
through the use of such contracts amounted to £762
million at 31 December 2007 and were denominated in US
dollars (46%), euro (44%) and Japanese yen (10%). 
Interest rate risk
The Group operates an interest rate policy designed to
optimise interest cost and reduce volatility in reported
earnings. To achieve this it maintains a target range of
fixed and floating rate debt for discrete annual periods,
over a defined time horizon, partly through the fixed rate
character of the underlying debt instrument, and partly
through the use of straightforward derivatives (forward
rate agreements, interest rate swaps and swaptions).
Interest rates on all debt capital market issues remain at
fixed rates whilst the balance of debt is at floating rates.
At 31 December 2007, 89% of the Group’s gross financial
liabilities were at fixed rates of interest, whilst the
weighted average period in respect of which interest has
been fixed was 7.9 years. 
Credit risk
The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event
of non-performance by counterparties to financial
instruments, which include trade debtors. 
Credit risk relating to financial institutions is mitigated by
the Group’s policy of selecting only counterparties with a
strong investment graded long term credit rating, 
normally at least AA- or equivalent, and assigning
financial limits to individual counterparties.
With the concentration of customers noted below, the
financial failure of any one of them could have a material
impact on results. The Group closely monitors credit
exposures which are reported to divisional management,
and overall divisional performance is reviewed regularly
by the Executive Committee. At 31 December 2007 the
largest individual debtor balance was 1.1% of Group sales.
In addition to the inherent specific financial risks and their
management referred to above, there are other, more
general, financial risks that could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, or results of
operations.
Pension and retiree medical risk
We operate both defined benefit (DB) and defined
contribution (DC) pension plans, together with retiree
medical arrangements. The majority of the DB plans are in
the UK, North America and continental Europe. Retiree
medical arrangements are limited to North America and
the UK, where there is a closed scheme. In total, the DB
pension and retiree medical schemes were in deficit by
£331 million as at 31 December 2007. Deterioration in
asset prices, changes to real long term interest rates or
the strengthening of longevity assumptions could lead to
an increase in the deficit or give rise to an additional
funding requirement.
Taxation risk
The Group operates in over 30 countries and as a
consequence is subject to many complex tax laws and
administrative procedures. The Group’s interpretation and
implementation of these laws and procedures may be
subject to detailed scrutiny by tax authorities undertaking
audits and ultimately litigation, which can take several
years to complete. 
Amounts accrued and provided for income tax liabilities
are based upon management’s judgement taking into
account their interpretation of tax law in each country and
the likelihood of settlement where there is a tax dispute.
However, actual tax liabilities could differ from the
provisions made by management and the difference
would give rise to an adjustment in a subsequent period
which could have a material impact on the Group’s profit
and loss and/or cash position. 
Market and customer related risk
Global economic and political risk
GKN operates in over 30 countries including several in the
emerging markets of Asia Pacific and Latin America and is,
therefore, exposed to a wide range of risks including
political, regulatory, environmental and socio-economic
factors. However, we are also in a position to benefit from
significant growth opportunities and a diversified
business base.
Cyclical nature of the markets in which we operate
Approximately 56% of our 2007 sales were for automotive
vehicle manufacturers and 20% for original equipment on
aircraft or aircraft components.
The automotive industry, in common with other capital
goods industries, is affected by macro-economic
conditions and consumer demand and preferences. The
38 GKN plc Annual Report 2007
Business Review
Financing and Risk
continued military aircraft element of our business is affected by
political considerations, particularly in the US, whilst 
civil demand is affected by the number of passenger miles
flown which, in turn, is a function of economic growth and
personal spending power and perceived security risk.
Customer concentration and relationships
Within the automotive and aerospace industries there is a
significant degree of customer concentration. As a result
the Group receives approximately 48% of its sales
revenue from 11 major global customers. The loss of or
damage to any of these relationships or a significant
worsening of commercial terms with these customers
could have a material impact on the Group’s results.
At the same time the Group enjoys good relationships
with customers who have a strong market share and
derives a significant benefit from trading with customers
of this nature. Considerable resource is devoted to ensure
that these good relationships are maintained and
developed.
Technological change
The markets for our products and services are
characterised by evolutionary change driven by consumer
preference for increased safety and more focus on the
environmental impact of motor vehicles and aircraft. We
ensure that we are responsive to this by focused
investment in technological development in all
businesses.
The credit crunch
The credit crunch, which has impacted the world’s
financial markets in the latter months of 2007 and the
early part of 2008 and has contributed to uncertainties
over near term macro-economic conditions, has not
introduced new exposures for the Group. Rather, it has
intensified certain of the financial and market risks noted
above in response to which we have intensified our
monitoring and controls in those areas.
Manufacturing and operational risks
Manufacturing strategy
Strategies are developed with the objective of aligning
production with the lowest available cost base. Failure to
meet customer requirements as these are implemented
would impact upon both short and longer term customer
relationships. We have considerable experience of
implementing operational change and a wealth of
experience to draw on to minimise this risk.
Product quality and liability
The nature of our products means that we face an
inherent risk of product liability claims if failure results in
any claim for injury or consequential loss. However, our
customers require high levels of quality assurance and
manufacturing systems in place to ensure that our quality
record is world class in both Automotive and Aerospace.
Appropriate levels of insurance are in place covering
product liability of third parties although the Group does
not generally insure against the cost of product warranty
or recall.
Supply chain
Our manufacturing processes may have dependencies on
the availability of specific equipment and raw materials.
An inability to supply because of their non-availability
would affect our sales and relationships with our
customers. Contingency plans exist to ensure continuity of
supply, though in most cases this would result in
additional costs which may or may not be recoverable
through insurance.
IT systems reliability, security and change
Our IT systems and networks are secured by formalised
back-up systems, hardware, virus protection and other
measures but any interruption could lead to disruption in
service. A breakdown of security or damage arising from
any cause could affect our operational performance or
revenue. 
Management resources
Rapid growth in some of the emerging economies in which
we operate has, in certain cases, given rise to an
extremely competitive market for and shortages of
appropriately qualified personnel. We address this
through focused recruitment and a combination of
education, training and retention/reward systems to
attract and retain key staff in those countries together
with the deployment of experienced GKN management on
a secondment basis.
Technology risk
Many of the Group’s products are technologically
advanced or use technologically advanced processes in
their manufacture and continuous improvement takes
place as new technology is developed. In order to
maintain the competitiveness of our products we make
focused investment in research and development so as to
achieve or maintain technological leadership in our key
businesses and retain the competitive advantage which
such leadership gives.
Environmental risk
The environmental laws of various countries impose
obligations on our businesses to operate in an
environmentally friendly way. Failure to do so would result
not only in financial consequences but also in damage to
our reputation and may impact shareholder value as well
as our employees and communities in which we operate.
In environmental terms, our manufacturing processes are
not inherently high risk; nevertheless, great care is taken
to prevent any adverse impact arising.
Insurance
The Group insures against the impact of a range of
unpredicted losses associated with business assets such
as buildings, plant, machinery and ensuing financial
impact arising from interruption to the business, as well
as its liabilities (whether statutory or not) in connection
with employees, products supplied or the public at large.
This insurance takes the form of a significant level of
capped self-insured retention at the Group level (within
GKN’s own captive insurance company, Ipsley Insurance
Ltd (Ipsley), which does not insure the risks of any other
entity) and a much lower level of self-insurance at the
subsidiary level. Catastrophe insurance is then purchased
in the commercial market over and above this level of 
self-insured retention. Ipsley’s current participation in
GKN’s insurance programme is £10 million per incident
capped at £20 million in any one year.

The GKN Way
Business Review
Living the Values
GKN is a group of over 42,000 people from many different
locations around the world, with diverse backgrounds and
differing experience. The GKN Way brings them all together
with a common global approach to the way we sustain and
develop our business. It encompasses a culture of
continuous improvement, development of all our people to
raise their capability, a focus on technology, the use of
common measures and, at its heart, the GKN Values. 
The Values govern our relationships with all our
stakeholders whether they are shareholders, employees,
customers, suppliers or the communities in which we
operate. They are underpinned by the GKN Code which,
together with a series of underlying policies, provides a
framework for the behaviour of all our employees
whatever their job and wherever they are located. 
Conducting our business with integrity
A fundamental tenet of the Code is that all business must
be conducted with respect for human dignity and rights
and in accordance with all applicable legal requirements.
Our ethical standards policy requires all employees to
maintain the highest standards of integrity, honesty and
fair dealing. We support the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights and do not tolerate the use of child labour
or forced labour in our own operations and, through our
supplier management policy, we require equivalent
standards through our supply chain. We will continue to
reinforce our reputation through high standards of
conduct in order to underpin shareholder value. 
Safeguarding shareholders’ interests
We describe in the corporate governance statement, on
pages 52 to 55, the governance and control procedures
we have adopted to ensure that strong stewardship of the
Group contributes to the sustainability of our business.
The Governance and Risk Sub-Committee of the Board
plays a central role in this with responsibility for
developing strategy and for providing oversight and
direction on all matters relating to governance, risk
management and corporate social responsibility. As 
part of our internal control procedures, Group companies
are required to confirm compliance with the GKN Code
and policies. 
A summary of those risks which could have a material
impact on the future performance of the Group is given on
pages 37 to 39. All Group companies must have a
business continuity plan so that, should a risk materialise
which threatens GKN assets, employees, production or
the environment in which we operate, we are in a position
to minimise disruption of our business with the least
inconvenience to our customers. Each plan must conform
to Group guidelines and be prepared following
consultation with all key internal and external
stakeholders.
A continuous improvement culture
At the very core of how we operate in GKN is a culture of
continuous improvement in all that we do. In our business
and production processes we are applying on a global
basis the techniques of Lean Enterprise to identify the
value stream for each product and process and ensure
that it flows without interruption. The use of common
At the very core of how we operate in GKN

continued
measures across the Group enables us to benchmark
performance against defined goals and against world
class standards. 
GKN’s Enterprise Excellence team, newly formed in 2007,
has responsibility for driving the focus on Lean Enterprise.
To date, we have trained 250 continuous improvement
leaders from our global operations to coach and facilitate
employees on how to improve their daily working
processes on the shop floor and in the offices. During
2007, over 1,000 leaders from around the world took part
in a programme on the leadership skills required to
encourage the further application of the principles of
Lean. In 2008 a further training programme is being
launched to provide managers with the necessary skills to
drive further improvement into the businesses and deliver
more value through improved productivity and cash
generation.
Going forward, all sites are required to develop an annual
continuous improvement plan which will engage every
employee in driving more value through increased process
efficiency and the elimination of all forms of waste
including unnecessary cost and time. Each plan will be
aligned to a site’s business objectives and set out its
continuous improvement actions. 
Central to the whole philosophy of Lean are GKN’s 
people, without whose engagement such progress would
not be possible. 
Raising the capability of our people
Within GKN we have high expectations of our people.
GKN’s leaders are tasked with growing the global
businesses in an environment which is highly competitive
and typified by complex supply chains and continually
developing technologies. This requires us to harness the
talents of all our employees and enable everyone to
contribute to their full potential.  Our objective is to create
an environment in which highly skilled and motivated
people can achieve the exacting standards demanded in
our business, can develop their careers and provide GKN
with a sustainable competitive advantage.
GKN’s Enterprise Excellence team is focused on raising the
capability of our people. Three global centres of
excellence have been created covering reward, HR
business processes and organisational capability, and a
further one is planned with the specific remit to further
improve employee engagement. These centres of
excellence provide a heightened focus for the
identification of areas for improvement and the
implementation of actions globally to address them. 
Central to our learning and development activities is the
performance development process (PDP) through which
individual objectives are aligned with business objectives,
responsibilities are clarified and competencies are
assessed. Individual development plans focus on enabling
employees to realise their full potential in their current
role whilst at the same time preparing them for the next
step in their career plan. In relation to production staff
there is a parallel process based upon the identification of
development needs by reference to appropriate skills
matrices. 
Considerable work has been undertaken to enhance our
senior leadership development programmes with the
result that, over the first four months of 2008, the 60 most
senior executives within the Group will attend a
programme focused around the next stage of the Group’s
development. The principal theme of the programme is
how we will grow and sustain the business by creating,
capturing and delivering value. 
Our Organisation and Management Development Review
(OMDR) process was also improved during 2007 with a
more extensive analysis of resource and capability to
determine the extent to which the organisation is
equipped to deliver its strategic objectives. The results,
including those relating to career progression and
succession coverage, are reviewed annually by the Board
and improvement targets are agreed.
GKN has a strong track record of recruiting high 
calibre graduate engineers with the aim of developing
their skills as international managers of the future.
Recently we developed separate graduate programmes in
China and India, key growth markets for GKN. The 
Group also continues to operate apprenticeship schemes
across the Group and a programme of employee
international assignments.
Engaging more fully with our employees
The extent to which our employees are engaged in the
business is an important indicator of our ability to deliver
on our business strategy. Whilst all divisions are required
to carry out employee surveys every two years, during
2008 a standard form of employee survey will be launched
across the Group which will focus on measuring levels of
employee engagement. 
Effective two-way communication is at the heart of
employee engagement and within GKN we have a variety
of mechanisms at all levels of the organisation to support
this, including daily team meetings, presentations,
intranets and newsletters. Consultation mechanisms exist
Our objective is to create an environment in which
highly skilled and motivated people can achieve
the exacting standards demanded in our business,
can develop their careers and provide GKN with a
sustainable competitive advantage.

Under our employment policy all Group businesses must
adopt practices which ensure that employees are treated
justly and with respect and that their abilities, differences
and achievements are recognised, thereby ensuring a
positive, inclusive working environment. Employment
decisions must be based on qualifications and merit and
all businesses must ensure a working environment free
from all forms of discrimination and from any form of
conduct which could be considered to be harassing,
coercive or disruptive, together with working conditions
which are safe and healthy. 
Employee-related policies are designed to encourage
individuals to report and discuss problems on a
confidential basis and provide expeditious and
confidential grievance procedures. GKN operates
international whistleblowing hotlines which are run by
external and independent third parties and are available
24 hours a day. The hotlines ensure that employees can
make (on an anonymous basis if preferred) confidential
disclosures about suspected impropriety and wrongdoing.
The policy requires that employees are able to make such
disclosures without fear of recrimination. Any matters
reported are investigated and escalated to the Audit
Committee as appropriate.

Our Group Excellence Awards are designed to 
encourage individuals and teams to excel in all of the key
areas which are recognised as essential to the strategic

nurture the principle of continuous improvement in
everything we do and recognise truly outstanding
performance across our business. 
Delivering advanced technology
Delivering advanced technology and first class
engineering capability to our customers is a key strategic
objective. During the year we strengthened our
technology focus through the newly created Enterprise
Excellence team which has assumed responsibility for
developing the Group’s technology strategy. At the start of
2008 a new position of Group Technology Officer was
created with responsibility for executing the Group
technology plan to secure the appropriate technology for
GKN’s long term development in line with our strategic
objectives. The Group Technology Officer works closely
with the Technology Sub-Committee, which comprises
senior divisional engineering executives, to identify those
technologies, beyond the individual divisional technology
plans, that are necessary for growth and to focus resource
on developing GKN’s position in these areas.
Working with our suppliers
Our suppliers play an integral part in the sustainability of
our business and it is essential that they conduct their
business in a manner that supports our commitment to
world class performance. Our supplier management policy
encourages Group companies to develop and maintain value
adding relationships with our supply base. It prohibits
companies from engaging suppliers that offer inadequate
health and safety standards for employees, infringe
internationally accepted standards of workers’ rights, use
child or forced labour, adopt unsound environmental
practices, have poor standards of social responsibility or
that fail to comply with relevant laws and regulations. 
Providing a safe place to work
Ensuring that our employees have a safe and healthy
place in which to work will always be a priority for GKN. In
pursuit of our ultimate goal of zero preventable accidents
we focus on strong, visible and supportive leadership
accompanied by a commitment from employees to take
ownership of their own health and safety and that of their
immediate colleagues. To strengthen our safety culture,
during 2007 we deployed an assessment tool containing
12 characteristics of safety excellence which is now being
used across the Group to guide sustainable
improvements. We also developed and piloted ‘RADAR’
(Risk Awareness, Detection, Action and Review), a safety
tool which operates at work team level so that employees
can play a more active role in accident prevention. This is
being launched Group-wide in 2008.

Accident frequency rate (AFR) and accident severity rate
(ASR) are key performance indicators for the Group and our
performance against these in 2007 is reported on page 11
and is shown in the charts on page 43. 2007 is the tenth
consecutive year of performance improvement. Over that
period our AFR and ASR performance has improved by 91%
and 82% respectively and our serious injury rate (SIR) has
improved by 87%. Each business is required to target
aggressive annual performance improvements. T argets are
set primarily at plant level where they can best reflect the
particular needs, risks, and priorities of each site. In 2007,
73% of plants maintained or improved their excellent AFR
performance and 67% met their AFR targets. For ASR,
performance was maintained or improved by 70% of plants,
and 60% met their targets. 
During 2007, five health and safety enforcement actions
(none of which carried a penalty) occurred in plants in
Canada and the UK. There were no fatalities of employees
or contractors on GKN sites.
Group businesses are required to confirm and certify the
accuracy of the data that they report. A programme of
safety review visits by senior executives and the Group
Safety Adviser also assists with data verification and
enables continuous improvement of safety systems and
performance. Many GKN businesses now incorporate in
their operational procedures features from the Health and
Safety Management System OHSAS 18001 and 30 Group
companies have achieved certification to this standard.
Minimising our impact on the environment
Our commitment to protecting the environment is focused
both on minimising the impact of our operations and on
making a contribution towards a sustainable future
through the design of our products.
GKN’s environmental management system (EMS),
originally introduced in 1994, and to which all Group
businesses must adhere, is broadly based on the
international standard ISO 14001. At its core is a
requirement for continuous improvement driven by
regular measurement and evaluation of performance,
identification and implementation of action plans, and
measurement of results.

Reporting on performance
Our performance against the key health and safety and
environmental indicators is measured on a regular basis and
reports are made quarterly to the Sub-Committee on
Governance and Risk and to the Executive Committee. A half
yearly report is also made to the Board. Significant health
and safety and environmental incidents are reported to
Executive Committee members within 24 hours and
reviewed at the Committee’s next meeting.
In early 2008 a new web-based reporting tool was launched
Group-wide to facilitate both the collection of data and,
more importantly, its analysis and use by management at all
levels to help drive improved performance. 
A specialists forum, comprising divisional and corporate
centre representatives, meets as required to discuss best
practice as well as specific issues in relation to the
management of accidental risk that either its members or
the Sub-Committee on Governance and Risk believe 
require attention.

Business Review
GKN Mission Everest has drawn employees closer
together and it has set a record for human
achievement. But above all else it has transformed
the lives of some of the world’s poorest children.
www.gkn.com
We measure the impact of our operations on the
environment against the key performance indicators of
energy consumption and associated carbon dioxide (CO
2
)
emissions, water usage, waste generation and recycled
waste. Operating sites are required to set targets,
particularly on energy consumption, water use and 
waste generation, in line with our commitment to
continuous improvement. 
Our performance against these measures in 2007 is
reported on page 11 and is shown in the charts above.
Most businesses either improved or maintained their
performance with certain exceptions. The sharp increase
in waste generation at Hoeganaes is accounted for by the
removal of a slag stockpile at its Gallatin plant in the US
(classified as waste), the ferrous content of which was
separated for on-site recycling with the non-ferrous
content being recycled for off-site construction purposes.
The relatively high water consumption at OffHighway is
due to the use of water from a borehole at our major
manufacturing site in Lohmar, West Germany. This is used
in a once through cooling process and is discharged
without contamination into surface water.  The
performance of Other Automotive includes the first full
year of production at the cylinder liner operation in China. 
During the year there were six environmental enforcement
actions against GKN companies, all of which were in the
US. The majority of these actions were due to minor
breaches of permit requirements which did not result in
any significant environmental damage. Fines totalling
$33,000 have been issued by the relevant authorities
although the penalty with regard to one of the actions
remains under negotiation.
We are committed to achieving accreditation to ISO 14001
at all our manufacturing sites worldwide. Over 100 of our
sites employing some 85% of our global workforce are
now certified to ISO 14001. A number of recently acquired
sites will be working towards accreditation. 
As a founder member of the UK Emissions Trading
Scheme, GKN committed to reducing carbon emissions by
10,000 tonnes by 2007 from a 1998 to 2000 average
baseline. Not only did we meet our obligations under the
Scheme for each of the five years but we achieved a
reduction of over 50,000 tonnes in total. The incentive
payments were used to support energy saving projects in
the UK. 
A common theme across our businesses is the drive
through technology developments to produce lighter
weight products, offering opportunities for manufacturers
of cars and light vehicles and of aircraft to improve fuel
economy and thereby reduce CO
2
emissions. GKN
Driveline’s countertrack™ technology for sideshafts is
estimated to reduce fuel consumption by 1% on a typical
four wheel drive V6 vehicle, saving 1g/km of CO
2
emissions. If applied to every vehicle on which GKN
sideshafts are fitted this would save 0.5 million tonnes of
CO
2
per annum. The increasing use of composite and
lightweight complex metallics on airframe structures
offers similar potential benefits. GKN Aerospace’s recently
designed blended winglet made from composite material
is estimated to provide up to 6% fuel savings on a high
utilisation global aircraft such as the B767-300 ER.
Aviation Partners Boeing, our customer for the product,
estimates that by 2010 blended winglets will have saved
the world’s airlines over two billion US gallons of fuel
which equates to 20 million tons of CO
2
emissions.
Contributing to our communities
2007 has been a very significant year for GKN with regard
to our commitment to make a positive contribution to the
communities in which we operate. Our achievements are
described on pages 46 and 47. We are immensely proud
of our employees who not only rose to the challenge of
raising an additional $0.5 million in their local
communities but far exceeded this target, raising in total
(in cash and time donations) an additional $1.7 million.
We look forward to another successful year in 2008.

GKN Mission Everest
AN INSPIRING YEAR 
OF ADVENTURE
On 14 May 2007, a team sponsored and supported
by GKN became the first to fly a powered paraglider
above the Himalayas, higher than Mount Everest
itself. This record breaking flight, piloted by Bear
Grylls, was more than just an incredible
achievement, it was the focal point and inspiration
for a year of extraordinary endeavour by GKN
employees around the world.
The Challenge
GKN Mission Everest challenged GKN employees to
do more for their communities by raising an
additional $500,000 in money and time donations.
GKN promised to recognise their local efforts by
helping children in Africa. During the year
employees far exceeded this target contributing an
extra $1.7 million to their communities in the
Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. This was in
addition to their usual, long-standing projects to
support people in need and the local infrastructure
on which they depend.
The African dimension
Meanwhile, in recognition of our employees’
achievements, GKN, working with international
charity Global Angels, identified five children’s
charities in Africa and contributed $500,000 to
provide dormitories, school buildings, fresh water
supplies and protection against malaria and other
diseases. We will provide a further $500,000 to
children’s projects in Africa during 2008.
The Chevron Quest
To support the GKN Mission Everest project, GKN
also launched what became known as the Chevron
Quest. This was a unique project that saw a gold
GKN Chevron visit plants all round the world to
provide further stimulus for employees to engage
with their communities on a huge scale.  The
Chevron set off from the Group’s annual European
Forum in Paris in April and during the next seven
months it visited 47 GKN facilities in 23 countries
travelling a total distance of 148,740 miles — the
equivalent of six circumnavigations of the world.
From China to the US and from India to the UK,
employees rose to the challenge, demonstrating
both individual humanity and collective
commitment to their communities.
Contributing to our communities
The many stories which demonstrate the
compassion shown by our employees are too
numerous to describe in this report but a few
representative examples are given below. Others
are featured on our website
www.gknmissioneverest.com.
At our Driveline plants in India the entire workforce
donated their earnings for one day to three local
projects — to educate children of workers at a
nearby brick kiln, to provide facilities for children
with disabilities, and to help women learn new
skills from which to earn a living. GKN Driveline
employees at the Celaya plant in Mexico provided
help and support for a local retirement home, made
donations of toys to a home for handicapped
children and distributed clothes and blankets to
the poor during the Mexican winter.  Annual Report 2007 GKN plc 47
In Germany, GKN employees from Offenbach saved
a children’s playground from closure and also
completely refurbished it. In the US, GKN
Aerospace employees engaged in a similar 
project to upgrade an important public park in a
city neighbourhood for African Americans.
Hoeganaes employees played a part in the
reconstruction of housing in New Orleans
devastated by Hurricane Katrina. 
Employees at our Wheels plant in Liuzhou, China,
have taken to their hearts children at a local special
needs school where they provide practical support,
and Sinter employees in South Africa have
provided financial and practical help to a children’s
home called Molly’s Place. In Australia our
Aerospace team established GKN’s Rural
Connection to provide relief to communities
affected by drought, bushfires, floods and other
agricultural issues. 
Trekking to base camp
Behind all these efforts lay the inspiration of GKN’s
adventures in the Himalayas — not only the record
breaking flight but also the GKN Trek. This saw a
team of 20 employees come together to trek up to
the GKN Mission Everest base camp — at a
breathtaking altitude of 4,252 metres. Drawn from
all round the world, the trek team played a major
role in the flight preparations and embodied the
sense of individual and collective endeavour that
has characterised all aspects of GKN Mission
Everest. 
The team drew its members from the entire
spectrum of the global GKN team. Several team
members had won their place by entering a global
competition and others had decided to pay their
own way to be part of the adventure. During the
trek the team were moved by the plight of an
orphanage for girls in Nepal and succeeded in
donating funds to complete its refurbishment.
Living the Values
GKN Mission Everest has proved to be an
inspirational global success. It has brought the
Group closer to the communities around the world
in which it operates, it has drawn employees closer
together and it has set a record for human
achievement.  But above all else it has transformed
the lives of some of the world’s poorest children. It
has also given eloquent expression to GKN’s Values
which embody the power of team work and the
obligation which companies have to contribute to
the wider society of which they are a part.
Inspired by the achievements of GKN Mission
Everest, the Group is launching a successor project
in 2008 — GKN Hearts of Gold — to encourage and
sustain a continuing high level of engagement by
GKN people with their local communities and
society at large.

Share capital
The authorised share capital of the Company as at 31 December 2007
was £450 million divided into 900 million ordinary shares each with a
nominal value of 50p. At the end of 2007, 743,699,431 fully paid ordinary
shares were in issue, including 38,659,142 ordinary shares (5.2% of the
issued share capital) held in treasury and 2,186,244 ordinary shares
issued during the year in connection with the exercise of options under
the Company’s share option schemes. Each share (other than the treasury
shares which have no voting rights) carries the right to one vote on a poll
at a general meeting of the Company.
The ordinary shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange. In addition,
GKN has a sponsored Level 1 American Depository Receipt (ADR)
programme for which the Bank of New York Mellon acts as Depositary.
The ADRs trade on the US over-the-counter market where each ADR
represents one GKN ordinary share.
At the Annual General Meeting in May 2007, the Company was authorised
to purchase up to 70,285,404 of its own ordinary shares, representing
slightly less than 10% of the issued share capital of the Company
(excluding treasury shares) at 31 December 2006. No shares were
purchased under this authority during 2007.
The rights and obligations attaching to the Company’s shares are
contained in the articles of association, a copy of which can be viewed on
GKN’s website or can be obtained by writing to the Company Secretary.
The articles can only be changed by special resolution of the
shareholders.
There are no restrictions on transfer or limitations on the holding of the
Company’s ordinary shares and no requirements for prior approval of any
transfers. Under the Company’s articles, the Directors have power to
suspend voting rights and the right to receive dividends in respect of
shares in circumstances where the holder of those shares fails to comply
with a notice issued under section 793 of the Companies Act 2006.
Change of control
The Company’s subsidiary, GKN Holdings plc, entered into separate
agreements on 27 July 2005 with the following banks each in respect of a
bi-lateral banking facility in an amount of £35 million: Barclays Bank plc,
BNP Paribas, Calyon, Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, Citibank N.A.,
Deutsche Bank A.G., HSBC Bank plc, ING Bank N.V., The Royal Bank of
Scotland and Wachovia Bank National Association. Each agreement
provides that, on a change of control of the Company, the bank can give
notice to GKN Holdings plc to repay all outstanding amounts under the
relevant facility.
All of the Company’s share schemes contain provisions relating to a
change of control. Outstanding options and awards normally vest and
become exercisable on a change of control subject to the satisfaction of
any performance conditions at that time.
As referred to in the Directors’ remuneration report on page 61, the
executive Directors’ service agreements provide for payment of a
predetermined amount equivalent to one year’s salary and benefits on
termination by the Company of a Director’s service agreement on less
than due notice within 12 months of a change of control of GKN plc.

Directors’ Report
The Board of Directors, which is responsible for the management of the
business, may exercise all the powers of the Company subject to the
provisions of relevant legislation and the Company’s memorandum and
articles of association. The powers of the Directors set out in the articles
include those in relation to the issue and buyback of shares.
Sir Ian Gibson retired as a Director of the Company on 31 December 2007.
He had been a non-executive Director of the Company since 2002 and
was appointed Senior Independent Director in January 2006. The
Directors would like to record their appreciation of the significant
contribution Sir Ian has made to the Group during this time.
In accordance with the provisions for retirement by rotation in the
Company’s articles of association, Nigel Stein, John Sheldrick and Sir
Peter Williams retire at the AGM and, being eligible, offer themselves for
re-election. As Directors appointed during the year, Marcus Bryson,
Andrew Reynolds Smith and Bill Seeger retire at the forthcoming AGM
and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election. Richard Parry-Jones,
appointed with effect from 1 March 2008, also retires at the AGM and
offers himself for re-election (further details can be found in the AGM
circular). In addition, in order to comply with the provisions of the
Combined Code, Roy Brown, Chairman, being a non-executive Director
who has served on the Board for more than nine years, also retires at the
AGM and, being eligible, offers himself for re-election.
Directors’ interests in GKN shares are shown on pages 64 to 68.
Pursuant to the articles of association, the Company has executed a deed
poll of indemnity for the benefit of the Directors of the Company and
persons who were Directors of the Company in respect of costs of
defending claims against them and third party liabilities. These provisions
remain in force. The indemnity provision in the Company’s articles of
association also extends to provide a limited indemnity in respect of
liabilities incurred as a director, secretary or officer of an associated
company of the Company.
A copy of the deed poll of indemnity and of the Company’s articles of
association are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office
during normal business hours and will be available for inspection at the
Company’s AGM.
The circular containing the notice of meeting sets out details of the
amendments to the articles of association which will be proposed at the
AGM (and where the full text of those amendments can be inspected).
Donations
Contributions to good causes made by Group companies around the
world, other than those in connection with GKN Mission Everest,
amounted to some £581,500 in 2007. This included cash donations to UK
registered charities of £144,500 for educational purposes and £22,300
for community activities. In addition, as part of its commitment to GKN
Mission Everest, the Company donated $500,000 to charities in Africa.
Further details of this and other community activities are given on pages
46 and 47 and on GKN’s website.
It is the policy of the Group not to make political donations. During 2007,
no donations were made to EU political organisations, no EU political
expenditure was incurred and no contributions to political parties outside
the EU were made within the meaning of section 364 of the Companies
Act 2006.
The Group’s US Aerospace business has a Political Action Committee
(PAC) which is funded entirely by employees and their spouses. No funds
are provided to the PAC by GKN and any administrative services provided
to the PAC by the US Aerospace business are fully charged to and paid for
by the PAC, and the Company does not therefore consider these to be
political donations. Employee contributions are entirely voluntary and no
pressure is placed on employees to participate. Under US law, an
employee-funded PAC must bear the name of the employing company.
Payments to suppliers
It is Group policy to abide by the payment terms agreed with suppliers,
provided that the supplier has performed its obligations under the
contract. Given the nature and diversity of the Group’s international
purchasing arrangements and contracts, it is not Group policy to follow
any specific code or standard in relation to payment practice.
GKN plc, as a holding company, did not have any amounts owing to trade
creditors at 31 December 2007.
Corporate governance
The Board’s statement on corporate governance is given on pages 52 to
55 and the Directors’ remuneration report is set out on pages 57 to 68.
Directors’ responsibility for the accounts
At the end of each financial year the Directors are required by the
Companies Act 1985 to prepare accounts which give a true and fair view of
the state of affairs of the Company and of the Group and of the profit or loss
of the Group for that year. In preparing the accounts for the year ended
31 December 2007, appropriate accounting policies, supported by
reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates, have been used
consistently. The Group accounts have been prepared on the basis of
applicable International Financial Reporting Standards effective and
endorsed by the European Union as at 31 December 2007 and the
Company accounts have been prepared in accordance with UK applicable
accounting standards. The Directors are responsible for ensuring that the
Company and the Group keep proper accounting records which disclose
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company
and the Group and which enable them to ensure that the accounts comply
with applicable company law. In addition, the Directors are responsible for
ensuring that an appropriate system of internal control is in operation to
provide them with reasonable assurance that the assets of the Company
and the Group are properly safeguarded and to ensure that reasonable
steps are taken to prevent or detect fraud and other irregularities.
Auditors
Resolutions to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors of the
Company and to authorise the Directors to determine their remuneration
will be proposed at the AGM.
Audit information
Each of the Directors who held office at the date of approval of this
Directors’ report confirms that, so far as he is aware, there is no relevant
audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware. Each
Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a Director
in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to
establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.

Corporate Governance
In accordance with the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority,
GKN is required to state whether it has complied with the relevant
provisions set out in Section 1 of the 2006 Combined Code on Corporate
Governance (the Code) and, where the provisions have not been complied
with, to provide an explanation. GKN is also required to explain how it has
applied the principles set out in the Code.
The following paragraphs, together with the Audit Committee report on
page 56 and the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 57 to 68,
provide a description of how the main and supporting principles of the
Code have been applied within GKN during 2007. The Directors’
statement of compliance with the Code is given on page 55.
The Board of Directors
The Board is collectively responsible for the success of the Company. Its
role is to provide entrepreneurial leadership of the Company within a
framework of prudent and effective controls which enables risk to be
assessed and managed. The Board sets the Company’s strategic aims,
ensures that the necessary financial and human resources are in place for
the Company to meet its objectives, and reviews management
performance. It also sets the Company’s values and standards and
ensures that its obligations to its shareholders (including reporting to
shareholders on the Board’s stewardship) and others are understood and
met. Specific responsibilities reserved to the Board include:
 setting Group strategy and approving an annual budget and medium
term projections;
 reviewing operational and financial performance;
 approving major acquisitions, divestments and capital expenditure;
 reviewing the Group’s systems of financial control and risk
management;
 ensuring that appropriate management development and succession
plans are in place;
 reviewing the activities of the three sub-committees of the Executive
Committee;
 reviewing matters relating to corporate social responsibility, including
the environmental, health and safety performance of the Group;
 approving appointments to the Board, to the Executive Committee and
to the position of Company Secretary, and approving policies relating
to Directors’ remuneration and the severance of Directors’ contracts;
and
 ensuring that a satisfactory dialogue takes place with shareholders.
The Directors’ responsibility for the preparation of accounts is explained
on page 51 (their confirmation that they consider it appropriate to
prepare the accounts for 2007 on a going concern basis is given on
page 37).
A description of the role of the Board, together with that of the Chairman,
Chief Executive, Senior Independent Director and Company Secretary, is
available on GKN’s website and further details of the Board’s role in
relation to the Group’s systems of internal control and risk management
are given on pages 54 and 55. Descriptions of the specific responsibilities
which have been delegated to the principal Board Committees are given
on page 54.
The Board currently comprises five executive and five non-executive
Directors including the Chairman. Biographical details of the Directors are
given on pages 48 and 49. With the exception of the Chairman, who is
presumed under the Code not to be independent, all the non-executive
Directors are regarded by the Board as independent and the Board does
not consider that there exist any relationships or circumstances likely to
affect the judgement of any Director. The terms and conditions of
appointment of the non-executive Directors are available for inspection
at the Company’s registered office and at the AGM.
As referred to in the Directors’ report, Richard Parry-Jones has been
appointed as an additional non-executive Director with effect from
1 March 2008. His biographical details are given in the AGM circular.
From 1 March 2008, Richard Parry-Jones will be a member of the
Chairman’s Committee, Audit Committee, Remuneration Committee and
Nominations Committee.
The Board normally meets 11 times a year, including at least one meeting
at a Group operating company. A 12 month rolling programme of items for
discussion by the Board is prepared to ensure that all matters reserved to
the Board and other key issues are considered at appropriate times.
During the year there are sufficient opportunities for the Chairman to
meet with the non-executive Directors without the executive Directors
being present should this be deemed appropriate.
The Company maintains appropriate insurance cover in respect of legal
proceedings and other claims against its Directors. Details of indemnities
in place between the Company and the Directors can be found in the
Directors’ report on page 51.
Chairman and Chief Executive
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive have been split since 1997.
Whilst collectively they are responsible for the leadership of the
Company, the Chairman’s primary responsibility is for leading the Board
and ensuring its effectiveness and the Chief Executive is responsible for
running the Company’s business.
The other significant current commitments of the Chairman, Roy Brown,
are listed in his biography on page 48. The Board is satisfied that his
commitments do not unduly restrict his availability to GKN and, in
particular, would not do so in the event of GKN being involved in a major
corporate transaction or other action.
Information and professional development
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that Directors receive accurate,
timely and clear information. The supply of information provided to the
Board was reviewed during the year as part of the performance
evaluation exercise referred to below.
Comprehensive briefing papers are prepared and circulated to all
Directors one week prior to scheduled Board meetings. Directors are
continually updated on the Group’s businesses, the markets in which it
operates and changes to the competitive and regulatory environment
through briefings to the Board and meetings with senior executives. The
Chairman arranges for the Board to visit at least one of the Group’s
business locations each year to enable the Directors to meet with local
management and employees and to update and maintain their knowledge
and familiarity with the Group’s operations. Annual Report 2007 GKN plc 53
Corporate Governance
On joining the Board, a Director receives a comprehensive induction
pack which includes background information about GKN and its Directors,
and details of Board meeting procedures, Directors’ duties and
responsibilities, procedures for dealing in GKN shares and a number of
other governance-related issues. This is supplemented by a briefing with
the Company Secretary who is charged with facilitating the induction
of new Directors both into the Group and as to their roles and
responsibilities as Directors. The Director meets with the Chief Executive
and with relevant senior executives to be briefed on the general Group
strategy and each individual business portfolio. Plant visits are organised
as necessary for new Directors. External training, particularly on matters
relating to the role of a Director and the role and responsibilities of Board
Committees, is arranged as appropriate.
Ongoing training is provided as and when necessary and may be
identified in annual individual performance reviews or on an ad hoc basis.
The suitability of external courses is kept under review by the Company
Secretary. Training and development of Directors in 2007 took various
forms and included visits to GKN plants (both with the Board as a whole
and on an individual basis).
All Directors have direct access to the advice and services of the Company
Secretary who is tasked with ensuring that the Board is fully briefed on all
legislative, regulatory and corporate governance developments. In
addition, Directors may, in the furtherance of their duties, take
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense.
Performance evaluation
During the year, the Board carried out a formal evaluation of its own
performance and that of its Committees. The process involved each
Director, as well as other attendees of Board Committee meetings,
completing a detailed questionnaire covering issues such as Board remit
and objectives; composition, training and resources; corporate
governance; stakeholder engagement; Board meetings, visits, procedures
and administration; Committee terms of reference and other specific
Committee-related questions. The results of the evaluation and
recommendations for improvements were reported to the relevant
Committees before the Board as a whole agreed appropriate changes.
These were minor and included changes in the scheduling of certain
items to be considered by the Board and the nature of information to be
circulated prior to Board meetings. It was also agreed to review the
quanta of delegated authorities.
The individual performance of the Directors was also evaluated at one-to-
one interviews with the Chairman. To assist this process, a number of
assessment areas were identified in advance and used as a framework for
conducting the appraisal interviews. In the case of John Sheldrick and Sir
Peter Williams, who completed their initial and second three year terms
respectively as non-executive Directors during the year, their evaluations
provide the basis for the recommendation to shareholders set out in the
notice of meeting circular that they be re-elected at the forthcoming AGM.
Sir Ian Gibson, as Senior Independent Director, led the review by the non-
executive Directors of the Chairman’s performance, which took into
account the views of the executive Directors. Similarly, the views of the
other Directors were taken into account by the Chairman in his review of
the Chief Executive’s performance. No actions were considered necessary
as a result of any of these evaluations.
Re-election of Directors
The Company’s articles of association require Directors to seek re-
election by shareholders at least once every three years. In addition, all
Directors are subject to re-election by shareholders at the first AGM
following their appointment by the Board. Any non-executive Directors
who have served for more than nine years are subject to annual re-
election. Details of the Directors retiring and seeking re-election at the
2008 AGM are given in the notice of meeting circular.
Relations with shareholders
GKN is committed to ongoing engagement with shareholders and has a
well established communication programme based on the Group’s
financial reporting calendar. This programme enables the Directors to
gain an understanding of the views and opinions of its shareholders. In its
communications with shareholders, GKN aims to present a balanced and
understandable assessment of the Group.
Communication with major institutional shareholders is undertaken as
part of GKN’s investor relations programme, in which non-executive
Directors are encouraged to participate. This includes presentations of
the full year and interim results, and meetings between institutional
investors (both in the UK and overseas) and the Chief Executive, Finance
Director, Head of Investor Relations and other executive Directors.
Periodic meetings with representatives of major institutional
shareholders, other fund managers and the financial press are also held.
Feedback is sought by the Company’s brokers after meetings and
presentations to ensure that the Group’s strategy and performance is
being communicated effectively and to develop further an understanding
of shareholder views. This feedback is included in twice-yearly reports to
the Board on meetings with existing and potential investors which, during
2007, included the results of an investor audit of GKN conducted by an
external investor relations firm. In addition, external brokers’ reports on
GKN are circulated to all Directors.
The Chairman offers major shareholders the opportunity to meet with him
to discuss matters relating to governance and strategy. Feedback to the
Board is provided by the Chairman on any issues raised with him. The
Senior Independent Director is also available to discuss issues with
shareholders where concerns cannot be addressed through normal
channels of communication.
Shareholders who attend the AGM are invited to ask questions during the
meeting and to meet with Directors after the formal proceedings have
ended. Details of the level of proxy votes received are advised to
shareholders at the meeting and are published on GKN’s website.
Written responses are given to letters or email received from
shareholders and all shareholders receive, or can access electronically,
copies of the annual and interim reports. The investor relations section of
GKN’s website provides further detail about the Group, including share
price information, webcasts and presentations of annual and interim
results, other presentations made to the investment community, and
copies of financial reports. 54 GKN plc Annual Report 2007

under the chairmanship of the Chairman.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee ensures the integrity of financial reporting and audit
processes and the maintenance of a sound internal control and risk

the Board, and for monitoring the remuneration of senior managers just
below Board level. It also prepares for approval by the Board the annual
report on Directors’ remuneration (set out on pages 57 to 68).
The Committee has access to such information and advice both from
within the Group and externally, at the cost of the Company, as it deems

balance of skills, knowledge and experience and the independence of the
non-executive Directors, and makes recommendations to the Board with
regard to any changes.
The Board has agreed procedures that are followed by the Nominations
Committee in making appointments to the various positions on the Board
and as Company Secretary. These procedures, under which the
Committee agrees a description of the role, experience and capabilities
for a Director, are available on GKN’s website. The Committee has access

Internal control
The Board attaches considerable importance to, and acknowledges its
responsibility for, the Group’s systems of internal control and risk
management and receives regular reports on such matters. Annual Report 2007 GKN plc 55
Corporate Governance
The Board’s policy is to have systems in place which optimise the Group’s
ability to manage risk in an effective and appropriate manner. The Board
has delegated to the Executive Committee responsibility for identifying,
evaluating and monitoring the risks facing the Group and for deciding
how these are to be managed. In addition to a formal quarterly review of
risk management by the Executive Committee, members are expected to
report to the Committee as necessary the occurrence of any material
control issues, serious accidents or events that have had a major
commercial impact, or any significant new risks which have been
identified. Such matters are reported to the next Board meeting and/or
Audit Committee meeting as appropriate. As part of its remit, the
Governance and Risk Sub-Committee develops strategy for and provides
oversight and direction on all matters relating to risk management. It
reports formally on an annual basis to the Executive Committee and
to the Board.
Continuing processes under the oversight of the Executive Committee and
its Governance and Risk Sub-Committee are in place for all parts of the
Group to assess the major risks to which their operations are exposed
and the way in which such risks are monitored, managed and controlled.
The risks covered by these processes include those relating to strategy,
operational performance, finance (including risk financing and fraud),
product engineering, business reputation, human resources, health and
safety, and the environment. These processes are summarised in a ‘risk
map’ which is reviewed annually by the Audit Committee. A summary of
those risks which could have a material impact on the future performance
of the Group is given on pages 37 to 39.
Each year all Group businesses are required formally to review their
business risks and to report on whether there has been any material
breakdown in their internal controls. This formal review is supplemented
by an interim review conducted at the half year. Companies also have to
confirm annually whether they have complied with statutory and
regulatory obligations as well as with the policies which support the GKN
Code. Risk profiling is undertaken across all subsidiaries to identify
accidental risks and highlight action required to mitigate such risks.
As part of GKN’s enterprise risk management programme, a risk profiling
software tool has been developed and deployed across the Group. The
tool provides a consistent set of risk definitions, a common approach to
probability and impact, and strengthens the ability to consolidate
measurement of risk. The objective of the Group’s risk management
processes is to ensure the sustainable development of GKN through the
conduct of its business in a way which:
 satisfies its customers;
 develops environmentally friendly products and processes;
 provides a safe and healthy workplace;
 protects against losses from unforeseen causes;
 minimises the cost and consumption of increasingly scarce resources;
 prevents pollution and waste;
 maintains proper relationships with our suppliers and contractors; and
 maintains a positive relationship with the communities in which it
does business.
The Group’s systems and procedures are designed to identify, manage
and, where practicable, reduce and mitigate the effects of the risk of
failure to achieve business objectives. They are not designed to eliminate
such risk, recognising that any system can only provide reasonable and
not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The review process
The Board reviews the Group’s systems of internal control and risk
management on an ongoing basis by:
 setting the strategy of the business at both Group and divisional level
and, within the framework of this, approving an annual budget and
medium term projections. Central to this exercise is a review of the risks
and opportunities facing each business and the steps being taken to
manage these;
 reviewing on a regular basis operational performance and updated
forecasts for the current year. Comparisons are made with budget and
the prior year and appropriate action plans put in place to optimise
operational and financial performance;
 retaining primary responsibility for acquisition and divestment policy,
and the approval of major capital expenditure, major contracts and
financing arrangements. Below Board level there are clearly defined
management authorities for the approval of capital expenditure, major
contracts, acquisitions, investments and divestments, together with an
established framework for their appraisal, which includes a risk analysis
and post-implementation plan, and where appropriate, a post-
acquisition review;
 receiving regular reports on the Group’s treasury activities, having
approved the operating policies and controls for this function;
 performing at least annually a review of the Group’s pension fund
arrangements and insurance and risk management programmes;
 receiving an annual report, following its review by the Executive
Committee, on corporate social responsibility matters, which includes
the environmental, health and safety performance of the Group’s
operations; and
 reviewing an annual management development and succession plan.
The Executive Committee also reviews management development issues
at least annually.
The Board receives an annual report from the Audit Committee concerning
the operation of the systems of internal control and risk management. This
report, together with the reviews by the Board during the year of the
matters described above, enables the Board to form its own view on the
effectiveness of the systems.
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing the ongoing control
processes, and the actions undertaken by the Committee during 2007 to
discharge this responsibility are described in the Audit Committee’s report on
page 56. T o assist it in this role the Committee liaises closely with the internal
audit department which, using a risk-based audit programme, reviews and
tests the systems, controls, processes, procedures and practices across the
Group. The Head of Internal Audit, who reports directly to the Finance
Director, meets regularly with the Chairman of the Audit Committee, the
Group Chairman and the Chief Executive. The department’s reports are seen
by the relevant members of the Executive Committee. The resolution of any
control issues raised by Board members or in reports reviewed by the Audit
Committee are discussed in Committee with management.
The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s systems of internal
control and risk management during the period covered by this annual
report. It confirms that the processes described above, which accord with
the guidance on internal control appended to the Code (the revised Turnbull
Guidance), have been in place throughout that period and up to the date of
approval of the annual report. The Board also confirms that no significant
failings or weaknesses were identified in relation to the review.
Compliance with the Code
It is the Board’s view that, throughout 2007, GKN was in compliance with
the relevant provisions set out in Section 1 of the Code. 56 GKN plc Annual Report 2007
Audit Committee Report
Role of the Audit Committee
The primary role of the Audit Committee, which reports its findings to the
Board, is to ensure the integrity of the financial reporting and audit
processes and the maintenance of a sound internal control and risk
management system. In pursuing these objectives, the Committee ensures
that an appropriate relationship is maintained between GKN and the
external auditors, considers the effectiveness of the external audit process
and makes recommendations to the Board on the appointment of the
external auditors. It reviews the effectiveness of the internal audit function
and is responsible for approving the appointment of the head of that
function. The Committee reviews the Group’s systems of internal control and
the processes for monitoring and evaluating the risks facing the Group.
In the performance of its duties, the Committee has independent access to
the services of the internal audit function and to the external auditors, and
may obtain outside professional advice as necessary. Both the Head of
Internal Audit and the external auditors have direct access to the Chairman
of the Committee outside formal Committee meetings.
The Committee has written terms of reference that outline its authority and
responsibilities. These are considered annually by the Audit Committee and
any proposed changes are referred to the Board for approval. The
Committee’s current terms of reference are available on GKN’s website.
In order that the Board is kept fully appraised of the Committee’s work, the
Committee Chairman reports formally on its proceedings at the next
following meeting of the Board, and minutes of meetings of the Committee
are circulated to all members of the Board.
Membership
The Audit Committee consists entirely of independent non-executive
Directors and presently comprises John Sheldrick (Chairman), Helmut
Mamsch, Sir Christopher Meyer and Sir Peter Williams, all of whom served
on the Committee throughout 2007 together with Sir Ian Gibson. Their
biographical details are set out on pages 48 and 49. The Company Secretary
acts as secretary to the Committee.
As the Chairman of the Committee is the Group Finance Director of Johnson
Matthey plc, the Board remains satisfied that at least one member of the
Committee has recent and relevant financial experience as required by the
Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
Report on the Committee’s activities in 2007
Meetings and attendance
The Committee met on four occasions in 2007 timed to coincide with the
financial and reporting cycles of the Company. Members’ attendance at the
meetings held during the year is set out in the table on page 54.
The Group Chairman, Chief Executive, Finance Director, Head of Internal
Audit, the engagement partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) and
other members of the management team attended meetings by invitation. At
each meeting there was an opportunity for PwC, and annually an
opportunity for the Head of Internal Audit, to discuss matters with the
Committee without any executive management being present. In addition,
the members of the Committee met separately at the start of each meeting
to discuss matters in the absence of any persons attending by invitation.
Financial reporting
During 2007, the Committee reviewed a wide range of financial reporting
and related matters including the interim and annual financial statements,
other related annual report information, and results announcements prior to
their submission to the Board. The Committee focused in particular on key
accounting policies and practices adopted by the Group and any significant
areas of judgement that materially impacted reported results.
External auditors
The Audit Committee is responsible for the development, implementation
and monitoring of the Company’s policies on external audit. The policies,
which were reviewed by the Committee during the year, are designed to
maintain the objectivity and independence of the external auditors. Together
they regulate the appointment of former employees of the external audit
firm to positions in the Group and set out the approach to be taken when
using the external auditors for non-audit work. As a general principle the
external auditors are excluded from consultancy work and cannot be
engaged by GKN for other non-audit work unless there are compelling
reasons to do so. Any proposal to use the external auditors for non-audit
work must be submitted to the Finance Director (who will, depending on the
nature of the service, seek the prior authorisation of the Chairman of the
Audit Committee) for approval prior to their appointment.
In accordance with its remit, the Committee reviewed and approved PwC’s
plans for the audit of the Group’s 2007 financial statements. In approving the
terms of engagement for the audit, the Committee considered PwC’s
proposed audit fee. It also reviewed PwC’s audit of the 2006 annual report
and review of the 2007 interim report.
During the year, the Committee performed its annual review of the
effectiveness of the external auditors. This process was based primarily on a
format devised by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland and
conducted by means of formal interviews with a number of Directors and
senior management across the Group and the engagement partner of PwC.
The Committee also reviewed a formal letter provided by PwC confirming
their independence and objectivity within the context of applicable
regulatory requirements and professional standards and received
confirmation of compliance with the policy on the employment of former
employees of the external auditors.
Internal audit and monitoring of control issues
At its meetings during 2007 the Committee reviewed the results of the audits
undertaken by the internal audit function and considered the adequacy of
management’s response to the matters raised, including the implementation
of recommendations made by the function. It also reviewed and approved the
internal audit plan for the coming year and the level of resources allocated to
the internal audit function. The effectiveness of the internal audit function was
reviewed based primarily on guidelines issued by the Institute of Internal
Auditors. Feedback was obtained from a number of Directors and senior
management across the Group by means of formal interview.
The Committee reviewed regular reports on control issues of Group level
significance, including details of any remedial action being taken. It
considered reports from the internal audit function and PwC on the Group’s
systems of internal control and reported to the Board on the results of its
review. The Committee also examined reports detailing the Group’s actual or
anticipated material litigation, monitored compliance with the Group’s policy
for the appointment of agents and consultants (which is available on GKN’s
website), and reviewed the Directors’ and Company Secretary’s expenses.
Whistleblowing
To support the Group’s Employee Disclosure Procedures Policy (which is
available on GKN’s website), GKN operates international whistleblowing
hotlines. Run by external and independent third parties, the hotlines
facilitate the arrangements whereby employees can make (on an
anonymous basis if preferred) confidential disclosures about suspected
impropriety and wrongdoing. Any matters so reported are investigated and
escalated to the Audit Committee as appropriate. Statistics on the volume
and general nature of all disclosures made are reported to the Committee on
an annual basis.
Effectiveness
During the year the Committee undertook a formal review of its own
effectiveness. Further details on the process can be found on page 53.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Role of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for formulating the Group’s
policy for the remuneration of the executive Directors of GKN plc. The
Committee reviews the policy annually and recommends any changes to
the Board as a whole for formal approval.
Within the framework of the agreed policy, the Committee determines the
detailed terms of service of the executive Directors, including basic salary,
incentives and benefits, and the terms upon which their service may be
terminated. The Committee also determines the fees of the Chairman and
is responsible for recommending to the Chief Executive and monitoring
the level and structure of remuneration for the most senior managers
below Board level.
The Committee is responsible for appointing external independent
consultants to advise on executive remuneration matters. Following a
review in 2006 the Committee appointed New Bridge Street Consultants
(NBSC) as its advisers and they were retained throughout 2007. NBSC
provide advice on executive Directors’ remuneration. Since 2006 NBSC
have also provided advice to the Group on incentive arrangements for
senior executives below Board level. They also continued, during 2007, to
provide the total shareholder return monitoring service in connection with
the Group’s long term incentive plan and executive share option scheme
and a valuation of awards during the year under the Group’s incentive
schemes as required for share-based payment valuation purposes under
International Financial Reporting Standard 2, roles they have performed
for the Group since 2004. In appointing NBSC in 2006, and retaining them
in 2007, the Committee ensured there was adequate independence and
no conflict of interest between the advice it would be seeking and the
work performed elsewhere within the Group by employees of NBSC.
NBSC did not provide any other services direct to the Group during
the year.
The Committee also receives input from the Group’s Chief Executive when
considering the remuneration of other executive Directors.
The Committee consists entirely of independent non-executive Directors
and presently comprises Sir Peter Williams (Chairman since 1 January
2006), Helmut Mamsch, Sir Christopher Meyer and John Sheldrick, all of
whom served on the Committee throughout 2007 together with Sir Ian
Gibson. Their biographical details are set out on pages 48 and 49. The
Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.
The Committee met on nine occasions in 2007 to consider a range of
issues including proposals for and payments under the short term
variable remuneration scheme; the introduction of a new Profit Growth
Incentive Plan for senior executives below Board level in 2007 and the
proposed introduction in 2008 of a new earnings per share performance
measure in the long term incentive plan; a review of the awards to be
made under the Group’s long term incentive arrangements; the terms of
service and remuneration levels for new executive Director appointments;
the remuneration of the Chief Executive and the Company Secretary and
the fees payable to the Chairman; and a review of the remuneration of
senior executives immediately below Board level. Members’ attendance
at meetings of the Committee in 2007 is set out in the table on page 54.
The Committee has written terms of reference that outline its authority
and responsibilities; these are available upon request and on GKN’s
website. The terms, which are reviewed annually under the Board’s
performance evaluation procedures described on page 53, comply with
the best practice provisions of the Combined Code on Corporate
Governance. (The Board’s statement of overall compliance with the
Combined Code is given on page 55.)
Remuneration policy
This section describes GKN’s current policy for the remuneration of its
executive and non-executive Directors as at the date of this report and for
subsequent financial years.
GKN’s remuneration policy for executive Directors is designed to attract,
retain and motivate executives of the high calibre required to ensure that
the Group is managed successfully to the benefit of shareholders. To
achieve this, an internationally competitive package of incentives and
rewards linked to performance is provided.
In setting remuneration levels the Committee takes into consideration the
remuneration practices found in other multinational companies and also
ensures that the remuneration arrangements for executive Directors are
compatible with those for executives throughout the Group. It also
considers the most recent pay awards in the Group generally when
reviewing the basic salaries of the executive Directors.
The remuneration of the executive Directors comprises basic salary and
benefits in kind set at competitive levels, short term variable
remuneration dependent upon the achievement of performance targets,
and longer term rewards including retirement benefits and performance-
related long term incentives. Further details of each of these elements are
given in the following paragraphs. On the basis of the expected value of
long term incentives and achievement of on target performance for the
purposes of the short term variable remuneration scheme, the total
annual remuneration (excluding pension benefits) of each executive
Director under the Group’s remuneration policy is weighted approximately
64% performance-related and 36% non performance-related, valued as at
the time of award of long term incentives, with flexibility to change the
balance between the performance-related and non performance-related
elements if the Remuneration Committee considers it appropriate. The
Committee believes that these proportions represent an appropriate
balance between certainty of income and incentive-based remuneration
linked to the achievement of GKN’s operational and strategic objectives.
The remuneration policy for the Chairman and the other non-executive
Directors is for recompense by way of fees at levels commensurate with
those paid by other UK listed companies of comparable size and
complexity. Such fees may include additional awards in respect of the
chairmanship of Board Committees. The fees of the Chairman, as stated
above, are determined by the Remuneration Committee. The fees of the
other non-executive Directors, including any separate fees payable to the
chairmen of Board Committees, are determined by the Board following
recommendation from the Chairman and Chief Executive and are set at a
level that the Board believes will attract individuals with the necessary
experience and ability to make a substantial contribution to the
Group’s affairs.
Basic salary
This is based on a number of factors including market rates together with
the individual Director’s experience, responsibilities and performance.
The Remuneration Committee’s objective is to maintain salaries at around
the median level of the relevant employment market and it reviews
annually benchmark data provided to it by external consultants. The
Committee has reviewed the performance of the Directors and believes
payment of salaries in accordance with this policy to be entirely justified.
Individual salaries of Directors are reviewed annually by the Committee
with any increase usually being effective from 1 July. 58 GKN plc Annual Report 2007
Directors’ Remuneration Report
continued
Benefits
These comprise principally car and healthcare benefits. The level of
benefits provided to executive Directors is consistent with that provided
by other major companies. These benefits do not form part of
pensionable earnings.
In addition, under the terms of Bill Seeger’s service agreement, under
which he is required to relocate to the UK, he receives reimbursement
of temporary living costs and is entitled to reasonable relocation
expenses. Due to the complicated interaction between the UK and the US
tax regimes, tax and social security equalisation will be applied to
Mr Seeger’s remuneration. Additional taxes which arise in excess of the
monthly contribution deducted from Mr Seeger will be settled by the
Company in order to ensure Mr Seeger is not disadvantaged by his
global tax position.
Performance-related short term variable remuneration
Payments may be made annually under arrangements which link
remuneration to the achievement of short term operational targets
relevant to GKN’s long term strategic objectives. These targets will typically
relate to a combination of corporate and, where appropriate, individual
portfolio profit and cash flow performance and performance against
strategic plan. For 2008, there is an additional target relating to Lean
Enterprise deployment (except for the Chief Executive) and cash targets
will be set at quarterly intervals. Achievement of on target profit
performance and the achievement of all other objectives will result in
payments of approximately 78% of an executive Director’s salary and
payments are normally capped at around 110% of salary. This cap
represents a 10% increase in the proportions from years prior to 2007 and
has been implemented to align more closely the performance targets with
the Group’s strategic growth plan by increasing the percentage applicable
to achievement of the growth targets.
Details of the targets and cap for 2007 are given below in the section
‘Directors’ remuneration 2007’.
The Remuneration Committee has discretion to alter targets to reflect
changed circumstances such as material changes in accounting standards
or changes in the structure of the Group. It may also make discretionary
payments in respect of exceptional performance. Payments to Directors
are based upon a percentage of basic salary received during the year and
do not form part of pensionable earnings under Directors’ pension
arrangements.
Long term incentive arrangements
The Remuneration Committee believes that performance-related long
term incentives which closely align executive rewards with shareholders’
interests are an important component of overall executive remuneration
arrangements. In 2004 shareholders approved revisions to both elements
of GKN’s current long term incentive arrangements for executive Directors
and other senior executives — the GKN Long Term Incentive Plan and the
GKN Executive Share Option Scheme. The structure of the Company’s
performance-related long term incentives is considered annually as part
of the award process and proposals for revisions to the GKN Long Term
Incentive Plan and the GKN Executive Share Option Scheme are set out in
the AGM circular; the substantive differences from the current
arrangements are explained below.
Award levels under each of the GKN Long Term Incentive Plan and the GKN
Executive Share Option Scheme are set such that the combined rewards
available to an individual Director, assuming full vesting, are no greater than
they would have been had the Group’s long term incentive arrangements
comprised only a single element. The combined maximum potential annual
award under both elements of the long term incentive arrangements is
250% of basic salary, or such higher overall percentage which may be
applied where necessary specifically to recruit or retain an individual.
There are no provisions under the rules of either the GKN Long Term
Incentive Plan or the GKN Executive Share Option Scheme for the
automatic release of unvested awards on a change of control of GKN plc.
GKN Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
In summary, under the LTIP as it currently operates, each executive
Director may be awarded annually a conditional right to receive GKN plc
ordinary shares up to a maximum value of 150% of basic salary. The value
of shares for this purpose is calculated by reference to the average of the
daily closing prices of GKN plc ordinary shares during the preceding year.
LTIP awards to executive Directors in 2007 were made at a value of 100%
of basic salary.
The number of shares that the Director will ultimately receive will depend
on the Group’s performance during the three years commencing on
1 January in the year of award and on satisfaction of a personal
shareholding requirement (see pages 61 and 62).
Under the present arrangements, performance is measured by comparing
the total shareholder return (i.e. the internal rate of return from the cash
flows arising from buying, owning and selling a company’s shares), or
‘TSR’, from GKN shares with the return on shares of other companies
chosen by the Remuneration Committee as an appropriate comparator
group. The Committee considers relative TSR to be an appropriate
performance criterion as it represents the investment return received by
GKN’s shareholders over the measurement period compared with the
return investors could have received by investing in alternative stocks
over the same period. For awards made from 2004 onwards, the
comparator group comprises a tailored peer group representing GKN’s
major competitors and customers worldwide. (Where a comparator
company’s shares are listed on an overseas market, the TSR of that
company is calculated in local currency. The Committee believes this
method of measurement provides a true indication of a company’s
performance, without potential distortions brought about by windfall
movements in currency.)
Under the proposed revised arrangements, a new performance condition
is to be introduced in the LTIP , to replace the existing TSR based
performance condition, based on compound annual growth in earnings
per share (normalised for tax, exceptional items and volatile IFRS charges
or credits) (EPS). The LTIP , with the new performance criterion, would be
available with the GKN Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) (explained
below) from which annual awards could be made up to an overall annual
limit of 250% of total face value of salary (as is currently the case).
For LTIP awards subject to the new EPS performance criterion, vesting
would occur at a threshold of 6% compound annual EPS growth at which
level 30% of the award would vest, and continue on a straight line basis
to 12% compound annual EPS growth at which point 100% of the award
would vest.
The Committee considers that an EPS performance condition provides a
true measure of the underlying profitability of a company, reflecting more
directly management effort and performance, and is a prime factor that
investors take into account when assessing their investment decisions;
compound annual growth in EPS of between 6% and 12% is a stretching
target of relevance to shareholders. When coupled with the TSR based
performance condition under the ESOS, the incentives available will, the
Committee believes, provide a meaningful incentive package for the
motivation and retention of executive Directors linked directly with
shareholders’ interests. If GKN’s TSR ranks in the upper quartile of the comparator group at the
end of the three year measurement period the conditional award is
converted into a deferred right to receive all of the shares, which will not
be released to the Director for at least one further year other than in the
specific circumstances set out in the rules of the LTIP . If the ranking is at
the median level, 30% of the shares will be received at the end of the
deferment period, with no shares being received for below median
ranking. For intermediate rankings between median and upper quartile,
the Director will receive a proportionate number of shares increasing on a
straight line basis. Dividends will be treated as having accrued from the
beginning of the third year of the measurement period on any shares that
vest and the equivalent cash amount will be paid to the Director on
release of such shares.

GKN obtains the required TSR data and ranking information from an

independently verified. However, irrespective of GKN’s TSR, or for awards
from 2008 onwards its EPS, before any shares become eligible for release
the Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that this is justified by the
underlying financial performance of the Group over the measurement
period.

GKN Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS)
Under the ESOS each executive Director may be awarded annually an
option to subscribe for a number of GKN plc ordinary shares. The
Remuneration Committee decides the level of awards in each year. For
awards from 2004 onwards, annual award levels are not specifically
capped under the ESOS, but when combined with awards under the LTIP
(which are capped at 150% of basic salary) they cannot exceed 250% of
basic salary, except where necessary specifically to recruit or retain an
individual. ESOS awards to executive Directors in 2007 were made at
120% of basic salary, giving a combined award value with LTIP for 2007 of
220% of basic salary.
The number of shares that a Director can ultimately acquire upon exercise
of the option is dependent upon satisfaction of a performance condition
and a personal shareholding requirement (see pages 61 and 62), set by
the Remuneration Committee before an option is granted. Performance
for awards granted from 2004 onwards is measured by comparing the
TSR from GKN shares with the TSR from shares of companies in a
comparator group comprising the constituents of the FTSE 350 Index at
the start of a three year measurement period commencing on 1 January in
the year of award. The Remuneration Committee believes the FTSE 350
Index to be appropriate as it is a broadly based index which contains
more manufacturing and engineering companies than the FTSE 100 Index.
Under current arrangements, 50% of the shares under option can be
acquired by the Director if GKN ranks at the median level in the
comparator group with no shares being receivable for below median TSR
performance. Under the proposed revised arrangements, 35% of the
shares can be acquired if GKN ranks at the median level. 100% of the
shares can only be acquired if GKN ranks in the upper quartile of the
comparator group, with a straight line sliding scale for rankings between
median and upper quartile, which remains unchanged under the
proposed revised arrangements. No retesting of the performance
condition after the end of the measurement period is permitted.
The TSR information is obtained from an external consultant to ensure
that the performance is independently verified. In addition,
notwithstanding GKN’s TSR, the Remuneration Committee must be
satisfied that the vesting of an option is justified by the underlying
financial performance of the Group over the measurement period.
For options granted from 2001 to 2003 inclusive, the performance
condition is linked to the increase in GKN’s earnings per share*, or ‘EPS’,
over the three years commencing on 1 January in the year of award. 50%
of the shares can be acquired if the increase over this period is not less
than the increase in the Retail Prices Index (RPI) plus 9%. The remaining
50% can only be acquired in full if such increase is RPI plus 15% (with a
straight line sliding scale for increases between RPI plus 9% and RPI plus
15%). If the performance condition is not satisfied in full after the first
three year period, so that less than 100% of the shares under option can
be acquired, the performance condition will be reassessed each year up
to six years from the date of grant (the RPI plus 9% will be increased by
3% for each year beyond the third year, and the RPI plus 15% will be
increased by 5% for each year beyond the third year). At the end of the six
year period, any unvested options will lapse. The awards granted in 2001
underwent their final retesting in 2007 and, as nothing vested, have now
lapsed. As stated above, there is no such retesting of awards made from
2004 onwards.
Options granted under the ESOS are normally exercisable between the
third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant. The exercise price is fixed
at the market price of GKN’s shares at the time of grant.
Retirement benefits
Prior to 6 April 2006, certain executive Directors were subject to the UK
restrictions on pensionable earnings in the Finance Act 1989 (the
earnings cap). Retirement provision is secured by the Company by
supplementary cash allowances paid to each Director or, in certain cases,
dependent in part upon the individual’s salary level at commencement of
employment, by membership of the executive section of the GKN Group
Pension Scheme, which is a defined benefit scheme, and a supplementary
allowance. The retirement provisions are made in order to assist each
Director towards securing overall retirement benefits comparable in value
with those available under the pension scheme had it not been for the
operation of the earnings cap (some members have specific individual
earnings caps).
GKN’s defined benefit pension scheme provides Directors with a
pension of up to two thirds of basic annual salary (up to their earnings
cap) on retirement at age 60 after 20 or more years’ service and
proportionately less for shorter service or for retirement before pension
age. An employee contribution of 7% of salary up to their earnings cap is
required under the scheme.
Executive Directors with non-UK employment contracts typically receive
retirement benefits consistent with local practice. In particular, in
accordance with standard practice in the US, GKN makes a total
contribution equivalent to 11% of Bill Seeger’s basic salary and annual
performance-related short term variable remuneration to his qualified and
non-qualified defined contribution pension arrangement. The amount
contributed by GKN is deducted from the supplementary allowance that
would otherwise have been payable to him (a maximum of 40% of salary).

Directors’ Remuneration Report
The arrangements for providing retirement benefits to executive Directors
and other senior executives were reviewed in the light of changes in the
taxation of pensions introduced by the Government from April 2006. For
those previously affected by the limit on annual pensionable earnings, a
notional limit has been maintained beyond April 2006 so that, overall, the
existing pension and salary supplement arrangements are broadly
unchanged (for some members a specific individual earnings cap has
been introduced). No compensation is offered for any additional tax
suffered by the individual in the event that the value of their pension
exceeds the new Lifetime Allowance.
From 1 September 2007 the GKN Group Pension Scheme adopted a
Career Average Revalued Earnings (CARE) approach rather than a Final
Salary basis. However, as earnings are capped and all the Directors can
complete more than 20 years’ service, this will have no impact on the
retirement benefit for these individuals.
Service agreements
The service agreements of executive Directors employed in the UK are
with GKN Holdings plc, the parent company of the GKN Group prior to the
Industrial Services demerger in 2001 and now a wholly-owned subsidiary
of GKN plc. Executive Directors employed overseas have their service
agreements with the appropriate overseas subsidiary. The non-executive
Directors do not have service agreements; their terms of service are
contained in letters of appointment.
The Board’s current policy is that, unless local employment practice
requires otherwise, the service agreements of its executive Directors will
be terminable by the employing company on one year’s notice. Bill Seeger
has a US service agreement with GKN North America Services Inc, also
terminable by the Company on one year’s notice, which terminates, in any
event, on 31 December 2016 (unless extended by prior agreement
between Mr Seeger and the Company).
Other than in the event of early termination following a change of control
of GKN plc, there is no contractual provision for predetermined
compensation payable upon early termination of an executive Director’s
service agreement. In the event of such a severance (other than on a
change of control) the Remuneration Committee would apply the
principles of the severance policy adopted by the Board. Under this
policy, which may be varied in individual cases, an immediate lump sum
severance payment will be made to the Director equivalent to one year’s
basic salary plus one year’s pension contributions. Consideration would
be given to the inclusion in the severance payment of additional elements
relating to short term variable remuneration and major benefits in kind.
However, such additional elements will not normally be included where
the severance is as a result of underperformance. Consideration would
also be given to making the severance payment in 12 equal instalments
which will only be paid to the extent that the Director has not been able to
mitigate his or her loss by the date of the relevant payment.
In the event of the service agreement coming to an end by mutual
consent, the Remuneration Committee will approve such termination
arrangements as are appropriate in the particular circumstances.
As permitted by the Combined Code on Corporate Governance, if
termination of a Director’s service agreement occurs on less than due
notice within 12 months following a change in control of GKN plc, a
predetermined amount is payable to the Director equivalent to one year’s
basic salary, pension contributions, benefits in kind and loss of
entitlements under performance-related short term remuneration
arrangements.
An enhancement to the pension rights of an executive Director upon early
retirement will only be considered in exceptional cases and a full costing
would be provided to the Remuneration Committee at the time of its
deliberations. In any event, such enhancement would not be considered
unless objectives set for the Director had been met or it was otherwise
merited in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee.
It is also the Board’s policy that, at the time of consideration of a
proposed appointment of an executive Director, the Remuneration
Committee will take into account the likely cost of severance in
determining the appropriateness of the proposed terms of appointment.
In accordance with the relevant provisions of the Companies Act 2006, no
payment will be made to a Director for loss of office or employment with
the Company in excess of the Director’s contractual obligations without
the prior approval of shareholders in general meeting.
External appointments
The Board recognises the benefit which GKN can obtain if executive
Directors of GKN serve as non-executive Directors of other companies.
Subject to review in each case, the Board’s general policy is that each
executive Director may accept one non-executive directorship with
another company (but not the chairmanship of a FTSE 100 company) from
which the Director may retain the fees.
Sir Kevin Smith is a non-executive Director of Scottish and Southern
Energy plc. Nigel Stein is a non-executive Director of Wolseley plc. They
each retain the fees payable in respect of these appointments (currently
£45,000 and £60,000 per annum respectively).
Terms of appointment of Chairman and non-executive Directors
Roy Brown became Chairman in May 2004 for an initial period of three
years terminable at any time upon 12 months’ notice by either party. In
May 2007, by resolution of the Board, his term was extended until 20 May
2010. He receives a fee, determined by the Remuneration Committee, of
£300,000 per annum, increased from £240,000 per annum with effect
from 1 July 2007. He does not participate in the Group’s short term
variable remuneration or long term incentive arrangements or in its
pension scheme.
The fees received by each of the remaining non-executive Directors are
determined by the Board upon the recommendation of the Chairman and
the Chief Executive. The non-executive Directors do not participate in the
Board’s determinations on this matter. The basic fee received by the non-
executive Directors in 2007 was £45,000. In addition, the chairmen of the
Audit Committee (John Sheldrick) and Remuneration Committee (Sir Peter
Williams) received £9,000 and £8,000 respectively to reflect the
significant extra responsibilities attached to these positions. The Senior
Independent Director, Sir Ian Gibson, received an annual fee in 2007 of
£50,000; he retired from the Board on 31 December 2007 and was
succeeded in the role of Senior Independent Director by Sir Peter
Williams, who receives an additional fee of £5,000 in respect of this role.
The non-executive Directors do not participate in the Group’s short term
variable remuneration or long term incentive arrangements or in its
pension scheme, nor do they receive benefits in kind. The current policy is
for non-executive Directors to serve on the Board for nine years with
interim renewals after three and six years, subject to mutual agreement
and annual performance reviews.
Shareholding requirement
In order to reinforce the alignment of their interests with those of
shareholders generally, all Directors are subject to a shareholding
requirement. Total shareholder return — £ sterling
GKN and FTSE 100 Index 2002 t0 2007
62 GKN plc Annual Report 2007
Directors’ Remuneration Report
continued
Under a policy adopted by the Remuneration Committee, executive
Directors are required to establish and maintain an investment in GKN plc
ordinary shares equivalent to at least 100% of their basic salary. The
receipt of any shares by a Director from an award made under the LTIP and
ESOS is conditional upon the shareholding requirement being met on the
third anniversary of the grant of the award. For these purposes any
deferred rights under the LTIP will be counted as shares.
Each executive Director must acquire the minimum required shareholding
by adding to any existing shareholding using performance-related
rewards which may be received under the GKN short term variable
remuneration and long term incentive arrangements. Until the required
shareholding level is reached, an executive Director must apply, in the
purchase of GKN shares, 30% of that amount of the gross (i.e. before tax)
payment under the short term (annual) variable remuneration scheme
which exceeds 50% of the Director’s gross basic salary at that time, and
must retain such number of shares received under the LTIP and ESOS as
represents at least 30% of the gross gain which the Director would have
realised on the exercise of such an award had the shares been sold on the
day of exercise.
It is the Board’s policy that non-executive Directors will normally be
expected to acquire a holding of GKN plc ordinary shares of a value
equivalent to 30% of one year’s basic fee within three years of
appointment.
Total shareholder return performance
Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 (the Act) requires GKN’s TSR
performance to be displayed in chart form against the TSR of a readily
available broad equity market index. The Committee considers that in
order to maintain consistency, it continues to be appropriate to show the
FTSE 100 Index to fulfil this requirement.
The chart below therefore illustrates the TSR performance (based on an
initial investment of £100) of GKN plc ordinary shares over the five year
period to the end of 2007 compared to the TSR that would have been
obtained over the same period from a hypothetical investment in the
companies constituting the FTSE 100 Index.
However, for the purposes of the LTIP and ESOS different comparator
companies are used (see pages 58 to 60) and the TSR calculation
methodology required is different from that required by the regulations
for the broad equity market index graph. We therefore show below GKN’s
TSR and rank against the TSR of the relevant comparator group, together
with the vesting percentage of the awards for the five most recently
completed measurement periods as computed under the terms of the LTIP
and for the completed measurement periods for the ESOS awards based
on TSR performance.

GKN) respectively. For the measurement periods ending on 31 December 2006 and 2007, they

With the exception of the dates of the executive Directors’ service agreements shown in the table below, note (a) to the table below, note (g) to the table
on page 65 and the section headed ‘Share interests’ on page 68, the information set out on pages 63 to 68 represents the auditable disclosures required
by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985.
The remuneration of the executive Directors in 2007, excluding pension benefits and long term incentives, was as follows:

(a) The executive Directors’ basic salaries at 31 December 2007 were: Sir Kevin Smith £747,579; M J Bryson £330,000; A Reynolds Smith £380,000; W C Seeger £330,000; N M Stein £470,000. The
average year end basic salary of those executives in the most senior executive grade below Board level whose remuneration is monitored by the Remuneration Committee was £220,027 (all non-
sterling amounts have been translated into sterling at the year end exchange rate for this purpose).
(b) Payments of supplementary allowances to certain executive Directors to assist them towards securing retirement benefits are included in the cash allowances for pension benefit purposes disclosed
in the first table on page 67. The allowances, detailed below, have therefore been excluded from the total remuneration shown in the table above although they are part of the Directors’ aggregate
emoluments for the purpose of disclosure under the Companies Act 1985: Sir Kevin Smith £287,956 (2006–£263,691); M J Bryson £17,780 (2006 – £nil); A Reynolds Smith £62,346 (2006 – £nil);
W C Seeger £30,758 (2006 – £nil); N M Stein £134,004 (2006 –£118,248).
(c) Appointed to the Board 1 June 2007.
(d) Appointed to the Board 10 September 2007. Under the terms of his service agreement, Mr Seeger’s emoluments are paid semi-monthly in US$, converted at the exchange rate published in the UK
Financial Times on the first business day of the relevant month. Mr Seeger is a US National who is relocating to the UK in the role of Group Finance Director. Additional reimbursement has been made
by the Company in respect of temporary living costs incurred ahead of such relocation. Mr Seeger continued to have full US Federal and State tax withholding through the US payroll in 2007. As a
result of the complicated interaction of the UK and US tax regimes, an additional payment of £47,559 was made by GKN to the UK tax authorities on Mr Seeger’s behalf in order to avoid a period of
double taxation. All subsequent tax refunds resulting from the tax paid by GKN will be refunded to the Company in due course. A figure of £9,414 is contained within the benefits figure shown, being
the best estimate of the amount which is not expected to be refunded based on information available to date.
The 2007 performance-related payments were triggered by the achievement of a number of Group and, where relevant, divisional targets relating to
profit before tax, strategy and cash generation. Profit performance equal to target would have resulted in payments of 40%–50% of salary. The maximum
amount that an individual could receive under the profit element was 100% of salary. In addition, cash flow targets were set for the Group as a whole
and, where appropriate, divisional cash flow performance for each half of the year. Cash flow targets were substantially achieved, resulting in payments
of between 4% and 10% of salary. In relation to profit performance, achievements resulted in payments of between 45% and 86% of salary. In relation to
divisional strategy performance, achievements resulted in payments of between 10% and 20% of salary. Actual total payments to executive Directors
under the 2007 short term variable remuneration scheme varied between 69% and 96% of salary.

Interests in GKN plc 50p ordinary shares held by the executive Directors through Company-matched shares under the GKN Bonus Co-Investment Plan
(BCIP) as at 31 December 2007 and 1 January 2007 (or, if later, on date of appointment as a Director), together with awards released during the year, are
given in the table below. Directors were prohibited from participating in the BCIP; awards detailed below were granted prior to the relevant individual’s
appointment as a Director of the Company.
Under the BCIP , participants could elect in 2005 to invest up to 10% of their maximum gross bonus opportunity for the prior year in GKN plc 50p ordinary
shares (‘investment shares’). GKN plc granted matching shares on a three and a half for one basis (i.e. seven matching shares for every two investment
shares purchased) which will be released to the participant after three years (which commenced 21 April 2005) provided that the participant continues to
hold the investment shares and remains an employee of the GKN Group during that period. An additional condition applies to a one for one proportion of
the match such that those shares will only be released to the participant after three years provided a Group OPIC (operating profit before exceptional
items (as defined for internal reporting purposes) after the application of a notional investment charge) performance condition is achieved. Directors
have a beneficial interest in their matching shares during the three year forfeiture period. Any awards deliverable under the BCIP will be satisfied from
GKN ordinary shares already in issue.

participating in the PGIP; awards set out in the table were granted prior to the relevant individual’s appointment as a Director of the Company.
Under the PGIP , the shares which are the subject of the awards set out in the table, if any, that will become capable of release will depend on the extent
to which profit growth targets are satisfied by the Company over a three year performance period which commenced on 1 January 2007; the Company’s
reported profit for 2006 forms the baseline for this performance measure. Annual Report 2007 GKN plc 65

The number of shares given below will be released following the performance period if the minimum targeted profit growth is achieved. A maximum of
twice the amount of shares listed below will be released on achievement of the maximum profit target. No shares will be released and the awards will
lapse if the minimum profit target is not achieved. Release is also conditional upon the satisfaction of a personal shareholding requirement. Any awards
deliverable under the PGIP will be satisfied from GKN ordinary shares already in issue.

Auditors’ Report
Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of GKN plc
We have audited the Group financial statements of GKN plc for the year
ended 31 December 2007 which comprise the consolidated income
statement, the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated cash flow
statement, the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense
and the related notes. These Group financial statements have been
prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the Company financial statements of
GKN plc for the year ended 31 December 2007 and on the information in
the Directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been
audited on page 115.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the
Group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union are set out in the statement of Directors’ responsibilities
on page 51.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in accordance
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including the opinion,
has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in
accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other
purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this
report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group financial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the Group financial
statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to
you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report is
consistent with the Group financial statements. The information given in
the Directors’ report includes that specific information presented in the
business review that is cross referred from the business review section of
the Directors’ report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information
specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions
is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the Combined Code
(2006) specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to
consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks
and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s
corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the annual report and consider
whether it is consistent with the audited Group financial statements. The
other information comprises only the Directors’ report, the Chairman’s
statement, the Chief Executive’s statement, the business review, the
corporate governance statement and the other information listed on the
contents page of the annual report. We consider the implications for our
report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the Group financial statements. Our responsibilities
do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts
and disclosures in the Group financial statements. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the
Directors in the preparation of the Group financial statements, and of
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us
with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Group
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused
by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the
Group financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
 the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance
with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the state of the
Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2007 and of its profit and cash flows
for the year then ended;
 the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS
Regulation; and
 the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the
Group financial statements.

Notes to the Financial Statements
1 Accounting policies and presentation
The Group’s key accounting policies are summarised below.
Basis of preparation and consolidation
The Group consolidated financial statements are for the 12 months ended 31 December 2007. These consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as applicable to companies reporting under IFRS and with those IFRS standards and IFRIC
interpretations issued and effective and endorsed by the European Union as at the time of preparing these statements.
The Group consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (together ‘the Group’) and the
Group's share of the results and equity of its joint ventures.
Subsidiaries are entities over which, either directly or indirectly, the Company has control through the power to govern financial operating policies so as
to obtain benefit from their activities. This power is generally accompanied by a shareholding of more than 50% of the voting rights. The results of
subsidiaries acquired or sold during the year are included in the Group’s results from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal. All business
combinations are accounted for by the purchase method.
Joint ventures are entities in which the Group has a long term interest and exercises joint control with its partners over their financial and operating
policies. In all cases voting rights are 50% or lower. Investments in joint ventures are accounted for by the equity method. The Group's share of equity
includes goodwill arising on acquisition.
In a single case the Company indirectly owns 100% of the voting share capital of an entity but is precluded from exercising either control or joint control
by a contractual agreement with the United States Department of Defense. In accordance with IAS 27 this entity has been excluded from the
consolidation and treated as an investment. Further details are contained in note 13.
Intra-group transactions and balances and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions, together with those with joint ventures,
are eliminated.
The profit or loss on discontinued operations comprises the trading results up to the date of disposal or discontinuance and the profit or loss on the
disposal or closure where businesses are sold or closed by the date on which the financial statements are approved. A discontinued operation is a
business or businesses that have either been disposed of or closed or satisfies the criteria to be classified as held for sale and that represents either a
material line of business within the Group or within one of its reported segments or a primary geographical area of operation. Where businesses fall to
be treated as discontinued in the current year the comparative data is reclassified to reflect those businesses as discontinued.
Minority interests represent the portion of shareholders’ earnings and equity attributable to third party shareholders not belonging to the Group.
Presentation of the income statement
IFRS is not prescriptive as to the format of the income statement. The format used by the Group, in arriving at the results of continuing operations, in
these financial statements is explained below.
Sales shown in the income statement are those of continuing subsidiary companies only.
Operating profit is the pre-finance profit of continuing subsidiary companies and, in order to achieve consistency and comparability between reporting
periods, is analysed to show separately the results of normal trading performance and individually significant charges and credits. Such items arise
because of their size or nature and, in 2007, comprise:
 charges relating to the Group’s strategic restructuring programme announced in 2004,
 the impact of the annual goodwill impairment review,
 asset impairment and restructuring charges which arise from events which are significant to any reportable segment,
 amortisation of the fair value of non-operating intangible assets arising on business combinations,
 profits or losses on businesses sold or closed which do not meet the definition of discontinued operations or which the Group views as capital rather
than revenue in nature, and
 changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments between the opening and closing balance sheets.
The Group’s post-tax share of joint venture profits is shown as a separate component of profit before tax.
Net finance costs are analysed to show separately interest payable, interest receivable and the net of interest payable on post-employment obligations
and the expected return on pension scheme assets.
Restatement of 2006 comparatives for presentation purposes
The 2006 trading profit of the Group has been reanalysed in respect of the results of GKN Sheepbridge Stokes, the UK cylinder liner business which
formed a significant component of the Other Automotive segment. The closure of this operation was announced in January 2007. Trading has ceased
during the year, and its trading results are shown as a separate component of operating profit within the caption ‘Profits and losses on sale or closures
of businesses’. Sales of the business in the year were £22 million (2006–£27 million) and are included in total Group sales.
In the segmental analysis (note 2), comparative figures for the Driveline and OffHighway segments have been restated by equal and opposite amounts
in respect of two businesses formerly reported in Driveline, the customer and the product base of which has become increasingly focused on off-
highway applications. Annual Report 2007 GKN plc 75
Financial Statements
Finalisation of fair value adjustments in respect of the 2006 acquisitions of Stellex Aerostructures, Rockford Powertrain and Liuzhou Steel Rim Factory
(Liuzhou) were made in the year. As required under IFRS 3, amendments to provisional fair values have been shown as a prior period restatement. As a
consequence, and only in respect of Liuzhou, intangible fixed assets have been restated to recognise non-operating intangible assets arising on
business combinations of £1 million with an equal reduction in the value of goodwill.
The impact of the presentational changes noted above on the previously reported 2006 figures is set out below:
As previously reported Restated
Trading profit (£m) 242 251
Operating profit (£m) 203 203
Profit after taxation for the year (£m) 177 177
Basic earnings per share (p) 25.0 25.0
Adjusted earnings per share (p) 28.8 30.1
Net assets (£m) 908 908
Retained earnings (£m) 589 589
Foreign currencies
Subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates account in the currency of their primary economic environment of operation, determined having regard to
the currency which mainly influences sales revenue and input costs. Transactions of subsidiaries are translated at exchange rates approximating to the
rate ruling on the date of the transaction except in the case of material transactions where actual spot rate may be used if it more accurately reflects the
underlying substance of the transaction. Where practicable, transactions involving foreign currencies are protected by forward contracts. Assets and
liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The Group's presentational currency is sterling. On consolidation, results and cash flows of foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures are translated to
sterling at average exchange rates. Their assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Profits and losses on the realisation of currency net investments include the accumulated net exchange differences that have arisen on the retranslation
of the currency net investments since 1 January 2004 up to the date of realisation.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group does not trade in derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments including forward foreign exchange contracts are used by
the Group to manage its exposure to (i) changes in the fair value of recognised assets and liabilities, (ii) risk associated with the variability in cash flows
in relation to both recognised assets or liabilities or forecast transactions and (iii) changes in the value of the Group’s net investment in overseas
operations. All derivative financial instruments are measured at the balance sheet date at their fair value.
Where derivative financial instruments are not designated as or not determined to be effective hedges, any gain or loss on the remeasurement of the
fair value of the instrument at the balance sheet date is taken to the income statement.
Where derivative financial instruments are held as and are effective as cash flow hedges against the fair value changes in recognised assets and
liabilities, remeasurement gains and losses on the instrument are matched against the remeasurement gain or loss on the recognised asset and liability
in the income statement.
Remeasurement gains and losses on derivative financial instruments held as net investment hedges are recognised in equity via the statement of
recognised income and expense until the instrument and the underlying hedged investment are sold, when the profit or loss arising is recognised in the
income statement.
Any derivative financial instruments no longer designated as effective hedges are restated at market value and any gains or losses are taken directly to
the income statement.
Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts are recognised at their fair value when the nature, characteristics and risks of the derivative are
not closely related to the host contract. Gains and losses arising on the remeasurement of these embedded derivatives at each balance sheet date are
taken to the income statement.
Other financial instruments
Borrowings are measured at their amortised cost unless they are matched by an associated effective hedging financial instrument in which case they
are stated at their fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and overdrafts together with highly liquid investments of less than three
months maturity. Unless an enforceable right of set-off exists and there is an intention to net settle, the components of cash and cash equivalents are
reflected on a gross basis in the balance sheet.
The carrying value of other financial assets and liabilities, including short term receivables and payables, are stated at amortised cost less any
impairment provision unless the impact of the time value of money is considered to be material. 76 GKN plc Annual Report 2007
Notes to the Financial Statements
continued
1 Accounting policies and presentation continued
Sales and revenue recognition
Revenue from the sales of goods and services is measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable which generally equates to the invoiced
amount, excluding sales taxes and net of allowances for returns, early settlement discounts and rebates.
Invoices for goods are raised when the risks and rewards of ownership have passed which, dependent upon contractual terms, may be at the point of
dispatch, acceptance by the customer or, in Aerospace, certification by the customer. Invoices for services are raised on the basis of hours worked or
the achievement of contractual deliverables which have been agreed by the customer.
Revenue is recognised in the income statement when it can be reliably measured and its collectability is reasonably assured.
Royalty and licence income is recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with relevant agreements and included within sales.
Intangible assets
All intangible assets, excluding goodwill arising on a business combination, are stated at cost (fair value on initial recognition) and subsequently carried
at their amortised cost or fair value less any provision for impairment.
Research and development costs
Research expenditure is written off as incurred.
Where development expenditure results in new or substantially improved products or processes and it is probable that recovery will take place, it is
capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over the product’s life up to a maximum of 7 years in Automotive and 15 years in Aerospace starting
from the date on which serial production commences. Costs are capitalised as intangible assets unless physical assets, such as tooling, exist when they
are classified as property, plant and equipment.
Computer software costs
Where computer software is not integral to an item of property, plant or equipment its costs are capitalised and categorised as intangible assets.
Amortisation is provided on a straight line basis over its economic useful life which is in the range of 3–5 years.
Acquired non-operating intangible assets — business combinations
Non-operating intangible assets that are acquired as a result of a business combination including but not limited to customer contracts and
relationships, order backlog, patents and know-how, proprietary technology, brand names and trademarks, other intellectual property rights, and
agreements not to compete that can be separately measured at fair value on a reliable basis, are separately recognised on acquisition at their fair value.
Amortisation is charged on a straight line basis to the income statement over their expected useful lives which are:
Years
Brands/trademarks 30–50
Intellectual property rights 5–10
Customer contracts and relationships 2–15
Proprietary technology and know-how 7–10
Agreements not to compete 3
Goodwill — business combinations
Goodwill arising on consolidation consists of the excess of the fair value of the consideration over the fair value of the identifiable intangible and
tangible assets net of the fair value of the liabilities including contingencies of businesses acquired at the date of acquisition. Goodwill in respect of
business combinations of subsidiaries is recognised as an intangible asset. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a joint venture or associated
undertaking is included in the carrying value of the investment.
Where negative goodwill arises, following reassessment of fair values, it is credited to the income statement in the period in which the acquisition
is made.
Goodwill is carried at cost less any recognised impairment losses that arise from the annual assessment of its carrying value. To the extent that the
carrying value exceeds the value in use, determined from estimated discounted future net cash flows or recoverable amount, goodwill is written down
to the value in use and an impairment charge is recognised in the income statement.
Impairment of non-current assets
All non-current assets are tested for impairment when events occur or circumstances indicate that their carrying values might be impaired. Goodwill,
capitalised development costs and acquired non-operating intangibles are subject to annual impairment reviews and assessments. Impairments arising
are charged to the income statement.
Property, plant and equipment
Cost
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment charges. Cost comprises the purchase
price plus costs directly incurred in bringing the asset into use but excludes interest. Annual Report 2007 GKN plc 77
Financial Statements
Where freehold and long leasehold properties were carried at a valuation at 23 March 2000, these values have been retained as book values and
therefore deemed cost at the date of the IFRS transition.
Where assets are in the course of construction at the balance sheet date they are classified as capital work in progress. Transfers are made to other
asset categories when they are available for use.
Depreciation
Depreciation is not provided on freehold land or capital work in progress. In the case of all other categories of asset, depreciation is provided on a
straight line basis over the course of the financial year.
Depreciation is applied to specific classes of asset so as to reduce them to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, which are reviewed
annually.
The range of main rates of depreciation used are:
Years
Freehold buildings Up to 50
Steel powder production plant 18
General plant, machinery, fixtures and fittings 6–15
Computers 3–5
Commercial vehicles and cars 4–5
Leasehold properties are amortised by equal annual instalments over the period of the lease or 50 years, whichever is the shorter.
Leased assets
Where fixed assets are financed by leasing arrangements which give rights approximating to ownership, the assets are treated as if they had been
purchased and the capital element of the leasing commitment is shown as obligations under finance leases. The rentals payable are apportioned
between interest, which is charged to the income statement, and capital which reduces the outstanding obligation. Operating lease rentals are charged
to the income statement as incurred over the lease term.
Inventories
Inventories are valued on a FIFO or weighted average cost basis at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value, due allowance being made for
obsolete or slow moving items. Cost includes raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and the relevant proportion of works overheads assuming
normal levels of activity.
Taxation
Current and deferred tax are recognised in the income statement unless they relate to items recognised directly in equity when the related tax is also
recognised in equity.
Full provision is made for deferred tax on all temporary timing differences resulting from the difference between the carrying value of an asset or liability
in the consolidated financial statements and its tax base. The amount of deferred tax reflects the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the
carrying amount of the assets and liabilities using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against
future taxable profits.
Deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted profits of joint ventures. No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted profits of overseas branches and
subsidiaries except to the extent that it is probable that such earnings will be remitted to the parent in the foreseeable future.
Pensions and post-employment benefits
The Group’s pension arrangements comprise various defined benefit and defined contribution schemes throughout the world. In the UK and in certain
overseas companies pension arrangements are made through externally funded defined benefit schemes, the contributions to which are based on the
advice of independent actuaries or in accordance with the rules of the schemes. In other overseas companies funds are retained within the business to
provide for retirement obligations.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit arrangements which provide certain employees with defined post-
employment healthcare benefits.
The Group accounts for all post-employment defined benefit schemes through full recognition of the schemes’ surpluses or deficits on the balance sheet
at the end of each year. Actuarial gains and losses are included in the statement of recognised income and expense. Current and past service costs,
curtailments and settlements are recognised within operating profit. Returns on scheme assets and interest on obligations are recognised as a
component of other net financing charges.
For defined contribution arrangements the cost charged to the income statement represents the Group’s contributions to the relevant schemes in the
period in which they fall due. 78 GKN plc Annual Report 2007

1 Accounting policies and presentation continued
Share-based payments
Share-based incentive arrangements are provided to employees under the Group’s share option, incentive and other share award schemes. Share
options granted to employees and share-based arrangements put in place since 7 November 2002 are valued at the date of grant or award using an
appropriate option pricing model and are charged to operating profit over the performance or vesting period of the scheme. The annual charge is
modified to take account of shares forfeited by employees who leave during the performance or vesting period and, in the case of non-market related
performance conditions, where it becomes unlikely the option will vest.
Government grants
Grants receivable from governments or similar bodies are credited to the balance sheet in the period in which the conditions relating to the grant are
met. Where they relate to specific assets they are amortised on a straight line basis over the same period as the asset is depreciated. Where they relate
to revenue expenditure and/or non-asset criteria they are taken to the income statement to match the period in which the expenditure is incurred and
criteria met.
Treasury shares
GKN shares which have been purchased and not cancelled are held as treasury shares and deducted from shareholders’ equity.
Dividends
The annual final dividend is not provided for until approved at the Annual General Meeting whilst interim dividends are charged in the period they
are paid.
Standards, amendments to standards and interpretations issued and applied
During the year ended 31 December 2007 the Group adopted the following standards, amendments to standards and interpretations.
IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' and the amendment to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ regarding capital disclosures. IFRS 7
introduces new and revised disclosures for financial instruments and for risks associated with financial instruments. As a disclosure based standard
there have been no changes in either accounting policies or the primary financial statements.
The following standards and interpretations had no material impact on the Group's results, assets or liabilities or were not relevant:
IFRS 4 ‘Insurance contracts’.
IFRIC 7 ‘Applying the restatement approach under IAS 29, Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies’.
IFRIC 8 ‘Scope of IFRS 2’.
IFRIC 9 ‘Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives’.
Standards, amendments to standards and interpretations issued but not yet applied
IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ was issued in November 2006 and is required to be implemented from 1 January 2009. It requires operating segments to be
identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive to allocate resources to the
segments and to assess their performance, and supersedes IAS 14 ‘Segment Reporting’. The effect of this standard on Group disclosures has not been
determined at this stage.
The following amendments to standards and interpretations are unlikely to have a material impact on the Group’s results, assets or liabilities or are not
relevant:
IAS 23 (Amendment) ‘Borrowing Costs’.
IFRIC 11 ‘IFRS 2 — Group and treasury share transactions’.
IFRIC 12 ‘Service concession arrangements’.
IFRIC 13 ‘Customer loyalty programmes’.
IFRIC 14 ‘IAS 19 — the limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction’.
Significant judgements, key assumptions and estimates
The Group’s significant accounting policies are set out above. The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with IFRS, requires the use of
estimates, subjective judgement and assumptions that may affect the amounts of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and reported profit and
earnings for the year. The Directors base these estimates, judgements and assumptions on a combination of past experience, professional expert advice
and other evidence that is relevant to the particular circumstance.
The accounting policies where the Directors consider the more complex estimates, judgements and assumptions have to be made are those in respect of
acquired non-operating intangible assets — business combinations (note 25), post-employment obligations (note 27), derivative financial instruments
(notes 3e and 20), taxation (notes 5 and 22) and impairment of non-current assets (notes 10 and 11). The details of the principal estimates, judgements
and assumptions made are set out in the related notes as identified. Annual Report 2007 GKN plc 79

All business segments shown above are continuing.
Intra-group sales, which are priced on an ‘arm’s length’ basis between segments and regions are not significant. The analyses of operating profit by
business includes an allocation, based on their nature, of costs incurred centrally in the United Kingdom, United States of America, China and Germany.
Unallocated costs represent corporate expenses. Segment assets and liabilities comprise all non-current and current items as per the balance sheet but
exclude taxation, borrowings and cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents and borrowings are not allocated to specific segments as these
resources are managed centrally and no business in any segment has sufficient autonomy to manage these resources. Segment capital expenditure is
the total cost incurred during the year to acquire segment assets that are expected to be used for more than one year. Annual Report 2007 GKN plc 81

Restatement of comparative data
i) Double Universal Joint business transfer: With effect from 1 January 2007 the Group’s Double Universal Joint activities in Italy and Uruguay have
been managed within our OffHighway segment having previously been included within Driveline. Segmental analyses presented in this note
represent the current period structure. Previously reported analyses have been restated.
ii) Cessation of UK cylinder liner manufacturing operation: In January 2007 the Group announced its intention to cease manufacturing at its UK
cylinder liner operation. This operation constitutes a major proportion of the Group’s Other Automotive segment. The losses of this business have
been reanalysed from trading profit to profits and losses on sale or closures of businesses.
iii) Finalisation of provisional fair value adjustment in respect of an OffHighway acquisition in 2006. See note 25.

inventory from its historical purchase or manufactured cost to current market values being current replacement cost for raw materials and
consumables and adjusted selling price for work in progress and finished goods. This fair value adjustment recognised on acquisition is charged to
the income statement as this inventory is sold. Annual Report 2007 GKN plc 83

Restructuring
During 2007 the Group continued to deploy its strategic restructuring programme, first announced in March 2004, that involves the migration of
Driveline production capacity from high cost to low cost/high growth economies, actions in support of the recovery in Powder Metallurgy and the
realignment and reduction of production capacity, overhead and infrastructure costs in other areas of the business. Charges recognised in the year in
respect of this programme amount to £33 million (2006–£63 million) which comprises amounts in respect of asset impairments of £6 million credit
(2006–£2 million charge), redundancy costs, including pension past service charges, credits and curtailments of £16 million (2006–£35 million) and
other reorganisation costs of £23 million (2006–£26 million). Pension past service charges, credits and curtailments amount to a £4 million charge in
2007 (2006–£3 million). An analysis by segment and description of the charges is set out below:

Powder Metallurgy 1 (2) (13) (14) (24)
Corporate — — — — (2)
6 (16) (23) (33) (63)
Redundancy costs provided for represent charges for contractual severance and other employee related exit benefits and post-employment
augmentations and curtailments. Reorganisation costs include charges for onerous lease, property and other contracts, incremental costs borne by the
Group as a consequence of dedicated restructuring and transition teams and equipment relocation costs attributable to the transfer of equipment
between closing facilities and continuing operations and incremental premium freight and product homologation costs. The impairment reversal in
Powder Metallurgy arises from the redeployment of previously impaired plant into cash generative alternative use elsewhere in the relevant division.
In Driveline the net impairment relates to the write-downs for plant deemed to be irrecoverable via future use (£3 million) being offset by a reversal
(£8 million) in a specific cash generating unit where business recovery has been sufficient to support reinstatement of the asset.
Restructuring actions undertaken in the year included the closure of a North American Powder Metallurgy production facility, the continuation of the
strategic fixed headcount reduction programme in Driveline and the ongoing reductions in operations in Driveline plants and four Powder Metallurgy
facilities. A net £2 million surplus has arisen on the disposal of a UK Powder Metallurgy facility that became surplus to operational requirements as a
consequence of the restructuring.
In 2006 restructuring charges arose primarily in respect of the announced closure and/or downsizings of four Driveline facilities, Driveline strategic
fixed headcount reductions and the announced closure of three Powder Metallurgy manufacturing facilities.
Cash outflow in respect of 2007 and earlier periods’ strategic restructuring actions amounted to £44 million (2006–£57 million). The disposal of the
surplus property noted above generated a net £4 million cash inflow.
Other impairments
The £2 million impairment reversal recognised in 2007 arose in relation to the Group’s UK cylinder liner manufacturing operation. The business
disposed of land and buildings and plant and machinery at a value greater than the theoretical net book value of the assets had they not been impaired,
consequently, a proportion of the previously recognised impairment has been reversed. The 2006 full year goodwill impairment arose in Driveline. Annual Report 2007 GKN plc 85
Financial Statements
(c) Amortisation of non-operating intangible assets arising on business combinations
In establishing the fair value of assets and liabilities arising on business combinations the Group identifies the fair values attributable to intangible
assets. The intangible assets recognised include operating intangibles, predominantly computer software, and non-operating intangibles being the
value in respect of brands and trademarks, intellectual property rights, customer contracts and relationships and proprietary technology rights and
know-how. All intangibles recognised on business combinations are amortised over the expected useful economic lives. Details of the lives used are set
out in the Group’s accounting policies and note 10 to these financial statements.
The amortisation of non-operating intangible assets is separately identified as a component of operating profit on the face of the income statement. The
analysis below sets out the amortisation charge in the year by category of non-operating intangible asset.

(e) Changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments
IAS 39 requires derivative financial instruments to be valued at the balance sheet date and any difference between that value and the intrinsic value of
the instrument to be reflected in the balance sheet as an asset or liability. Any subsequent change in value is reflected in the income statement unless
hedge accounting is achieved. Such movements do not affect cash flow or the economic substance of the underlying transaction. In 2007 and 2006 the
Group used transactional hedge accounting in a limited number of instances. As a consequence, and to assist year on year comparison, the change in
value continues to be identified as a separate element of operating profit. Details of the charges and credits to 2007 operating profit are set out in

The Group is required to estimate the income tax due in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. This requires an estimation of the current tax
liability together with an assessment of the temporary differences which arise as a consequence of different accounting and tax treatments. These
temporary differences result in deferred tax assets or liabilities which are measured using substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply when the
temporary differences reverse. Recognition of deferred tax assets, and hence credits to the income statement, are based on forecast future taxable
income and therefore involves judgement regarding the future financial performance of particular legal entities or tax groups in which the deferred tax
assets are recognised. Annual Report 2007 GKN plc 87
Financial Statements
The Group is subject to many different tax jurisdictions and tax rules as a consequence of its geographic spread. It is therefore subject to tax audits and
tax reviews, which by their nature are often complex and can require several years to conclude. Management judgement is therefore required to
determine the total provision for income tax. Amounts set aside and released in any period are based on management judgement and interpretation of
country specific tax law and the likelihood of crystallisation and settlement. Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that the tax positions
are sustainable. However, as amounts set aside in any period could differ from actual tax liabilities incurred, adjustments are required in subsequent
periods which may have a material impact on the Group’s income statement and/or cash tax payment. Payments in respect of tax liabilities for an
accounting period comprise payments on account and payments on the final resolution of open items with tax authorities and, as a result, there can be
substantial differences between the charge in the income statement and tax cash payments. Interest on provisions for uncertain tax positions is, where
relevant, provided for in the tax charge.
Details of the effective tax rate for the Group and the underlying events and transactions affecting this and the tax charge are given in the business
review on page 15.

6 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in
issue during the period, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares.
Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share are calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive
potential ordinary shares. The Company has only one category of dilutive potential ordinary shares; share options.
The calculation is performed for the share options to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value (determined as the
average market share price of the Company's shares) based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options. The
number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options.
Earnings per share are computed as follows:

9 Share-based payments
The Group has granted options over shares to employees for a number of years under different schemes. Where grants were made after 7 November
2002 they have been accounted for as required by IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’. As permitted by the transitional arrangements of that standard,
awards made before that date have not been so accounted. All options have been valued at the date of grant by an independent third party using a
Monte Carlo model which uses the same principle as a binomial model.
Details of awards made since 7 November 2002 are:
a) Employee Sharesave Scheme
In September 2003 the Company awarded options to UK employees under an approved Sharesave scheme the terms of which were that the employee
entered into a regular savings commitment up to a maximum of £250 per month for a three year period. The cumulative savings were then used to
acquire options over a number of shares at a 10% discount to market price at the date of grant. There were no performance conditions but, in general,
the employee must remain in employment for the three year period. Inputs to the valuation model were: option price 229p, volatility 38%, expected
dividend yield 4.3%, risk-free interest rate 4.49% and a term of 3.25 years. There have been no further awards since September 2003.
b) Executive Share Option Schemes (ESOS)
Awards were made to Directors and certain senior employees in March 2003 under the 2001 scheme and in September 2004, April 2005 and April 2006
under the 2004 scheme. In April 2007 awards were made to Directors under the 2004 scheme. Under both schemes options were granted with a fixed
exercise price equal to the market price at the date of grant and subject to meeting performance conditions over a three year period. In the case of the
2001 scheme, the performance condition was based on earnings per share (EPS) growth whilst under the 2004 scheme the condition is based on Total
Shareholder Return (TSR) compared with that of comparator companies. Under the 2001 scheme only, where the performance condition is not satisfied
in full after the first three years, retesting is carried out each year up to six years from the date of grant. Inputs to the valuation model were: option
price 163p to 380.3p, volatility 31% to 38%, expected dividend yield 3.3% to 6.2%, risk-free interest rate 4.28% to 5.40% and expected terms of 6.4
years to 6.7 years.
c) Long Term Incentive Plans (LTIP)
Awards were made to Directors and certain senior employees in March 2003 under the 2001 scheme and in September 2004, April 2006 and April 2007
under the 2004 scheme. In April 2005 awards were made to Directors under the 2004 scheme. Under both schemes, options were granted subject to
TSR performance over a three year period compared with a comparator group. There is no retest facility under either scheme. Inputs to the valuation
model were: option price nil, volatility 23% to 39%, expected dividend yield 3.3% to 6.2%, risk-free interest rate 4.05% to 5.40% and a term of 3 years
to 4 years 9.5 months.
d) Bonus Co-Investment Plan (BCIP)
Under the Bonus Co-Investment Plan, certain senior employees (excluding Directors) were entitled to use up to 10% of their gross short term annual
bonus potential to purchase shares in the Company at market price. Provided they remain in employment for three years and the shares are retained
for that period the Company matches those shares. For shares purchased by employees in 2004 the match was on a two for one basis and in 2005 was
two and a half for one. In addition, in 2005 there was a further one for one match if certain profit targets are achieved. All shares under the scheme are
purchased in the open market. Inputs to the valuation model were: option price nil, volatility, where applicable, 37%, expected dividend yield 4.9% to
5.4%, risk-free interest rate, where applicable, 4.94% and a term of 3 years.
e) Profit Growth Incentive Plan (PGIP)
Awards were made in April 2007 under the PGIP to certain senior employees (excluding Directors). Any benefit under the PGIP will be deliverable
dependent upon the extent to which profit growth targets are satisfied by the Group over a three year performance period; the Group’s reported profit
for the year prior to the year of award forms the baseline for this performance measure. The PGIP is a cash-based incentive plan. However, for certain
very senior employees the benefit is deliverable in shares; the number of shares given below will be released following the performance period if the
minimum targeted profit growth is achieved. A maximum of twice the amount of shares listed below will be released on achievement of the maximum
profit target, with one and a half times the number being released for interim performance. No shares will be released and the awards will lapse if the
minimum profit target is not achieved. Release is also conditional upon the satisfaction of a personal shareholding requirement. Any awards
deliverable under the PGIP will be satisfied from GKN ordinary shares already in issue.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over a period commensurate with the term of the awards. The risk-free interest rate is the rate
obtainable from government securities over the expected life of the equity incentive.
Further details of the ESOS, LTIP , BCIP and PGIP schemes are given in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 57 to 68. Annual Report 2007 GKN plc 91

Financial Statements
Impairment
An impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value of the assets of a business or cash generating unit (CGU) to their recoverable amount. Where
the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results. During the year, all goodwill was tested for impairment, with no
impairment charges resulting.
For the purposes of carrying out impairment tests, the Group’s total goodwill has been allocated to a number of CGUs and each of these CGUs has been
separately assessed and tested. The allocation of goodwill by business segment is set out in note 2. The size of a CGU varies but is never larger than a
primary or secondary reportable segment. In some cases, the CGU is an individual subsidiary or operation. The only amount of goodwill allocated to an
individual CGU which is significant to the total Group goodwill is that attributable to a US Aerospace business of £67 million (2006–£68 million).
All of the recoverable amounts were measured based on value in use except for current year acquisitions where market values have been used.
Detailed forecasts for the next five years have been used in the majority of impairment tests except where a longer term more detailed forecast is
available and appropriate. These forecasts are based on approved annual budgets and represent a best estimate of future performance.
A number of key assumptions have been made as a basis for the impairment tests. In each case, these key assumptions have been made by
management reflecting past experience and are consistent with relevant external sources of information and these are set out below. Where a
reasonably possible change to an assumption would lead to an impairment, a sensitivity analysis has been provided which quantifies the amount of
change required for an impairment to result.
Discount rates
A relative risk adjustment (or ‘beta’) has been applied to discount rates to reflect the risk inherent in specific CGUs. In determining the risk adjusted
discount rate, management have applied an adjustment for risk of such companies relative to all other sectors on average, determined using an
average of the betas of comparable listed companies.
Except for operations in India, where a rate of 16.0% has been factored into impairment models, the risk adjusted pre-tax discount range of rates set
out below have been used for impairment testing. The range of rates reflects the mix of currencies within CGUs within the segments.
Driveline: 8.25%–13.0%
Powder Metallurgy: 9.75%–12.25%
OffHighway: 11.0%–12.25%
Aerospace: 9.75%–11.50%
Long term growth rates
To forecast beyond the five years covered by detailed forecasts, a long term average growth rate has been used. In each case, this is not greater than
the published Oxford Economic Forecast average growth rate in gross domestic product for the next five year period in the territory or territories where
the CGU is primarily based. This results in a range of real growth rates from 2.1% (2006 – 2.4%) for Japan to 7.7% (2006 – 7.9%) for India, with most
other countries between 2.0% and 4.0% in both years. Nominal growth rates used in the calculations ranged from 2.7% to 13.4%.
Goodwill sensitivity analysis
In order to gauge sensitivity to likely and potential changes in discount rates and long term growth rates the impact of a 1% increase and/or decrease
in each rate in isolation was reviewed. In no instance does such a change result in an impairment in segmental goodwill balances. 94 GKN plc Annual Report 2007
Notes to the Financial Statements
continued
10 Intangible assets continued
Driveline
In determining the recoverable amount of Driveline CGUs, it is necessary to make a series of assumptions to estimate future cash flows. The main
assumptions include discount rates, long term growth rates, future sales prices and volumes (with reference to specific customer relationships and
product lines), a realistic estimate of new business, the cost structure of each CGU and the ability to realise benefits from annual productivity
improvements. Assumptions have also been made regarding input costs, including steel prices. It is not considered that a reasonably possible change
in any of these assumptions would generate a different impairment test outcome to the one included in this annual report.
Aerospace
In addition to the discount rate and long term growth rate, the key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount of Aerospace CGUs were
specific volumes on certain US military and civil programmes, the achievement of forecast selling prices, the cost structure of each CGU and the ability
to realise planned productivity improvements. It is not considered that a reasonably possible change in any of these assumptions would generate a
different impairment test outcome to the one included in this annual report.
Other segments
For the remaining impairment tests, key assumptions related to sales volumes and prices, raw material input costs and achieving benefits from annual
productivity improvements.

Other investments mainly comprise the Group’s net investment in GKN Aerospace Services Structures Corp. which is an entity in which the Group has,
since 2003, had a 100% share in the equity of the entity. This corporation operates under a proxy agreement with the United States Department of
Defense developing high technology, classified products for the Joint Strike Fighter. The agreement currently places significant restrictions on the
Group’s management and control of the business for the life of the contract so that, in accordance with IAS 27, it has been excluded from the
consolidation and treated as an investment. The investment, which is fully provided, is stated at cost less provision for diminution. At 31 December
2007, the excluded net liabilities were £5 million (2006–£4 million) and the operating loss for the year then ended was £1 million (2006–£1 million).
During the year, the Group provided engineering and design services to GKN Aerospace Services Structures Corp. which amounted to £nil (2006 – less
than £1 million).
Other receivables includes amounts recoverable in respect of employee deferred compensation arrangements and amounts recoverable from fiscal
authorities. Financial assets within the scope of IFRS 7 included within trade and other receivables amount to £9 million (2006–£7 million).
Loans to joint ventures are at variable interest rates. The fair value of the loans at 31 December 2007 was £nil (2006 –£7 million). 96 GKN plc Annual Report 2007

Notes
i) Denotes borrowings at fixed rates of interest until maturity. All other borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are at variable interest rates.
ii) The average interest rate on short term bank deposits was 5.48% (2006 – 5.16%). These deposits had an average maturity from 31 December 2007
of 2 days (2006 – 4 days).
iii) Finance lease obligations gross of finance charges fall due as follows; £2 million within one year (2006 –£3 million), £8 million in one to five years
(2006–£8 million) and £12 million in more than five years (2006–£12 million).
iv) £18 million (2006 –£25 million) of the Group’s cash and cash equivalents are held by the Group’s captive insurance company. In the normal course
of events these funds are held by the captive insurance company to maintain solvency requirements and as collateral for Letters of Credit issued to
the Group’s principal external insurance providers. These funds, therefore, are not circulated within the Group on demand. 98 GKN plc Annual Report 2007

The following methods and assumptions were used in estimating fair values for financial instruments:
Unsecured bank loans, overdrafts, other short term bank borrowings, bank balances and cash and short term bank deposits approximate to book value
due to their short maturities. For other borrowings and finance lease obligations carrying fixed rates of interest, the repayments which the Group is
committed to make have been discounted at the relevant interest rates applicable at 31 December 2007. Bonds included within other borrowings have
been valued using quoted closing market value.
19 Financial risk management
The Group’s activities give rise to a number of financial risks: market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. Market risk includes foreign exchange risk, cash
flow and fair value interest rate risk and commodity price risk. The Group has in place risk management policies that seek to limit the adverse effects on
the financial performance. Derivative financial instruments, mainly forward foreign exchange contracts, are used to hedge risk exposure that arise in the
ordinary course of business.
Risk management policies have been set by the Board and are implemented by the central Treasury Department that receives regular reports from all
the operating companies to enable prompt identification of financial risks so that appropriate actions may be taken. The Treasury Department has a
policy and procedures manual that sets out specific guidelines to manage foreign exchange risks, interest rate risk, financial credit risk and liquidity risk
and the use of financial instruments to manage these. These disclosures should be read in conjunction with the financing and risk commentary in the
business review on pages 36 to 39.
a) Foreign exchange risk
The Group has transactional currency exposures arising from sales or purchases by operating subsidiaries in currencies other than the subsidiaries’
functional currency. These exposures are forecast on a quarterly basis by operating companies and are reported to the central Treasury Department.
Under the Group’s foreign exchange policy, such exposures are hedged on a reducing percentage basis over a number of forecast time horizons.
The Group has a significant investment in overseas operations. As a result, the sterling value of the Group’s balance sheet can be affected by
movements in exchange rates. The Group’s policy is to mitigate the effect of these translational currency exposures for major currencies (US dollar, euro
and yen) by hedging 70% to 90% of the net investment in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in their functional currencies, except
where significant adverse interest differentials or other factors would render the cost of such hedging activity uneconomic. This is achieved by
borrowing either directly or indirectly through the use of rolling annual forward foreign exchange contracts.
The main impact of foreign exchange risk on the Group’s results arises from the translation into sterling of the results of operations outside of the UK.
The Group's largest exposures are the euro and the US dollar where a 1% movement in the average rate impacts trading profit of subsidiaries and joint
ventures by £1.6 million and £0.7 million respectively.
Regarding financial instruments, the main operating profit (changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments) exposure arises from changes in the
US dollar and euro for derivative financial instruments held at fair value through profit and loss and the main exposure on equity arises from changes in
the euro, US dollar and yen for derivative financial instruments designated as net investment hedges. Annual Report 2007 GKN plc 99

b) Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to fair value interest rate risk on fixed rate borrowings and cash flow interest rate risk on variable rate net borrowings/funds. The
Group’s policy is to optimise interest cost in reported earnings and reduce volatility in the debt related element of the Group’s cost of capital. This policy
is achieved by maintaining a target range of fixed and floating rate debt for discrete annual periods, over a defined time horizon. The Group’s normal
policy is to require interest rates to be fixed for 30% to 70% of the level of underlying borrowings forecast to arise over a 12 month horizon. However,
this policy was suspended in December 2004 as it was deemed inappropriate given the absence of floating rate bank debt following the receipt of the
sale proceeds of GKN’s share in AgustaWestland. At 31 December 2007 89% (2006 – 91%) of the Group’s gross borrowings were subject to fixed
interest rates.
As at 31 December 2007 £147 million (2006–£188 million) was on deposit with various banks and in money market funds, of which £145 million (2006
–£163 million) was on deposit in the UK. A 1% change in interest rates would have a £1 million impact on net interest. This sensitivity impact has been
prepared by determining average floating interest rates and flexing these against average floating rate deposits and borrowings by major currency area
over the course of the year.
c) Credit risk
The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments. In terms of substance, and
consistent with the related balance sheet presentation, the Group considers it has two types of credit risk; operational and financial. Operational credit
risk relates to non-performance by customers in respect of trade receivables and by suppliers in respect of other receivables. Financial credit risk relates
to non-performance by banks and similar institutions in respect of cash and deposits and financial contracts, including forward foreign currency
contracts.
Operational
As tier one suppliers to automotive, off-highway and aerospace original equipment manufacturers the Group may have substantial amounts
outstanding with a single customer at any one time. The credit profiles of such original equipment manufacturers are available from credit rating
agencies. The failure of any such customer to honour its debts could materially impact the Group’s results. However, there are many advantages in
these relationships. In certain parts of the Group, mainly Industrial Distribution Services within Driveline and OffHighway there are a greater proportion
of amounts receivable from small and medium sized customers.
Credit risk and customer relationships are managed at a number of levels within the Group. At a subsidiary level documented credit control reviews are
required to be held at least every month. The scope of these reviews includes amounts overdue and credit limits. At a divisional level debtor ratios,
overdue accounts and overall performance is reviewed regularly. Provisions for doubtful debts are determined at these levels based upon the
customer's ability to pay and other factors in the Group's relationship with the customer. As at 31 December 2007 41% (2006 – 44%) of trade
receivables arose from 10 customers. 100 GKN plc Annual Report 2007
Notes to the Financial Statements
continued
19 Financial risk management continued
The amount of trade receivables outstanding at the year end does not represent the maximum exposure to operational credit risk due to the normal
patterns of supply and payment over the course of a year. Based on management information collected as at month ends the maximum level of trade
receivables at any one point during the year was £650 million (2006–£611 million).
Financial
Credit risk is mitigated by the Group’s policy of only selecting counterparties with a strong investment graded long term credit rating, normally at least
AA– or equivalent, and assigning financial limits to individual counterparties.
The maximum exposure with a single bank for deposits is £25 million (2006–£40 million), whilst the maximum mark to market exposure for forward
foreign currency contracts at 31 December 2007 to a single bank was £3 million (2006–£6 million). The amounts on deposit at year end represent the
Group’s maximum exposure to financial credit risk with Group indebtedness varying over the course of a year in line with normal financing and trading
patterns.
d) Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders
and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain a capital structure which optimises the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders,
issue new shares or sell assets to reduce borrowings.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the ratio of Gross borrowings to EBITDA.
The Group seeks to operate at an EBITDA to Gross borrowings ratio of 2.5 times or less and the ratios at 31 December 2007 and 2006 were as follows:
2007 2006
£m £m
Gross borrowings 788 768
EBITDA 428 396
Gross borrowings to EBITDA ratio 1.8 times 1.9 times
e) Liquidity risk
The Group is exposed to liquidity risk as part of its normal financing and trading cycle at times when peak borrowings are required. Borrowings normally
peak in May and September following dividend and bond coupon payments. The Group’s policies are to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to
meet obligations when they fall due and to maintain sufficient flexibility in order to fund investment and acquisition objectives. Liquidity needs are
assessed through short and long term forecasts. Committed bank facilities of £350 million expire in July 2010 and were undrawn at the year end (2006 –
£350 million expiring in July 2010 and undrawn at the year end). Committed facilities are provided through ten banks.

Financial Statements
f) Commodity price risk
The Group is exposed to changes in commodity prices, particularly of metals, which has a significant impact on input costs and the overall financial
results. The Group seeks to mitigate this exposure in a variety of ways including medium term price agreements, surcharges and advance purchasing. In
rare circumstances and only in respect of certain specified risks, the Group uses derivative commodity hedging instruments. The impact of such financial
instruments in respect of the overall commodity price risk is not material.

Hedge accounting
Cash flow hedges
The Group manages exposure to foreign currency fluctuations on outstanding purchase and sale agreements using forward foreign currency contracts.
In 2007 the Group adopted transactional foreign exchange hedge accounting in a limited number of contracts. The value of forward foreign exchange
contracts subject to hedge accounting was £1 million asset (2006–£1 million asset). The net cash flows and profit impact will occur during 2008
(2006 – during 2007). A £1 million gain was recognised in equity during the year (2006–£1 million gain). An accumulated gain of £1 million was
removed from equity during the year and included in the income statement as a £1 million gain in Cost of Sales. Cash flow hedging was 100% effective
during 2007 and 2006.
Net investment hedging
See note 19. Net investment hedging was 100% effective during 2007 and 2006.

Restructuring
Restructuring provisions outstanding at 31 December 2007 relate primarily to the estimated future cash outflows in respect of redundancies and
onerous contracts (predominantly leases) arising from the Group’s strategic restructuring programme, details of the charges in respect of which are
included in note 3. Amounts are only set aside when irrevocable commitments exist at the balance sheet date and these invariably reflect actual or
constructive contractual arrangements which indicate the amount and most likely timing of flows.
Warranty
Provisions set aside for warranty exposures either relate to amounts provided systematically based on historical experience under contractual warranty
obligations attaching to the supply of goods or specific provisions created in respect of individual customer issues undergoing commercial resolution
and negotiation. In the event of a claim, settlement will be negotiated with the customer based on supply of replacement products and compensation
for the customer’s associated costs. Amounts set aside represent management’s best estimate of the likely settlement and the timing of any resolution
with the relevant customer.
Legal and environmental
Legal provisions amounting to £5 million (2006–£8 million) relate to management estimates of amounts required to settle or remove litigation actions
that have arisen in the normal course of business. Further details are not provided to avoid the potential of seriously prejudicing the Group’s stance in
law. Amounts unused and reversed only arise when the matter is formally settled or when a material change in the litigation action occurs where legal
advice confirms lower amounts need to be retained to cover the exposure.
As a consequence of primarily legacy activities, a small number of sites in the Group are subject to environmental remediation actions, which in all
cases are either agreed formally with relevant local and national authorities and agencies or represent management’s view of the likely outcome having
taken appropriate expert advice and following consultation with appropriate authorities and agencies. Amounts charged and carried reflect the current
best estimates of the likely cost of remediation and inherent timings.
Other
Other provisions include amounts set aside in terms of insurance provisions held within the Group's captive insurance company £8 million (2006 –£10
million), provisions held in respect of onerous loss making contracts £11 million (2006–£9 million), and long service non-pension and other employee
related obligations arising primarily in the Group’s continental European subsidiaries £15 million (2006–£12 million). Insurance provisions and charges
are established in accordance with external insurance and actuarial advice. The onerous loss making contract provisions relate to specific non-
cancellable contractual commitments where it is anticipated that unavoidable net operating losses will arise.
Vacant leasehold property provisions included in Restructuring and Other provisions above amount to £1 million (2006–£2 million). Annual Report 2007 GKN plc 103

Unrecognised deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in relation to certain taxable losses and other temporary differences on the basis that their future
economic benefit is uncertain. The gross and tax values of these unrecognised assets together with any expiry dates where relevant are shown below.
The tax value of the assets has been calculated using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.

Included above are tax losses of £677 million with a tax value of £109 million (2006–£732 million with a tax value of £111 million) that are severely
restricted for future use and management, based on the Group’s current profile, believes they are unlikely to be utilised in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets totalling £35 million (2006–£82 million) have been recognised relating to territories where tax losses have been incurred in the
year. It is anticipated that future profitability arising from restructuring and other actions will result in their realisation.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries except where the distribution of such profits is planned. If the
earnings were remitted in full, tax of £25 million (2006–£25 million) would be payable.
The UK Government announced the gradual abolition of industrial building allowances in the 2007 Budget. Since this change had not been
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, its effect is not included in the calculation of deferred tax as at 31 December 2007. The impact of this
change on the Group’s future tax rate is anticipated to be insignificant.

At the last Annual General Meeting, shareholder authority was obtained for the Company to purchase up to a maximum of 70.3 million of its own
ordinary shares (representing 10% of the issued share capital of the Company on 31 December 2006) for a period ending on the earlier of the next
Annual General Meeting or 3 August 2008, provided that certain conditions (relating to the purchase price) are met. The Notice of Annual General
Meeting proposes that shareholders approve a resolution updating and renewing this authority. Shares in the Company may also be purchased by the
GKN Employee’s Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) Trust.
At 31 December 2007 there were 38,659,142 ordinary shares of 50p each (nominal value £19.3 million (2006–£19.3 million)) held as treasury shares.
No shares were purchased in the open market during the year. In 2006 13,439,142 shares were purchase at a cost of £40 million including expenses.
These shares, which represented 5.2% (2006 – 5.2%) of the called up share capital at the end of the year, have not been cancelled but are held as
treasury shares and represent a deduction from shareholders’ equity.
During the year shares issued under the share option schemes generated £5 million (2006–£3 million). Annual Report 2007 GKN plc 105

25 Acquisitions
2007 Acquisitions
On 29 June 2007, the Group completed the acquisition of the Teleflex Aerospace Manufacturing Group (TAMG) of Teleflex Inc, in a mixed trade and asset
and legal entity deal, for a fair value consideration of £68 million. The businesses acquired provide manufacturing and engineering services from
operations in the US, Mexico, France and the UK.
The acquisition has been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting. Fair values on the acquisition remain provisional as the review of
acquired operations and assets remains ongoing.

Valuation of non-operating intangibles — methodology
The fair value exercise carried out in conjunction with a third party expert on the acquisition of TAMG considered the existence of the following
recognisable intangibles attributable to the business: in-process research & development (IPRD), non-compete covenants, marketing agreements,
distributor relationships, trade names, leasehold interests, software, proprietary technology and customer relationships/contracts.
No significant IPRD or marketing agreements were identified and accordingly no fair value was ascribed. TAMG transacts most of its business directly
with aerospace prime engine manufacturers, any revenue applicable to distributors is included within the customer relationship calculation. No trade
names were acquired in the transaction.
As part of the transaction the vendor covenanted not to compete on the products and processes of the business acquired for a period of three years.
Although the vendor still operates in the aerospace business it has retained no activities of a similar nature to those it disposed of. The costs of
recreating the specific technology and processes it disposed of would be significant. A fair value of £1 million was identified for the covenant not to
compete.
TAMG is a recognised market leader in the manufacture of complex engine components for the aerospace industry, thus giving the Group further
positions on a range of established engine programmes. The business has a range of both cold section products that are complementary to the Group’s
existing engine case and fan blade activities and hot section core activities in blisks, compressor airfoils and guide vanes. TAMG has manufacturing and
technological expertise in electrochemical machining (ECM), forging, multi axis milling and conventional milling. These capabilities are based on
developed ECM proprietary technology and milling know-how. The proprietary technology and know-how has been valued using a relief from royalty
methodology. The cash flow forecasts supporting this valuation reflect the future sales to be generated in conjunction with the technology. The fair
value attributed to proprietary technology represents the theoretical costs avoided by TAMG from not having to pay a licence fee for the technology.
The royalty rate used in the valuation was 3.0% for ECM and 2.0% for milling, which was based on a review of licence agreements for comparable
technologies in similar industrial segments. An after tax discount rate of 12.0% was applied to the forecast cash flows, a rate that reflects the higher
inherent risk of intangible cash flows compared to the weighted average cost of capital of the TAMG acquisition. Annual Report 2007 GKN plc 107
Financial Statements
The intangible assets inherent in TAMG’s customer relationships/contracts were valued using an excess earnings method. This methodology places a
value on the intangible as a function of (a) management’s estimate of the attrition rate on the expected cash flows arising from the contracts and
forecast cash flows likely to accrue to TAMG from its customer base; (b) expected cash flows arising from the intangibles; (c) discount rate reflective of
the risks inherent in the flows; and (d) an asset charge attributable to operating assets needed to generate the cash flows. The cash flows attributable
to customer relationships include an annual attrition rate of 5.0% to reflect expected decay in future revenues. An after tax discount rate of 14.0% was
applied to the forecast cash flows.
TAMG’s primary operations and centre of management are based in the US. The valuation of all intangibles reflects the tax benefit of amortisation,
which in the context of TAMG has meant a benefit assessed with reference to US tax laws. According to US tax law an intangible may be rateably
amortised over 15 years regardless of its actual useful life, as such, there is a tax benefit to an acquirer and hence values attributable to the intangible
assets have been recognised. This value amounts to £3 million across all the intangibles recognised.
The fair value of customer relationships/contracts recognised was £13 million and the fair value of ECM and milling know-how was £7 million.
Fair value adjustments on tangible fixed assets represent a net uplift on plant and equipment to fair values following an external third party appraisal.
The uplift primarily represents the restoration of asset values fully depreciated by TAMG. TAMG operates from owned and leased facilities. At leased
facilities the rentals are reflective of current market values and hence no fair value is attributable to TAMG’s interest in these leases. Inventories
acquired were assessed for scrap and obsolete items before being fair valued. Inventories acquired have been fair valued at current replacement cost
for raw materials and selling price, adjusted for costs of disposal and a selling margin, for finished goods and work-in-progress. The value of the fair
value inventory uplift was £1 million, the adjustment for scrap and obsolete items was £2 million. Provisions includes amounts in respect of onerous
contracts. Three contracts with two customers have been identified where the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under long term
agreements exceeds the economic inflow they generate. In assessing these contracts dedicated fixed assets have been impaired upon acquisition. Two
of the contracts identified are at an early stage and reflect the impact of contractually committed price downs. Unavoidable costs include direct labour
and material and a reasonable proportion of manufacturing overhead. Also included are the unavoidable costs of purchasing fixed assets dedicated to
these contracts and required as future volumes increase.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of TAMG is attributable to the anticipated future operating synergies from the combination with the Group’s
existing US Engine Products business, the value of the embedded workforce, the value of a significant manufacturer in the US engine component
market and the ownership and control of a leading business in an industry with substantial barriers to entry.
TAMG contributed £38 million to sales and £4 million to the Group’s trading profit for the period between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet
date. If the acquisition of TAMG had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group sales for the year would have increased by £72 million
and Group trading profit would have increased by £6 million. TAMG was acquired debt and cash free.
In the post-acquisition period TAMG contributed £4 million to cash generated from operations and absorbed £1 million in investing activities.
Prior year acquisitions
Finalisation of fair value adjustments in respect of the 2006 acquisitions of Stellex Aerostructures, Rockford Powertrain and Liuzhou Steel Rim Factory
(Liuzhou) were made in the year. As required under IFRS 3, amendments to provisional fair values have been shown as a prior period restatement. As a
consequence, and only in respect of Liuzhou, intangible fixed assets have been restated to recognise non-operating intangible assets arising on
business combinations of £1 million with an equal reduction in the value of goodwill. 108 GKN plc Annual Report 2007

Pensions and medical — funded
The Group’s pension arrangements comprise various defined benefit and defined contribution schemes throughout the world. A number of retirement
plans are operated which provide certain employees with post-employment medical benefits.
Pensions
In the UK, pension arrangements are made through an externally funded defined benefit scheme. In the USA and the Rest of the World there are a
number of externally funded defined benefit schemes while in certain companies in Europe funds are retained within the business to provide for post-
employment obligations.
(a) Defined benefit schemes — measurement and assumptions
Independent actuarial valuations of all major defined benefit scheme assets and liabilities were carried out at 31 December 2007. The present value of
the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and the past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.
Key assumptions were:

Inflation assumption 3.1 2.5 1.75 1.0
Rate of increases in medical costs:
initial/long term 8.0/4.5 10.0/5.0 n/a n/a
The underlying mortality assumptions for the major schemes are as follows:
United Kingdom
Such is the size and profile of the UK scheme that data on the scheme’s mortality experience is collected and reviewed annually. At the recent annual
review the age adjustment to PA92 (year of birth) was strengthened by 0.5 to 2.5 years to reflect actual scheme experience. Mortality assumptions were
strengthened further by moving to medium cohort projections. The key current year mortality assumptions for the scheme are that a male aged 65 lives
for a further 19.8 years, whilst a male aged 40 is expected to live a further 21 years after retiring at 65. The impact of this change in assumptions has
increased liabilities by £75 million.
Overseas
In the USA, CL2007 tables were adopted in 2007 whilst in Germany the RT2005-G tables were again used. In the USA the longevity assumption for a
male aged 65 is that he lives a further 18.8 years whilst in Germany for a further 17.7 years. The longevity assumption for a US male currently aged 40 is
that he also lives for a further 18.8 years once attaining 65 years, with the German equivalent assumption being 17.7 years. These assumptions are
based solely on the prescribed tables not on actual GKN experience. 110 GKN plc Annual Report 2007

Assumption sensitivity analysis
The impact of a one percentage point movement in the primary assumptions on the defined benefit net obligations as at 31 December 2007 is set
out below:
UK Americas Europe ROW
£m £m £m £m
Discount rate +1% 282 32 31 3
Discount rate -1% (346) (40) (39) (3)
Rate of inflation +1% (200) — (25) —
Rate of inflation -1% 180 — 22 —
Rate of increase in medical costs +1% (1) (1) n/a n/a
Rate of increase in medical costs -1% 11 n/a n/a
A one percentage point increase in the assumption on healthcare benefits would increase the total service and interest cost by £nil (2006 –£1 million)
and the liability by £2 million (2006 –£11 million). A one percentage point decrease in the assumption on healthcare benefits would reduce liabilities by
£2 million (2006–£9 million).

The past service credit of £7 million within operating profit (2006–£2 million charge) includes a £12 million credit from the impact of changes to retiree
medical benefits in the USA, partly offset by a past service charge of £5 million (2006–£2 million charge), £4 million of which is within Restructuring
and impairment charges (2006 – £nil) primarily from further downsizing of a UK business in the Automotive portfolio. The 2007 settlement/curtailments
credit arises from changes in pension regulations in Italy.

The expected return on plan assets is a blended average of projected long term returns for the various asset classes. Equity returns are developed
based on the selection of the equity risk premium above the risk-free rate which is measured in accordance with the yield on government bonds. Bond
returns are selected by reference to the yields on government and corporate debt as appropriate to the plan’s holdings of these instruments; all other
asset classes’ returns are determined by reference to current experience.
The actual return on plan assets was £165 million (2006–£185 million). Annual Report 2007 GKN plc 113

Auditors’ Report
Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of GKN plc
We have audited the Company financial statements of GKN plc for the year
ended 31 December 2007 which comprise the balance sheet and the
related notes. These Company financial statements have been prepared
under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the
information in the Directors’ remuneration report that is described as
having been audited.
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of GKN plc
for the year ended 31 December 2007 on page 69.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report, the
Directors’ remuneration report and the Company financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting
Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are
set out in the statement of Directors’ responsibilities on page 51.
Our responsibility is to audit the Company financial statements and the
part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited in accordance
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including the opinion,
has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in
accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other
purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this
report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Company financial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the Company financial
statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be
audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information
given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the Company financial
statements. The information given in the Directors’ report includes that
specific information presented in the business review that is cross
referred from the business review section of the Directors’ report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept
proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law
regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the annual report and consider
whether it is consistent with the audited Company financial statements.
The other information comprises only the Directors’ report, the unaudited
part of the Directors’ remuneration report, the Chairman’s statement, the
Chief Executive’s statement, the business review, the corporate
governance statement and the other information listed on the contents
page of the annual report. We consider the implications for our report if
we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the Company financial statements. Our
responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts
and disclosures in the Company financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the
Directors in the preparation of the Company financial statements, and of
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us
with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Company

Financial Statements
Notes on the Balance Sheet of GKN plc
Significant accounting policies and basis of preparation
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 1985. They have been prepared under the historical
cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and law. In accordance with FRS 1 (revised 1996) and FRS 8
the Company has taken advantage of the exemptions not to prepare a cash flow statement and not to disclose transactions with related parties. FRS 29
‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’ became effective from 1 January 2007. As the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with IFRS 7, the Company is exempt from the disclosure requirements of FRS 29. Other new accounting standards issued by the Accounting Standards
Board and effective from 1 January 2007 have had no impact on the accounts of the Company.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have been applied consistently in both years presented.
Investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Treasury shares
GKN shares which have been purchased and not cancelled are held as treasury shares and deducted from shareholders’ equity.
Share-based payments
Equity-settled share-based payments are measued at fair value at the date of grant. The Company has no employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments that are made available to employees of the Company’s subsidiaries are treated as increases in equity over the
vesting period of the award, with a corresponding increase in the Company’s investments in subsidiaries, based on an estimate of the number of shares
that will eventually vest.
Dividends
The annual final dividend is not provided for until approved at the Annual General Meeting whilst interim dividends are charged in the period they
are paid.
1 Profit and loss account
As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for the year. The profit
for the year ended 31 December 2007 was £162 million (2006–£124 million).
Auditors’ remuneration for audit services to the Company was £0.6 million (2006–£0.5 million).

holding companies, are shown on pages 120 and 121 of the Group financial statements.

calendar above.
GKN website and share price information

reports, results announcements and presentations together with the GKN
plc share price updated every 20 minutes, is available on GKN’s website at
www.gkn.com. The latest GKN share price is also available within the UK
from the Financial Times’ Cityline service by telephoning 0906 843 2696.
Calls are charged at 60p per minute.
Shareholding enquiries and information
Administrative enquiries relating to shareholdings should be addressed to
GKN’s registrar, Equiniti (see inside back cover). Correspondence should
refer to GKN plc and include the shareholder’s full name, address and, if
available, 8-digit reference number which can be found on GKN plc share
certificates.
By visiting Equiniti’s Shareview website at www.shareview.co.uk,
shareholders can view information on their shareholdings and recent
dividends, obtain guidance on transferring shares and receiving
shareholder documents electronically, update their personal details
(including changing address details) and set up a new dividend mandate
or change their existing mandate. Shareholders wishing to register for
Shareview will need their 8-digit reference number, which can be found on
GKN plc share certificates.
Share dealing service
A telephone dealing service has been arranged with Stocktrade which
provides a simple way of buying or selling GKN plc ordinary shares. Full
details can be obtained by telephoning 0845 601 0995 (+44 131 240 0414
from outside the UK) and quoting reference Low Co139.
Also, the Equiniti group offers Shareview Dealing, a service for UK
residents to buy or sell GKN plc ordinary shares on the internet or by
phone. Further details can be obtained from www.shareview.co.uk/dealing
or by telephoning 08456 037 037. Shareview Dealing is provided by
Equiniti Financial Services Ltd, which is authorised and regulated by the
UK Financial Services Authority. The registered details of the provider are
available from the above number.
Please note that the value of shares can fall and you may get back less
than you invest. If you are in any doubt about the suitability of an
investment, please consult a professional adviser.
GKN single company ISA
Equiniti operates a single company ISA in which GKN plc ordinary shares
can be held in a tax efficient manner. Full details and an application form
can be obtained by telephoning Equiniti’s ISA Helpline on 0871 384 2244
or by visiting the Shareview website (www.shareview.co.uk). Investors
should note that the value of any tax benefit will vary according to
individual circumstances and the tax rules relating to ISAs may change in
the future. If you are in any doubt you should seek professional advice.
GKN American Depositary Receipts
GKN has a sponsored Level 1 American Depositary Receipt (ADR)
programme for which The Bank of New York Mellon acts as Depositary.
Each ADR represents one GKN plc ordinary share. The ADRs trade in the
US over-the-counter (OTC) market under the symbol GKNLY. When
dividends are paid to shareholders, the Depositary converts such
dividends into US dollars, net of fees and expenses, and distributes the
net amount to ADR holders. For enquiries, The Bank of New York Mellon
can be contacted by telephone on +1-888-BNY-ADRS (toll-free for US
residents) or +1-212-815-3700 (for international residents), via their
website at www.adrbny.com or by email enquiry to
shareowners@bankofny.com.
Receipt of shareholder documents
Following an amendment to company law introduced by the Companies
Act 2006, and a subsequent amendment to the Company’s articles of
association approved by shareholders at the 2007 AGM, shareholder
documents are only sent in hard copy to those shareholders who have
made an election to receive documents in this form. (All shareholders,
regardless of any such elections, will continue to receive dividend
documentation in hard copy.) This allows the Company to reduce costs
and its impact on the environment. Shareholders who have not elected to
receive documents in hard copy will receive a letter at the time of their
publication advising that they are available electronically (usually on
GKN’s website) and how to access them. Annual Report 2007 GKN plc 123
Shareholder Information
Also, shareholders can elect to be notified of the publication of
documents by email. The email will contain a link to the relevant page on
the website, providing shareholders with easy access to the document
which can then be read or printed. By electing for this option,
shareholders will receive documents more speedily, avoiding the
possibilities of delays in the postal system. Shareholders who would like
to register for this option can do so via the GKN or Shareview websites
(see inside back cover) and will need to provide their 8-digit reference
number which can be found on GKN plc share certificates.
Unsolicited mail
GKN is obliged by law to make its share register publicly available and as
a consequence some shareholders may have received unsolicited mail. If
you wish to limit the amount of such mail you should contact the Mailing
Preference Service whose address is FREEPOST 29 LON20771, London
W1E 0ZT. Alternatively they may be contacted by telephone on 0845 703
4599, via their website at www.mpsonline.org.uk or by email addressed to
mps@dma.org.uk.

(a) The stated market values are used to allocate the base cost of GKN ordinary shares, on the
basis of the relative percentages specified, between GKN ordinary shares and ‘B’ shares and
between GKN ordinary shares and Brambles ordinary shares in calculating any CGT liability
under the ‘B’ share return of capital and the Industrial Services businesses demerger
arrangements. Worked examples and guides to the general tax position of United Kingdom
shareholders under these arrangements are given in the circulars dated 20 April 2000 and
22 June 2001 respectively, copies of which are available on GKN’s website and on request from
the Company.
(b) Being the first day of trading of the ‘B’ shares.
(c) Being the first day of trading of the Brambles ordinary shares. From this date, the market price
of GKN ordinary shares reduced to reflect the value of the businesses demerged into the
Brambles group.
(d) Adjusted for subsequent rights and capitalisation issues (prior to the issue of the ‘B’ shares on
30 May 2000) and the two for one GKN ordinary share split in May 1998.
(e) If the GKN ordinary shares in respect of which the ‘B’ shares/Brambles ordinary shares were
issued were held by you on 6 April 1965 or 31 March 1982, you will be deemed to have also
held the ‘B’ shares/Brambles ordinary shares on such date. In such cases, the 1965/1982
market values (adjusted as described in note (d)) are apportioned between GKN ordinary
shares and ‘B’ shares and, if you also received Brambles ordinary shares, between GKN
ordinary shares and Brambles ordinary shares using the relative percentages specified above
in respect of the first day of trading market values. The apportioned market values are shown
in the table.
(f) Following the unification of Brambles’ dual listed companies structure and with effect from 24
November 2006, outstanding Brambles Industries plc shares were exchanged for the same
number of shares in Brambles Ltd (Australia). Brambles Ltd shares are traded on the London
Stock Exchange as Brambles Ltd Crest Depositary Interests (CDIs). 124 GKN plc Annual Report 2007

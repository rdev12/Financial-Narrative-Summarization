Working in Partnership
with Atos Origin
Building on the success of the ﬁ eld engineering resource initiative in
place since 2007, Atos Origin selected Phoenix IT Services to deliver their

By combining both ﬁ eld and on-site engineering requirements under a single
partnership Atos Origin are able to drive efﬁ ciencies in service delivery and
preserve their excellent customer relations through improved customer 
experience. 
Ongoing efﬁ ciency beneﬁts are derived from Phoenix IT Services’ expertise

This helps Atos Origin to reduce the costs associated with on-site resource. To
ensure that this does not adversely affect the Customer’s overall quality of 
service experience, Atos Origin and Phoenix IT Services have identiﬁ ed areas
where engineers can be cross trained to maximise availability of technical skills 
and opportunities for utilising the Phoenix extensive ﬁ eld resource during
periods of increased call volumes. 
Phoenix IT Services has been supporting Atos Origin across a number of 
service areas for more than 6 years. This long-term relationship has enabled 
the two companies to develop an integrated approach to service delivery. 
The dedicated Phoenix IT Services call centre team, led by the Partner Services 
Manager, delivers ﬁ rst line support across all services to Atos Origin and
provides management information to help drive a continuous improvement 
approach.
This close working relationship between Phoenix IT Services and Atos Origin on
both an operational and Account Management level enables both organisations
to drive proﬁtable business growth without compromising the high quality
service delivery expected by Atos Origin’s customers.

Melton Borough Council
Waking up to ﬁnd head ofﬁce devastated overnight by ﬁre
Dealing with the aftermath of a ﬁre is a daunting and stressful time for any business or
organisation. When you have nearly 50,000 customers relying on you daily for essential
services the potential for disaster is even worse. For Melton Borough Council, waking up
to ﬁnd their head ofﬁce gutted by an early morning ﬁre, it was essential that they could
operate ‘business as normal’ as quickly and efﬁciently as possible – and with ICM Continuity
Services they achieved exactly that.
Essential Planning
Luckily for the residents of Melton Mowbray, Melton Borough Council was quick to 
turn to its business continuity supplier, ICM, to organise alternative accommodation 
for key staff and ensure downtime for the council would be as minimal as possible.
“As events unfolded throughout the morning we were in contact with the council and were
able to invoke the previously agreed business continuity strategy,” explained John Mills,
Service Director, ICM. “We had previously agreed with ofﬁcials at the council on the level of
resource they would need – things such as workstations, networked phone lines, internet access
and suchlike. What was also essential was our ability to provide a top-level facility – a factor
that paid dividends for the council as staff quickly found our East Midlands Business Continuity
Centre provided a home from home experience.”
For Lynn Aisbett, Chief Executive for the Council, this forward planning proved essential. “I
don’t want to think what we would have done should we not have planned for an eventuality
like this. When you are faced with suddenly losing your ofﬁces you have so many things to
do and people to organise you need the help of someone like ICM to absorb a huge part of
the stress – trusting them completely to have a new working premises ready for you straight
away.”
Moving on
With the building now repaired the council is moving back home. “Events such as these
really do bring home to us all the value of those Business Continuity planning strategy
meetings which, at the time, can seem too hypothetical,” says Lynn. “To anyone who doubts
the value of Business Continuity strategies or thinks events like a ﬁre will never happen to them,
you need to think again – without planning and a partner like ICM to be there the moment you
need them the potential for a drama turning into a business fatal crisis is just too risky.”

Baxi Group
A major European player in heating solutions
Baxi Group is a leading manufacturer and supplier of domestic and commercial water
and space heating systems and services. Employing more than 5,000 people and with a
turnover of £1.2 billion, the Group owns some of Europe’s leading brands in a market
worth over £5.5 billion a year.
In 2007 Baxi standardised its brand presentation, both in its national markets and in its use
of the internet as a marketing channel. Until this point, web usage had been fragmented
among different technologies and standards. Since Baxi’s e-marketing strategy is focused
on customer relationships, the Group needed to raise its proﬁle and underpin its status as a
major player in delivering energy-efﬁcient and environmentally friendly heating solutions.
To achieve its online goals, Baxi decided to host its entire UK and European web services on
a single platform. Acknowledging that its in-house team could not cost-effectively match
the quality of a specialist provider, the Group approached long-term IT partner Servo for a
hosting solution.
A committed strategic partnership
As Baxi’s strategic IT partner in the UK since 2002, Servo has provided a wide range of
hardware, software and networking solutions. The Company is committed to a desktop
replacement programme every three years, with full ongoing support for its client’s entire
UK array of desktops, laptops, servers, peripherals, switches and routers.
Complex relationships brought rapidly to fruition
Implemented within a fortnight of placing the order, the new hosting project involved
four key parties: Baxi Group, Servo, RedDot and Freestyle. Integral to success was
Servo’s tenacity in navigating the complex relationships between all parties. Using the
shared platform, Servo provisioned virtual servers in the hosting environment and
provided secure network access to all project partners. Advanced virtualisation features
guaranteed high availability through dynamic workload balancing and automated
resilience, ensuring continual adherence to a 24x7x365 SLA.
The result was a highly available, resilient and fully managed server platform for the RedDot
Web Content Management System and Baxi’s public-facing web servers hosted at Servo’s
data centre in Leeds.

reducedcostsviatheconsolidationofallGroupwebsitesintoasinglehostedenvironment.
Long-term commitment
“It was Servo’s ﬂexibility and commitment that ensured we launched our ﬁrst site on
schedule,” commented Baxi’s IT Development Manager Luke Vanhegan. It is this unfailing
responsiveness that differentiates a mid-market supplier such as Servo from larger players.
Servo understands the needs and goals of smaller enterprises, and builds long-term client
partnerships to support their ongoing demands.
Servo has the capability to manage and run systems either on 
client premises or provide a managed hosted solution on a national 
basis with T3 compliant data centres in Leeds, Birmingham and 
Farnborough. Whether running systems on or off our customers’ 
premises, Servo has a 24x7 help desk capability and a network 
monitoring team that provides extensive and ﬂ exible levels of
tailored support.
Servo’s scale and geographic coverage enables us to address clients 
across the UK in both the private and public sectors with solutions 
tailored to their individual requirements.

“THE GROUP REMAINS WELL PLACED
IN EACH OF ITS CHOSEN MARKETS
AND ENTERS THE NEW FINANCIAL
YEAR WITH A ROBUST ORDER BOOK
AND STRONG SALES PIPELINE.”
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Review of the Year
I am pleased to be able to report that Phoenix IT Group plc has 
continued to make good progress over the past year despite 
challenging trading conditions and a backdrop of economic 
slowdown. The Group has grown revenue and proﬁ t and this,
combined with improvements in working capital and cash 
management, has provided the base for further increases in 
shareholder value. 
Results
Group revenues increased by 9.7% to £253.2m (2008: £230.8m)
and operating proﬁ t before non-recurring items and
amortisation of acquired intangibles increased by 8.0% to 
£35.7m (2008: £33.0m). On a like-for-like basis, adjusting for
the effect of the timing of the ICM acquisition, revenue and 
operating proﬁ t increased by 3.8% and 3.1% respectively.
Excluding non-recurring items and amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 
to 26.3p (2008: 24.1p) and diluted earning per share were
14.2p (2008: 14.6p). Proﬁ t from operations (after amortisation
of acquired intangibles) decreased by 1.8% to £23.0m
(2008: £23.4m). The Group has continued to be cash generative 
during the year reducing its net debt (including ﬁ nance leases)
by £14.5m to £88.4m (2008: £102.9m).  
Dividend
The Board recommends a proposed ﬁ nal dividend of 4.2p per
share (2008: 3.65p) which, if approved at the Annual General 
Meeting, will be paid on 9 October 2009 to shareholders on the 
register at 18 September 2009. Combined with the interim 
dividend of 2.1p per share paid on 6 April 2009, this would make 
a total dividend per share of 6.3p (2008: 5.48p), an increase of 
15%. It is the Board’s current intention to increase future 
dividends broadly in line with earnings.
Board Changes
John Sussens, who joined the Board in 2004 as a Non-Executive 
Director, wished to cut back on his commitments and therefore 
stepped down from his role on 14 August 2008. Jeremy Stafford 
stepped down from the Board on 21 November 2008 and Nick 
Robinson returned to the role of Chief Executive. I would like to 
reiterate our thanks to John and Jeremy and we are grateful for 
their contributions to the Group. 
In addition to these changes, we have appointed two new 
Non-Executive Directors to the Board. David Garman joined the 
Board on 1 December 2008 and brings extensive Listed 
Company experience, including Associated British Foods plc, 
TDG plc and Carillion plc. David Warnock joined the Board on 
23 January 2009. He has long experience of the Investment 
Management industry, latterly at Aberforth Partners LLP. 
I am conﬁ dent that the experienced Board combined with a
strong and focused management team will continue to drive 
our business forward and further enhance our position in our 
chosen markets. 
Employees
This has been another year of good performance by the Group 
and these results have been delivered by our staff in a year 
overshadowed by a challenging economic environment. On 
behalf of the Board and the Shareholders I would like to thank 
all our staff for their hard work and support during the year and 
for delivering this successful performance.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be held at the Group’s 
registered ofﬁ ce, Technology House, Hunsbury Hill Avenue,
Northampton on Friday 31 July 2009 at 10.30 a.m.
Summary
The strategy of the Group has not changed and we continue
to focus on delivering proﬁ table organic growth, supported
by excellent service and a strong customer focus. With the 
integration programme now completed and ﬁ rmly behind
us, the Group remains well placed in each of its chosen markets 
and enters the new ﬁ nancial year with a robust order book
and strong sales pipeline. Our close relationships with our 
customers will allow the Group to gauge market conditions
and to take advantage of and gain new business where

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
 “THE GROUP CONTINUES TO HAVE
GOOD FORWARD VISIBILITY FROM ITS
ORDER BOOK AND HIGH LEVELS OF 
RECURRING REVENUES FROM A
DIVERSIFIED CUSTOMER BASE.”
Overview
I am pleased to report that in the past year Phoenix IT Group has 
developed into a larger, more resilient and competitive business
with three operating divisions focused on speciﬁ c sectors of
the UK IT services market. The integration of the Group’s most 
recent acquisition, ICM, together with our earlier acquisitions, 
Servo and NDR, was completed in the year and returns on our 
investment in additional business recovery and hosting facilities 
have underpinned our organic revenue growth and positioned 
the Group for future growth.
We have had a successful year ﬁnancially. For the year ended
31 March 2009 Group proﬁ t before tax (before non-recurring
items and amortisation of acquired intangibles) grew by 10.6% 
to £28.3m
(1)
 (2008: £25.5m) on Group revenues of £253.2m 
(2008: £230.8m), an increase of 9.7%. Cash generation was also 
strong enabling a reduction in net debt (including ﬁ nance
leases) of £14.5m to £88.4m (2008: £102.9m).
Factors helping to drive this growth and operational 
performance include: our ﬂ exibility and responsiveness to the
particular needs of our customers; operational precision and 
quality of service; the introduction of new and innovative 
services; and tight cost controls that help us quote competitively 
for new business in the markets in which we operate.
Strategy 
The Group’s strategy for increasing Shareholder value and 
accelerating growth by entering into IT outsourcing contracts 
and through the development of niche IT services, particularly 
business continuity and hosting, remains unchanged. We are 
conﬁ dent that we have the right strategy in place to deliver
value to our customers and shareholders. Each of our three 
operating divisions beneﬁ ts directly from being part of the
wider Group, leveraging our centres of excellence as well as 
giving opportunities to cross-sell between divisions and to sell
a wider portfolio of services to existing and prospective 
customers. In addition, as we plan for the longer-term growth
of the Group, we have established a strong modular structure 
which can be readily expanded with the addition of service lines 
and potential further acquisitions which meet our strict criteria. 
The Board believes that a continuing focus on the UK will 
maximise the performance of the Group for the foreseeable 
future and enhance shareholder value through securing 
proﬁ table, cash generative growth.
The markets the Group serves
With effect from 1 April 2008 the Group moved from ﬁ ve
operating businesses to three customer-facing divisions: ICM 
Continuous Business (Business Continuity) serving the Business 
Continuity and Disaster Recovery market; Phoenix IT Services 
(Partner Services), providing a full range of IT support services
to large Partner organisations; and Servo (Mid-Market) which 
serves the UK corporate and public sector mid-market. Where it 
is most cost-effective to do so, these divisions are supported by 
shared activities, operated as centres of excellence by the 
division best equipped to provide that function to the other 
operating divisions in the Group.
Phoenix continues to be well positioned in each of its chosen 
markets and has good forward visibility and resilience from its 
forward order book. Our spread of customers and penetration 
of more defensive sectors, such as the public sector, results in
a high level of recurring revenue derived from a diversiﬁ ed
customer base. In the year no contract was larger than 4% 
(2008: 4%) of Group revenue. As at 31 March 2009 the Group’s 
annualised contract value was £179.9m (2008: £182.0m) and
the values by sector were:

Integration process
As anticipated, we completed our integration programme 
during the year. The combination of the Phoenix businesses
and ICM resulted in a number of cost synergies together with 
cost savings arising from the increased buying power of the 
enlarged Group. We are also beginning to beneﬁ t from
cross-selling and collaborative working across the three 
customer facing divisions. In addition, the combination of 
Phoenix and ICM’s operations into larger units throughout the 
UK is providing improved operating efﬁ ciency from the greater
density of geographical coverage.
Changes to the economic background
The recession is affecting the markets in which we operate and 
the speed and scale of the general economic downturn has 
been greater than envisaged by some commentators. As a 
result, 2009 is likely to be a tough year for some participants in 
the IT sector. However, having taken early action, including a 
review of our cost base, the Group is well positioned to be able 
to withstand the recession and whilst the short-term outlook 
remains sensitive to recessionary inﬂ uences, the medium-term
prospects for growth in our markets are positive. 
There is an ongoing need for our customers to invest in
IT services, particularly the outsourcing of IT functions, to 
maintain and improve their competitive positions. The 
investments we have made during the year combined with the 
removal of duplicated activities through the integration means 
we are well positioned in the more difﬁ cult economic climate.
Each of our three customer-facing divisions is appropriately 
structured and resourced for the less favourable market 
conditions anticipated for the remainder of 2009 and beyond. 
Actions have been taken to cut costs and maximise cash 
generation in order to mitigate any further downturn and 
protect the Group’s capital position whilst safeguarding the 
Group’s core strengths. The key actions we have taken to 
reduce costs and improve our working capital efﬁ ciency are:
Cost Reduction 
Action has been taken to reduce discretionary expenditure and 
to streamline ﬁ xed elements of cost such as central functions
and management structures. Regrettable but necessary 
decisions have been taken to reduce headcount across the 
Group and to cancel the Group’s annual salary review for 2009.
I have been encouraged by the positive way that our staff have 
adapted to these changes. In addition, we have imposed a 
disciplined approach to the use of subcontractors. We now have 
our cost base at the appropriate level for the current market, 
though we will continue to drive best value from our supplier 
relationships and through continuous improvement of our 
processes and productivity. We are also ready to take any 
additional action that becomes necessary in individual business 
units should demand conditions weaken further.
Working Capital Efﬁciency
We saw pressure on our working capital efﬁciency ratios during
the year as both suppliers and customers sought to conserve 
cash. However, net working capital reduced by £4.8m 
compared with 31 March 2008 which was largely due to a 
reduction in Days Sales Outstanding to 54 days (2008: 60 days). 
The actions we have taken to improve the efﬁ ciency of cash
collections from our customers are expected to have an 
enduring beneﬁ t to the Group’s working capital position.
Cash ﬂ ow and Capital Expenditure
The improvement in net debt was achieved despite signiﬁ cant
cash ﬂ ow pressures on some of our customers during the year.
The Group continues to be highly cash generative and
I am pleased to report that the Group’s net debt position
was reduced by £14.5m to £88.4m (2008: £102.9m). This was 
after continued signiﬁ cant investment in the asset base of
the Group to support future growth and non-recurring 
integration cash costs of £5.8m. The Group also repaid
£11.0m of the principal ﬁ ve year term loan in September 2008
and £3.3m drawn on the 364 day facility in February 2009, 
resulting in the cancellation of these elements of the
banking facilities.
Capital expenditure in the year was £15.5m (2008: £21.4m)
with signiﬁ cant investment in our hosting centres at the
existing Birstall and Farnborough sites and business continuity 
facilities at our Aston ofﬁ ces. There was also further investment
during the second half of the year to increase business

continuity and hosting capacity at our Wapping site. Following 
our investment programme in business recovery and hosting 
facilities, the Group now has sufﬁ cient capacity to support
anticipated growth in these two key growth areas for the 
current ﬁ nancial year. Consequently, planned capital
expenditure can be reduced in the new ﬁ nancial year and is
expected to be broadly sustainable at this reduced level for one 
to two years as we continue to invest selectively in capital 
projects on a sales-led basis where satisfactory investment 
returns can be achieved.

Revenues £51.2m £42.0m 22.0%
Proﬁ t from operations £13.0m £8.9m 47.1%
Operating margin 25.4% 21.1%
The formation of the Business Continuity division has created
a critical mass business providing a national network of 18 
business recovery centres geographically well placed in relation 
to our target customer groups, with each centre equipped to 
meet the speciﬁ c needs of our customers. The ICM acquisition
and integration has further strengthened the Group’s position 
in the UK business continuity services market, making the Group 
one of only four signiﬁ cant providers of these services in the UK.
Combining the ICM and NDR customer bases has given us the 
intended extensive penetration of both the large enterprise and 
SME sectors providing us with a solid platform for growth and the 
knowledge and expertise to accelerate business progress. This is 
reﬂ ected in the strong growth of both revenues and operating
proﬁ t during the year.
Revenues for the year were £51.2m (2008: £42.0m) and operating 
proﬁ t £13.0m (2008: £8.9m). On a pro forma basis assuming that
ICM had been acquired on the ﬁ rst day of the comparative
period, revenues have increased by 12.5% and operating proﬁ t
by 37.5%. 
Despite the impact of an increase in electricity costs during
the second half of the 2009 ﬁ nancial year, operating margins
have continued to improve as the division has increased the 
utilisation of its syndicated seats and expanded its hosting 
capacity. The utilisation rate for syndicated seats increased to 
47% at 31 March 2009 (31 March 2008: 42%).
During the year our contract with a large investment bank
was terminated when that bank ceased trading. Following the 
acquisition of the UK operations of the failed bank by another 
bank, the contract continued on amended terms with the new 
owner, a testimony to our responsiveness and the quality of 
service we provide. 
The Business Continuity order book increased by 6.2%
to £98.8m (2008: £93.1m) at 31 March 2009 representing
almost two years’ annual revenues and the division has a
strong pipeline of new business opportunities. As a result
of the economic downturn, contract renewal rates by value 
marginally decreased to 87% (2008: 89%) including the
net impact of the contract termination and replacement in 
respect of the large investment bank relationship referred
to earlier.
During the year further investment has been made to develop 
the hosting and business continuity facilities at the Aston 
ofﬁ ces, where the division is headquartered, to complete the
ﬁt-out of the Farnborough business continuity and hosting sites
and to provide additional hosting and business continuity 
capacity at our Wapping ofﬁ ces.

Revenue £105.5m £102.9m 2.5%
Proﬁ t from operations £16.1m £17.6m (9.1%)
Operating margin 15.3% 17.2%
The Partner Services business provides services to large 
commercial and public sector end users through ‘tier 1’ IT 
services companies (Partners). 
The strategy pursued in our Partner Services business is to 
provide a comprehensive range of IT services to Partner 
organisations to support their typically multi-year contracts 
with their end user customers. This approach is increasingly 
important in these changeable markets and the Partner model 
continues to have tremendous value with our customer base, 
particularly in an industry which is consolidating and becoming 
increasingly commoditised.
Against a market background of increased competition and 
commoditisation, and the short-term disruption resulting from 
the integration process, revenues for the year were £105.5m 
(2008: £102.9m) and operating proﬁ t £16.1m (2008: £17.6m).
Operating margin for the year was 15.3% (2008: 17.2%). 
On a pro forma basis excluding the revenues and operating 
proﬁ t of the Group’s French business, the Partner Services
division’s results were:

(2)  
Excluding revenues and proﬁ t of French operation disposed of during
the year.
Management believe the division’s margin is broadly sustainable
at this level. It is pleasing to note that the actions taken within the
division increased the operating margin in the second half of the
year to 15.4% compared to the weaker performance in the ﬁrst
six months when the margin was 15.2%.
The performance of the division, and in particular the decline
in operating margin, reﬂ ects not only difﬁcult market
conditions but also some additional costs incurred in relation
to the Group’s integration. These were necessary to ensure 
appropriate service levels to customers through the post-
integration period. Following the integration, service quality 
remains high and we continue to meet overall customer service 
level agreements. 
In the competitive market in which Phoenix IT Services operates, 
in the year there have been fewer large-scale multi-million 
pound, multi-year contract opportunities and consequently 
new business wins have been increasingly of a smaller size.
The uncertainty resulting from the economic downturn has
also increased the average time new customers are taking to 
reach purchasing decisions and has resulted in certain 
Partners committing to shorter periods of minimum 
contracted revenues on contract renewals, contributing to a 
reduction in the division’s contract renewal rate by value to 
66% (2008: 86%). These factors have held back growth in the 
order book which reduced by £28.1m to £142.2m at 31 March 
2009 (2008: £170.3m). 
However, there continues to be a good pipeline of opportunities
and the depth of the recession should provide further business 
opportunities with Partners whose end user customers are 
seeking reductions in their cost bases to improve their 
competitive positions. 
During the year we sold our small French operation which 
delivered services to French IT industry Partners by seeking to 
replicate the UK Partner model. Revenues and operating proﬁ t
of the French business for the year ended 31 March 2009 were 
£1.6m (2008: £2.5m) and £0.2m (2008: £0.2m) respectively. This 
divestment improves our focus and reduces business risk. Whilst 
UK centric, the Group will continue to offer European services as 
an adjunct to UK business using third party providers.

Revenue £96.5m £85.9m 12.3%

Operating margin 10.4% 10.4%
This division sells a broad range of IT services and IT products to 
the Mid-market providing customers with a complementary 
and extensive range of services on a UK-wide basis. Year-on-
year operating margins have been maintained with the division 
achieving increased margins of 10.7% in the second half of the 
year compared to 10.1% in the ﬁ rst half. This reﬂects an
improvement in Servo’s business mix, healthy new business 
generation and an increase in hosting revenues. A key objective 
for the Servo division is to extend its presence further in the 
Mid-market business sector as this represents a signiﬁ cant
growth opportunity for the Group.
Hosting revenues increased by 93.3% to £6.1m (2008: £3.1m).
Of the Annual Contract Value of £7.4m (2008: £4.2m) at
31 March 2009, 73% is derived from managed hosting. These 
high quality annuity contracts improve the visibility of future 
revenues and earnings within this division. Investment in 
hosting capacity has been made with further signiﬁ cant data
centre space commissioned during the latter part of 2008
in response to strong market demand for these services.
Revenues for the year were £96.5m (2008: £85.9m) and 
operating proﬁ t was £10.0m (2008: £9.0m). On a pro forma basis
assuming that ICM had been acquired on the ﬁ rst day of the
comparative period, revenues have increased by 1.1% and 
operating proﬁ t by 1.3%.
The Servo order book decreased by 1.4% to £45.9m (2008: 
£46.5m) at 31 March 2009 reﬂ ecting the increase in time being
taken by some new customers to reach purchasing decisions 
and a decrease in the contract renewal rate to 87% (2008: 92%) 
by value which is a reﬂ ection of the current economic
background and some disruption during the integration to
a small number of customers. 
Outlook
With the continued deterioration of the UK economic climate 
this will be a challenging year for the sector. We are conﬁ dent
that we have taken the necessary steps, including a review of 
our cost base, to be ready for these challenges. The Group 
continues to have good forward visibility from its order book 
and high levels of recurring revenues from a diversiﬁ ed
customer base. 
We have achieved good momentum into the new ﬁnancial
year and remain well positioned in each of our chosen
markets. In spite of continuing macroeconomic uncertainties, 
we remain positive about the outlook for the current year and 
beyond and are well placed to capture further opportunities 
and market share.

The Group has had a positive year with continuing revenue and

operating companies to three customer facing divisions and 
during a period of economic uncertainty and recession.

Revenues and Proﬁ ts
Revenues increased by 9.7% to £253.2m (2008: £230.8m). On a 
pro forma basis, assuming ICM had been acquired on the ﬁ rst
day of the comparative period, Group revenues grew by 3.8%. 
Revenues in all divisions increased in the year, with our Business 
Continuity division ICM performing particularly strongly with a 
pro forma 12.5% increase in revenues and a 37.5% increase in 
proﬁ t from operations

.
Proﬁ t from operations before non-recurring items and
amortisation of acquired intangibles increased by 8.0% to 
£35.7m
(1)
 (2008: £33.0m) despite the UK economy entering a 
period of recession. The economic downturn has led to some 
customers reducing or delaying their purchasing decisions and 
continuing margin pressure in the market for Partner Services. 
On a pro forma basis, assuming ICM had been acquired on the 
ﬁrst day of the comparative period, proﬁt from operations
before non-recurring items and amortisation of acquired 
intangibles increased by 3.1%.
Proﬁ t before tax before non-recurring items and amortisation
of acquired intangibles increased in the year by 10.6% to 
£28.3m

 (2008: £25.5m) and proﬁ t before tax increased by
0.6% to £15.6m (2008: £15.5m).
Earnings and Dividend
Adjusted diluted earnings per share excluding non-recurring 
items and amortisation of acquired intangible assets were 
26.3p

 (2008: 24.1p). Diluted earnings per share were 14.2p 
(2008: 14.6p). Comparable basic earnings per share were 14.7p 
(2008: 15.0p). A full analysis of the earnings per share calculation 
is set out in note 13.
A ﬁnal dividend of 4.20p per share is being recommended by
the Board, making a total of 6.30p per share for the year (2008: 
5.48p), an increase of 15.0%. The total dividend for the year is 
covered 2.3 (2008: 2.7) times by basic earnings per share and 
Shareholders’ funds at the end of the ﬁ nancial year were
£126.4m (2008: £120.3m). If approved by Shareholders at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting, the ﬁ nal dividend will
be paid on 9 October 2009 to Shareholders on the register on
18 September 2009.
Investment Income and Finance Costs
Net ﬁ nancing costs were £7.4m (2008: £7.9m) and net interest
cover was 6.7 (2008: 6.3) times.
The Group’s bank term debt carries a variable rate of interest 
linked to prevailing LIBOR rates. In order to provide a degree of 
certainty over the interest rate exposure on a proportion of the 
total debt, the Group entered into a 3 year interest rate swap on 
28 September 2007 at an interest rate of 5.78% plus applicable 
margin. As at 31 March 2009 £51.8m of debt carried this ﬁ xed
rate of interest. This will reduce to £42.0m for the period from 
1 October 2009 until 30 September 2010. The interest rate swap 
applies to 75% of the amortising balance of the principal term 
loan and the balance of the Group’s bank debt is unhedged.

Non-recurring Items
Including further impairment losses in respect of freehold 
properties held for resale, £9.3m (2008: £6.4m) of non-recurring 
items were incurred during the year, of which £5.7m relate to 
expenses arising from the integration of acquired businesses. In 
total the Group has incurred £11.2m of integration costs since 
the acquisition of ICM on 29 May 2007. Whilst the physical 
integration plan was completed during the autumn of 2008, 
additional costs were incurred in the second half of the year to 
ensure appropriate customer service levels were maintained 
during the immediate post-integration period and to ensure 
that divisional management structures remain fully aligned to 
business needs.
In response to the economic downturn in the UK the Group has 
undertaken a restructuring of some of its activities, together 
with a programme of headcount reduction. The total cost 
associated with these actions was £1.4m.
Non-recurring costs also include losses arising on the disposal of 
two non-core trading companies (as detailed further below), 
which in total amounted to £0.8m, and a further £1.4m of 
impairment losses in respect of freehold properties held for
resale at 31 March 2009. Of the total non-recurring costs, £5.8m 
of cash expenditure was incurred during the year.
The Group currently does not anticipate any further non-
recurring costs arising in the next ﬁ nancial year.
A full analysis of the non-recurring items is set out in note 7.
Taxation
The taxation charge was £4.6m (2008: £4.8m). The effective tax 
rate was 29.5%, down from 30.6% in the prior year as 
anticipated due to a change in the UK corporation tax rate from 
30% to 28% as of 1 April 2008. A full analysis of the tax charge 
for the year is set out in note 12.

Disposals
On 10 April 2008 the Group disposed of 100% of the ordinary 
share capital of ICM Business Solutions Limited to R Atherton 
and A Wilkinson. £0.5m of gross assets were disposed of and the 
transaction resulted in a loss on disposal of £0.4m. In addition, 
100% of the ordinary share capital of the Group’s French 
business, Phoenix Holding SA (and its wholly owned subsidiary 
Phoenix IT Services SA), was sold on 28 November 2008 to
P Sansade. £1.8m of gross assets were disposed of and the 
transaction resulted in a loss on disposal of £0.4m. The 
combined loss on disposal of £0.8m has been shown as a 
non-recurring cost, details of which are set out in note 7. 
Divesting of these businesses has improved the risk proﬁ le of
the Group and improved our core business focus in the UK.
Cash Flow
The Group has continued to be highly cash generative. 
Year-end net debt including ﬁnance leases of £16.0m
(2008: £13.0m) decreased to £88.4m (2008: £102.9m). Cash ﬂ ow
from operations was £45.8m (2008: £45.3m) and the Group 
remains conﬁ dent that it will continue to be a proﬁtable cash
generator and will continue to reduce net debt. Tight controls 
are exercised over the Group’s working capital and conversion 
of proﬁ t to cash. Cash generated by operations before £5.8m of
cash cost incurred in the year in respect of non-recurring items 
was £51.6m
(4)
 (2008: £49.6m) representing 144.7% of proﬁ t from
operations before non-recurring items and amortisation of 
intangible assets (2008: 150.1%).
Capital Expenditure
Capital expenditure during the year totalled £15.5m
(2008: £21.4m) which included further investment in hosting 
centres and the completion of the ﬁ t-out of the Farnborough
business continuity and hosting facility. Capital investments are 
subject to stringent levels of authorisation and clearly deﬁ ned
authority levels are in place throughout the Group. Whilst the 
nature of business continuity and the Group’s hosting activities 
are signiﬁ cantly more capital intensive than the other areas of
activity, additional capital expenditure is only incurred with 
clear visibility of the demand for the services that the Group can 
then provide. Following the signiﬁ cant capital investment of the
last two years, the Group is well invested. We will continue to 
invest in new facilities, particularly in hosting and business 
continuity where there is sales-led demand and where 
appropriate proﬁ t margins can be achieved. The level of
planned capital expenditure will further reduce in the new 
ﬁnancial year.
Borrowing Facilities and Liquidity
The Group has long-term bank borrowing facilities comprising a 
£99.0m syndicated credit facility provided by a group of core 
relationship banks in the form of a term loan (£69.0m) and a 
revolving credit facility (£30.0m). In addition, the Group has 
access to overdraft facilities of £10.0m giving total facilities of 
£109.0m at 31 March 2009. The term loan amortises over the 
next four ﬁ nancial years through to expiry on 27 May 2012 as
follows: £13.0m on 30 September 2009; £16.0m on 30 September 
2010; £16.0m on 30 September 2011; and with the balance of 
£24m being repayable on 27 May 2012. The revolving credit 
facility is available to the Group until 27 May 2012.
As at 31 March 2009 the Group had total bank borrowings 
(excluding ﬁ nance leases) of £72.4m consisting of the term loan
of £68.3m (net of unamortised loan issue costs), £10.0m drawn 
down on the revolving credit facility and £5.9m of cash and 
cash equivalents. This gave £36.6m of headroom against the 
Group’s banking facilities of £109m. This headroom, together 
with the proven cash generating capability of the Group, gives 
assurance that the operating cash requirements of the Group 
will continue to be met for the foreseeable future.
The Group’s borrowings are subject to usual general and 
ﬁnancial covenants and potential events of default set by the
lenders. Covenant compliance is measured semi-annually using 
ﬁnancial results prepared under International Financial
Reporting Standards issued and/or adopted by the 
International Accounting Standards Board. During the
12 month period to 31 March 2009 there were no breaches of 
covenants, and the Group comfortably achieved compliance 
with each ﬁ nancial covenant.

non-recurring cash ﬂ ows of £5.8m (2008: £4.3m).

Treasury
The Group operates within policies and guidelines approved by 
the Board using conventional ﬁ nancial instruments and
speciﬁ ed derivatives.
It is the Board’s preference to manage market risks without the 
use of derivatives but they are used where necessary and 
appropriate to reduce the levels of volatility to both income and 
equity. The use of derivatives is strictly controlled and they are 
not permitted to be used for speculative or trading purposes.
The Group’s main treasury risks relate to the availability of 
funds to meet its future requirements. The Group’s policy with 
respect to facilities is to ensure that these are sufﬁ cient to cover
the expected needs of the Group, having reﬂ ected the inherent
uncertainty of projections and forecasts. Whist the Group 
maintains uncommitted facilities to maintain short-term 
ﬂexibility its principal debt funding comprises committed bank
facilities which are detailed above.
Going Concern
From November 2008 the Financial Reporting Council, in the light
of the current economic conditions, has required all of the
disclosures regarding going concern and liquidity risk in
companies’ annual reports and accounts to be brought together
into a single section or to be cross-referenced by way of a note.
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and position are 
set out in the Chief Executive’s Review. The ﬁ nancial position
of the Group, its cash ﬂ ows, liquidity position and borrowing
facilities are described above. In addition, notes 18 and 19 to
the ﬁ nancial statements include: the Group’s objectives,
policies and processes for managing its capital; its ﬁ nancial
risk management objectives; details of its ﬁ nancial
instruments and hedging activities; and its exposure to credit 
and liquidity risk.
The Directors are currently of the opinion that the Group’s 
forecast and projections, taking account of reasonably possible 
changes in trading performance, show that the Group should 
be able to operate within its current borrowing facilities and 
comply with its banking covenants. A breach of one or more of 
the covenants could result in the Group’s debt becoming 
immediately repayable. Should a covenant breach become 
likely, there are several mitigating actions that the Group could 
take including: deferral of capital expenditure; seeking cost 
reductions; and entering into negotiations with debt providers 
which could result in higher ﬁ nancing costs. The Group has not
been required to seek any commitment from its banks to waive 
or amend any existing covenants and is not aware of any 
reason why its banking group would refuse to support such a 
request, subject to acceptable terms, were one to be made.
The Group is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
which arise as a result of the current economic environment. In 
determining that the Group is a going concern, these risks (the 
most signiﬁ cant of which are listed below) have been
considered by the Directors, who have determined that 
currently they do not represent a signiﬁ cant threat to the
Group. The most signiﬁ cant are:
l Whilst the Directors have considered reasonable changes in 
market conditions and competitive pressures, in the current 
environment a further signiﬁ cant downturn could impact
Group revenues and margins to a greater extent than they 
have currently envisaged.
l Liquidity risks are greater because of the difﬁ culties within
the banking sector. However, the Group currently has 
£109m of facilities subject to periodic amortisation until 
2012 that provide it with sufﬁ cient headroom for the
foreseeable future.
l Interest rate movements present a risk to the Group, 
although they are signiﬁ cantly reduced through the use of
an interest rate swap.
l Credit risk is heightened as a result of difﬁ culties that might
be faced by some of the Group’s customers in the current 
climate and also because of credit risks associated with 
other counterparties, such as banks, with which the Group 
has dealings.
l Following the acquisition of ICM, the Group has a deﬁned
beneﬁt pension scheme for certain former ICM employees,
which is now closed to new members. The scheme has an
accounting deﬁcit at 31 March 2009 of £1.1m (2008: £1.1m).
Deterioration in the scheme’s funding position together with
a requirement to make good a material deﬁcit in a short
timescale could adversely impact the Group’s liquidity.

continued
competition from low cost outsourcing centres, including 
offshore centres, and new or existing niche market participants 
whose costs may be lower. Increased competition could lead to 
the loss of market share, loss of material contracts, 
renegotiation of price levels or a general reduction in revenues 
of the Group.
Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”)
Proﬁ tability
The Group’s principal proﬁ tability KPIs are proﬁt from
operations before non-recurring items and amortisation of 
acquired intangibles
(1)
and adjusted diluted earnings per share
(3)
.
These measures increased in the year by 8.0% and 9.1% 
respectively to £35.7m and 26.3p (2008: £33.0m and 24.1p).
Operating margin
This represents the Group’s proﬁ t from operations before
non-recurring items and amortisation of acquired intangibles 
divided by Group revenues. For the year ended 31 March 2009, 
Group operating proﬁ t margin was 14.1% (2008: 14.3%).
Cash generated from operations
Strong control is exercised over the Group’s working capital 
and conversion of proﬁ t into cash. For the year ended
31 March 2009, cash generated from operations was £45.8m 
(2008: £45.3m). Cash generated by operations before
non-recurring cash ﬂ ows were £51.6m
(4)
 (2008: £49.6m) 
representing 144.7% of proﬁ t from operations before
non-recurring items and amortisation of intangible assets
(2008: 150.1%).
Order book
The order book reduced in the year by 7.9% to £286.9m
(2008: £311.5m). Volatility in the order book is to be expected 
due to the timing of large contract wins and contract renewals. 
However, there has been a relative scarcity over the year of 
multi-million pound, multi-year opportunities particularly in the 
Partner Services market and in response to the increased 
economic uncertainty, some Partners have responded by 
committing to minimum contracted forward orders for shorter 
periods. The economic uncertainty and downturn has also led 
to a general increase in the decision making timescale for new 
customers and a decrease in the contract renewal rate by value 
in each division, both of which have contributed to the decrease 
in the order book. Assuming that the French business had been 
disposed of at the start of the comparative period, the pro 
forma order book decreased to £286.9m (2008: £309.9m), a 
decrease of 7.4%. Of the total order book at 31 March 2009, 
£140.3m (48.9%) is expected to be recognised in revenues in
the new ﬁ nancial year.
The Directors have reviewed the Group’s future cash forecasts 
and revenue projections, which they believe are based on 
prudent market data and past experience and have formed a 
judgement that at the time of approving these ﬁ nancial
statements, based on those forecasts and projections, there is a 
reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
For this reason, the Directors continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the ﬁ nancial statements.
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
As a result of the contracted revenues in the order book, the 
Group has a high degree of forward visibility of its revenues 
over the next twelve months. Nonetheless, there are a number 
of potential risks and uncertainties, in addition to those noted 
above, which could have a material impact on the Group’s 
performance over the next ﬁ nancial year and which could
cause the Group’s actual results to materially deviate from 
historical and expected results.
Macroeconomic risk
Whilst the Group has not seen a downturn in activity, a 
prolonged period of recession for the UK economy increases 
the risk of this occurring. This risk has increased signiﬁ cantly
during 2008 and early 2009 and is likely to cause an increasing 
number of business failures in the UK and a lengthening of the 
decision-making cycle between prospect and contract. For 
Phoenix this risk is mitigated by the high proportion of 
long-term contracted annuity business and stringent 
management of working capital and cash.
Competitor risk
The IT services industry is highly competitive. Several 
competitors, including, in some cases, Phoenix’s partners, have 
longer operating histories, higher brand recognition and 
greater ﬁ nancial, technical, marketing, personnel and other
resources than the Group. The Group’s competitors have, and 
other potential competitors may have, well-established 
relationships with current and potential customers of the 
Group. As a result, these competitors may be able to respond 
more quickly to new or emerging technology and changes in 
customer requirements, or to devote greater resources to the 
development, promotion and sale of their services, than the 
Group. In addition, the Group may experience increased

Annual Contract Value
Primarily due to the effect of the disposal of the French business 
the Group’s Annualised Contract Value (ACV), which is a key 
measure of the proportion of high quality recurring revenue 
annuity based contracts, declined by £2.1m to £179.9m
(2008: £182.0m). On a pro forma basis, excluding the effect of 
disposals during the year, Group ACV was stable year on year at 
£179.9m (2008: £180.2m), with the Phoenix IT Services division’s 
ACV increasing to £85.4m (2008: £84.8m); ICM Continuous 
Business’s ACV increasing to £51.5m (2008: £50.3m); and 
Servo’s ACV reducing to £43.0m (2008: £45.1m) reﬂ ecting an

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
The Directors present their report together with the audited 
ﬁnancial statements for the Group and the Company for the
year ended 31 March 2009.
Principal Activity and Review of the Business
The Group’s principal activity is the provision of information 
technology and business continuity services. A review of the 
Group’s performance and future prospects is provided in the 
Chief Executive’s Review and the Financial Review.
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
The Group’s operations expose it to a variety of ﬁ nancial and
other risks, a review of which is provided in the Financial Review 
and note 19 to the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements.
Dividends
The Directors propose a ﬁ nal dividend of 4.2p per ordinary
share which, subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting, 
will be paid on 9 October 2009, to Shareholders on the register 
at 18 September 2009. The shares will go ex dividend on 
16 September 2009. The ﬁ nal dividend together with the interim
dividend of 2.1p per ordinary share paid in April 2009 makes 
a total dividend per ordinary share of 6.3p (2008: 5.48p), an 
increase of 15%.
Capital Structure
Details of the authorised and issued share capital, together with 
details of the movements in the Company’s issued share capital 
during the year, are shown in note 30. The Company has one 
class of ordinary shares which carry no right to ﬁ xed income.
Each share carries the right to one vote at the general meetings 
of the Company.
There are no speciﬁ c restrictions on the size of a holding nor
on the transfer of shares, which are both governed by the 
Company’s articles of association and prevailing legislation.
The Directors are not aware of any agreements between 
holders of the Company’s shares that may result in restrictions 
on the transfer of securities or on voting rights.
Details of employees share schemes are set out in note 39.
Shares held by the employee beneﬁ t trust do not attract any
payment of dividends nor do they have any voting rights 
attached to them.

share capital and all issued shares are fully paid.
The Directors have authority to allot the Company’s unissued 
ordinary shares (within the meaning of section 80 Companies 
Act 1985) up to an aggregate nominal amount of £249,965 
(being approximately one-third of the Company’s issued share 
capital at 14 May 2008) and the power to disapply pre-emption 
rights in respect of the allotment of shares (under Section 
95 Companies Act 1985) up to an aggregate nominal value

Directors’ Indemnities
The Company has made qualifying third party indemnity 
provisions for the beneﬁ t of its Directors which remain in force
at the date of this report.
Substantial Shareholders
As at 29 May 2009 the Company had been notiﬁ ed that the
following Shareholders had an interest of 3% or more in the 
issued ordinary share capital of the Company.
 Ordinary shares % of issued

Montanaro Group  2,481,602 3.30%
Employment Policy
As a progressive service organisation, employees at every 
level are critical to the Group and its future. Management and 
professional and technical expertise are the Group’s major 
assets. Investment in developing and retaining such skills is 
ongoing and well established, and is supported by use of in-
house and external training programmes.
The Board recognises the value of effective communication
and consultation with all employees and informing them of
the progress and policies of the Group. This is achieved
through formal and informal meetings, brieﬁ ng groups and
internal newsletters.
It is the Group’s policy to encourage the recruitment, training 
and development of disabled persons on the basis of their 
aptitude and ability, and the retention and retraining of 
employees who become disabled.
Consistent with the Group’s human resources policies, the 
Board encourages staff to identify with the ﬁ nancial success
of the business through the opportunity to acquire ordinary 
shares in the capital of the Company. Staff can participate in 
the ﬁ nancial prosperity of the Group through share ownership.
Employee incentive arrangements include a Performance Share 
Plan and Share Incentive Plan.
Payments to Suppliers
The Group’s operating companies determine terms and 
conditions of payment for the supply of capital and revenue 
items by agreement with suppliers. Payment is then made on 
these terms, subject to the terms and conditions being met by 
the suppliers. As at 31 March 2009, trade creditors of the Group 
were equivalent to 38 days (2008: 48 days (restated)) and in the 
Company 41 days (2008: 18 (restated)).
Charitable Donations
The total amount of charitable donations made during the year 
was £12,318 (2008: £31,994). The Group has a policy that it does 
not make political donations to, or incur political expenditure 
on behalf of, political parties or political organisations.
Going Concern
The Directors have considered detailed proﬁ t and cash ﬂow
forecasts and have a reasonable expectation that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue as an operational business for 
the foreseeable future. The ﬁ nancial statements have therefore
been prepared on a going concern basis.
Auditors
An ordinary resolution to reappoint Deloitte LLP as auditors 
of the Company is to be submitted to the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting
The notice of the Annual General Meeting to be held on 31 July 
2009 (together with explanatory notes) is sent to Shareholders 
with this annual report. The special business of the meeting 
includes the following resolutions:
Authority to Allot Shares (Resolution 10)
The Directors are seeking authority under Section 80 of 
the Companies Act 1985 (‘the Act’) to allot shares up to an 
aggregate nominal value of £250,490. This amount represents 
approximately one-third of the total ordinary share capital 
as at 29 May 2009. The authority will be in substitution for the 
previous authority taken at last year’s Annual General Meeting 
and will expire on the earlier of the conclusion of the next 
Annual General Meeting or 31 October 2010.
The Directors have no present intention to make any such issue 
of shares, other than in respect of shares that may be issued 
pursuant to the Company’s share option schemes, but 
consider it is desirable for them to be given this opportunity 
by Shareholders.
As at 29 May 2009, the Company held no treasury shares.
Disapplication of Pre-Emptive Rights (Resolution 11)
The Directors are seeking authority from Shareholders to allot 
ordinary shares for cash other than on a pre-emptive basis
(as required by Section 89 of the Act) in limited circumstances. 
The Directors recommend that Section 89 of the Act should 
not apply to any allotment of shares in connection with a 
rights issue, open offer or other pre-emptive offer in favour of 
Shareholders in accordance with normal practice in the UK, nor 
to an issue for cash of shares up to an aggregate nominal value 
of £37,573 which is equivalent to 5% of the Company’s issued 
share capital as at 29 May 2009. The authority sought will expire 
on the earlier of the conclusion of the next Annual General 
Meeting or 31 October 2010.

Authority to make Market Purchases of Shares (Resolution 12)
The Directors are seeking authority to make market purchases, 
pursuant to section 166 of the Act, of shares up to 3,757,356 
ordinary shares which is equivalent to 5% of the Company’s 
issued share capital as at 29 May 2009 on such terms and in 
such manner as the Directors may determine, provided that 
the amount paid for each share (exclusive of expenses) will not 
be more than 5% above the average middle market quotation 
for ordinary shares as derived from the Daily Ofﬁ cial List of the
London Stock Exchange plc for the ﬁ ve business days before the
date on which the contract for the purchase is made and in any 
event not less than 1p per ordinary share. The authority sought 
will expire on the earlier of the conclusion of the next Annual 
General Meeting or 31 October 2010.
The Directors have no present intention to make any such 
market purchases but consider it is desirable for them to be 
given this opportunity by Shareholders. The authority will only 
be exercised if to do so would result in an increase in earnings 
per share and is in the best interests of Shareholders generally.
As at 1 June 2009 there were a total of 2,562,901 options to 
subscribe for equity shares in the Company outstanding, 
representing 3.4% of the Company’s issued share capital. If the 
full authority sought by this resolution is used, this number of 
outstanding options would represent 3.2% of the Company’s 
issued share capital.
Authority to adopt new Articles of Association (Resolution 13)
The Directors are seeking authority to adopt new articles of 
association which will update the Company’s existing articles 
of association primarily to take account of changes in company 
law brought about by the Companies Act 2006 (the “2006 
Act”). The proposed new articles of association incorporate 
amendments to reﬂ ect the changes brought about by the
2006 Act which are either already in force or which are to come 
into effect on or before 1 October 2008. As the 2006 Act will 
not be fully in force until October 2009, it is not yet possible to 
fully reﬂ ect the 2006 Act changes. As such, it is anticipated that
Shareholders will be asked to approve further changes to the 
articles of association at the Annual General Meeting of the 
Company in 2009.
An explanation of the effect of the proposed amendments is 
set out in note 14 to the enclosed notice of Annual General 
Meeting. The proposed new articles of association, marked 
to show the changes to the existing articles of association 
proposed by resolution 13, are available for inspection as set out 
in note 13 to the enclosed notice of Annual General Meeting.
Notice of General Meetings (Resolution 14)
It is proposed that the Shareholders should approve the 
continued ability of the Company to hold general meetings 
(other than the Annual General Meeting) on 14 clear days’ 
notice. This resolution is required to reﬂ ect the proposed
implementation in August 2009 of the EU Shareholder Rights 
Directive (2007/36/EC). The regulation implementing this 
Directive will increase the notice period for general meetings of 
a company to 21 days unless the company has approval from 
its Shareholders by resolution in general meeting to call such 
meetings on 14 days’ notice.
The resolution is valid up to the next Annual General Meeting of 
the Company and so will need to be renewed annually.
The Board of the Company recommends that Shareholders 
vote in favour of the resolutions to be proposed at the Annual 
General Meeting and is of the opinion that they are in the best 
interests of security holders as a whole.
By order of the Board.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
The Board is committed to high standards of corporate 
governance and has sought to comply with the main and 
supporting principles of the Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance (the “Combined Code”) with due regard to the size 
and needs of the Company and with reference to best practice. 
The application of the principles of the Combined Code, in the 
composition and operation of the Board, the remuneration of 
the Directors, relations with Shareholders and procedures for 
ﬁnancial reporting and internal control are described below.
Statement of Compliance
The Directors consider that throughout the year ended
31 March 2009 the Company has complied with the principles 
set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code with the exception 
that for a period of time the three Board Committees were
not quorate. 
The Board of Directors
The Group is controlled by a Board of Directors which meets 
regularly and currently comprises 3 Executive Directors 
(including the Executive Chairman) and 3 Non-Executive 
Directors. The Non-Executive Directors are Brian Sellwood, who 
is the Senior Independent Director, David Garman and David 
Warnock. All the Non-Executive Directors are considered by
the Board to be independent of management and free from 
any business or other relationship which could materially 
interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.
The Non-Executive Directors regularly meet independently
of management.
The Chairman’s other main commitments are disclosed on 
page 20. The Chairman is responsible for leadership of the 
Board, ensuring its effectiveness and setting its agenda.
In advance of each meeting the Directors are provided with 
or have full and timely access to, information in relation to the 
matters to be discussed.
At Board meetings, the Directors receive presentations from 
the senior Executives on the implementation of the Company’s 
strategies and the Board receives regular updates on changes 
to the business, and legislative and regulatory environments.
The Board is responsible to the Shareholders for the proper 
management of the Group and for its system of corporate 
governance. It receives information on a monthly basis to 
enable it to review trading performance, forecasts and strategy 
and it has a schedule of matters speciﬁ cally reserved for its
decision. The most signiﬁ cant of these are:
l Changes to the structure, size and composition of the Board;
l Consideration of the independence of Non-Executive 
Directors;
l Review of management structure and senior management 
responsibilities;
l With the assistance of the Remuneration Committee, 
approval of remuneration policies across the Group;
l Approval of strategic plans, proﬁ t plans and budgets and
any material changes to them;
l Oversight of the Group’s operations ensuring competent 
and prudent management, sound planning, an adequate 
system of internal control and adequate accounting and 
other records;
l Final approval of annual accounts and accounting policies; 
l Approval of the dividend policy;
l Approval of the acquisition or disposal of subsidiaries and 
major investments and capital projects;
l Delegation of the Board’s powers and authorities, including 
the division of responsibilities between the Chairman and 
the Chief Executive and other Executive Directors; and
l Receiving reports on the views of the Company’s 
Shareholders.
Operational management of the Group is delegated to the 
Executive Chairman, the Chief Executive and the Chief
Financial Ofﬁ cer.
The Board receives a regular ﬂ ow of information to enable it
to discharge its duties, including a monthly report detailing 
current and forecasted trading results and treasury positions. 
It also receives regular updates on Shareholders’ views as 
part of the monthly report, and more formal brieﬁ ngs on
Shareholders’ views are given to the Board following the 
presentation of the Company’s interim and annual results. 
Board papers are generally distributed not less than 5 days in 
advance of the relevant meeting to allow the Directors fully to 
prepare for meetings, and minutes of committee meetings are 
circulated. The Board is kept fully informed of developments 
within the Company’s businesses through regular presentations 
by divisional management. Induction programmes for newly 
appointed Directors are devised to ensure that Directors spend 
time with divisional management and can visit operational sites. 
Procedures exist to allow the Directors to seek independent 
legal advice in respect of their duties at the Company’s expense 
where the circumstances are appropriate. All Directors have 
access to the Company Secretary who is a qualiﬁ ed Solicitor.
All Directors are required to submit themselves for re-election at 
regular intervals and at least every three years.
During the year the Board undertook an evaluation of its 
performance and that of its committees. Detailed 
questionnaires were used for the performance evaluation 
process. The Board concluded that overall the Board and its 
committees operated effectively. The performance of each of 
the Directors was evaluated while the Senior Independent 
Director evaluated the performance of the Chairman. The Board 
considered that the evaluation process was satisfactory and that 
the use of an external third party to assist in such evaluation was 
not necessary.

Committees of the Board
The following formally constituted Committees deal with 
speciﬁ c aspects of the Group’s affairs in accordance with their
written terms of reference, which have been reviewed in the 
light of the Combined Code and are available on request and 
on the Group’s website. The Company Secretary also acts as 
secretary to each Committee.
The Audit Committee’s purpose is to assist the Board in the 
discharge of its responsibilities for ﬁ nancial reporting and
corporate control and to provide a forum for reporting by the 
external Auditors. The Committee, chaired by Brian Sellwood 
who the Board consider to have recent and relevant ﬁ nancial
experience, comprises the independent Non-Executive Directors 
and meets at least three times a year.
A report on its activities is given on page 30.
The Remuneration Committee, which is chaired by David 
Garman and comprises the independent Non-Executive 
Directors, meets at least twice a year and additionally as 
required. It is responsible for reviewing remuneration 
arrangements for members of the Board, and all senior 
reports of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer, for
providing general guidance on aspects of remuneration policy 
throughout the Group and for the Group’s Share Incentive 
Plans. Hewitt New Bridge Street Consultants have been 
appointed by the Group to assist and advise the Remuneration 
Committee in the performance of its duties. Hewitt New Bridge 
Street Consultants do not provide any other service to the 
Group and are independent of the Group’s Auditors.
A report on its activities is given on pages 31 to 35.
The Nominations Committee is chaired by David Warnock 
and comprises the Non-Executive Directors. The Committee 
is responsible for effective succession planning and proposes 
candidates to the Board, having regard to the balance and 
structure of the Board. The Committee determines the terms of 
reference of new appointments and uses external advisers to 
identify suitable candidates. The process is for the Committee 
to interview each candidate with a view to preparing a shortlist 
for the Board, for further interviews to take place as appropriate 
and for the Chairman to consult with the Chief Executive 
and any external advisers before any appointment is made. 
Independent recruitment consultants were retained leading to 
the appointment of David Garman and David Warnock.
Attendance at meetings

Internal Control
The Board is responsible for establishing and maintaining the 
Group’s system of internal control. Internal control systems are 
designed to meet the particular needs of the Group and the 
risks to which it is exposed. By their nature, however, internal 
control systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can provide 
only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
Key elements of the internal control system are described
below. These have all been in place throughout the year and 
up to the date of this report and are considered and monitored 
regularly by the Board (and once during the year):
l Ongoing procedures to identify, evaluate and manage 
signiﬁ cant risks faced by the business in accordance
with the guidance of the Turnbull Committee on Internal 
Controls and procedures to monitor the control systems in 
place to reduce these risks to an acceptable level;
l Clearly deﬁ ned management structure and delegation
of authority to committees of the Board and the
Executive Directors;
l Clearly documented internal procedures set out in the 
Group’s ISO 9001 accredited quality manual;
l High recruitment standards and formal career 
development and training to ensure the integrity and 
competence of staff;
l Regular and comprehensive information provided to 
management, covering ﬁ nancial performance and key
performance indicators, including non-ﬁ nancial measures;
l A detailed budgeting process covering budgets for the 
coming year which are approved by the Board;
l Procedures for the approval of capital expenditure, 
investments and acquisitions;
l Monthly monitoring and reforecasting of results 
against budget, with major variances followed up and 
management action taken where appropriate;
l Regular internal audits of key processes and procedures 
under the Group’s ISO 9001 accredited quality assurance 
process; and
l Formal consideration of progress made against signiﬁ cant
business risks at monthly operating board meetings, with 
quarterly brieﬁ ngs to the Board.
The Board, with the assistance of the Audit Committee, is 
responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s 
systems of internal control. During the year, the Board has 
reviewed the effectiveness of the systems of internal control 
and risk management based on a review of signiﬁ cant risks
identiﬁ ed and the results of quality and other reports from
management. Following the review the Board concluded 
that the systems were satisfactory and in accordance with 
the Turnbull guidance. The Board seeks to ensure that steps 
continue to be taken to try to embed internal control and 
risk management further into the operations of the Group’s 
business and to deal with any areas of improvement which 
come to its attention.
Whistleblowing: The Group’s Whistleblowing Policy allows 
employees, in conﬁ dence, to raise concerns about possible
improprieties including, in ﬁ nancial reporting, other
operational matters or inappropriate personal behaviour in
the workplace. 
The Internal Audit function is described in the Audit
Committee Report.
Auditor Independence
The Company has a formal policy designed to ensure that 
the Auditor’s independence is not compromised by their 
undertaking inappropriate non-audit work. All signiﬁ cant non-
audit work commissioned from the external Auditor requires 
the Audit Committee’s formal approval. The external Auditor 
is only selected to undertake non-audit work where the nature 
of the advice makes it more timely and cost-effective to select 
advisers who already have a good understanding of the Group.
The Audit Committee has undertaken a review of the nature 
and amount of non-audit work undertaken by the external 
Auditors to satisfy itself that there is no effect on their 
independence. The split between audit and non-audit fees is 
shown in note 8 to the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements.
Going Concern
The Directors are satisﬁ ed that the Group has adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future, a period of not less than 12 months from the 
date of this report. For this reason, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the ﬁ nancial statements.

Communication with Shareholders
The Company values the views of its Shareholders and 
recognises their interests in the Group’s strategy and 
performance. It holds brieﬁ ngs with institutional fund
managers, analysts and other investors, primarily following 
the announcement of interim and preliminary results, as 
well as at other times during the year as may be appropriate. 
The Company’s programme of investor relations activities is 
designed to ensure that the investing community receives a 
balanced and consistent view of the Group’s performance. 
All Shareholders are welcome to attend the Annual General 
Meeting, at which the Board of Directors will be available to 
answer questions from Shareholders.
Provision D.1.1 of the Combined Code requires the Senior Non-
Executive Director to meet with major Shareholders. During the 
year, this requirement has been undertaken by the Chairman, 
who has met with a range of major Shareholders to discuss 
governance and strategy. The Senior Non-Executive Director 
has been available for all such meetings if requested. The views 
of major Shareholders are communicated to the Board as a 
whole by the Chairman. In addition, the Board receives reports 
from the Company’s broker twice a year that communicate 
feedback from major Shareholders. The Board also reviews 
analyst coverage of the Company every month.
Approved by the Board and signed on its behalf.

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the Parent 
Company financial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under 
company law the Directors must not approve the accounts 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the 
Company for that period. 
In preparing the Group financial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
l properly select and apply accounting policies;
l present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
l provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable 
users to understand the impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on the entity’s financial 
position and financial performance; and
l make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern.
In preparing the Parent Company financial statements, the 
Directors are required to:
l select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
l make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
l state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have 
been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements; and
l prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the Company and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies 
Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
l the financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit 
or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in 
the consolidation taken as a whole; and
l the management report, which is incorporated into the 
Directors’ report, includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of 
the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
By order of the Board.

Compliance with Directors’ Remuneration Report 
Regulations
The Directors Remuneration Report has been prepared 
by the Remuneration Committee and approved by the 
Board. It has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 
7A to the Companies Act 1985 and also meets the relevant 
requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services 
Authority and describes how the Board has applied the 
principals relating to Directors’ remuneration in the 
Combined Code. 
A resolution to approve the report will be proposed at 
the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the 
ﬁnancial statements will be approved.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee members are appointed by 
the Board. During the year John Sussens, Nick Robinson, 
Brian Sellwood, David Garman and David Warnock all 
served on the Remuneration Committee. 
On 14 August 2008 John Sussens stepped down as a 
Non-Executive Director of the Company and thus as 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and was 
temporarily replaced as Chairman by Brian Sellwood. 
Since 1 December 2008, David Garman has held the role 
of Remuneration Committee Chairman. On 21 November 
2008 Nick Robinson resigned from the Committee on his 
appointment to Chief Executive and on 23 January 2009 
David Warnock became a member of the Committee.
The Committee is responsible for determining the 
framework and broad policy for the remuneration of the 
Executive Directors (including the Executive Chairman) 
and their senior direct reports as designated and makes 
recommendations thereon to the Board within agreed 
terms of reference. The terms of reference of the 
Remuneration Committee are available on request from 
the Company Secretary. 
The Remuneration Committee is able to obtain independent 
professional advice from remuneration and other consultants 
in order to carry out its duties. During the year, executive 
remuneration advice was received from Hewitt New Bridge 
Street who did not provide any other services to the Company 
during the course of the year. 
Remuneration Policy
The Group’s remuneration policy on Executive Directors’ 
remuneration is to provide appropriate incentives to encourage 
enhanced performance and to reward contributions to the 
success of the Group in a fair and responsible manner.
In order to achieve this, remuneration packages comprise 
a ﬁxed element made up of basic salary, beneﬁts in kind
and pensions and a variable “at risk” element which reﬂ ects
Group performance and individual achievement made up 
of annual performance related bonus and participation in a 
Performance Share Plan. The performance related element
forms a signiﬁ cant proportion of the total Executive Directors’
remuneration packages.
The Group’s remuneration policy in relation to Non-Executive 
Directors is to pay annual fees to reﬂ ect responsibilities and
duties which are determined by the Executive Directors of the 
Board. 
Directors are not involved in decisions about their own 
remuneration.
In determining the remuneration of Executive Directors 
and other senior Executives, the Committee also takes into 
account the general level of remuneration and pay awards to 
employees of the Group.
Directors’ Contracts
It is the Group’s policy that Executive Directors’ service contract 
notice periods should not normally exceed 12 months. The 
Company can pay salary, contractual beneﬁ ts and bonus in lieu
of notice. Non-Executive Directors have 3 month notice periods.

Jeremy Stafford is entitled to 12 month’s notice of termination 
of his contract of employment which will expire on 20 November
2009. During this period of notice he remains entitled to salary 
and contractual beneﬁ ts.
Individual components of remuneration packages are discussed 
below.
Basic Salary 
Salaries are reviewed annually with changes effected from
1 April. The current base salaries of the executive Directors as at 
1 April 2009 are:
Peter Bertram £250,000
Nick Robinson £275,000
David Simpson £225,000
Basic salaries are determined taking account of advice received 
from independent sources on the rates of salary for similar roles 
in selected groups of comparable companies and reﬂ ecting
the individual’s experience and role within the business. The 
Committee’s policy is to pay salaries at around the market 
median level against other comparable companies.
Basic salary only is pensionable.
Beneﬁ ts in Kind
In addition to basic salary, the Executive Directors receive 
certain beneﬁ ts such as a company car (or equivalent
allowance), life assurance and private medical insurance.
Pension Arrangements
The Executive Directors are entitled to receive personal pension 
contributions of 20% of basic salary, or salary in lieu.
Annual Bonuses
Two Executive Directors, David Simpson and Jeremy Stafford,
participated in the Group’s annual bonus scheme during the 
year to 31 March 2009. 
The annual bonus performance targets are set and approved 
annually by the Remuneration Committee and are designed to 
be challenging and aligned to Company goals and objectives. 
For the year ended 31 March 2009, bonus entitlements were 
calculated by reference to stretching performance targets set in 
relation to proﬁ tability.
The maximum potential bonus level for the year ended
31 March 2009 was capped at 75% of basic salary for David 
Simpson and 100% for Jeremy Stafford. No bonuses were 
achieved in the year. 
For the forthcoming year, there will be no changes to the policy 
or in the key performance metric used. The maximum potential 
bonus level for the year ending 31 March 2010 is capped at 
75% of basic salary for David Simpson. Peter Bertram and Nick 
Robinson will not participate in the scheme for the year ending 
31 March 2010.

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
Performance Share Plan
The Group’s policy is to award share incentives under the 
Performance Share Plan to Executive Directors and senior
management in order to align their interests with those of 
the Group’s Shareholders. Of the Executive Directors, only 
David Simpson and Jeremy Stafford have participated in the 
Performance Share Plan during the ﬁnancial year.
The plan rules allow for awards of up to 175% of salary 
per annum to be made (and 400% of salary per annum in 
exceptional circumstances). The actual granted awards for the 
year ended 31 March 2009 were over 171,429 shares (150% of 
salary) for Jeremy Stafford and 66,939 shares (100% of salary) 
for David Simpson. 
For awards made in 2008 these will vest fully if the Group’s 
average annual earnings per share growth over the
3 years from grant (measured by reference to EPS in the year 
immediately prior to grant) exceeds 20% per annum and the 
executive is still employed by the Group. If the average annual 
growth is 5% per annum, the award will vest as to 20% of the 
maximum. If average annual earnings per share grow between 
5% and 20%, then the award will vest on a progressive scale. 
The award will not vest at all if average earnings per share 
growth is less than 5% per annum.
The Committee is considering the award levels and vesting 
criteria for the 2009 awards in the context of Phoenix’s 
circumstances and is in consultation with major investors in 
relation to future awards and criteria.  
Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
The Company operated a Share Incentive Plan in the year. 
Under the SIP, employees (including Executive Directors) are 
able to buy shares by deduction of up to £1,500 from their
pre-tax salary in each tax year or, if less, 10% of salary.
Performance Graph
The graph below shows Phoenix’s total Shareholder return 
performance compared to the FTSE Small Cap index, of which 
Phoenix is a constituent. The graph covers the period from the 
date of ﬂ otation to 31 March 2009 and the values show the share
price growth plus reinvested dividends from a hypothetical 
£100 holding of Ordinary Shares in Phoenix and in the index at 
the start of the period.
The FTSE Small Cap Index has been selected as a comparator 
because the Group believes it is the most meaningful market 
index of which the Company is a member.

between these points being on a progressive scale.
During the year to 31 March 2009, the Company’s share price varied between 129.0p and 346.5p and ended the year at 145.0p.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF PHOENIX IT GROUP plc
We have audited the Group ﬁnancial statements of Phoenix IT
Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2009 which comprise 
the consolidated statement of income, the consolidated 
statement of recognised income and expense, the consolidated 
balance sheet, the consolidated cash ﬂ ow statement and
the related notes 1 to 40. These Group ﬁ nancial statements
have been prepared under the accounting policies set out 
therein. We have also audited the information in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the Parent Company
ﬁnancial statements of Phoenix IT Group plc for the year ended
31 March 2009.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as 
a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies 
Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we 
might state to the Company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an Auditors’ report and for no 
other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do 
not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditor
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report,
the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Group ﬁnancial
statements in accordance with applicable law and International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European
Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group ﬁ nancial statements in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group
ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, whether the
Group ﬁ nancial statements have been properly prepared
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation and whether the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report described as having been audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the 
information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the 
Group ﬁ nancial statements.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not 
received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit, or if information speciﬁ ed by law regarding
Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement
reﬂ ects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of
the 2006 Combined Code speciﬁ ed for our review by the Listing
Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it 
does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s 
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or 
form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate 
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report
as described in the contents section and consider whether it 
is consistent with the audited Group ﬁ nancial statements. We
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of 
any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with 
the Group ﬁ nancial statements. Our responsibilities do not
extend to any further information outside the Annual Report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of
evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the Group
ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration
Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the
signiﬁcant estimates and judgements made by the Directors
in the preparation of the Group ﬁnancial statements, and of
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in 
order to provide us with sufﬁ cient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the Group ﬁ nancial statements and the part
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other 
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated 
the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in 
the Group ﬁ nancial statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
l the Group ﬁ nancial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2009 and of 
its proﬁ t for the year then ended;
l the Group ﬁ nancial statements have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; 
l the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report described 
as having been audited has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
l the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent 
with the Group ﬁ nancial statements.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs
As explained in note 3 to the Group ﬁ nancial statements, the
Group, in addition to complying with its legal obligation to 
comply with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, has 
also complied with the IFRSs as issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board.
In our opinion the Group ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair
view, in accordance with IFRSs, of the state of the Group’s affairs
as at 31 March 2009 and of its proﬁt for the year then ended.

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the year ended 31 March 2009
1. GENERAL INFORMATION
Phoenix IT Group plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985. The address of the 
registered ofﬁ ce is given on the inside back cover. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in
note 6 and in the Chief Executive’s review and ﬁ nancial review on pages 9 to 19.
These ﬁ nancial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in
which the Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 3.
2. ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED STANDARDS AND RESTATEMENTS
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the annual ﬁ nancial statements for the year ended 31 March 2008
except for the presentation of the income statement, which has been changed to show operating expenses by nature (in a note to 
the ﬁ nancial statements) rather than by function, as the Directors believe this presentation more appropriately reﬂects the costs of
the business. The effect of this restatement is presentational and does not impact revenue, proﬁ t from operations, proﬁt before tax
or proﬁ t for the period in the restated period. The operating expenses breakdown is included in note 8.
Lease incentive balances are being released to the income statement over the duration of the lease; therefore, an element of each
balance has been classiﬁ ed as amounts due in more than one year under the heading “other non-current liabilities”. The
comparatives at March 2008 have been reclassiﬁ ed to reﬂect this presentation to ensure consistency with the March 2009
incentives. This has resulted in a reclassiﬁ cation of £7.9m from trade and other payables due within one year at March 2008. This
reclassiﬁ cation has no impact on the income statement.
The following interpretations, issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee (IFRIC), are effective for the 
ﬁrst time in the current ﬁnancial year and have been adopted by the Group with no signiﬁcant impact on its consolidated results or 
ﬁnancial position:
l IFRIC12 — Service Concession Agreements (effective for annual accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008)
l IFRIC14 — IAS19 — The Limit on a Deﬁ ned Beneﬁt Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their interaction (effective for
annual accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008)
In addition, the Group has elected to adopt IAS23 (Revised) Borrowing costs in advance of its effective date for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2009. The principal change to the Standard, which was to eliminate the previously available option
to expense all borrowing costs as incurred, has meant that the Group has capitalised £0.2m (2008: £0.1m) of borrowing costs in 
accordance with the policies set out in note 3 that would have previously been expensed through the income statement during
the year.
At the date of authorisation of these ﬁ nancial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied
in these ﬁ nancial statements were in issue but not yet effective:
l IFRS1 ‘First time adoption of IFRS’ (amended) — effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009
l IFRS2 ‘Share-based payments’ (amended) — effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009
l IFRS3 ‘Business combinations’ (revised) — effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009
l IFRS5 ‘Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations’ (amended) — effective for accounting periods beginning 
on or after 1 July 2009
l IFRS7 ‘Financial instruments: disclosures’ (amended) — effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of accounting
The ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). The ﬁnancial
statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group ﬁ nancial
statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except where stated below. The principal accounting
policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements incorporate the ﬁnancial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the
Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 March each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the 
ﬁnancial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain beneﬁts from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets (including identiﬁ able intangible assets, excluding goodwill) and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a
subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the 
identiﬁ able net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are
included from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Discontinued operations and assets held for sale
Cash ﬂ ows and operations that relate to a major component of the business or geographical region that has been sold or is
classiﬁ ed as held for sale are shown separately from continuing operations.
Assets and businesses classiﬁ ed as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell. No
depreciation is charged on assets and businesses classiﬁ ed as held for sale.
Assets are classiﬁ ed as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through
continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale
in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a 
completed sale within one year from the date of classiﬁ cation.
Where an asset held for sale has not sold within one year, the asset may remain classiﬁ ed as held for sale provided that the delay is
caused by events or circumstances beyond the Group’s control and Management are still committed to the sale and the above 
criteria are still met.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the 
identiﬁ able assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually with cash generating units assessed by segment
(see note 15). Any impairment is recognised immediately in proﬁ t for the period and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the proﬁ t or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS as adopted by the European Union has been retained at the
previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP in
the year ended 31 March 1999 and earlier periods has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent 
proﬁ t or loss on disposal.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and
services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Product
Revenue is recognised when the signiﬁ cant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, usually on
delivery of goods.
Maintenance contracts
For ﬁ xed-fee maintenance contracts the revenue arising is spread evenly over the term of the contract. Costs incurred under these
contracts are charged to the income statement as they arise (typically these contracts are annual and costs arise evenly over the
contract term. If circumstances arise such that costs do not reasonably reﬂ ect performance, appropriate adjustments are made).
Other contract revenues
Other contract revenues are recorded according to the stage of completion of the contract by reference to the value of work 
performed.
The amount by which revenue differs from payments on account is shown under receivables as accrued income, or under payables 
as deferred revenue, as appropriate.
Provision is made for all anticipated contract losses as soon as they are identiﬁ ed.
Where a contract contains several service elements, the individual elements are accounted for separately at fair value.
Interest income
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, 
which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the ﬁ nancial asset to that asset’s
net carrying amount.
Dividend income
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the Shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established. 
Leasing
Assets held under ﬁ nance leases and hire purchase contracts are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at
the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the 
lessor is included in the balance sheet as a ﬁ nance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between ﬁnance charges and
reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges 
are charged directly against income.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Beneﬁ ts received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease 
term and discounted where material.
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the
transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated 
at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in
foreign currencies are translated at the rate prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Gains and losses arising on
retranslation are included in net proﬁ t or loss for the period.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the 
balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences 
arising, if any, are classiﬁ ed as equity and transferred to the Group’s proﬁt and loss reserve. Such translation differences will be
recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that
necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until
such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Retirement beneﬁ t costs
Deﬁ ned contribution pension schemes
The principal subsidiary undertakings contribute to a number of Group personal pension plans in respect of certain employees. 
These plans are deﬁ ned contribution plans and the annual charge to the income statement is the contributions payable in the year.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments 
in the balance sheet.
Deﬁ ned beneﬁt pension scheme
The Group operates a deﬁ ned beneﬁt funded pension scheme.
The costs of providing pensions under the deﬁ ned beneﬁt funded pension scheme are estimated on the basis of independent
actuarial advice, with full actuarial valuations carried out on a triennial basis, and updated at each balance sheet date.
The operating and ﬁ nance costs of the scheme are recognised separately within the statement of income. Actuarial gains and
losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur and are presented in the statement of recognised income and 
expense. 
The retirement beneﬁ t obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation as
adjusted for unrecognised past service costs, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Short-term employee beneﬁ ts
The cost of short-term accumulating balances is charged to the income statement over the period during which the entitlement is
earned, at an average pay rate plus social security costs. Differences between the entitlement earned and the entitlement actually 
paid is shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
Taxation
The tax currently payable is based on taxable proﬁ t for the year. Taxable proﬁt differs from net proﬁt as reported in the income
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items 
that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
in the ﬁ nancial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable proﬁt, and is accounted for using
the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and
deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁ ts will be available against which deductible
temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill 
or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects 
neither the tax proﬁ t nor the accounting proﬁt.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the
Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in 
the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer
probable that sufﬁ cient taxable proﬁts will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, 
in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Investments
Investments are included at cost less provisions for impairment.
Property, plant and equipment 
Land and buildings, ﬁ xtures and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and recognised impairment.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than freehold land, over their estimated useful lives, using the 
straight-line method, on the following bases:
Freehold buildings 50 years
Leasehold property Period of lease
Fixtures and equipment 2 to 5 years
Motor vehicles 4 years
Assets held under ﬁ nance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where
shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are measured initially at fair value and are amortised on a systematic basis over their estimated useful lives on the 
following bases:
Value of trade name 15 years
Customer contracts and relationships 6 to 10 years
Impairment policy
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of 
the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash ﬂows
that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset 
belongs. An intangible asset with an indeﬁ nite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that
the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
ﬂows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂects current market assessments of the time value 
of money and the risks speciﬁ c to the asset for which the estimates of future cash ﬂows have not been adjusted.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (or cash generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is immediately recognised
as an expense.
Where an impairment loss on assets, other than goodwill, subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash 
generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not 
exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash 
generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is immediately recognised as income.
Research and development
All expenditure on research and development activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Service stocks, other than consumable stocks, are systematically amortised over four years so as to reduce their value to nil at the 
end of the period. Consumable stocks are expensed as they are purchased.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and ﬁ nancial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for
estimated irrecoverable amounts. Estimated irrecoverable amounts are based on the ageing of the receivable balances and 
historical experience. Individual trade receivables are written off when management deems them not to be collectable.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, other short-term highly liquid investments that are 
readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insigniﬁ cant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classiﬁ ed according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Borrowings are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including premiums payable on 
settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis to the income statement using the effective 
interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in
which they arise.
Equity instruments are any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
Derivative ﬁ nancial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group uses derivative ﬁ nancial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge risks associated with interest rate ﬂuctuations.
Such derivative ﬁ nancial instruments are stated at fair value. The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined by reference to
market rates for similar instruments.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document from inception the relationship between the item 
being hedged and the hedging instrument. The Group is also required to document and demonstrate an assessment of the 
relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, which shows that the hedge will be highly effective on an 
ongoing basis. This effectiveness testing is performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.

16013 24/06/09 Proof 6
3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualiﬁ es
for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in 
equity until the highly probable forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net 
cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the consolidated statement of income for the period.
Cash ﬂ ow hedges
Changes in the effective portion of the fair value of derivative ﬁ nancial instruments that are designated as hedges of future cash
ﬂows are recognised directly in equity, and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of income where
relevant. If the cash ﬂ ow hedge of a ﬁrm commitment or forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-ﬁnancial asset or
liability, then, at the time it is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in 
equity are included in the initial measurement. For hedges that result in the recognition of a ﬁ nancial asset or liability, amounts
deferred in equity are recognised in the statement of income in the same period in which the hedged item affects net proﬁ t or loss.
Provisions
Provisions relate to the obligation to reinstate certain properties to their former condition at the end of their leases. Provisions are 
measured at management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are 
discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Non-recurring items
Non-recurring items are items of income or expenditure that, in management’s judgement, should be disclosed separately on the 
basis that they are material, either by their nature or their size. Such items are included within the income statement caption to 
which they relate, and are separately disclosed either in the notes to the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements or on the face of the
consolidated income statement.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS2 Share-based Payments. In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS2 has
been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at 
fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed 
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of options that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black–Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on 
management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations. 
Shares purchased through the employee beneﬁ t trust (EBT) are held at cost and are deducted from shareholders’ equity. The right
to a dividend on these shares has been waived.

4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
The preparation of the ﬁ nancial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Information about such judgements and estimation is
contained in the accounting policies or the notes to the accounts, and the key areas are summarised below.
Areas of judgement that have the most signiﬁ cant effect on the amounts recognised in the ﬁnancial statements are:
Non-recurring items
Non-recurring items are items of income or expenditure that, in management’s judgement, should be disclosed separately on
the basis that they are material, either by their nature or their size, to an understanding of the Group’s ﬁnancial performance and
signiﬁcantly distort the comparability of ﬁnancial performance between periods. Items of income or expense that are considered
by management for designation as non-recurring items include such items as: signiﬁcant restructuring; impairments of assets;
integration of acquired businesses; and gains and losses on disposals of non-current assets. Details of non-recurring items are included
in note 7.
Assets held for sale
Assets are classiﬁ ed as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through
continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate
sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a
completed sale within one year from the date of classiﬁ cation. However, an asset may remain in this categorisation for longer than
one year if it remains unsold due to events or circumstances beyond the Group’s control. In making this judgement, impairment 
losses of £1.4m (2008: £0.5m) have been reﬂ ected in the income statement as non-recurring items. Details of the losses are
disclosed in note 20.
Valuation of intangible assets and useful life
The Group has made assumptions in relation to the potential future cash ﬂ ows to be determined from separable intangible assets
acquired as part of business combinations. This assessment involves assumptions relating to potential future revenues, appropriate 
discount rates and the useful life of such assets. These assumptions impact the income statement over the useful life of the 
intangible asset. These assumptions are discussed further below. 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a signiﬁcant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities within the next ﬁ nancial year are:
Retirement beneﬁ ts
The Group operates a deﬁ ned beneﬁt pension scheme which has been accounted for in accordance with IAS19 — Employee
Beneﬁ ts. Application of IAS19 requires the exercise of judgement in relation to various assumptions including future pay rises in
excess of inﬂ ation, employer and pensioner demographics and the future expected returns on assets. Phoenix IT Group determines
the assumptions to be adopted in discussion with its actuaries, and believes these assumptions to be in line with UK practice 
generally, but the application of different assumptions could have a signiﬁ cant effect on the amounts reﬂected in the ﬁnancial
statements. Further details can be found in note 10.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
Determining whether goodwill and intangible assets have been impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash 
generating units to which they have been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash
ﬂows expected to arise from the cash generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. Details of the 
carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets are shown in notes 15 and 16 respectively.
Share-based payments
In valuing the share-based payments realised in the Group’s accounts, the Company has used the Black–Scholes calculation model,
which makes various assumptions on factors outside the Group’s control, such as share price volatility and risk-free interest rates. 
Details of the options and assumptions used in deriving the share-based payments are disclosed in note 39.
Dilapidation provisions
Dilapidation provisions have been derived on the basis of the most recent assessment of likely cost. Many of these obligations will
not arise for a number of years and the costs are difﬁ cult to predict accurately. In making these assessments, the Group has sought
the aid of independent experts where appropriate. The total provisions are disclosed in note 28.

Business continuity Provision of business continuity and IT disaster recovery services
SME IT services Provision of information technology services and systems
Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. 
Corporate costs relate to central Group costs, including ﬁ nance, legal and employee costs that are not directly attributable to the
operating segments. 
Inter-segment turnover has been eliminated.

10. RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES
Deﬁ ned contribution scheme
The Group operates a deﬁ ned contribution retirement beneﬁt scheme. The assets of this scheme are held separately from those of
the Group.
Pension costs for deﬁned contribution schemes are as follows:
2009 2008
 £m £m
Deﬁ ned contribution scheme 1.8 1.7
Deﬁ ned beneﬁt scheme
The Group operates a deﬁ ned beneﬁt scheme for certain of its employees. Under the scheme the employees are entitled to
retirement beneﬁ ts varying between 1.25% and 1.67% of ﬁnal salary, multiplied by number of years of pensionable service, on
attainment of a retirement age of 65. No other post-retirement beneﬁ ts are provided. The scheme is a funded scheme.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the scheme’s deﬁ ned beneﬁt obligation was carried out at 6 April 2006 and updated to
31 March 2009 by a qualiﬁ ed independent actuary for IAS19 purposes. The projected unit method was used in all valuations and
assets were taken into account using market values.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were:

 2009 2008
 £m £m
Equities 7.0 7.4
Bonds 4.3 4.7
Cash 0.2 –
11.5 12.1
The scheme assets do not include any of the Group’s own ﬁ nancial instruments, nor any property occupied or other assets used by
the Group.
The expected rate of return on the equities was determined by reference to long-term historic outperformance of this asset class
over bonds so a view was taken that it was appropriate to take a future return rate on equities of 7.20% (2008: 7.5%) p.a. The 
investment return in relation to these assets is variable and as such they are considered riskier investments. This results in ‘the 
equity risk premium’ which is included in the yield on the equity investment and compensates investors for the additional risk 
of holding this type of investment. There is signiﬁ cant uncertainty about the expected size of this risk premium and this risk is
managed by holding assets which are less risky in nature but have a corresponding lower return.
The expected rate of return on bonds was determined by taking a blend between the gross redemption yields on corporate and 
government bonds, which were the two types of bonds held within the scheme at 31 March 2009, resulting in a return rate on 
bonds of 5.40% (2008: 5.70%). The risk of default on these assets is considered to be small. 
The expected rate of return on cash was determined by reference to the level of bank base rate of 0.5% (2008: 5.25%) p.a.
The overall expected rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with how the plan assets are 
invested.
The actual return on scheme assets was a loss of £2.1m (2008: £0.4m).

At 31 March 2009 178.8
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units (CGUs) that are expected to 
beneﬁ t from that business combination. Before recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill has been
allocated as follows:
 2009 2008
 £m £m
Partner services business 21.7 21.7
Business continuity 79.9 82.8
SME IT services 77.2 70.1
178.8 174.6
The movement in allocation of goodwill to the CGUs is due to the revision of the provisional fair values in relation to the ICM
acquisition.
Impairment
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. The 
recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations and from time to time the Group may also obtain 
independent appraisals of fair values to determine recoverable amounts.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations based on 3 year ﬁ nancial forecasts approved
by the Directors, with year 1 extracted from a detailed ﬁ nancial budget and years 2–3 from the strategic plan. The main
assumptions within the forecast operating cash ﬂ ows include the Directors’ conservative estimates of revenue growth, future
proﬁ tability and ongoing levels of working capital and capital expenditure to support growth.
The key assumptions used in determining the value-in-use calculations are set out below and these assumptions have been revised
in the year in light of the current economic environment which has resulted in more conservative estimates about the future. 
Cash ﬂ ow projections
The Group prepares risk-adjusted cash ﬂ ow forecasts derived from the most recent annual ﬁnancial budgets and 3 year business
plans approved by the Directors with an extrapolation of these cash ﬂ ows beyond a 3 year horizon to perpetuity applying an
assumed annual growth rate of 2.25%. 
Discount rate
The Directors have used discount rates ranging from 10% to 12% (2008: 10% to 13%) which represents the Group pre-tax weighted 
average cost of capital adjusted for the risk proﬁ les of the individual CGUs.

15. GOODWILL continued
Growth rates
Growth rates are determined with reference to: current market conditions; external forecasts and historical trends for the Group’s 
key end markets. Cash ﬂ ow growth rates are derived from the Directors’ latest estimates of forecast revenues taking into
consideration past experience of operating margins achieved in the CGU. Historically, such forecasts have been reasonably 
accurate. To forecast beyond 3 years a long-term average growth rate of 2.25% has been used to calculate a terminal value.
The Directors have made the judgement that this long-term growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rate
for the industry. The terminal value represents the value of cash ﬂ ows beyond the third year to perpetuity. In the short-term
(up to 3 years) growth rates of between 0% and 12.3% have been used.
In assessing goodwill for impairment as at 31 March 2009, the Directors made use of the most recent detailed calculations of the
recoverable amount of the Group’s CGUs, prepared at 31 March 2009. Those calculations resulted in recoverable amounts 
exceeded the carrying values for each of the Group’s 3 CGUs, despite the weaker markets currently being experienced.
 
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions 
Whilst the Directors consider that their assumptions are realistic, it is possible that an impairment would be identiﬁ ed if any of the
above key assumptions were changed signiﬁ cantly. The Group’s impairment review is sensitive to a change in the key assumptions
used, most notably the discount rates. Based on the Group’s sensitivity analysis, an increase in the discount rate in any of the CGUs 
of 1.8% or a decrease in forecast cash ﬂ ows of 16.9% (in isolation) would not lead to an impairment.
Using a discounted cash ﬂ ow methodology necessarily involves making numerous estimates and assumptions regarding revenue
growth, operating margins, tax rates, appropriate discount rates, capital expenditure levels and working capital requirements. 
These estimates will likely differ from future actual results of operations and cash ﬂ ows, and it is possible that these differences
could be material. In addition, judgements are applied by the Directors in determining the level of cash generating units identiﬁed
for impairment testing and the criteria used to determine which assets should be aggregated. A difference in testing levels could 
affect whether an impairment is recorded and the extent of impairment loss. 
Changes in business activities or structure may also result in changes to the level of testing in future periods. Further, future events 
could cause the Group to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with a given operation 
have become impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material impact on the Group’s ﬁ nancial condition and results
of operations.

19. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of ﬁ nancial risks: market risk (including currency risk and interest rate risk), credit risk
and liquidity risk.
Funding and treasury risk management is carried out under a framework of policies and guidelines approved by the Board. The 
Board is responsible for regular review and monitoring of treasury activity and for approval of speciﬁ c transactions, the authority
of which may be delegated. The Group accounting function provides regular update reports of treasury activity to the Board of 
Directors. 
The Group does not enter into or trade ﬁ nancial instruments, including derivative ﬁnancial instruments, for speculative purposes.
Capital risk management
The Group seeks to match long-term assets with long-term funding and short-term assets with short-term funding. 
Equity, retained proﬁ ts and long term ﬁxed interest debt are used primarily to ﬁnance intangible assets and ﬁxed assets.
Short-term borrowings are required primarily to ﬁ nance current assets.
The Group capitalisation policy seeks to maintain a strong credit rating and an appropriate funding structure whilst safeguarding 
Group ability to continue as a going concern.
Market risk
(a) Foreign exchange risk
The Group publishes its consolidated ﬁ nancial statements in sterling but also conducts some business in foreign currencies, mainly
the US dollar and euro. As a result, it is subject to foreign exchange currency risk due to exchange rate movements, which will
affect the Group’s transaction costs. All foreign operations were disposed of during the year.
The Board periodically reviews the net exchange risk and implements strategies as appropriate. Due to the relative stability of the 
foreign currencies in which the Group deal and size of the foreign exchange transactions, the Group does not hedge the foreign 
exchange risk as the potential exposure is considered not to be material to the Group’s results.
The carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities at the reporting date are as 
follows:

19. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued
(b) Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both ﬁ xed and ﬂoating interest rates. The risk is
managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between ﬁ xed and ﬂoating rate borrowings and by the use of interest
rate swap contracts. These practices serve to reduce the volatility of the Group’s reported ﬁ nancial performance.
All borrowings before interest rate swaps are at variable rates. The table below sets out the carrying amount of borrowings that are 
exposed to interest rate risk after taking into account interest rate swaps:
 2009 2008
 £m £m
Fixed interest rate borrowings (note 25) 51.8 80.0
Floating interest rate borrowings (note 25) 27.2 23.3
Total borrowings 79.0 103.3
The contractual maturity of these borrowings can be found in the relevant notes shown above.
The Group holds an interest rate swap to hedge risks associated with interest rate ﬂ uctuations on variable rate the £51.8m term
loan (note 18) which matures on 30 September 2010. The interest rate swap settles on a quarterly basis. The rate was ﬁ xed at
5.78% based on 3 months LIBOR. The Group will settle the difference between the ﬁ xed and ﬂoating interest rate on a net basis.
The interest swap has been designated as a cash ﬂ ow hedge in order to reduce the Group’s cash ﬂow exposure resulting from the
variable interest rate on the term loan. The interest rate swaps and the interest payments on the loan occur simultaneously and the 
amount deferred in equity is recognised in proﬁ t or loss over the period that the ﬂoating rate interest payments on debt impact
proﬁ t or loss.
The quantitative disclosures relating to derivative ﬁ nancial instruments can be found in note 18.
Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in ﬁ nancial loss to the Group.
The Group monitors its credit exposures to its counterparties via their credit rating, where applicable, or through other publicly 
available ﬁ nancial information and its own trading records.
The Group does not have any signiﬁ cant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or group of counterparties having similar
characteristics. The Group deﬁ nes counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are connected entities. Concentration
of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited due to the Group’s customer base being large and unrelated. The credit 
risk on liquid funds and derivative ﬁ nancial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit rating
assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The carrying amounts of ﬁ nancial assets recorded in the ﬁnancial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the
Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk.
Liquidity risk
The Group manages its liquidity requirements by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities
by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash ﬂ ows. All borrowing is agreed and monitored by the Board of Directors. The
Group’s undrawn committed borrowing facilities are shown in note 25. The Group has a policy of pooling Group cash ﬂ ows in order
to maximise the return on surplus cash and also utilise cash within the Group. Surplus cash is placed on short-term deposits.
The following is an analysis of the contractual undiscounted cash ﬂ ows payable under ﬁnancial liabilities and derivative ﬁnancial
instruments as at the balance sheet date. The table includes both interest and principal cash ﬂ ows:

Floating rate interest has been estimated using a future interest rate curve as at 31 March. The cash ﬂ ow movements on the interest
rate swap are expected to affect the statement of income in the same period in which they occur. 
Sensitivity analysis
Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits and derivative ﬁ nancial instruments. The following
analysis, required by IFRS7, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being UK interest rates and the US 
dollar and euro to sterling exchange rate on the Group’s ﬁ nancial instruments.
The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of pension and other post-retirement 
beneﬁ ts obligations, provisions and on the non-ﬁnancial assets and liabilities of the overseas subsidiary.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of ﬁ xed to ﬂoating interest rates of the
debt and the derivative portfolio and the proportion of ﬁ nancial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis
of the hedge designations in place at 31 March 2009 and 31 March 2008, respectively. 
The following table shows the illustrative effect on the income statement and items that are recognised directly in equity that
would result from reasonably possible movements in changes in UK interest rates and in the US dollar and euro to sterling 
exchange rate, before the effects of tax.

20. NON-CURRENT ASSETS HELD FOR SALE
Assets held for sale of £3.4m (2008: £4.5m) consist of properties held in the business continuity segment, £nil (2008: £4.1m), and the 
SME IT services segment, £3.4m (2008: £0.4m). 
These assets were classed as held for sale at 31 March 2008. However due to market conditions outside of the Group’s control they 
remained unsold at 31 March 2009. Management are still committed to the sale of these assets, are actively marketing them and 
hope the sale will occur in the next ﬁ nancial year ended 31 March 2010.
An impairment loss of £1.4m has been recognised in the year on properties held for sale and reﬂ ects the difference between their
carrying value and their estimated fair value in the market less costs of sale.

Over 120 days 0.6 –
Total 6.4 2.5
Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited due to the Group’s customer base being large and 
unrelated. Due to this, the Directors believe there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the allowance for bad and 
doubtful debts.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value due to their
short maturities.

The other principal features of the Group’s borrowings are as follows:
l A loan of £69m. Repayments are annual in September and the loan expires in May 2012. The Company and certain subsidiaries 
(as guarantor) have entered into a composite guarantee in favour of Royal Bank of Scotland on account of the Company and 
certain subsidiaries (as principal). The loan carries an interest rate of 1.262% above LIBOR. The hedging terms relating to the
loan are discussed in note 19.

Weighted average share price £2.93 £4.01
Weighted average exercise price Nil Nil
Expected volatility 30% 30%
Expected life 4 years 4 years
Weighted average risk-free rate 5.22% 5.31%
Weighted average dividend yield 1.87% 1.19%
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous 6 months and 
by comparison with comparable companies. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best 
estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Other share-based plans
The Company introduced a Share Incentive Plan on ﬂ otation. All employees were entitled to apply for free shares up to a value of
£1,250 depending on their period of service. The Company issued 259,558 shares in connection with this award.
In addition, employees are able to buy shares by deduction from their pre-tax salary. Under the current SIP legislation this is
restricted to a maximum of £1,500 in each tax year or, if less, 10% of salary.
The Group recognised total income of £0.3m relating to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in 2009 (2008: expense
of £1.0m).

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF PHOENIX IT GROUP plc
We have audited the Parent Company ﬁnancial statements of
Phoenix IT Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2009 which 
comprise the Balance Sheet and the related notes 1 to 16. These 
Parent Company ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared
under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the Group ﬁnancial statements
of Phoenix IT Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2009 and 
on the information in the Directors’ remuneration report that is 
described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 
1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an Auditors’ report and for no other 
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual
Report and the Parent Company ﬁ nancial statements in
accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement
of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Parent Company ﬁ nancial
statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory 
requirements and International Standards on Auditing
(UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Parent
Company ﬁ nancial statements give a true and fair view
and whether the Parent Company ﬁ nancial statements have
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the 
Directors’ Report is consistent with the Parent Company 
ﬁnancial statements.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has 
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all 
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if 
information speciﬁ ed by law regarding Directors’ remuneration
and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report as
described in the contents section and consider whether it is
consistent with the audited Parent Company ﬁnancial
statements. We consider the implications for our report if we
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the Parent Company ﬁnancial statements.
Our responsibilities do not extend to any further information
outside the Annual Report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, 
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the 
Parent Company ﬁ nancial statements. It also includes an
assessment of the signiﬁ cant estimates and judgements made
by the Directors in the preparation of the Parent Company 
ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in 
order to provide us with sufﬁ cient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the Parent Company ﬁ nancial statements are
free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also 
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of 
information in the Parent Company ﬁ nancial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
l the Parent Company ﬁ nancial statements give a true and
fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state of the 
Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2009;
l the Parent Company ﬁ nancial statements have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
1985; and
l the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent 
with the Parent Company ﬁ nancial statements.

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended 31 March 2009
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Accounting convention
The ﬁ nancial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and have been prepared in accordance with the
applicable United Kingdom accounting standards. As permitted by the Companies Act 1985 the Company has not presented its 
own proﬁ t and loss account.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and the
preceding year.
Foreign currencies
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of transaction. Exchange 
differences are taken into account in arriving at the operating result. 
Group undertakings
Investments are included in the balance sheet at cost less any provision for permanent diminution in value.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classiﬁ ed according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans are recorded at the proceeds received, less any direct issue costs. Finance charges and direct issue
costs are accounted for on an accruals basis in proﬁ t and loss using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying
amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Share-based payments
The Company has applied the requirements of FRS20 ‘Share-based payments’. In accordance with the transitional provisions, FRS20 
has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are 
measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the 
estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Derivative ﬁ nancial instruments and hedge accounting
The Company uses derivative ﬁ nancial instruments to reduce exposure to interest rate movements. The Company does not hold or
issue derivative ﬁ nancial instruments for speculative purposes.
For an interest rate swap to be treated as a hedge, the instrument must be related to actual assets or liabilities or a probable
commitment and must change the nature of the interest rate by converting variable rate to ﬁ xed rate or vice versa. Interest
differentials under these swaps are recognised by adjusting new interest payable over the period of the contracts.
If an instrument ceases to be a hedge, for example because the underlying hedged position is eliminated, the instrument is marked 
to market and any resulting proﬁ t or loss recognised at that time.
2. STAFF COSTS
The Directors were the only employees during the period and they received all of their remuneration, as disclosed in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on page 34, from Phoenix IT Services Limited, a subsidiary entity.
3. PROFIT OF PARENT COMPANY
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the proﬁ t and loss account of the Parent Company is not presented as part
of these accounts. The Parent Company’s proﬁ t after tax for the ﬁnancial year amounted to £6.2m (2008: £1.0m).

Special Business
As special business, to consider and if thought ﬁ t pass the following resolutions which will be proposed as to resolution 10 as an

10. THAT, subject to and in accordance with Article 9.2 of the Company’s Articles of Association, the Directors be generally and 
unconditionally authorised in accordance with section 80 of the Companies Act 1985 (in substitution for any existing authority 
to allot relevant securities) to exercise all the powers of the Company to allot relevant securities (within the meaning of 
section 80 of the Companies Act 1985) up to a maximum nominal amount of £250,490 (being approximately one-third of the 
Company’s issued share capital as at 29 May 2009) provided that such authority shall expire on the conclusion of the Annual 
General Meeting of the Company to be held in 2010 or 31 October 2010, whichever is earlier, but so that the Company may 
before such expiry make an offer or agreement which would or might require relevant securities to be allotted after such 
expiry, and the Directors may allot relevant securities in pursuance of such offer or agreement as if the authority conferred by
this resolution had not expired.
11. THAT, subject to the passing of resolution 10 as set out in the notice of this meeting, and in accordance with Article 9.2 of the 
Company’s Articles of Association, the Directors be empowered pursuant to section 95 of the Companies Act 1985 to allot 
equity securities (as deﬁ ned in section 94 of the Companies Act 1985) for cash pursuant to the general authority conferred
by resolution 10 as set out in the notice of this meeting as if section 89(1) of the Companies Act 1985 did not apply to such 
allotment, provided that this power shall be limited to allotments of equity securities: 
(a) in connection with or pursuant to an offer by way of rights, open offer or other pre-emptive offer to the holders of 
shares in the Company and other persons entitled to participate therein in proportion (as nearly as practicable) to their 
respective holdings, subject to such exclusions or other arrangements as the Directors may consider necessary or expedient 
to deal with fractional entitlements or legal or practical problems under the laws of any territory or the regulations or 
requirements of any regulatory authority or any stock exchange in any territory; 
(b) otherwise than pursuant to sub-paragraph (a) above, up to an aggregate nominal amount of £37,573, which is equivalent 
to 5% of the Company’s issued share capital as at 29 May 2009.
and such power shall expire on the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held in 2010 or on
31 October 2010, whichever is earlier, but so that the Company may before such expiry make an offer or agreement which

the middle market quotation for the Company’s ordinary shares as derived from the Daily Ofﬁ cial List of London Stock
Exchange plc for the ﬁ ve business days before the date on which the contract for the purchase is made, and (2) an amount
equal to the higher of the price of the last independent trade and current independent bid as derived from the London

(b) the authority herein contained shall expire at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held in 2010
or on 31 October 2010, whichever is earlier, provided that the Company may, before such expiry, make a contract to purchase its

NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
continued
Notes:
1. Any member entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting is entitled to appoint one or more proxies (who need not be a member of the 
Company) to attend and, on a poll, to vote instead of the member. Completion and return of a form of proxy will not preclude a member from attending 
and voting at the meeting in person, should he subsequently decide to do so. A member can appoint more than one proxy in relation to the meeting, 
provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attaching to different shares held by him. 
2. Your proxy could be the Chairman, another Director of the Company or another person who has agreed to attend to represent you. Your proxy will vote
as you instruct and must attend the meeting for your vote to be counted. Details of how to appoint the Chairman or another person as your proxy using 
the proxy form are set out in the notes to the proxy form.
3. In order to be valid, any form of proxy and power of attorney or other authority under which it is signed, or a notarially certiﬁed or ofﬁce copy of such
power or authority, must reach the Company’s Registrars, Equiniti Ltd, Aspect House, Spencer Road, Lancing, BN99 6ZL not less than 48 hours before the 
time of the meeting or of any adjournment of the meeting. 
4. To change your proxy instructions you may return a new proxy appointment using the methods set out above. Where you have appointed a proxy using 
the hard copy proxy form and would like to change the instructions using another hard copy proxy form, please contact the Company’s Registrar (see 
note 3). The deadline for receipt of proxy appointments (see above) also applies in relation to amended instructions. Any attempt to terminate or amend 
a proxy appointment received after the relevant deadline will be disregarded. Where two or more valid separate appointments of proxy are received in 
respect of the same share in respect of the same meeting, the one which is last sent shall be treated as replacing and revoking the other or others.
5. CREST shareholders who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so by utilising the 
procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST Personal shareholders or other CREST sponsored shareholders, and those CREST shareholders who have 
appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on 
their behalf.
6. In order for a proxy appointment made by means of CREST to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a “CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be properly 
authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland’s speciﬁ cations and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in
the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously 
appointed proxy, must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID: RA19) by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy 
appointments speciﬁ ed in the notice of meeting. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp
applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner 
prescribed by CREST.
7. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertiﬁ cated Securities Regulations
2001.
8. CREST shareholders and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that Euroclear UK & Ireland does not make available
special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy
Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or
has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure
that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST shareholders and, where applicable, their CREST
sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and
timings.
9. As permitted by Regulation 41 of the Uncertiﬁ cated Securities Regulations 2001, shareholders who hold shares in uncertiﬁcated form must be entered on
the Company’s share register at 6.00 p.m. on 29 July 2009 in order to be entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting. Such shareholders may 
only cast votes in respect of shares held at such time. Changes to entries on the relevant register after that time shall be disregarded in determining the 
rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.
10. In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the meeting, arrangements will be put in place at the meeting so that (i) if a corporate 
shareholder has appointed the Chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative with instructions to vote on a poll in accordance with the 
directions of all of the other corporate representatives for that shareholder at the meeting, then on a poll those corporate representatives will give voting 
directions to the Chairman and the Chairman will vote (or withhold a vote) as corporate representative in accordance with those directions; and (ii) if 
more than one corporate representative for the same corporate shareholder attends the meeting but the corporate shareholder has not appointed the 
Chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative, a designated corporate representative will be nominated, from those corporate representatives 
who attend, who will vote on a poll and the other corporate representatives will give voting directions to that designated corporate representative. 
Corporate shareholders are referred to the guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators on proxies and corporate 
representatives – www.icsa.org.uk – for further details of this procedure. The guidance includes a sample form of representation letter if the Chairman is 
being appointed as described in (i) above.

11. The total number of ordinary shares of £0.01 in issue as at 26 June 2009, the last practicable day before printing this document was 75, 149, 139 ordinary 
shares and the total level of voting rights was 75, 149, 139, none of which were attached to shares held in treasury by the Company.
12. Shareholders satisfying the thresholds in section 527 of the Companies Act 2006 can require the Company to publish a statement on its website setting out 
any matter relating to:
12.1 the audit of the Company’s accounts (including the Auditor’s report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the meeting; or
12.2 any circumstances connected with an Auditor of the Company ceasing to hold ofﬁ ce since the last Annual General Meeting, that the shareholders
propose to raise at the meeting. 
The Company cannot require the Shareholders requesting the publication to pay its expenses. Any statement placed on the website must also be sent to 
the Company’s Auditor no later than the time it makes its statement available on the website.
The business which may be dealt with at the meeting includes any statement that the Company has been required to publish on its website.
13. Copies of the service contracts of each of the Directors and the new Articles of Association of the Company will be available for inspection at the registered 
ofﬁ ce of the Company during usual business hours on any weekday (Saturdays and public holidays excluded) from the date of this notice until the date 
of the Annual General Meeting and at the place of the annual general meeting from at least 15 minutes prior to and until the conclusion of the annual 
general meeting.
14. An explanation of the effect of the proposed amendments to the Company’s Articles of Association is set out below. 
Article 46 (old numbering) is being deleted and a new article 46 inserted to provide that any general meeting of the Company (other than an Annual 
General Meeting) can be called on 14 day’s clear notice and that in relation to the calling of a general meeting at less that 14 day’s notice, the meeting 
is deemed to have been properly called if the majority of shareholders (holding at least the minimum percentage in nominal value of the shares as 
prescribed by the 2006 Act at the time of the meeting) agree to the shorter notice. All references to “Extraordinary General Meetings” have been changed 
to “General Meetings”. 
Articles 93–95 (old numbering) are being deleted and new articles 93–95 inserted to deal with the Directors’ conﬂ icts of interest. Under the 2006 Act,
from 1 October 2008 a Director must avoid a situation where he has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conﬂ ict, or may possibly conﬂict, with
the Company’s interests. The requirement is very broad and could apply, for example, if a Director becomes a Director of another Company or a trustee 
of another organisation. The 2006 Act allows Directors of public companies to authorise conﬂ icts and potential conﬂicts, where appropriate, where the
Articles of Association contain a provision to this effect. The 2006 Act also allows the Articles of Association to contain other provisions for dealing with 
Directors’ conﬂ icts of interest to avoid a breach of duty. Article 95 is being proposed to give the Directors authority to approve such situations and includes 
some conﬂ ict management provisions regarding conﬁdential information and a Director’s ability to absent himself from discussions. Only Directors who 
have no interest in the matter being considered will be able to take the decision to authorise a conﬂ ict or potential conﬂict. In addition, the Directors will be
able to impose limits or conditions when giving authorisation if they think this is appropriate.
Article 96 (new numbering) is being inserted to provide that a Director who is directly or indirectly interested in a contract, transaction or arrangement shall
declare his interests if as a consequence of his involvement a conﬂict of interest within the meaning of Article 94 has arisen.
Article 97 (new numbering) is being inserted to provide that if the Company holds shares in any other company, and those shares have voting rights 
attaching to them, the Directors of the Company may exercise those voting rights as they see ﬁ t.
Articles 96–142 are to be renumbered as articles 98–144.
15. Biographical details of each Director who is being proposed for reappointment or re-election by shareholders, including their membership of Board 
committees, are set out on pages 20 to 21 of the 2009 Annual Report and Accounts.

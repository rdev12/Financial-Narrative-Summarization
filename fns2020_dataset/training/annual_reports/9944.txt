T ransformation
Mecom is changing the Group into 
a modern multi-platform content 
and consumer business in order to 
maximise the collection and delivery 
of high-quality relevant content, new 
revenue opportunities, efficiencies 
and savings across the Group. 
A core element of this process is the 
merging of print and online operations in 
newsrooms, editorial, marketing and sales 
departments. This enables journalists 
to work on both print and online content 
and optimises the collection, cross-
marketing and sale of the highest quality 
products and services to our communities 
whatever their choice of delivery. 
By reorganising the workflow in 
newsrooms and establishing new 
methods of content collection and 
delivery, Mecom becomes closer to the 
consumers and strengthens its relationship 
with its markets and communities.
This new business model is being 
implemented to generate more revenue 
per customer rather than relying solely 
on the price of the newspaper or a 
single advertisement and reaching 
an audience which is well beyond the 
reach of traditional newspapers.

Overview
New
revenues
In addition to generating revenues through 
new content platforms, Mecom is also 
developing new revenues through stand-
alone digital businesses, as well as the sale 
of branded goods and services targeted 
to appeal to our readers (Enterprises). 
The growth in the popularity of our 
newspaper related websites, like rp.pl 
(the online companion to Rzeczpospolita 
in Poland) or berlingske.dk (the online 
companion to Berlingske Tidende in 
Denmark), is being mirrored by the 
growth in the reach of our portfolio of 
stand-alone digital businesses that are 
not related to the Group’s newspapers 
but use new brands to target specific 
interests or markets. Whether it is the 
leading automotive classifieds site 
autotrack.nl in the Netherlands or the 
city site for Copenhagen aok.dk, these 
sites represent an increasingly important 
part of Mecom’s digital portfolio. 
In parallel, Mecom is developing a 
diversified portfolio of brand endorsed 
products and services which can be 
promoted across all content platforms. 
Mecom now sells a wide range of items 
including holidays, books, CDs, DVDs, as 
well as home-wares and theatre tickets.

Titles
Key to the transformation 
process is not only high-
quality content but also well-
established trustworthy brands 
and strong marketing platforms. 
As well as its 300 printed 
titles, Mecom has more 
than 200 websites.
More than 130 websites 
are newspaper sites which 
are essential to consolidate 
Mecom’s position as a 
leading source of news 
and entertainment in their 
respective markets. 
The other 70 websites are 
stand-alone sites targeting 
new markets with new brands 
contributing to an overall 
impressive digital portfolio.

Our
people
Mecom would not have been able to 
embark on its transformation strategy 
without the talent, commitment and 
adaptability of its employees. 
Mecom is a people business. The 
passion and drive of its people is its 
biggest asset. Mecom employees form 
part of the communities it serves, and 
they are well placed to understand 
the needs of these communities.
The key to Mecom’s approach has been 
the rigorous training of its experienced 
employees to work online as well as offline, 
creating new forms of content (including 
online TV, tools and utilities) and integrating 
user opinion and feedback across as 
many media channels as possible.
They have had to adapt to the challenge 
of established thinking and devise new 
sales methods and a fresh journalistic 
approach promoting greater productivity 
from the existing resources. 
Mecom’s employees have responded 
to change with great imagination, 
endeavour and commitment.

Mecom’s strategy is to use 
the scale of the Group and its 
very large readership base to 
create a modern content and

new management team in place 
in all of Mecom’s geographies 
to implement this strategy.

Overview
Overview
I am very pleased to report in my first 
Chairman’s statement to shareholders that we 
expect that Mecom will shortly secure a new 
and solid financial platform for the future. We 
have today announced that a mix of existing 
shareholders and new institutional investors 
have signed non-binding letters of support for 
an equity issue to raise £140 million (before 
expenses). Their support is conditional on, 
amongst other things, the Group agreeing 
final facility documentation with its lenders 
(the principal commercial terms of which have 
already received credit approval from each 
of the lenders); the issue of a prospectus in 
connection with an equity issue; and relevant 
shareholder resolutions being passed. The 
Group’s new bank facilities, the principal 
feature of which is a waiver of normal trading 
covenants until June 2010, are primarily 
intended to protect Mecom against continuing 
weakness in its advertising markets. 
We anticipate that a prospectus will be 
posted to shareholders in mid-May. When  
the proceeds of an equity issue are received, 
we will repay our unsecured convertible loan 
note holders in full (approximately £30.6 million) 
with the balance of the proceeds applied in 
paying down bank debt. The combination of 
the disposals earlier in the year of our German 
and Northwest Norway divisions, the new 
bank arrangements and an equity issue give 
us a good base from which to enter an upturn 
in all of the economies in which we operate, 
from which all of our newspaper titles and 
other media outlets should benefit significantly. 
Although the short-term outlook for our 
businesses remains uncertain, the Board 
is confident that the longer term promises 
greater stability and improved profitability. We 
are grateful to our shareholders and lenders 
for sharing this confidence.
Board
It was announced on 16 January 2009 that I 
had been appointed Chairman of the Group, 
having previously been a non-executive 
Director. David Montgomery, who had been 
Executive Chairman of Mecom since its 
foundation, remains the Chief Executive. This 
change is in accordance with the undertaking 
Mecom gave at the time of its move to trading 
on the London Stock Exchange’s main market 
for listed securities last year to split the roles of 
Chairman and Chief Executive.
We were pleased to welcome Stephen 
Davidson who joined the Board as the Senior 
Independent Director on 16 January 2009 as 
well as Henry Davies, who joined the Board 
as acting Finance Director on the same day 
and became Group Finance Director on 13 
February 2009. We expect to be in a position 
to announce the appointment of another non-
executive director shortly.
Chairman’s 
statement
Throughout 2008 and the first few months 
of 2009, our managers and employees in 
all departments across the Group have 
responded – in the face of extremely debilitating 
economic conditions – with enthusiasm and 
determination in the continuing transformation 
of our traditional newspaper business into a 
more broadly-based consumer and content 
business. On behalf of the Board, I thank 
them very much for their commitment and 
hard work.

Group
highlights
Equity issue and amendments to 
the facility terms
The agreed amendments to the Group’s debt 
facilities and the proposed equity issue to 
raise £140 million (before expenses) together 
represent material progress in restructuring 
Mecom’s balance sheet. In particular:
net cash proceeds from the equity raise of •	
£133 million (approximately €149 million);
£30.6 million (€34.2 million) of the net •	
proceeds will be used to pay down the 
Group’s outstanding convertible loan notes, 
with the balance being used to pay down 
bank debt;
pro forma 2008 net debt of approximately •	
£340 million (€350 million), after taking into 
account the net proceeds of the equity 
issue and the net proceeds of the recently 
completed disposals of the Group’s German 
and Northwestern Norwegian businesses;
testing holiday of normal trading covenants •	
under the facility agreement until June 2010;
margin of 350 bps on the term loan, 300 •	
bps on the revolving credit facilities; and
total debt restructuring costs of •	
approximately £18 million (€20 million).
Mecom expects that full banking documentation 
will be finalised in mid May 2009 following which 
the Group expects to launch the equity issue. 
Key financials
The Group has presented its financial results 
on two bases below and in the Chairman’s 
statement, the Chief Executive’s review and 
the Divisional reviews. 
The first is “like-for-like”, which presents 
comparatives for the year to 31 December 2007 
as if Mecom had owned all of its divisions for that 
entire year so as to allow a better understanding 
of the underlying trading and financial 
performance of the Mecom divisions (these 
are shown as Group revenue, Group EBITDA 
and Group operating profit in the table below); 
this like-for-like information is also stated before 
exceptional items and amortisation of acquired 
intangibles and on a constant currency basis 
(being the average exchange rates prevailing 
in the year to 31 December 2008); this like-
for-like information also includes the results of 
Mecom Germany on a line-by-line basis. 
The second basis is “reported”, that is the 
results of the operations as they appear in 
the audited financial statements, which reflect  
the ownership of Wegener and Mecom Germany 
for only part of the year to 31 December 2007 
and present the results of Mecom Germany as 
a discontinued operation in the financial years 
to 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007 . 
The effect of the acquisitions of Wegener and 
Mecom Germany part way through the year to 
31 December 2007 results in the two sets of 
reported results not being directly comparable.

ARTWORK NOTE: BASELINE GRID IS BEING USED ON THIS JOB 14 Mecom Group plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Overview
Overview
Since the summer of 2008 Mecom has been 
making significant adjustments to its financial 
position to deal with unprecedented economic 
conditions caused by the worldwide recession. 
The downturn, which has been reflected in a 
marked decline in trading multiples of publicly 
listed newspaper groups, came within months 
of Mecom completing its largest acquisition, 
of Wegener in the Netherlands, which itself 
represented half the size of the Group. 
Clearly the Group has had to act promptly 
to install a financial structure suitable for the 
current times and one that will sustain the 
business through a volatile advertising market 
with the extent of the downturn still difficult  
to predict. 
At the beginning of 2009 Mecom agreed the 
disposal of its German assets, principally the 
newspapers in Berlin and Hamburg. The price 
achieved (7.8 times 2008 adjusted EBITDA) 
was materially in excess of the trading multiple 
of both Mecom and the sector. Later, the 
Northwest Norwegian assets were sold at 
a price (7.3 times adjusted EBITDA) which 
reflected a similar premium to sector valuations. 
The combined €210 million of proceeds (net 
of expenses) has been used to pay down 
debt. In the case of Germany, the newspaper 
sector remains ripe for consolidation and as 
Mecom had no ability to participate further in 
this at the time, the disposal was well justified 
strategically. In the case of Northwest Norway, 
the disposal still leaves the Group with a 
considerable business in that country mainly 
grouped much closer to Oslo. The lost profits 
from the disposed assets should be made 
up in the medium term by strenuous cost 
reduction including sharing of services with 
other Norwegian publishers.
The disposals do not disrupt the pursuit or 
the validity of the overall Group strategy. 
This is to consolidate regional newspapers 
across Europe within a single infrastructure 
and to transform an old-fashioned print- 
based business into a content and consumer-
focused Group. 
The intensity of the economic storm will require 
us to accelerate cost savings associated with 
our ongoing restructuring programmes. In 
2008, the Group-wide reduction in headcount 
of 830, or 7 per cent, of the workforce was 
in part offset by high salary inflation. However, 
this inflationary trend in staff and supplier costs 
is now subsiding as the recession bites.
Economic conditions will also require us 
to intensify our transformation towards a 
business which grows new revenues both 
online and by selling more products, goods 
and services to our readers and users. In 2008, 
this transformation was particularly noticeable 
Chief 
Executive’s 
review
in Norway which is the Group leader in the 
expansion of online revenues and added new 
digital businesses and staff aggressively in  
the first half of the year, with 12 per cent of the 
Norwegian advertising revenues now coming 
from online.
We have now established a Group-wide 
policy of redeployment of resources rather 
than new investment to fuel transformation, 
with journalists being encouraged to produce 
content for different media outlets rather than 
simply printed newspapers. The business is 
run on a weekly basis by a unified European 
management group that includes the CEOs 
of the country divisions, the Chief Operating 
Officer, the Group Finance Director, Group 
Digital Officer and the Group CEO. This 
format is increasingly effective as the 
modernisation programme is rolled out from 
the best performing areas. In addition, there 
is a new and parallel initiative to centralise 
certain other Group functions where there is 
currently overlap between the Group’s head 
office in London and Wegener’s head office 
in Apeldoorn.
The Netherlands
Following extensive discussions and the 
replacement of the Wegener Supervisory  
Board, the new CEO Joop Munsterman  
swiftly set to work on a cost reduction 
plan resulting in a marked improvement to 
the profitability of the daily newspapers in 
particular. Coupled with continued focus on 
profit improvement in Limburg (the results 
of which are reported jointly with Wegener 
in the Netherlands segment), EBITDA
1
 in  
the Netherlands increased from £97.1 million 
in 2007 to £103.4 million in 2008 on static  
revenues of £632.3 million (2007: £636.2 
million).
Wegener’s current reorganisation plan (the 
so-called “Delta” plan), which originally sought 
around 500 job losses, will now be extended 
to include editorial departments.
At the same time the development of online 
newspaper advertising has been slow. 
Productivity improvements in both content 
and sales departments are being sought.
The combination of the Wegener and Limburg 
titles make Mecom the largest Dutch publisher 
with almost one million subscription copies 
a day and weekly household penetration of 
around 80 per cent of the Dutch market. The 
development of that consumer market is the 
management’s priority.

like basis as explained on page 13.
ARTWORK NOTE: BASELINE GRID IS BEING USED ON THIS JOB 15
Overview
Denmark
Berlingske Media has suffered the worst of 
the advertising downturn and has been the 
longest in recession but has been the most 
successful division in the Group in reducing 
costs, down by around six per cent in 2008. 
This cost reduction went some way to 
compensate for the £32.3 million year-on-year 
decline in advertising revenues. Total revenues 
for the year were £371.9 million (2007: £409.0 
million) with EBITDA falling from £32.0 million 
in 2007 to £16.6 million in 2008.
In addition, the business is furthest advanced 
in transformation under the leadership of 
Lisbeth Knudsen, who occupies the roles of 
both editor-in-chief of the flagship national title 
Berlingske Tidende and Danish group CEO. 
The division returned to its refurbished 
headquarters in May and many of the 
traditional departments have disappeared. 
Instead journalists and sales staff are working 
in market groups, supplying a range of 
products, print and online as an integrated 
unit. This is highly developed in business, 
sport and lifestyle market groups and is  
being extended on a monthly basis to other 
content areas. 
The more efficient and revenue building model 
will equip the Danish business to make the 
most of a future return to growth and is being 
rolled out to other divisions during 2009. Whilst 
many restructuring initiatives were completed 
in Denmark during 2008, we anticipate that 
there will be further cost reductions in 2009. 
Norway
Management in the Group’s Norwegian 
division, Edda Media, was changed in the latter 
days of 2008 with Truls Velgaard assuming 
responsibility for Edda Media in addition to his 
responsibility for the Group’s Polish division. 
After a boom in advertising revenue in the first 
months of the year, Norway had a disappointing 
result as both existing businesses and newly 
acquired digital companies saw slowing 
revenues after the summer of 2008. As a 
consequence, total revenues in Norway 
grew slightly from £258.7 million in 2007 
to £267 .6 million in 2008. However, largely 
as a result of extensive investment in new 
revenue areas which contributed to an 
increase in costs of £22.6 million (including a 
decline in associate income from £3.0 million 
in 2007 to £0.9 million in 2008), EBITDA  
fell from £41.7 million in 2007 to £28.0 million 
in 2008.
As a result of the deteriorating advertising 
environment in Norway, Edda Media’s 
aggressive expansion programme, particularly 
in online acquisitions in Norway and Sweden, 
has been halted. 
The fall-off in advertising revenues was 
particularly noticeable in the developing 
national and international markets and action 
has been taken either to curtail cost or  
make disposals. 
However, the character of the local franchises 
remains robust as they represent the leading 
media brands in their areas where increasingly 
they occupy the number one position in online 
as well as in print.
Poland
The Polish division continues to develop 
through product launches in the regional 
newspaper division, particularly in the door-
to-door segment and in online which is 
experiencing the fastest rate of growth in the 
Group, with unique users per month up over 
50 per cent to 4 million. These developments 
were accompanied by growing advertising 
for the early part of 2008 but this tailed off 
decisively in the final months, particularly in 
the national newspaper division.
Subscription sales of the national title 
Rzeczpospolita declined only modestly during 
2008 as some of its rival publications saw 
significant circulation reductions. 
Modest declines in both circulation and 
advertising revenues (the latter caused by 
the ending of national advertising sales joint 
venture, whereas underlying advertising was 
up) contributed to a decline in overall revenues 
from £143.8 million in 2007 to £136.5 million in 
2008 with cost reductions mitigating much of 
this. EBITDA in 2008 was £9.1 million (2007: 
£11.4 million).
 
Germany
Advertising decline and inflationary influences 
were countered by energetic cost control 
in Berlin and Hamburg under the leadership 
of CEO and Berliner Zeitung editor-in-chief 
Josef Depenbrock. As a result the business 
ended 2008 with a higher profit margin than 
at the time of acquisition by Mecom. In 2008, 
shortfalls in revenue were in part mitigated by 
cost control, with revenues in 2008 of £119.3 
million (2007: £123.2 million) and EBITDA in 
2008 of £15.3 million (2007: £16.9 million).
Circulation has stabilised as a result of greater 
marketing effort that curtailed some profit 
development in 2008. Berliner Zeitung, a quality 
broadsheet, is close to becoming the largest 
circulation newspaper in the city, the gap 
having narrowed with BZ, the popular tabloid, 
during Mecom’s ownership. The continuing 
strong circulations of the titles represented 
a strong selling point in negotiations with the 
new owners, DuMont Schauberg.
We thank the employees of the German 
businesses for their hard work and 
commitment during our period of ownership 
in which we sought to develop and secure the 
titles for the future.
Online
Digital revenue in 2008 was £62.8 million, up 
by £11.8 million or 23 per cent year-on-year, 
reflecting an increase in online newspaper 
advertising sales and small bolt-on 
acquisitions. Management has changed the 
strategy of having dedicated staff for online 
and introduced integrated work across both 
digital and print platforms. This is designed 
to increase productivity in sales and content 
production markedly and to create many 
products from one central hub. 
The objective is to exploit a wider market of 
consumers and advertisers with a greater 
range of products that use common content 
origination and production. This transformation 
process will gain momentum during 2009.
Outlook
The trend in advertising revenue decline 
has steepened in the first months of 2009 
against challenging comparisons in the  
early part of 2008. In the first quarter advertising 
revenues were down 20 per cent, although 
the year-on-year comparison is complicated 
by the timing of Easter. Cost reduction has 
also accelerated in the first quarter to partly 
compensate for this trend. Subscription 
revenues remain broadly stable. The benefit of 
the efficiency measures is now less likely to be 
affected in the future by inflationary pressures.
The outlook continues to be unpredictable 
without great prospect of rapid improvement. 
Nevertheless the management is focused on 
a rapid modernisation programme to create 
a content and consumer business which is 
not only efficient but can take advantage of  
broader markets when the economy improves.

Overview
In addition the holders of a £30.6 million 
convertible loan note which was due for 
payment on 12 April 2009, have agreed an 
extension of the maturity date to 12 July 2009, 
although this extension will accelerate to 31 
May 2009 should the Group not proceed with 
its equity raising or if certain insolvency events 
arise.
Note 4 in the consolidated financial statements 
sets out the going concern considerations 
related to the above.
Like-for-like financial performance
Group revenue fell by 3 per cent from 
£1,570.9 million to £1,527 .6 million in the  
year to 31 December 2008, driven by a  
decline in advertising revenue for the full year 
of 6 per cent. 
Full-year advertising fell £50.0 million to 
£772.6 million and was down in all the 
Group’s operations apart from Norway, which 
benefited from the effect of some local bolt-
on acquisitions and strong digital growth. 
The steepest decline in advertising was in 
Denmark, at 17 per cent, as the current 
economic conditions compounded the effect 
of an already highly competitive advertising 
market. The Dutch advertising market in 
contrast performed relatively strongly and 
was only down 4 per cent on 2007 as the 
economic downturn took longer to affect  
that country. 
Circulation revenue grew by 2 per cent across 
the Group, as falling volumes continued to 
be more than offset by price increases. Over 
75 per cent of circulation revenue derives 
from subscriptions; this proportion is over 
95 per cent in the Netherlands and Norway. 
Circulation revenues fell in Germany and 
Poland, where the proportion of newsstand 
sales is highest.
Printing revenue increased marginally from 
£95.0 million to £96.7 million. Enterprises 
revenues grew by 30 per cent, which included 
strong growth in the Netherlands especially  
in the Wegener business. Other revenues fell 
by £9.8 million, including decreases in third-
party distribution.
An increase of £3.1 million in Group revenue 
in the first half of 2008 was followed by a 
reduction of £46.4 million in the second 
half of the year. The main cause of this was 
a decrease in advertising revenue of £41.7 
million, or 10 per cent, in the second half, 
caused by the continuing competition and the 
difficult economic conditions that affected the 
countries in which Mecom operates. 
Digital revenue, which is largely included 
within advertising above, increased from 
£51.0 million to £62.8 million, an increase of 23 
per cent. Strong growth in the first half of the 
year and the effect of acquisitions made early 
in 2008 were dampened by the effect of the 
economic downturn on some digital activities, 
in particular online recruitment.
New financial platform
As announced in the October 2008 Interim 
Management Statement, the Board of Mecom 
recognised the need to deleverage the balance 
sheet to address a more challenging economic 
outlook. Since then, Mecom has completed 
two significant asset disposals in Germany 
and Northwestern Norway at the same time 
as increasing focus on cost minimisation 
and cash conservation. Simultaneously 
Mecom has been in discussions with both 
its banks and its shareholders concerning an 
agreement on an appropriate capital structure 
for the long-term. 
On 29 April 2009, certain Mecom  
shareholders and new institutions signed non-
binding letters of support for an equity issue 
to raise approximately £140 million (before 
expenses). This support is conditional on, 
amongst other things, the Group agreeing 
final facility documentation with its lenders 
(the principal commercial terms of which have 
already received credit approval from each 
of the lenders); the issue of a prospectus in 
connection with an equity issue; and relevant 
shareholder resolutions being passed. 
The key terms of the new bank deal, assuming 
the equity issue takes place as planned, will 
include:
total facilities of circa €600 million, including •	
a term facility maturing in October 2013 of 
€350 million, a revolving credit facility of up 
to €200 million maturing in October 2013 
and an additional term loan facility of circa 
€50 million; 
the amount of the revolving credit facility •	
will vary according to the Group’s projected 
working capital requirements and to the 
amount of gross cash on the Group’s 
balance sheet;
margin on the term loan facility of 350 basis •	
points over the relevant inter-bank rate, 
with a 200 basis points additional non-
cash margin on the additional term loan 
facility accruing from 1 January 2010 and 
increasing by a further 200 basis points 
on 1 June 2010 and by a further 200 basis 
points on 1 January 2011;
margin on the revolving credit facility of 300 •	
basis points;
cash margin under both the term and •	
revolving credit facilities are subject to 
downward adjustment in the event that the 
Group’s leverage falls below 3.0 times or 
2.0 times respectively;
leverage, interest cover and operating cash •	
flow covenants tested at 30 June 2010, 31 
December 2010 and quarterly thereafter; 
June 2010 leverage covenant of 5.25 times, •	
falling to 4.50 times at 31 December 2010;
covenants on the total capital expenditure •	
and exceptional items of the Group, tested 
annually from 31 December 2009; and
warrants over the Company’s shares •	
issued to the banks which would represent 
5 per cent of the existing (pre-equity issue) 
share capital of the Company.
The Group’s cost base (including share of 
results of associates) was reduced by 1 per 
cent, or £15.2 million. This net reduction reflects 
the Group’s restructuring programmes and 
the effect of disposals, offset by inflationary 
pressure on the cost base and additional costs 
from acquired businesses. On an underlying 
basis, stripping out the effect of inflation and 
acquisitions, staff costs were down 5 per cent 
on the prior year. Average full-time equivalent 
employees fell by 830, or 7 per cent, between 
2007 and 2008. 
The cost base fell in all countries other than 
Norway, where high country inflation and 
acquisitions and investment in new businesses 
drove a cost base increase of 10 per cent. The 
cost base fell by 6 per cent in Denmark, which 
has carried out a substantial reorganisation of 
its Copenhagen operations.
Restructuring the business is continuing and 
management is targeting a further reduction 
of the cost base by €75 million in 2009 driven 
by a combination of the full year effect of 
2008 initiatives, further headcount reduction, 
the benefits of the Danish print restructuring 
and a further clampdown on discretionary 
spend. The tough economic conditions mean 
management teams are constantly reviewing 
additional cost saving measures.
Group EBITDA fell by £28.1 million, or 15 per 
cent, from £191.4 million to £163.3 million, 
reflecting the excess in the reduction of 
revenues, in particular advertising, over the 
reduction in the cost base. EBITDA grew in  
the Netherlands, which was affected last by  
the fall in advertising revenue and benefited 
from cost reduction measures, but reduced 
in all other countries. The falls were most 
pronounced in Denmark, down £15.4 million 
or 48.1 per cent, where advertising revenue 
decline was sharpest of all the Group’s 
operations, and Norway, down £13.7 million or 
33 per cent, where the growth in the cost base 
could not be contained to match a second half 
decline in revenue. Central costs increased to 
£9.1 million from £7.7 million reflecting a full 
year of the London full head office. EBITDA 
margin was 10.7 per cent, down 1.5 points 
from 2007. EBITDA margin was highest in the 
Netherlands at 16 per cent (2007: 15 per cent) 
and lowest in Denmark at 4 per cent (2007: 8 
per cent). 
Depreciation increased by 8 per cent to £58.7 
million reflecting the significant investment in 
print assets in the Netherlands, the refit and 
refurbishment of the Copenhagen office and 
investment in IT systems. The depreciation 
charge for the disposed German and 
Northwest Norwegian assets was £5.0 million. 
Operating profit was £104.6 million (2007: 
£137 .0 million), with an operating margin of 
6.8 per cent, down 1.9 points from 2007. As 
with EBITDA, the range of operating margins 
is wide, from 13 per cent in the Netherlands 
per cent to 1 per cent in Denmark.

Market 
overview
The Netherlands
The Netherlands has a population of 16 million 
and GDP grew by 2 per cent in 2008.
The paid-for newspapers saw their circulation 
decline by an average of 2.4 per cent over 
the year, with the circulation decline highest 
amongst the national dailies. Newspaper 
circulations in the paid-for daily regional 
markets declined by 1.6 per cent in 2008. 
The newspaper market in the Netherlands was 
estimated to be worth £1,244 million in 2008 
and has been growing at an annual rate of 
0.3 per cent since 2003. In 2008, newspaper 
advertising constituted approximately 20 per 
cent of the total advertising market which 
grew by 3.7 per cent. However, the markets 
deteriorated in the second half of 2008.
There are three major operators in the Dutch 
market: Mecom, Telegraaf Media Group 
(“TMG”) and PCM Uitgevers. These operators 
constitute 75 per cent of the total newspaper 
market. The remainder of the market consists 
of various medium sized and smaller players. 
TMG is the market leader in the national daily 
market, through its title De Telegraaf, with a 15 
per cent share of the total newspaper market. 
Mecom is the leader in the regional newspaper 
market and has a 59 per cent market share. 
The weekly free-sheet market is fragmented, 
with Mecom the market leader with a 38 per 
cent market share. 
The Netherlands has the highest internet 
penetration in Europe, reaching almost 90 
per cent of the population. Online advertising 
has continued to grow rapidly in 2008 and 
constituted 10 per cent of the Dutch advertising 
market, up from 8 per cent in 2007 . Online 
advertising sales in the Netherlands were 
approximately €450 million in 2008.

Denmark
Denmark has a population of over five million 
and GDP declined by 0.9 per cent in 2008. 
Newspaper circulations in the paid-for national 
daily market in Denmark declined by 6.8 per 
cent across 2008, and regional newspaper 
circulations declined by approximately 4.5 per 
cent. The newspaper market in Denmark was 
estimated to be worth £991 million in 2008 
and has declined 5 per cent since 2007 . 
Newspaper advertising was estimated to be 
worth £565 million in 2008 and constituted 37 
per cent of the total advertising market against 
42 per cent in 2007. The total advertising 
market is expected to be £1,502 million in 
2008, a decline of 3 per cent compared with 
2007 . Newspaper advertising declined by 5 per 
cent in 2008 compared with 2007. Advertising 
in the paid-for newspapers declined by 16.7 
per cent with nationals down by 18.2 per cent, 
regionals down by 14.2 per cent and locals 
down by 13.4 per cent.
There are two major newspaper publishing 
operators in the Danish market: Berlingske and 
JP/Politikens Hus. These operators constitute 
50 per cent of the total newspaper market.
Sondagsavisen publishes the leading weekly 
free-sheet, Sondagsavisen, with several 
regional editions and has a significant 
distribution business (which is in the process 
of being disposed). The daily free-sheet 
market has been intensely competitive, with 
three daily titles including MetroXpress (Metro 
International), URBAN (Mecom), 24 Timer (JP/
Politikens Hus). The weekly local free-sheet 
market is concentrated, with Berlingske and 
JP/Politikens Hus being the market leaders. 
Berlingske has an estimated 20 per cent 
share of this market. In 2008, MetroXpress 
and 24 Timer merged their activities into one 
company but still publishes two newspapers. 
Following the merger, 24 Timer reduced its 
circulation.
Online advertising is estimated to be worth 
£304 million and has continued to grow at 
an estimated 20 per cent in 2008. Denmark’s 
internet penetration in 2008 was over 80.4 per 
cent; 90 per cent of those who have an internet 
connection at home have broadband.

Overview
Norway
The population of Norway is over four million 
and GDP in 2008 is estimated to have grown 
by 2 per cent in 2008.
The newspaper advertising market in Norway 
(excluding inserts and free-sheets) was 
estimated to be worth £680 million in 2008 
and declined by 4.4 per cent compared to 
2007. 
Newspaper advertising (including inserts and 
free-sheets) constituted 41 per cent of the total 
advertising market in 2008, a small decrease 
compared to 2007. The total advertising market 
declined by 0.5 per cent in 2008. Newspaper 
circulations declined by 2.8 per cent in 2008. 
Whilst the national tabloid declined by 8.4 
per cent, the circulation of local newspapers 
market remained stable. 
There are three major operators in Norway 
who, between them, account for 64 per cent of 
the total newspaper market. Schibsted has a 
33 per cent market share through the national 
tabloid, VG, the morning paper, Aftenposten, 
and its majority ownership of the main regional 
newspapers such as Bergens Tidende, 
Stavanger Aftenblad, Faedrelandsvenennen 
and Adresseavisen. Edda Media had a 13 
per cent share in 2008 through its strong 
position in the local newspaper segment. 
It also owns a number of local online news 
websites, national online niche positions and 
several local radio and television stations. 
Edda Media’s market share after the disposal 
of Northwestern assets to Polaris Media ASA, 
is 10 per cent. A-pressen has a 17 per cent 
market share through its strong position in the 
local newspaper segment. Dagbladet, owned 
by the Berner Group, is the second largest 
national tabloid with a 5 per cent share of the 
national newspaper circulation. The weekly 
free-sheet market consists of local community 
based weekly free-sheets, where Edda Media 
is the dominant and leading player with a total 
of 12 titles (17 editions) and a 50 per cent share 
of the free-sheet advertising market.
Online advertising has continued to grow 
rapidly and in 2008 constituted 10 per cent 
of the Norwegian advertising market, up from 
9.5 per cent in 2007. The online advertising 
market was estimated to be worth £180 
million in 2008. Norway is one of the leading 
European internet markets with penetration of 
88 per cent.

unless mentioned otherwise.
Poland
The population of Poland is over 38 million and 
GDP grew by 4.9 per cent in 2008. 
The newspaper market in Poland was 
estimated to be worth £456 million in 2008. 
The total advertising market grew by 10.5 per 
cent in 2008 against 12.8 per cent in 2007 . 
The advertising market in Poland has been 
growing in recent years in line with the strong 
economy. The newspaper advertising market 
grew by 5.4 per cent in 2008 representing 13 
per cent of the total advertising market.
The newspaper circulation market is estimated 
to be worth approximately £317 million. 
Newspaper circulations in the paid-for national, 
daily free-sheets and daily regionals markets 
have declined by 6 per cent, 12 per cent and 
14 per cent respectively in 2008. Despite this, 
the value of this market increased by 2 per 
cent due to the growth of cover prices.
Competition within the paid-for newspaper 
market is very strong, especially in newspaper 
sales. There are four major operators in Poland 
who, between them, account for 76 per cent of 
the total paid-for newspaper market. Mecom 
owns Rzeczpospolita, the leading upmarket 
daily newspaper, business daily Parkiet and 
12 regional newspapers across Poland, giving 
a 19 per cent share of the total market. Axel 
Springer, with a 28 per cent share, publishes 
Fakt, Poland’s largest newspaper, two sports 
dailies and Dziennik, a daily national. Grupa 
Wydawnicza Polskapresse is the largest 
publisher of regional newspapers with a 13 per 
cent share of the total newspaper market. 
Agora publishes the daily Gazeta Wyborcza 
and the national free paper Metro, and has a 
16 per cent market share. 
Online advertising grew by 33 per cent in 
2008, constituting 10 per cent of the Polish 
advertising market. There are approximately 
15.4 million internet users in Poland, a 10 
per cent increase from 2007 . Broadband 
penetration in 2008 was 79 per cent, a 7 per 
cent increase on 2007 .

Divisional review
Divisional 
review
The Netherlands
The Group’s Dutch division comprises 
Wegener and Limburg Media Group (“LMG”). 
In May 2008, Jan Houwert stepped down as 
the CEO of Wegener and was replaced by 
Joop Munsterman; Johan Boermann is the 
CEO of LMG.
Wegener is the largest publisher of regional 
daily newspapers and free door-to-door 
newspapers in the Netherlands. LMG is a 
significant regional newspaper business in the 
Dutch province of Limburg and in the south 
and east of the Netherlands. With its online 
portfolio of newspaper websites and stand-
alone niche websites serving customers, 
communities and advertisers, the Dutch 
division now has nine million unique users 
every month up from eight million in 2007 . 
This supplements its newspaper readership 
of 11.8 million every week and extending the 
reach of the division’s content well beyond  
its traditional newspaper audience. 
In a challenging year, Mecom increased its 
share of the total Dutch printed newspaper 
advertising market from 25.3 per cent to 25.6 
per cent and its circulation market share from 
19.9 per cent in 2007 to 20.6 per cent in 2008. 
Wegener improved the market position of its 
dailies by limiting the decline in circulation to 
1.8 per cent, compared to a national decline 
of 5.5 per cent for all dailies, and increased 
revenues from circulation by 3.3 per cent due 
to price rises. The Wegener free door-to-door 
newspapers had another good year with 
advertising revenues rising by 5.8 per cent as 
the strategy of achieving national coverage 
continued to be implemented, in particular 
through the repositioning of De Weekkrant 
as a national brand for regional free door-to-
door newspapers. Wegener strengthened its 
position in the Netherlands’ three northern 
provinces through the launch of new weekly 
newspapers at the beginning of 2008 and 
has continued to expand in 2009 through two 
joint ventures with Buijze Pers and Rodi Pers 
covering the western part of the Netherlands.
In Wegener, there has been a continued  
growth in the internet as an advertising  
medium by 16 per cent in 2008, following an 
increase of 28 per cent in 2007 . 
All Wegener and LMG dailies have a website 
operating alongside the printed newspaper 
and they increasingly refer readers and 
visitors to one another. By concentrating on its 
leading regional brands (such as BN/De Stem, 
Brabants Dagblad, Dagblad De Limburger, 
De Gelderlander, De Stentor, De Twentsche 
Courant Tubantia, Limburgs Dagblad), the 
Dutch division grew its newspaper site  
unique users by over 38 per cent. During  
2008 this portfolio was expanded by the 
launch of a new website, deweekkrant.nl, an 
online companion site for the division’s free 
door-to-door newspapers, which provides 
local communities across the Netherlands with 
access to local news. This new site attracted 
more than 500,000 unique users per month 
within three months of its launch.

The unique users of the division’s stand- 
alone sites grew by over 25 per cent with 
autotrack.nl (the Netherlands’ leading 
automotive niche portal) and jobtrack.nl  
(one of the leading job search portals) both 
improving their positions in highly competitive 
markets. LMG launched many new websites 
in 2008 and increased its number of unique 
users by 50 per cent compared to 2007 .
Wegener’s Enterprises business made good 
progress during 2008, selling increasing 
volumes of goods and services to readers by 
marketing them through the division’s print 
and online portfolio. The Dutch Enterprises 
portfolio now includes holidays, home interior 
products, ticketing, wine, as well as books 
and collections of CDs and DVDs.
In addition to the synergies and savings 
generated by reorganisation, during the course 
of 2008 the Dutch businesses invested over 
£36.0 million in their printing plants, improving 
office automation for all employees, renewing 
all the news sites of the Wegener dailies 
and developing new platforms for autotrack.
nl and jobtrack.nl. The largest portion of this 
investment was devoted to upgrading and 
expanding the printing facility in Best and 
upgrading the existing presses in Apeldoorn 
and Enschede. This provides more colour 
capacity so that all dailies can be printed in 
full colour. The investment in the Best facility, 
which has resulted in the closure of the Breda 
facility and will in 2009 result in the closure 
of the Nijmegen facility, will deliver greater 
efficiency as well as the availability of full colour 
printing for all Wegener newspapers. These 
investments in printing plants will not only result 
in greater efficiencies but also a better quality 
product for readers and advertisers with 
more colour positions for content including 
advertisements. This will also contribute to 
better environmental practices. 
Whilst Wegener and LMG continue to be run 
as separate businesses, 2008 has seen the 
implementation of an intensive collaboration 
programme between the two companies with 
LMG outsourcing a number of operations to 
Wegener thereby enabling both businesses to 
capitalise on economies of scale.
The Dutch division will continue to progress 
the transformation strategy in 2009 focusing 
on new multi-platform products as well as 
the integration of editorial, marketing and 
sales staff to facilitate the development of 
new revenues alongside the collection and 
production of digital and print content.

Mobile  
reporting
The challenge:
To start reporting through mobile phones across all 
Wegener newspapers in a professional way.
The solution:
Half of the editorial staff of all the 
Wegener newspapers were given a 
Nokia 95 or a Nokia 96 mobile phone 
and were challenged to use it during 
their “normal work” hours after 
receiving intensive training.
The result:
Enthusiastic journalists using their 
Nokia mobile phones reporting directly 
to the websites during soccer games, 
submitting their own photos and 
articles and presenting reports from 
live events.

Financial overview – like-for-like
Total revenue fell by £3.9 million, or 1 per 
cent, from £636.2 million to £632.3 million. 
Advertising revenue fell by 4 per cent to 
£348.5 million, reflecting the onset of the 
economic downturn at the end of the year 
and the disposal of the De Trompetter titles in 
March 2008. The deterioration in advertising 
was most pronounced in the second half of 
2008, falling by 8 per cent, and has affected 
the paid-for dailies to a greater extent than the 
weekly papers. 
Circulation revenue increased by 4 per cent  
as price increases, which were brought 
forward within the year, more than offset 
declines in circulation volumes. 95 per cent 
of circulation revenue in the Netherlands is 
subscription-based.
Other revenue was higher, up £3.0 million to 
£54.3 million, as a result of greater third-party 
printing and higher Enterprises sales, which 
grew strongly albeit from a low base. Total 
costs (including share of results of associates) 
fell by £10.2 million, or 2 per cent, to £528.9 
million, reflecting the restructuring during the 
year and previously, as well as the disposal 
of De Trompetter. Considerable elements of 
back office functions from the two previously 
separate businesses were combined during 
the year.
EBITDA was £103.4 million, up £6.3 million (or 
6 per cent) from 2007 . EBITDA margins held 
up well in the full year (up 1.1pts to 16.4 per 
cent) and also in the second half of the year 
(up again 1.1pts to 16.1 per cent), despite the 
deterioration in advertising revenue, as cost 
benefits and higher circulation and other 
revenue offset the advertising decline.
Depreciation increased by £2.7 million to £22.9 
million, reflecting the investment in printing 
equipment during the year, resulting in operating 
profit up £3.6 million to £80.5 million.
Financial overview – reported
The sharp increase in the reported revenue 
and operating profit between 2007 and 
2008 results from a full year’s ownership of 
the Wegener business, which was acquired 
in October 2007. Operating exceptional 
charges totalled £45.8 million (2007: £7.0 
million), primarily related to staff redundancy. 
Amortisation of acquired intangibles was 
£34.3 million (2007: £9.7 million) and an 
impairment charge of £543.7 million (2007: 
£nil) was recognised against the carrying 
amount of goodwill, resulting in an operating 
loss after exceptional items and amortisation 
of acquired intangibles of £543.3 million (2007: 
profit of £14.0 million).

Berlingske Media (“Berlingske”) is Denmark’s 
largest news publishing group producing 
content for print, online, online TV, radio  
and mobile phones. The activities of 
Berlingske span across Jutland and Zealand 
with its headquarters located in the centre 
of Copenhagen. During 2008, Berlingske 
rebranded from Det Berlingkse Officin to 
Berlingske Media, building a new identity.
Berlingske is one of two national publishers 
of quality newspapers in Denmark. It has a 
portfolio of three daily paid-for national titles, 
one national free-sheet, a weekly paid-for 
national newspaper, a national business 
magazine, six local daily newspapers operating 
under the name of Midtjyske Medier and one 
partly owned regional newspaper operating 
under the name of Syddanske Medier. Many 
of the division’s paid-for newspapers are 
subscription based. 
Berlingske is also one of the leading publishers 
of free newspapers with 50 local weekly 
titles, primarily in the Jutland and Zealand 
regions of Denmark. The division’s major 
free newspaper URBAN, which is aimed at 
the commuter market nationally, had a 2008 
daily circulation of approximately 196,000 and 
a daily readership of approximately 408,000. 
URBAN is the second largest daily free-sheet 
in Denmark in terms of readership. In 2008 
Berlingske re-launched several of its daily 
newspapers including Berlingske Tidende, 
URBAN and Århus Stiftstidende. 
Berlingske Media decreased its share of the 
total Danish dailies advertising market from 36 
per cent in 2007 to 31 per cent in 2008. The 
main reason for this decrease is the exposure 
of Berlingske to the recruitment and property 
market, two areas which are highly sensitive to 
the current economic climate. The same trend 
is seen in the regional and local newspaper 
market.
In a challenging business environment 
Berlingske Media had an intensive year. It 
moved into new headquarters in Copenhagen, 
bringing together Erhvervsbladet, URBAN, 
WeekendAvisen, B.T ., Berlingske Tidende and 
Berlingske Nyhedsmagasin, and many of its 
online activities, under one roof. Four buildings 
have now been consolidated into one modern 
media hub with over 1,100 employees, a 
newsroom for four of Berlingske’s newspapers 
and a highly professional TV studio ready to 
produce online TV. 
As well as consolidating the editorial assets 
and thinking innovatively about journalism, 
Berlingske has put in place a centralised 
advertising sales desk with two centres 
servicing east and west Denmark. It is also 
moving towards having a single point of 
contact for buyers so they can buy a package 
combining several media at once.
Berlingske has increased efforts to streamline 
purchasing by carrying out a wholesale review 
of travel, marketing, and office equipment, 
with clear goals identified for savings.
With more than 70 websites and 7.7 million 
unique users every month, Berlingske is 
focusing on the rapidly growing online 
advertising market principally through the 
cross promotion of its online newspaper sites 
such as berlingske.dk, business.dk and bt.dk, 
the three strongest national online media 
brands. Mecom also part owns several leading 
online classified sites including jobzonen.dk 
(the second largest online recruitment site) 
and bilzonen.dk (the second largest online  
motor vehicle site).
During the year, eight new content websites 
were launched as well as a new web shop 
to showcase the division’s brand endorsed 
goods and services (Enterprises). New site 
launches include lidtmere.dk, spilop.dk, 
sporten.dk, rejseliv.dk, dinepenge.dk, dinby.
dk, spotted.stiften.dk, fri.dk and new sites for 
all Berlingske’s free local weeklies.
Berlingske is leading the market with its 
development of its Enterprises business in 
Denmark, adopting a far more commercial 
approach than its rivals. In 2009, Enterprises 
growth will be driven by events and seminars, 
and new business-to-business services aimed 
at small- and medium-sized companies.

Financial overview – like-for-like
Total revenue fell by £37 . 1 million, or 9 per cent, 
during the year to 31 December 2008 from 
£409.0 million to £371.9 million. Advertising 
revenue fell by 17 per cent to £160.1 million, 
reflecting the highly competitive advertising 
and the effects of the economic downturn. 
All the division’s main titles were adversely 
affected, particularly the national Berlingske 
Tidende title, which accounts for around 30 
per cent of the division’s advertising revenue, 
and URBAN, the largest Mecom Denmark 
free-sheet. The decline in advertising revenue 
accelerated in the second half, from 14 per 
cent to 20 per cent. 
Circulation revenue increased by 3 per cent, 
with volume declines of around 5 per cent 
more than compensated for by price increases. 
Other revenue fell by 9 per cent, mostly driven 
by lower third-party printing and distribution 
revenue (which between them comprise three 
quarters of other revenue).
Total costs (including share of results of 
associates) fell by 6 per cent, reflecting 
the benefits of the rationalisation of the 
Copenhagen operations in a single office 
and an average full-time equivalent employee 
reduction of around 10 per cent during 2008, 
as well as reduced direct costs associated 
with lower revenue (including third-party 
printing and distribution).
As a consequence, EBITDA reduced by £15.4 
million from £32.0 million to £16.6 million, with 
EBITDA margin falling from 7.8 per cent to 
4.5 per cent. Depreciation increased by 13 
per cent from £12.7 million to £14.4 million, 
reflecting the recent investment in office and 
information technology. Operating profit fell 
from £19.3 million to £2.2 million.
Financial overview – reported
Revenue and operating profit differ between 
the like-for-like and reported results only as 
a consequence of movements in foreign 
currency rates.
Operating exceptional items totalled £15.3 
million (2007: £29.1 million), primarily due to the 
costs of redundancy and the reorganisation 
and refurbishment of the Copenhagen office. 
Amortisation of acquired intangibles was 
£13.5 million (2007: £11.7 million) and an 
impairment charge of £147 .5 million (2007: 
£nil) was recognised against the carrying 
amount of goodwill and acquired intangible 
assets, with the result that Denmark recorded 
an operating loss after exceptional items and 
amortisation of acquired intangibles of £175.9 
million (2007: £24.2 million).

Online TV
The challenge:
Ensuring even more value is delivered to people visiting 
Berlingske online. Online TV is an obvious choice, but it  
is not the format that is important, but how it enhances  
the editorial.
The solution:
Constructing a cutting edge online TV 
studio in the main newsroom. Training 
local journalists to become mobile 
journalists, filming and uploading video 
“on the go” using low cost technology 
such as mobile phones, giving an 
immediate first-hand account of  
the news.
The result: 
News with added value, and increased 
interest and use of our websites. 
Berlingske teamed up with competitors 
in the run-up to the US presidential 
election and one national broadcaster 
opted to use Berlingske’s studio 
instead of their own. In addition, local 
newspaper websites have attracted 
visitors from national newspaper 
websites by having their editorial 
enhanced by mobile journalism.

Edda Media is a major player in the Norwegian 
media industry with daily contact with more 
than one million Norwegians, more than one 
fifth of the population. The division’s 105
1
 
editorial titles are spread across the southern 
part of Norway. 
The product portfolio comprises 44 
newspapers (dailies, weeklies and free-
sheets), 72 websites, and 10 local radio 
and television stations. Edda Media holds a 
leading market position in its core markets  
with more than 70 per cent household  
coverage in 29 geographical areas and  
between 50 per cent and 70 per cent  
coverage in 50 geographical areas.
Edda Media increased its share of the total 
Norwegian printed newspaper advertising 
market (excluding inserts and free-sheets) from 
15.7 per cent to 16.3 per cent and increased 
its circulation market share from 12.3 per cent 
in 2007 to 13.2 per cent in 2008. The division’s 
market position in its subscription-based 
titles decreased in circulation by 2.5 per cent 
compared to national decline of 1.5 per cent 
for all subscription-based titles, but increased 
its revenues from circulation by 2.2 per cent. 
The free door-to-door newspaper advertising 
increased by 2.2 per cent, compared to 
an increase in the market by 3.5 per cent, 
reducing Edda Media’s market share within 
this market by 0.7 percentage points.
The most important brands within Edda 
Media were founded in the 19
th
 century. They 
have a strong position in their respective 
societies and have highly loyal readers and 
subscribers, resulting in a stable circulation 
of more than 340,000 paid-for papers and 
350,000 free-sheets. In total the newspapers 
have 1,290,000 readers comprising 790,000 
daily readers, 175,000 weekly readers and 
330,000 free-sheet readers. 
As a locally based media group, Edda Media’s 
strategy has been to “follow the reader”. All of 
Edda Media’s titles are constantly changing 
and improving their quality and content in line 
with the evolving needs of the users and their 
changing media habits. 
During 2008, Edda Media grew its online 
portfolio with launches in new geographic 
areas, special community editions, and 
new stand-alone sites. Synergies have 
been exploited between the local online 
newspapers and the stand-alone national sites 
(which cover sport, technology, and lifestyle 
themes) enabling the local online newspapers 
to broaden their content proposition. The 
national classified site, tinde.no, and the local 
online newspapers have also worked well 
together and are now further integrated.
Edda Media’s goal is to maintain its strong 
market position and at the same time build a 
strong online market position in local media 
and to increase its digital revenues significantly. 
During 2008 the number of unique visitors for 
its online newspapers increased by 25 per cent 
to 600,000. The traffic growth on the national 
sites was even stronger at 650,000. The Edda 
Media network in total has 1,250,000 unique 
weekly visitors, which represent a growth of 
more than 30 per cent year-on-year. 
Edda Media’s national sites used to be 
organised as separate business units with 
separate editorial offices – one for technology, 
one for sport, one for lifestyle. By the end 
of 2008 all these businesses had merged 
editorial resources into one joint office. This  
has enabled them to work much more 
efficiently, with fewer management resources 
and more content production. Even though 
each journalist has his or her own unique skills, 
they now work across the sites and deliver 
content to the local online newspapers.
The “follow the reader” strategy represents 
a complete transformation of the way 
employees work in order to deliver editorial 
and commercial content. More than 700 
journalists are in the middle of a process 
involving new working methods and content 
production irrespective of platform. The 
strategy demands a new approach from  
the workforce. 
In order to execute its strategy, Edda Media 
reorganised its operational structure in 2008 
under the more cost focused leadership of 
Truls Velgaard who was appointed in October 
2008. The senior management group 
changed its structure from being product-
oriented to being market-oriented. Prior to 
the change, Edda Media had one specialist 
digital business unit but now all business units 
have responsibility for newspapers, online and 
mobile development in their respective market 
areas. Edda Media has defined three main 
markets for its activities: local (which is divided 
into 10 regions); national; and international. In 
revenue terms the local market is currently the 
largest, comprising more than 70 per cent of 
the revenues of Edda Media.
The international market of Edda Media is 
mainly built around three companies: Opoint, 
HR North and NetSprint. Opoint, a business 
providing services to both corporate clients 
and government offices, broadened its service 
offering in the year with the acquisition of Siste 
Nytt, a business offering media monitoring 
services across radio and television. In January 
2008, Edda Media also acquired the Swedish 
company HR North AB, a recruitment site. 
HR North is the market leader in the Swedish 
online recruitment market, and gained market 
share even after the start of the financial 
downturn in the second half of the year. 
NetSprint is an award winning search engine 
company operating in Poland but managed 
as part of the Norwegian operations. 
On 18 February 2009, Mecom announced the 
sale of its Northwestern assets in Norway to 
Polaris Media ASA and the disposal completed 
on 2 April 2009.

Innsida.no – from 
web to paper
The challenge:
Innsida.no is a local online news site that covers four towns 
in the highly competitive northern region around Bømlo 
Fitjar, Kvinnherad and Stord. Whilst growing its audience 
well, Edda Media realised that the Innsida brand had further 
potential, to expand its reach and its appeal to both local 
advertisers and local readers.
The solution:
In May 2008 Edda Media launched a 
new free-sheet newspaper with the 
same brand: Innsida. The newspaper  
is distributed once a week to every 
household in the area (15,000). The 
circulation figure is twice as high as 
that of the main local competitor.
The result:
This move has strengthened Edda 
Media’s market position in the region, 
increased the consumer awareness  
of innsida.no, and given people in  
the region more choice and a  
better proposition.

Financial overview – like-for-like
Total revenue grew by 3 per cent from £258.7 
million in the year to 31 December 2007 to 
£267 .6 million in 2008. Advertising grew by 
4 per cent: there was strong growth in the 
first half of the year and the division benefited 
from the effect of bolt-on digital acquisitions 
made early in 2008; the second half of the 
year saw a decline of 5 per cent, however, as 
the weakening economic conditions affected 
advertising markets, with recruitment revenue 
hit hardest and earliest. Circulation revenues 
grew by 3 per cent, or £2.0 million, as price 
rises more than offset declines in volume. 
Other revenue increased by 3 per cent from 
£52.0 million to £53.7 million, mainly as a result 
of increases in printing.
Total costs (including share of results of 
associates) increased by 10 per cent from  
£217.0 million to £239.6 million, reflecting 
the effect of acquisitions (accounting for 
approximately half of the increase) and the 
strong underlying cost inflation in the Norwegian 
economy. Staff inflation was 6 per cent, 
offsetting the effect of previous restructuring.
EBITDA fell from £41.7 million to £28.0 million. 
After modest growth in the first half, second 
half EBITDA of £7.0 million was £15.6 million 
lower than the equivalent period in 2007 , 
reflecting falling advertising revenues and the 
higher cost base. EBITDA margin decreased 
from 16.1 per cent to 10.5 per cent.
Financial overview – reported
Revenue and operating profit differ between 
the like-for-like and reported results only  
as a consequence of movements in foreign 
currency rates.
Operating exceptional items totalled £3.3 
million (2007: £3.3 million), primarily due to the 
costs of redundancy. Amortisation of acquired 
intangibles was £9.4 million (2007: £8.3 
million) and a goodwill impairment charge of 
£138.6 million (2007: £nil) was recorded, with 
the result that Norway recorded an operating 
loss after exceptional items and amortisation 
of acquired intangibles of £137 .0 million (2007: 
profit of £15.1 million).

The Group’s Polish division comprises 
Media Regionalne, a regional newspaper 
and content business, and a 51 per cent 
share of Presspublica, which is the owner of 
Rzeczpospolita, one of the most respected 
titles in Poland. Presspublica also publishes a 
number of business and legal publications as 
well as operating the business website parkiet.
com. The Polish division also operates more 
than 40 websites and eight printing plants that 
print both Group and third-party publications 
and newspapers. 
Presspublica maintained its share of the total 
Polish national printed newspaper advertising 
market at 17 per cent in 2008 and maintained 
its circulation market share at 10 per cent. 
Presspublica’s market position of its dailies 
decreased in circulation by 4.5 per cent 
compared to the national decline of 5.8 per 
cent for all national dailies, and maintained 
revenues from circulation. Media Regionalne 
increased its share of the total Polish regional 
printed newspaper advertising market to 14 
per cent in 2008 from 13 per cent in 2007 and 
increased its circulation market share by 2.2 
per cent.
To reinforce Presspublica’s position in the 
market, Rzeczpospolita launched a new 
television guide, a new high-quality lifestyle and 
business monthly magazine, First Class, and a 
new daily supplement for the SOHO (“Small 
Office Home Office”) market, GPP, in 2008. 
The production teams of Zycie Warszawy and 
the Warsaw supplement of Rzeczpospolita 
were merged in 2008. Zycie Warszawy 
remains as a separate paid-for title but is 
published as a supplement to Rzeczpospolita 
in the Warsaw edition. This has led to editorial 
and marketing co-operation with a major local 
television station and with the City Council. 
Media Regionalne has embarked on an 
extensive restructuring in 2008 by merging all 
Media Regionalne entities into one company.  
This enables Media Regionalne to be better 
organised and managed and provides better 
access to information and databases for its 
customers and readers.
One initiative launched by Media Regionalne 
was the “Safe roads” project to promote 
behaviours to reduce the danger on Polish 
roads. Free door-to-door MM Lublin and four 
commuter free-sheets Teraz, were launched 
in the cities of Rzeszow, Kielce, Radom and 
Opole. With the exception of free-sheet Teraz, 
all newspapers have online companion sites.
The Polish division’s transformation into 
a content business is continuing apace. 
Integrated newsrooms are being set up and 
journalists are increasingly working across 
both print and online publications, with content 
first being published online.
Newsroom convergence in Media Regionalne 
means that web exclusive comments written 
by its leading columnists are now posted every 
morning. Video comments on the most widely 
debated issues are posted every evening and 
video interviews with prominent politicians 
and celebrities are made on a regular basis. 
Breaking news is published online and offline 
as soon as it has been thoroughly researched 
and double-checked.
A new look and feel has been created for the 
online newspapers, increasing their appeal 
to consumers, and making them the fastest 
growing media in each region. The sales 
teams attended rigorous online advertising 
training and in 2008, online advertising 
revenue reached approximately 7 per cent of 
Polish division’s total advertising revenues.
Media Regionalne had a very active year online, 
and its sites achieved 100 per cent growth in 
user numbers year-on-year. It significantly 
expanded the reach of Moje Miasto, an 
innovative combination of a local weekly free-
sheet and a local community website. It is a 
completely new product offering in the Polish 
market which is attractive to both readers and 
advertisers. In 2008 print and online Moje 
Miastos were launched in Lublin and eight 
stand-alone local community websites were 
launched in the biggest cities in Poland, being 
new markets for Media Regionalne. Moje 
Miasto is growing very fast and it currently 
attracts an average of 580,000 unique users 
per month. In addition, Media Regionalne 
launched 12 regional websites which are more 
interactive and modern. This has enabled 
Media Regionalne to increase its monthly 
unique users to an average of 2,100,000.
Poland’s digital operations achieved a 
significant increase in its audience numbers 
over the year, with monthly unique users 
increasing to over four million per month (up 
from 2.6 million per month in 2007). National 
brands like Rzeczpospolita and regional 
brands like Echo Dnia and Glos Dziennik 
Pomorza enhanced their online presence by 
re-launching their websites during the year, 
and introducing innovative concepts like 
Mobile Citizen Journalism (“MoDO”). MoDO is 
a mobile application for journalists, first used 
on the Moje Miasto websites and subsequently 
rolled out to all Media Regionalne’s online 
newspapers. This is the first example of such 
technology being applied in this way so far  
in Poland.
 
In 2008, Presspublica launched two online 
web shops. Firstly, sklep.rp.pl was launched 
to showcase the division’s brand endorsed 
products and services (Enterprises). Followed 
by e-sklep.parkiet.com, a platform on which 
Presspublica sells over 2,000 book titles 
issued by other publishers. Other Enterprises 
initiatives by Media Regionalne include warto.pl, 
an e-commerce web shop, and regiopedia.pl,  
the first Polish online encyclopaedia with 
regional appeal, co-created by Media 
Regionalne’s readers and online users. 
Holidays and tours organised by local travel 
agents are also now being marketed, as 
are local trade fairs, with a broad range of 
interest areas, including property, building and 
construction, health and fitness, fashion and 
weddings. Sources: Expert Monitor, ZKDP.

Divisional review
Financial overview – like-for-like
Total revenues fell by 5 per cent, from £143.8 
million to £136.5 million. This fall included the 
effect of the closure of a national advertising 
joint venture, a proportion of whose third-party 
revenues had been consolidated previously. 
Without this effect, total revenues fell by 1 per 
cent.
Including the effect of the closure of the 
national advertising joint venture, advertising 
fell by 3 per cent. However, advertising in 
the two continuing Polish businesses grew 
by 6 per cent, reflecting the strong growth in 
the Polish economy and the roll out of new 
revenue initiatives in the regional business. 
Total advertising fell by 9 per cent in the 
second half, however, advertising fell in the 
second half by only 2 per cent in the continuing 
businesses, with the national business’s 
financial title affected badly by the prevailing 
economic conditions.
Circulation fell by 3 per cent, or £1.9 million, 
mainly from volume declines on existing titles 
in the regional business. Other revenue fell by 
£3.4 million, or 15 per cent, mainly as a result 
of lower Enterprises sales of books in the 
national business. This business was stopped 
in the autumn of 2008.
Total costs fell by 4 per cent, or £5.0 million, 
reflecting closed operations and the benefits of 
restructuring, offset by cost investment in new 
revenue initiatives in the regional business. 
EBITDA as a result was £9.1 million, down 
from £11.4 million in 2007 and EBITDA margin 
fell by 1.2 points to 6.7 per cent. Depreciation 
was broadly flat, resulting in operating profit of 
£2.5 million (2007: £4.9 million).
 
Financial overview – reported
Revenue and operating profit differ between 
the like-for-like and reported results only as 
a consequence of movements in foreign 
currency rates. 
Operating exceptional items totalled £3.2 
million (2007: £2.0 million), primarily due to 
the costs of redundancy and costs on the 
closure of the national business’s books 
business. Amortisation of acquired intangibles 
was £3.4 million (2007: £2.6 million) and an 
impairment charge of £26.1 million (2007: £nil) 
was recognised against the carrying amount 
of goodwill and acquired intangibles, with 
the result that Poland recorded an operating 
loss after exceptional items and amortisation 
of acquired intangibles of £30.2 million (2007: 
profit of £0.7 million).

Business portal
The challenge:
Presspublica’s key competitor in the business publishing arena is Infor, a company that publishes a 
whole range of specialist business and legal titles, including Gazeta Prawna. They have a very strong 
online presence and achieve high brand recognition among the division’s subscribers. The quality of 
Presspublica’s online proposition in this area has historically been inferior to Infor’s. This has been a 
competitive threat to the business and a limiting factor to growing the division’s online audience.
The solution:
Presspublica’s existing website, Dobra 
Firma, which is part of Rzeczpospolita 
website, rp.pl, was significantly 
expanded. The access to the upgraded 
site was free in 2008 but will be 
subscriber-only in 2009 as part of a 
premium package which will generate 
a new revenue stream for the division.
The result:
Presspublica’s strong response to a competitive threat  
has been appreciated by its readers. The major product 
development led to a huge improvement to the existing 
website. This provides a good justification for increasing 
the subscription price in 2009 and creating a new revenue 
stream. The enhanced subscription product allows 
Presspublica to claim “Now with Rzeczpospolita you  
can have everything – you do not need to subscribe  
to any other titles”.

Divisional review
Germany
As announced on 13 January 2009, 
the Group sold its German division, 
Berliner Verlag, to M. DuMont Schauberg 
and this disposal completed on  
27 March 2009.
In 2008, Berliner Zeitung increased its share 
of the Berlin subscription paper advertising 
market from 15 per cent to 16 per cent and 
Berliner Kurier’s share of the Berlin tabloid 
paper advertising market increased from 8 
per cent to 9 per cent. The readership share of 
Berliner Kurier in Berlin increased from 12.7 per 
cent in 2007 to 14.7 per cent in 2008, while the 
share of Berliner Zeitung decreased from 19.9 
per cent to 17 .8 per cent. The market share 
of both titles combined remained stable at  
33 per cent of the Berlin newspaper market.
The magazine, TIP, increased its circulation 
market share from 12 per cent in 2007 to 13 
per cent in 2008, thus maintaining its leading 
position both in Berlin and Germany. The 
advertising market share however decreased 
from 40 per cent to 38 per cent as a result 
of the decreasing overall advertising market 
for print and the price cutting strategies of 
other publications. The free-sheet Berliner 
Abendblatt decreased its share of the total 
Berlin printed free-sheet advertising market 
from 40 per cent to 30 per cent and decreased 
its circulation market share from 46 per cent in 
2007 to 40 per cent in 2008.
Hamburger Morgenpost launched its sub-
local supplement Blickpunkt offering articles 
and advertisements targeted at each Hamburg 
district thus emphasising its strength in local 
coverage. Berliner Zeitung and Berliner 
Kurier are jointly publishing a new real 
estate magazine, Immobilien, attracting new 
advertising clients by offering a new quality 
platform. The editorial co-operation between 
Berliner Kurier and Hamburger Morgenpost is 
providing higher quality local news coverage 
with some of the political news editors now 
writing for the local news section.
In 2008, a newsroom was set up in Berliner 
Kurier serving News, Local, Online desks as 
well as layout and production. At the same 
time, Berliner Zeitung created a newsroom in 
which all Netzeitung editors were integrated 
and articles from Berliner Zeitung, especially 
those with nationwide interest, are now 
accessible on netzeitung.de. Most of the 
division’s websites have been relaunched 
and now include user-generated content and 
interactive forums. 
One key development during the year has 
been the development of a web shop in 
order to enable the division to market its 
brand endorsed goods and services to 
readers and users across all its titles and 
websites (Enterprises). Berliner Verlag has 
used Berlingke’s web shop lidtmere.dk as

Enterprises continued with its successful 
programme of holiday offers and held up well 
despite increasing levels of competition from  
new market entrants. TIP magazine regularly 
offers DVD and CD covermounts as well as 
booklet covermounts on special topics and 
publishes five special editions each year. 
Berliner Zeitung and Berliner Kurier also 
launched a programme of book offers in the 
year. Marketing for these book offers appeared 
both in paper and in a monthly catalogue insert 
offering 10 different books. All the successful 
Enterprises initiatives launched in Berlin were 
also rolled out at Hamburger Morgenpost.

Financial overview – like-for-like
Total revenue fell by £3.9 million or 3 per cent 
during the year to 31 December 2008, from 
£123.2 million to £119.3 million. Advertising 
revenue fell by 9 per cent, with the decline 
accelerating from a first half decline of 6 per 
cent to 11 per cent in the second half. All 
Mecom Germany titles were affected by the 
decline, with the division’s free-sheets and bi-
weekly magazine falling most in percentage 
terms. 
Circulation revenue, which is over 55 per 
cent newsstand sales in highly competitive 
markets, fell by 1 per cent, with the loss of 
volumes more than offsetting price increases. 
Other revenue increases reflected the growth 
in a number of initiatives, including call centre 
and content sales.
Costs (including share of results of associates) 
fell by £2.3 million, or 2 per cent, reflecting 
mainly the benefit of staff restructuring, 
resulting in EBITDA of £15.3 million, down from 
£16.9 million in 2007. EBITDA and operating 
margins fell marginally to 12.8 per cent and 9.9 
per cent, respectively. 
Financial overview – reported
1
The increase in the reported revenue and 
operating profit between 2007 and 2008 
results primarily from a full year’s ownership 
of Mecom Germany in 2008 (acquired in 
April 2007) and the strengthening of the euro 
against sterling. Operating exceptional items of 
£3.6 million (2007: £2.5 million) were recorded, 
related mainly due to staff restructuring. 
Amortisation of acquired intangibles was £6.3 
million (2007: £3.9 million), increasing because 
of a full year’s ownership and currency effects. 
An impairment charge of £149.3 million (2007: 
£nil) was recorded against goodwill to write 
the net assets of Germany down to the net 
disposal proceeds on its sale in March 2009.

The financial results for the year to 31 
December 2008, and the financial position 
of the Group at that date, were affected by a 
number of important factors:
the inclusion of the results of Wegener (within •	
the Netherlands segment) and Mecom 
Germany (within discontinued operations, 
as explained below) for a full financial year 
whereas in the year to 31 December 2007 
the results of Wegener were included 
only from 25 October 2007 and Mecom 
Germany only from 12 April 2007 , the dates 
on which the Group acquired Wegener and 
Mecom Germany, respectively. This report 
explains the reported results of the Group as 
set out in the financial statements, whereas 
the Group highlights and Divisional reviews 
on pages 13, 20 to 32 provide a comparison 
of the current year’s results against the prior 
year’s on a like-for-like basis, that is as if the 
Group had owned each of its businesses for 
the entire two year period;
the treatment of Mecom Germany as a •	
discontinued operation as at 31 December 
2008, with the result that Mecom 
Germany’s result (for both the current and 
prior financial year) and the loss recorded 
in writing down Mecom Germany’s 
goodwill are shown as a single-line item in 
the income statement below the profit after 
tax result of the Group and its assets and 
liabilities recorded as “held for sale” in the 
balance sheet (more detailed information 
is given in Note 13 to the consolidated 
financial statements);
the recognition of impairment charges of •	
£861.3 million on continuing businesses, 
against the carrying amount of goodwill, 
intangible assets and other non-current 
assets of the Group’s continuing businesses 
(and the loss on the remeasurement of 
the assets of the German business of 
£149.3 million), reflecting the effect that 
the current economic crisis has had on 
the performance and prospects of the  
Group’s businesses; and
the sharp increase in the relative strength  •	
of the currencies of the countries in 
which the Group operates, in particular 
the euro, which affected the results as 
presented in sterling and the value of 
assets and liabilities in the 31 December 
2008 balance sheet – the exchange rates 
used in the consolidation of the Group’s 
financial statements are given in Note 4 
to the consolidated financial statements. 
The Group has decided to change its 
presentational currency from sterling to the 
euro from 1 January 2009 and will therefore 
present future financial statements in euro. 
In the income statement, the Group has 
presented exceptional items and amortisation 
of acquired intangibles separately and excluded 
these items in presenting the “adjusted 
results” referred to in this Annual report and 
accounts to allow shareholders to understand 
better the elements of financial performance 
in the period. The Group separates the 
amortisation of acquired intangibles because, 
whilst accounting standards require the 
recognition of amortisation as an expense, it

set out in Note 10 to the consolidated financial 
statements. 
The Group’s financial key performance 
indicators are revenue growth, adjusted 
EBITDA margin and adjusted operating margin. 
These are considered in the Group highlights 
and Divisional reviews, on a like-for-like basis. 
Information on these performance indicators 
on a reported basis is set out in Note 6 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
Revenue and earnings before interest 
and tax from continuing operations
Revenue from continuing operations for the 
year to 31 December 2008 was £1,408.3 
million, up £503.5 million from the prior 
year. The increase includes the effect of the 
ownership of Wegener for a full year and 
the relative strength of the currencies of the 
countries in which the Group operates, in 
part offset by an underlying decrease in the 
advertising revenue of the Group’s businesses. 
The advertising revenue performance of the 
Group was affected in the final months of the 
year by the current economic crisis.
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations 
was £148.0 million, up £46.0 million from that 
of the prior year. The increase reflects again 
the effect of the ownership of Wegener for 
a full year and the relative strength of the 
currencies of the countries in which the Group 
operates, offset in part by a deterioration in the 
EBITDA margin of the Group as the shortfall in 
underlying advertising revenue was matched 
only in part by reductions in cost. The Group’s 
restructuring activities (and the net effect 
of acquisitions and disposals) resulted in a 
decrease in average headcount of 830 (7 
per cent) during 2008, in all areas other than 
editorial staff.
Depreciation and amortisation of software 
increased by £23. 1 million, resulting in adjusted 
operating profit from continuing operations 
of £92.8 million, up by £22.9 million from the 
year to 31 December 2007 . As with revenue 
and adjusted EBITDA, this increase is the net 
effect of increases resulting from movements 
in foreign exchange rates and the increase in 
the size of the Group, more than offsetting an 
underlying decrease in the Group’s adjusted 
operating profit margins.
Exceptional items recognised in operating loss 
totalled £74.2 million, compared with £47.2 
million for the year to 31 December 2007 , 
and included staff redundancy costs resulting 
from the Group’s restructuring activities in the 
Netherlands and Denmark, costs associated 
with the reorganisation and refurbishment  
of the Copenhagen offices and the cost of  
the Company’s admission to the main list  
of the London Stock Exchange, as explained 
in Note 10 to the consolidated financial 
statements. Management estimates that the 
level of exceptional cash cost in 2009 will be 
circa €80 million, including circa €20 million 
of costs related to the amendments of the 
facility agreement and further restructuring 
costs, including the Delta restructuring project 
to be undertaken in 2009 in the Netherlands 
and payments made on provisions related to 
previously completed restructurings. Charges 
for impairment of goodwill and of acquired 
intangibles of the continuing businesses were 
£855.9 million (2007: £nil). Full details of the 
charges are given in Notes 15, 16, 17 , 18 and 
20 to the consolidated financial statements. 
Amortisation of acquired intangibles was £60.6 
million, up by £27 .2 million from the prior year, 
reflecting the full-year effect of the acquisitions 
of Wegener and Mecom Germany as well as 
the weakening of sterling.
The resulting operating loss after exceptional 
items and the amortisation of acquired 
intangibles was £903.3 million, compared  
with £10.7 million in 2007 .
Finance items and taxation from 
continuing operations
Net finance expense before exceptional items 
was £39.7 million, up from £22.8 million in 
2007 . The increase includes the effect of 
additional borrowings taken out to finance 
the acquisitions of Wegener during 2007 and, 
since the Group’s borrowings and interest 
cost are largely denominated in currencies 
other than sterling, the relative strength of 
these other currencies during the period. 
As explained in Note 26 to the consolidated 
financial statements, the margin applicable 
to the Group’s borrowings was increased to 
350 basis points from 22 December 2008 as 
part of amendments to the facility agreement 
agreed with the Group’s lending banks; the 
terms of the revised facility agreement that 
has been agreed with the Group’s lending 
banks are set out below in Note 26 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
Exceptional finance items include costs of 
the amendments made to the bank facility 
agreement in December 2008. The total fees 
were £3.3 million, of which £2.9 million relates 
to continuing operations.
The Group’s effective tax rate on adjusted 
profit before tax (adjusted for associates 
whose earnings are presented after tax) was 
30 per cent (2007: 31 per cent), which is more 
than the weighted blended statutory rate of the 
countries in which the Group operates owing 
to the presence of non-deductible items. This 
is likely to remain at this level in 2009.
The total tax expense on the loss before tax 
after exceptional items and amortisation of 
acquired intangibles was £1.5 million (2007: 
credit of £10.2 million). Of which, the tax 
effect of exceptional items and amortisation 
of acquired intangibles was a credit of £45.6 
million. The relatively low tax credit compared 
with the total exceptional charges relates 
to the non-deductibility for tax purposes 
of the goodwill write-down. The credit in 
respect of acquired intangibles results 
from the release of deferred tax liabilities 
recorded on acquisition of the Group’s 
businesses and is therefore a non-cash item. 
ARTWORK NOTE: BASELINE GRID IS BEING USED ON THIS JOB 35
Overview
In addition, an exceptional tax charge of  
£32.4 million was recorded to provide against 
carried forward losses that were considered 
to be no longer recoverable. 
Discontinued operations
The profit after tax of Mecom Germany is 
shown in the “discontinued operations” 
line in the income statement. The adjusted 
result after tax of £6.3 million is £2.5 million 
higher than last year, reflecting a full year of 
ownership in 2008 compared with eight and 
a half months in 2007 . The charge of £163.0 
million for exceptional items and amortisation 
of acquired intangibles includes an impairment 
loss recognised on the re-measurement of the 
assets and liabilities of Mecom Germany to 
fair value (less costs to sell) of £149.3 million, 
exceptional items charged to operating 
profit of £3.6 million (2007: £2.5 million), the 
amortisation of acquired intangibles of £6.3m 
(2007: £3.9 million) and finance exceptionals  
of £0.9 million (2007: £2.1 million). Full details 
are set out in Note 13 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
Earnings per share and dividends
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing 
operations were 2.1 pence, down from 2.6 
pence in 2007 . Adjusted earnings per share 
from continuing and discontinued operations 
were 2.5 pence, down from 2.9 pence in 2007 . 
The retained profit used for the calculation of 
adjusted earnings per share increased from 
£36.8 million to £38.6 million and the average 
number of shares in issue increased from 
1,278 million to 1,572 million, resulting from 
share issues part way through 2007 . The 
unadjusted loss per share from continuing 
operations was 60.3 pence (2007: 2.1 pence) 
and the unadjusted loss per share from 
continuing and discontinued operations was 
70.3 pence (2007: 1.9 pence).
The Group paid no dividends in the year to 
31 December 2008 (2007: £nil).
Cash flow
Cash generated from operations (which 
includes the cash flows of Mecom Germany) 
was £111.6 million, an increase of £28.5 million 
from 2007 . Adjusted EBITDA (for the entire 
Group) increased by £50.0 million; there was 
a net inflow from working capital in the year to 
31 December 2008 of £31.2 million, compared 
with a net inflow of £21.6 million in 2007 (which 
included the effect of the timing of the Group’s 
2007 acquisitions with the working capital 
cycle of the businesses acquired). Capital 
expenditure payments were £68.8 million 
(2007: £34.6 million); receipts from the sale of 
assets were £12.0 million (2007: £8.1 million). 
Tax paid was £1.7 million (2007: £9.1 million).
In line with guidance given at the interim 
results in 2008, capital expenditure is likely to 
fall to around €50 million in 2009, as the final 
stages of the Wegener repressing programme 
are implemented.
Net finance costs paid were £37 .9 million (2007: 
£28.6 million), in addition to which the Group 
paid cash costs in respect of the amendment 
of the terms of the Group’s bank borrowings 
of £2.3 million. The income statement charge 
for net finance expense included non-cash 
expenses related to imputed interest on 
discounted liabilities of £2.3 million (2007: £1.5 
million) and the amortisation of prepaid debt 
issue costs of £2.9 million (2007: £0.3 million).
The Group recorded a net cash outflow from 
acquisitions and disposals of £1.2 million. 
Disposals comprised the De Trompetter free-
sheet business in the Netherlands segment 
(net proceeds of £15.8 million), and a Direct 
Marketing business in the Norway segment 
(net proceeds of £3.8 million). Acquisitions 
included digital businesses in the Norway 
segment (net cash outflow of £7.6 million) 
and the purchase of the remaining 7 per cent 
of Mecom Germany that the Group did not 
previously own (£5.3 million). The cash outflow 
of £502.4 million in 2007 included amounts 
related to the acquisition of 78 per cent of 
Mecom Germany (£86.9 million) and 86.4 per 
cent of Wegener (£401.1 million).
Net proceeds from borrowings, derivatives 
and obligations under finance leases during 
the year were £8.3 million (2007: net repayment 
of £97 .3 million). In 2007 , the Group raised 
£556.4 million (net of expenses) from the  
issue of share capital. 
The net increase in cash and cash equivalents 
in 2008 was £21.1 million (2007: decrease  
of £17 .4 million) which when added to the 
amount at the beginning of the year of 
£73.1 million and with net foreign exchange 
differences of £14.5 million resulted in cash 
and cash equivalents at the end of 2008 of 
£108.7 million. 
Financial position
The Group’s closing net debt was £669.3 
million (2007: £524.3 million), comprising 
borrowings of £744.6 million (2007: £588.9 
million), obligations under finance leases of 
£24.3 million (2007: £18.5 million), liabilities 
associated with interest rate swaps and 
other derivative liabilities of £9.4 million (2007: 
assets of £6.7 million) borrowings included 
within liabilities directly associated with assets 
held for sale of £4.5 million (2007: £nil) and 
cash and cash equivalents of £113.5 million 
(2007: £76.4 million). Cash balances at 31 
December 2008 included prepaid annual 
and quarterly subscription receipts collected 
at the very end of the year. In the absence of 
a fully signed revised facility agreement for its 
bank borrowings, the Group has classified all 
bank borrowings as current at 31 December 
2008. In addition, the convertible loan note of 
£30.1 million (at 31 December 2008) became 
payable within one year. 
The effect of foreign currency movements was 
to increase the Group’s net borrowings by 
£135.0 million; the euro sterling exchange rate 
at 31 December 2008 was 1.03, compared 
with 1.36 at 31 December 2007 . Including  
other non-cash movements of £21.8 million, 
closing net debt increased from £524.3 million 
to £669.3 million.
The Group’s equity decreased by £853.7 
million in the year to 31 December 2008. The 
retained loss of £1,107 .8 million was partially 
offset by net income recognised directly in 
equity of £256.5 million, including exchange 
differences on retranslation of the Group’s 
subsidiaries of £270.7 million. Minority interest 
increased during the year by £2.7 million, 
including the minority interest’s share of net 
income recognised directly in equity.
Financial and liquidity risk and  
going concern
The basis on which the consolidated financial 
statements have been prepared on the going 
concern basis, and the uncertainties related 
to the Group’s ability to continue in operational 
existence in the foreseeable future, are set out 
below.
The Group’s financial risk factors are set 
out in Note 27 to the consolidated financial 
statements.
Background to negotiations on revised 
bank agreement and proposals for an 
equity issue
The Group’s primary sources of funding are 
shareholders’ equity and bank borrowings. 
During the second half of 2008, a marked 
deterioration in advertising revenues affecting 
the Group’s profitability indicated that the 
Group’s leverage was too high for the current 
economic conditions.
In December 2008, the Group announced 
its intention to reduce borrowings and, at the 
same time, entered into an agreement with its 
lending banks to defer the testing of financial 
covenants in its bank facilities agreement 
from 31 December 2008 to 28 February 2009 
(which was subsequently deferred further to 31 
March 2009, then further to 30 April 2009 and 
further to 31 May 2009, as explained below) 
and engaged in discussions to renegotiate the 
terms of its bank facilities. 
The Group announced the disposal of its 
German operations in January 2009 for 
consideration of €152.0 million (£147.0 million) 
and of its northwest Norwegian operations in 
February 2009 for NOK559.3 million (£55.5 
million) as part of its strategy to reduce its 
borrowings. The cash proceeds from these 
disposals were received by the Group on 27 
March 2009 and 2 April 2009, respectively.
The Group announced on 23 March 2009 that 
it has been examining the merits of an equity 
fund-raising.
The Group announced on 1 April 2009 that 
it had also agreed with the holders of its 
convertible loan notes an extension to the 
maturity of these notes from 12 April to 12 
May 2009, although it was agreed that this 
extension would accelerate to 30 April 2009 
under certain conditions.  
On 29 April 2009, the Group entered into 
an agreement with its lending banks for a 
further deferral of the testing date of financial 
covenants until 31 May 2009 and the Group 
ARTWORK NOTE: BASELINE GRID IS BEING USED ON THIS JOB 36 Mecom Group plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Overview
Group 
Finance 
Director’s 
report
continued
agreed a further extension of the maturity of 
the convertible loan notes to 12 July 2009, 
although it was agreed that this extension 
would accelerate to 31 May 2009 under 
certain conditions. 
In principle agreement with lending banks 
on proposed revised bank facility 
agreement and with investors on 
proposed equity issue
On 29 April 2009, the Group:
reached “in principle” agreement with its •	
lending banks (subject to the completion 
and signing of full documentation and 
subject to the completion of the proposed 
equity issue by no later than 14 July 2009) 
on the terms of a proposed revised bank 
facility agreement. The agreement given by 
the banks on the key terms of the proposed 
revised facility agreement are not binding 
on the banks but each of the banks has 
received credit committee approval for 
the same and the Group believes that it is 
highly likely that full documentation will be 
signed in May 2009; and
received non-binding commitments from •	
current and prospective shareholders 
(which will be conditional upon, inter alia, 
the Group agreeing acceptable banking 
terms with its lenders, publishing a 
prospectus and obtaining shareholder 
approval) to subscribe to a proposed 
equity issue of approximately £140 million 
(before expenses). The Group intends 
repaying the convertible loan notes from 
these proceeds.
The Group expects to complete and to sign 
full banking documentation during May 2009, 
after which it expects that a prospectus for the 
issue of new shares will be issued with a view 
to receiving the proceeds of the equity issue 
during June 2009.
In the event that full banking documentation is 
not completed on the terms currently agreed 
or that the proposed equity issue does not 
happen, the Group would continue discussion 
with its bank lenders with a view to agreeing 
alternative banking terms, but the directors 
cannot determine at this stage whether, or 
on what basis, alternative terms would be 
agreed.
In the event that full banking documentation is 
not completed on the terms currently agreed 
or that the proposed equity issue does not 
happen, the Group would also expect to 
enter into discussions with the holders of the 
Group’s convertible loan notes to restructure 
the maturity of these notes, which would then 
be due currently and which the Group would 
be unable, in the absence of the agreement 
of the Group’s lending banks, to repay. The 
directors cannot determine at this stage what 
the outcome of these discussions would be.
In the event that the full banking documentation 
is not completed on the terms currently 
agreed or that the proposed equity issue 
does not happen, the Group’s ability to 
continue operating as a going concern would 
be dependent, therefore, on the outcome of 
these discussions with its lending banks and 
with the holders of the convertible loan notes.
 
Key terms of the proposed revised bank 
facility agreement
The key terms of the revised bank deal (on the 
basis that the share issue proceeds and after 
applying the proceeds of the share issue) will 
be as follows:
total facilities of circa €600 million including •	
a term facility maturing in October 2013 of 
€350 million, a revolving credit facility of up 
to €200 million maturing in October 2013 
and an additional term loan facility of circa 
€50 million;
the amount of the revolving credit facility •	
will vary according to the Group’s projected 
working capital requirements and to the 
amount of gross cash on the Group’s 
balance sheet;
margin on the term loan facility of 350 basis •	
points over the relevant inter-bank rate, 
with a 200 basis points additional non-
cash margin on the additional term loan 
facility accruing from 1 January 2010 and 
increasing by a further 200 basis points 
on 1 June 2010 and by a further 200 basis 
points on 1 January 2011;
margin on the revolving credit facility of 300 •	
basis points;
cash margin under both the term and •	
revolving credit facilities are subject to 
downward adjustment in the event that the 
Group’s leverage falls below 3.0 times or 
2.0 times respectively;
leverage, interest cover and operating cash •	
flow covenants tested at 30 June 2010, 31 
December 2010 and quarterly thereafter; 
June 2010 leverage covenant of 5.25 times, •	
falling to 4.50 times at 31 December 2010;
covenants on the total capital expenditure •	
and exceptional items of the Group, tested 
annually from 31 December 2009; and
warrants over the Company’s shares •	
issued to the banks which would represent 
5 per cent of the existing (pre-equity issue) 
share capital of the Company.
In assessing the Group’s ability to remain in 
compliance with the terms of the revised 
facility agreement in the foreseeable future, 
the directors have taken into account the fact 
that the leverage, interest cover and operating 
cash flow covenants would not be tested 
under the proposed revised facility agreement 
within twelve months of the date of these 
financial statements. 
The directors have also considered the 
Group’s financial projections for the twelve 
month period from these financial statements 
as they affect the proposed revised bank 
facility agreement in respect of conditions 
other than the leverage, interest cover and 
operating cash flow covenants. In making 
its financial projections for these purposes, 
the Group has taken into account that it 
currently generates around 50 per cent of 
its revenue from advertising, the markets for 
which have tended in the past to reflect the 
general economic conditions of the countries 
ARTWORK NOTE: BASELINE GRID IS BEING USED ON THIS JOB 37
Overview
in which the Group operates. The remainder 
of the Group’s revenue includes circulation 
revenue (around 35 per cent of total revenue), 
which has more stable characteristics 
compared with advertising revenue and has 
not previously been affected by prevailing 
economic conditions to the extent that 
advertising revenue has been.
The Group’s advertising markets have 
experienced a considerable and systematic 
downturn in recent months and, although the 
experience of recent weeks’ trading suggests 
that some stabilisation at these lower levels 
has occurred, the advertising environment 
remains challenging and uncertain.  
In making assumptions of future advertising 
revenue for the purposes of assessing its ability 
to comply with the terms of the proposed 
revised facility agreement, the Group has 
used a combination of long-term trends, 
industry and third-party forecasts and internal 
estimates which reflect recent experience 
in each of our markets. If the actual outturn 
is adverse to these assumptions, the Group 
has identified a number of further mitigating 
actions that it could take to reduce costs or 
borrowings further.
Going concern basis in the financial 
statements
The directors believe that the combination 
of the circumstances described above, 
in particular (a) the uncertainty as to the 
completion of a revised facility agreement on 
the terms currently agreed (b) the uncertainty 
as to whether the non-binding commitments 
of investors to underwrite the issue of new 
share capital will result in new shares being 
issued, with the completion of the revised 
facility arrangements and the issue of equity 
being inter-conditional, and (c) the uncertainty, 
in the event that the revised facility agreement 
is not completed on terms currently agreed 
or that the new share capital is not issued, 
as to whether the Group could reach 
satisfactory agreement with the holders of 
its convertible loan notes as to an extension 
of the maturity of those notes, all of which 
three factors existing within a highly uncertain 
advertising environment, represent a material 
uncertainty that casts significant doubt on 
the Group’s and the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. Nevertheless, 
after making enquiries, and considering the 
uncertainties described above, the directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
and the Company have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. For these reasons, they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the Annual report and accounts.
Treasury
Details of the Group’s bank borrowing 
facility, which is the main source of the 
Group’s funding, are given in Note 26 to the 
consolidated financial statements. The Group 
agreed an amendment to the terms of this 
facility on 18 December 2008, which had the 
effect of deferring the testing of the year-end 
financial covenants under the facility from 31 
December 2008 to 28 February 2009 as well 
as restricting the Group’s ability to draw on the 
revolving credit facility. The Group paid £2.3 
million as a fee to the banks in connection with 
this amendment.
The Group manages treasury matters centrally, 
through the Group Treasurer and the treasury 
function in the Group’s head office in London. The 
Group treasury function manages the Group’s 
borrowings facilities and short- and medium-
term liquidity position and monitors the Group’s 
treasury risks. A Treasury Committee, which 
includes the Group Finance Director, the Group 
Treasurer, the Group Head of Corporate Finance 
and the Group Financial Controller, provides 
guidance on treasury matters and oversees risk 
management.
The Group is exposed to treasury risks arising 
from exposure to movements in market interest 
rates and to foreign currency rates. 
The Group has a policy of keeping between 40 
per cent and 80 per cent of its borrowings at 
fixed rates, so as to provide some certainty on its 
interest costs while leaving open the opportunity 
to benefit from any future reductions in interest 
rates.
The Group has drawn its borrowings in the 
operating currencies of its businesses, principally 
in euros and in Danish and Norwegian krone, 
to match the currency of interest payments 
and anticipated repayments of principal with 
the Group’s operating cash flows. The foreign 
currency borrowings also provide a balance 
sheet hedge for the Group’s operating assets and 
liabilities, all of which are denominated in foreign 
currencies. 
The Group’s principal performance indicators 
in respect of financing and treasury matters are 
the ratios of net debt to adjusted EBITDA and of 
adjusted EBITDA to adjusted net interest expense. 
As well as being well-recognised measures for 
monitoring the strength of financial condition, 
these two measures form the basis of covenants 
in the Group’s bank borrowing arrangements.
Principal accounting policies
The Group’s significant accounting policies 
are described in detail in Note 4 to the  
consolidated financial statements. The significant 
accounting judgements and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty are set out in Note 5 to the 
consolidated financial statements and relate to 
the following:
critical judgements
taxation; and •	
recoverability of deferred tax assets. •	
estimation and assumptions
impairment of goodwill and acquired  •	
intangibles;
valuation of acquired intangibles; •	
useful lives of acquired intangibles; •	
provisions; and •	
employee benefit obligations. •

Overview
Principal 
risks and 
uncertainties 
The Group’s principal risks and uncertainties, together with the actions that management 
is taking to mitigate each, are set out below. In the current economic climate the 
Board considers that the mitigating actions have increased in relevance and progress  
in each area is therefore being closely monitored by executive management with regular  
Board updates.
The Group recognises that risk is an inherent part of doing business and has therefore  
adopted a process for identifying, evaluating and managing the risks faced by its business 
(as described in the Corporate governance report). The risks to which the Group is potentially 
exposed cover a wide range of factors: competition, legislation, fiscal, regulatory, political, 
financial, terrorism, economic, social and operational. Each could impact on the Group’s 
revenue, operating profit, net assets and liquidity.
Risk Description Management action
Market place Short term – Reduction in advertising revenue in the current economic downturn
In common with the majority of publishing businesses, the 
Group’s revenues are traditionally heavily dependent on 
advertising which comprised approximately 50 per cent of 
total revenue in 2008. 
The economic crisis, which started in 2008, has attacked all 
categories of advertising with print adverts for employment, 
property and motor vehicles more affected than other 
groups. The Group experienced approximately a 10 per 
cent reduction in advertising revenue during the second half 
of 2008 and this trend has continued and deepened into  
early 2009.
The Group has already commenced urgent steps to mitigate 
the shortfall in advertising by setting up programmes to take 
considerable costs out of its businesses and in accelerating 
the development of new revenue from alternative sources. 
However, it may not be able to do this quickly or sufficiently 
leading to reduced profitability in the short term.
Medium term – Negative effect of internet advertising on traditional advertising
Across the market, the print media’s share of advertising is 
declining and this trend is likely to continue into the medium 
term as customers exercise their choice to advertise over the 
internet rather than in newspapers.
The Group is taking decisive action to accelerate its 
transformation from a pure print company into a consumer 
content business and seeking new digital revenue streams  
and new media products as fast as possible. Management 
expects that new consumer products and services will 
be introduced in line with its required time schedules, but 
cannot yet assess whether the new revenue streams will fully 
compensate for the traditional revenues that have already 
been lost.
Long term – Erosion of demand for printed newspapers
The Group’s newspapers have experienced circulation volume 
declines over recent years, in common with the newspaper 
industry in general. To date we have been able to offset  
these volume declines by cover price and subscription rate 
increases such that circulation revenue has remained  
broadly constant.
However, there is now a risk that the rate of volume decrease 
will be exacerbated as a result of the current economic 
conditions and that the Group will be less successful than  
in the past at compensating volume declines with increases 
in cover price and subscription rates.
Given the Group’s in-depth understanding of the markets in 
which it operates, it is able to withstand some of the downward 
pressures being felt on newspaper volumes across media 
businesses by maintaining and improving the quality of its 
portfolio of strong premium products in the marketplace.
The Group is leveraging its expert knowledge of its local 
markets and customers to maximum advantage by improving 
the relevance of its papers to the readers in the individual 
markets in which it operates.

Overview
Risk Description Management action
Operational 
performance
The Group’s margins will be eroded if its cost base is not 
reduced quickly to offset the detrimental effects of inflation 
on salaries, given the Group’s high proportion of staff costs, 
and on the cost of its raw materials, most notably newsprint.
The Group’s strategy for protecting margins relies on 
identifying operating synergies which are often achieved 
through reorganisations, the introduction of more efficient 
work practices and realising economies of scale. However, the 
cost of structural change in continental European economies 
is potentially very high. In addition, the Group operates in 
countries with labour laws and agreements that differ from 
the UK and where employees generally enjoy stronger 
protection. The Group’s ability to generate cost savings on 
a timely basis may therefore be hampered by strikes, illegal 
industrial action or new regulation from governments in any 
of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
The Group continually seeks ways of improving its productivity 
to protect its margins. In addition it has established priority 
programmes in all divisions in the light of the economic 
downturn. These programmes will drive improvements in our 
business models by making our businesses more innovative, 
securing better ways of working, leveraging cross-Group 
benefits from scale and removing old “industry practices”. 
For example, outsourcing and partnering arrangements 
have already been agreed to make best use of underutilised 
capacity. In considering the best option, attention is always 
given to the cash impact as well as to optimising the return.
To tackle rising costs the Group has already carried out a 
strategic review of procurement which has enabled it to: secure 
more competitive prices for raw materials and other key supplies; 
reduce discretionary spend and improve demand management. 
To ensure that the Group is able to implement the structural 
changes needed in its business, it is committed to working 
constructively with governments and other regulatory bodies. 
It is challenging previous collective bargaining and industry 
practices to make its cost base more flexible and is engaging 
in constructive dialogue with unions and works councils to 
develop effective relationships in each case.
Business 
continuity
The Group is highly dependent on the continuous 
operation of its print plants, packing lines and supporting IT 
infrastructure to get its print products to its customers. It also 
depends on the high availability of its many websites which 
allow its customers access to online products and services. 
A significant and extended loss of a major facility, whether 
through natural causes, deliberate acts or breakdown, could 
result in a loss of revenue.
All divisions are required to maintain business continuity 
plans and to update these to reflect the re-organisations and 
restructurings taking place within its business. Each division is 
also required to develop a programme for the testing of these 
plans to ensure their effectiveness and relevance.
The Group is also reviewing its printing plant maintenance 
programmes and maintains insurance to protect against 
catastrophic risks.
Funding The Group is financed by significant bank borrowings, as well 
as shareholders’ equity. As explained in the Group Finance 
Director’s report and Note 4 to the consolidated financial 
statements, the Group has agreed “in principle” terms for a 
revision and extension to the its bank borrowings. Further as 
explained in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, 
the Group faces the risk, in the short term, that these “in 
principle” terms do not result in a signed revised facility 
agreement. The Group also faces the risk, in the medium- 
to longer-term, that it is not able to comply with financial 
covenants in the proposed revised bank facility agreement, 
the key financial covenants being tested first at June 2010. 
The Group expects that the “in principle” terms agreed 
with its lending banks will result in a signed revised facility 
agreement, since the key terms (which cover substantially all 
major commercial and financial matters) have been agreed 
by the credit committees of each of its lending banks and the 
remaining steps to conclude full bank documentation should 
not be contentious.
The Group has initiated a number of actions to reduce its 
borrowings and to provide the financial stability needed to 
operate within the terms of its banking agreements in the 
current difficult economic conditions. Cost reduction plans 
are underway and the Group operates a policy of strict 
management of cash expenditure. The Group has completed 
or announced disposals in recent months to reduce the 
absolute levels of its bank borrowings and to improve its 
leverage ratios.
Exchange 
rates
The Group will report its results in euro from 1 January 2009. 
The Group will then be exposed in its reported results and 
balance sheet position to movements in exchange rates 
between the euro and the other currencies in which the Group 
operates, principally the Norwegian krone and Polish zloty.
The Group has borrowed in Norwegian krone to reduce its 
net balance sheet exposure to movements between the  
euro and the krone.
Key
management
The Group’s success depends on its ability to attract, 
motivate and retain highly qualified employees who have 
extensive experience and knowledge of the industry at a 
strategic level.
T o attract, retain and motivate the best talents, the Group provides 
a competitive remuneration package for its key management  
and employees. Succession planning from the level of Country 
CEOs up to the Chief Executive has also been put in place.
Certain risks and uncertainties arise through factors that are outside the control of management, for example, inflation or interest rates. 
Nevertheless in each case management seeks to minimise the impact on the Group from such external events, for example, by hedging through 
interest rate swaps as set out in the Group Finance Director’s report under the heading of “Treasury”. In other cases risks may appear that are 
presently unanticipated as the Group develops its new business models.
ARTWORK NOTE: BASELINE GRID IS BEING USED ON THIS JOB 40 Mecom Group plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Overview
Corporate 
social 
responsibility
Mecom is committed to responsible corporate 
behaviour. As a dedicated media group 
Mecom believes that its reputation is based 
on maintaining high standards of business 
conduct in its relationships with employees 
and stakeholders, being customers, readers, 
shareholders, suppliers, governments, 
competitors and the local communities in 
which Mecom operates.
To underwrite Mecom’s commitment, a 
Code of Business Conduct (the “Code”) has 
been implemented across the Group to help 
employees develop a clear understanding of 
the principles and ethical values that Mecom 
wants to uphold. The Code is available on 
Mecom’s website. Each division has translated 
the Code into its local language and made 
it available to employees on their intranets. 
Compliance with the Code is important for 
maintaining and building the reputation of 
the Group as a responsible and trustworthy 
business partner, employer, supplier and 
corporate citizen.
The Code forms the core element of the 
Group’s corporate responsibility framework 
which comprises a set of policies and 
controls that govern how Mecom acts as an 
organisation and how Mecom interacts with 
its stakeholders in conducting business. It is 
not possible to anticipate every situation that 
may arise. The Code is therefore necessarily 
broad and general in nature and is not 
intended to replace more detailed policies 
and procedures within individual divisions.  
A whistleblowing policy is also in place  
within the Group for employees to raise 
concerns, in confidence, about possible 
wrongdoing, dishonest or unethical behaviour. 
The Code protects anyone choosing to make 
such a disclosure.
The following report is aimed at providing 
further insight and highlighting a variety of 
social, ethical, environmental, health and safety 
policies within which Mecom’s businesses 
operate.
Employees
Mecom’s employees are key contributors 
towards the Group’s success. The 
responsibility for formulating, implementing and 
ensuring adherence to employment policies 
and relevant legislation is the responsibility of 
the Human Resources (“HR”) director of each 
division. During the year, a HR Steering Group 
consisting of HR directors of each division was 
established by the Company Secretary with 
the aim of sharing knowledge and exchanging 
ideas regarding employee matters. 
Each division in the Group fully supports the 
principle of equal opportunity for all and is 
committed to a policy of equal opportunity for 
employees at all levels. Employees are treated 
equally in all employment-related aspects 
regardless of their gender, age, race, religion, 
nationality, political opinion, social origin, ethnic 
origin, sexual orientation or any disability. The 
Group as a whole has over 40 per cent of the 
workforce which are women. Each division 
opposes all forms of discrimination and has 
policies to ensure it meets its legal obligations. 
It is also the policy of each division to give 
full and fair consideration to the recruitment 
of disabled persons. In an annual employee 
survey carried out by our Norwegian division, 
it was shown that the employees feel that there 
are no significant differences between the 
genders on how they perceived the treatment 
and opportunities in the workplace.
Employees across all divisions enjoy various 
rights and protection through collective 
employee involvement and representation 
achieved via local forums, such as works 
councils and meetings with recognised 
unions. Procedures for electing employee 
representatives vary across the divisions, and 
on balance reflect the views of the workforce. 
Meetings are held between employee 
representatives and management to consult 
on matters essential to the operation of the 
business and to allow employees to raise 
any concerns they may have. Furthermore, 
in Denmark and Norway, employees are 
entitled to be represented on the boards of the  
local operating companies.
In addition to divisional practices, emphasis 
was placed on building the relationship 
between central management and Mecom’s 
European Works Council (“EWC”) during 2008 
and this led to the signing of a new European 
Works Council (“EWC”) agreement for the 
enlarged Mecom group. The EWC comprises 
10 representatives from the Group’s divisions 
and meets three times a year without, 
and three times a year with, the central 
management team. The central management 
team comprises of representatives from the 
Group’s divisions and the Company Secretary 
or any person nominated by Mecom. The 
Company Secretary or any person nominated 
by Mecom is responsible for managing the 
relationship with the EWC on behalf of the 
Board. The EWC’s focus is on transnational 
matters (as opposed to national matters where 
the principal mechanisms for information and 
consultation operate at divisional level) and its 
relationship with central management is good 
with open dialogue and a solutions-oriented 
approach to the matters discussed.
Each division believes in open and continuous 
communication as an important part of the 
employee engagement process and seeks to 
achieve this through a variety of channels. All 
the divisions except Germany have a well-used 
intranet and publish newsletters to employees. 
The Country CEOs in Denmark, Norway and 
Germany write to all employees and the 
Dutch Country CEO held roadshows to keep 
employees informed of the development plans 
of the division. A monthly HR breakfast meeting 
between the HR director and the employees 
was initiated in 2008 in Presspublica, one of 
Mecom’s businesses in Poland, to discuss 
current employee issues and this led to the 
publication of a quarterly newsletter for the 
employees. Furthermore, in co-operation 
with an external consultant, our Norwegian 
division runs an annual employee survey 
which is used as an employee feedback tool, 
providing management an insight to develop, 
ARTWORK NOTE: BASELINE GRID IS BEING USED ON THIS JOB 41
Overview
conduct and improve communications with 
employees. 
Each division recognises that the development 
of its employees is important for the success 
of that division as well as the Group, and their 
aim is to encourage and wherever possible to 
develop employees to realise their potential. 
Each division, wherever possible, advertises 
job vacancies on the intranet and internal 
notice boards so that the number of positions 
filled from within the Group is maximised 
and opportunities are created for internal 
promotion. For example in 2008, 20 per cent 
of all vacancies across the Group have been 
filled with internal candidates.
Each division invests in a range of training 
and development programmes that are 
offered to employees in order to maintain a 
broad portfolio of skills and to help each one 
maximise their effectiveness in the workplace. 
Most divisions run training programmes aimed 
at online journalism, sales and enterprise sales, 
all of which supports the transformation of the 
business into a content company. In Wegener, 
training is available through the Wegener WHM 
Academy and the Wegener Dailies. LMG 
provided extensive training courses during 
the year in preparation for the conversion of 
its newspapers into tabloid format. Numerous 
employees in LMG also participated in 
one or more modules of Wegener’s sales 
training programme. Our Danish division runs 
Berlingske Academy, which provides training 
programme for employees, and the plan for 
2009 is to place more emphasis on web 
training for editorial staff and training for sales 
employees, and providing a new management 
training programme. 
Edda Media has a long tradition of running 
internal training programmes for potential 
future leaders and managers in the 
organisation. Currently there are two main 
management development programmes; 
one for mid-level managers and another for 
top-level managers. These programmes 
are important for career development within 
Edda Media. Media Regionalne also launched 
a Training Academy during the year which 
includes a programme for editorial managers 
aimed at developing their leadership skills. 
There are dedicated inhouse trainers who will 
train, coach and spread know-how across 
the division. Presspublica offered specific 
courses to develop employees and keep 
them up-to-date with the latest technological 
developments, for example advanced sales 
for the advertising and sales department, 
technical production skills for the production 
support department and intellectual property 
law for the editors. 
Leadership capability at all levels of the 
business is important to the future success 
of each division and the Group as a whole. 
Each division except for Presspublica has a 
succession plan and continues to identify its 
leadership talent in order to meet the current 
and future needs of the Group. 
Community
Social and community involvement is 
inseparable from Mecom and its businesses 
because of the substantial and crucial impact 
of media on society and the communities they 
serve. As a European content and consumer 
business operating in various countries and 
regions, each division builds its reputation 
as a local enterprise through involvement in 
the local community and a broad variety of 
charitable activities, examples of which are 
set out below.
Wegener is one of the founding members 
of Fonds Slachthofferhulp, a charitable 
foundation established for the benefit of 
victims of crime, traffic accidents and disasters 
in the Netherlands. The foundation supports 
and seeks to improve the circumstances 
of victims and survivors and their families. 
Wegener also lends its support to many other 
national and regional charitable organisations 
including the Free Voice (a media organisation 
which strives for balanced and reliable media 
in eastern European, African and Latin 
American countries), Red Cross, the Dutch 
Hart Foundation, Ronald McDonald House in 
Zwolle (a house for children with cancer and 
their families) and Koningin Wilhelmina Fonds 
(an organisation which fights against cancer). 
Wegener supports the academic programme 
for student journalists in collaboration with 
the University of Groningen, a few other 
universities and higher education schools. 
LMG supports the Toon Hermans House 
foundation which was founded in Limburg 
in 1988. This foundation houses people with 
cancer, their next of kin or survivors and 
provides various facilities to support them. 
LMG also supports various other community 
initiatives, including two finalists from Limburg 
for the audition of the lead in the musical  
Evita and a local pole vault world champion 
from Limburg, Rens Blom, in his preparation 
for the recent Olympic Games, as well 
as producing a successful book entitled  
“20 years of PinkPop” recording the history of 
the PinkPop Festival, one of the oldest festivals 
in the world, which has been held in Limburg 
every year since 1970. 
Berlingske Media runs Den Berlingske Fond. 
This foundation supports activities of national, 
religious, cultural, social or scientific interest, 
as well as research, training and education in 
journalism. Two honorary prizes are presented 
each year by the foundation based on 
applications submitted. The “journalist prize” 
is presented to a journalist who has made 
an outstanding contribution to journalism 
and the “prize of honour” is presented to an 
outstanding Danish public figure. In 2008, 
Berlingske’s free-sheet URBAN launched a 
national campaign against violence in the city 
after several tragic fights at night in the centre 
of Copenhagen. The campaign was a success 
with thousands of young people taking an 
active role by submitting their own stories to 
the campaign website. Since 1972 Berlingske 
Media has held the Berlingske Music Awards 
for Young Talents (age 17 and under) in co-
ARTWORK NOTE: BASELINE GRID IS BEING USED ON THIS JOB 42 Mecom Group plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Overview
operation with the Royal Music Academy. A 
number of very significant musicians have 
been inspired and helped in their careers by 
this award for example, the internationally 
renowned violinist Nikolaj Znaider won this 
award in 1988.
Edda Media participates in the annual 
Christmas campaign set up by Amnesty 
International in support of freedom of the 
press. Most of the local media houses in Edda 
Media take an active part in the development 
of their communities sponsoring local sports 
clubs, cultural groups and events. Some of 
the media houses have established awards, 
prizes and scholarships within the sports or 
culture fields and support schools providing 
training materials and the opportunity for 
school classes to edit special pages in the 
newspaper. Edda Media has been one of 
the key sponsors in a project to write the 
history of the Norwegian Press which is to 
be launched as a four volume history work in 
2010 in connection with the celebration of the 
centenary of The Norwegian Press Association 
and The Norwegian Publishers Association. 
A “Safe Roads” campaign was launched 
in September 2008 by Media Regionalne. 
The campaign was prepared together with 
institutions and organisations of healthcare 
and safety. The goal is to promote behaviours 
to reduce the danger on Polish roads. In all of 
the Media Regionalne titles, articles linked to 
this subject were published. At the same time 
events were organised together with the local 
Red Cross, emergency units and the police. 
Gifts like road maps, reflective arm-bands, 
drivers’ handbooks and driver vests were 
also distributed to readers via its dailies. As 
a result of this campaign, awareness in local 
communities has increased and during the 
campaign car incidents were reduced. Media 
Regionalne also supports numerous other 
local and regional charitable activities aimed 
at poor families such as supporting the “Help 
Me” foundation by placing announcements in 
its titles for charity donations.
Also in Poland, Presspublica organised an 
auction of the caricatures by Jerzy Flisak in 
aid of “AKOGO?”, the charitable foundation 
of Ewa Błaszczyk for children with brain 
damage. The auction was a part of the award 
ceremony organised for the publication of 
“Lista 2000”, a supplement published once 
a year by Rzeczpospolita ranking top 2,000 
Polish companies. Given the number of 
representatives from top Polish companies 
present at this ceremony, Presspublica used 
this opportunity to raise funds by organising 
the auction. During the ceremony, “Good 
Company 2008” prizes for managers of 
the best Polish companies were issued. 
Presspublica has also supported many other 
charitable events throughout the year.
At the end of each year, Berliner Verlag awards 
a prize in recognition of the outstanding 
contribution of politicians, actors, artists 
or businessmen to cultural, political and 
economic life in the city of Berlin. Berliner 
Verlag also operates a free cultural or social 
event for the public at their offices in Berlin. 
These events are held monthly and attract 
1,000 visitors per event. Berliner Verlag also 
developed a project called “Paper in the 
Schools”. Through this project schools receive 
Berliner Zeitung for one year. Each quarter, the 
teachers are invited to a teachers’ club meeting 
where they can exchange their experiences 
in the project with the other participants as 
well as popular personalities from economic, 
culture and media backgrounds. Students are 
encouraged to write their own articles which 
are published in the paper. They also visit the 
editors of Berliner Zeitung to have a look at 
the daily work at a newspaper. In 2008, this 
project received an award, the “Media Max 
Special Prize” for its achievements in the field 
of education.
During 2008, the Group made donations 
to various community and charitable 
organisations totalling £83,000 (2007: 
£73,000). 
Health and safety
The Group strives to create a positive working 
environment by observing all applicable 
health and safety regulations and providing all 
employees with a safe working environment. 
Each division has a health and safety 
committee and/or representatives and has 
monitoring and reporting processes in place. 
The health and safety committee meets 
to discuss issues that arise and establish 
measures to correct and improve health and 
safety standards. 
The table below indicates the total number of 
injuries in the printing plants of all divisions. 
The increase of major injuries in 2008 was due 
to various factors. One being an improved 
reporting system for health and safety 
incidents which has led to a slight increase in 
reported cases. Additional training, guidance 
and emphasis on more careful approach 
have also been given in particular to newly 
employed staff to prevent further injuries.

Overview
Environment 
The Group aims to achieve good environmental 
practice and to minimise adverse 
environmental impacts. Due to the nature of 
Mecom’s business, the primary focus is on 
the reduction of environmental impact in the 
production and printing of newspapers. Each 
division was an established business prior 
to joining Mecom and accordingly operates 
various environmental practices in compliance 
with local regulations.
An Environmental Steering Group (the “ESG”) 
consisting of representatives from each 
division was established by the Company 
Secretary in 2008 to improve the focus and 
leadership of the Group in environmental 
matters. The ESG met during the course of 
2008 to share knowledge and develop a more 
consistent approach to policies and reporting 
on environmental matters across the Group. 
The Group identified the principal key areas 
relevant to our environmental footprint as 
sustainable sourcing with particular focus 
on paper, energy consumption and waste 
management. Mecom considers these 
areas as a way to link social responsibility 
with corporate efficiency. Responsibility for 
the development and implementation of 
environmental policies and initiatives lies with 
each division.
As a European content and consumer  
business, the Group’s aim is to identify and 
assess the risks and reduce the environmental 
impact of its operations. To progress this 
objective, the Group has commissioned 
Trucost, a leading environmental research 
organisation, to assess the Group’s 
environmental impact and this research will 
be used to review the position of the Group 
going forward.
As well as striving to improve the environment 
in which it works, Mecom also aims to promote 
greater environmental responsibility through 
its publications. Thus, Berlingske Tidende, 
launched a new website www.berlingske.dk/
klima dedicated to environmental activities 
and has formed a partnership with Mandag 
Morgen, Scandinavia’s largest independent 
think-tank, in order to increase the focus on 
climate issues in the run-up to Denmark’s 
hosting of the United Nations Climate 
Conference in 2009. Berlingske Tidende has 
also initiated a “Climate Cup” competition 
focusing on business and the environment 
and encouraging Danish companies to enter 
the competition to be designated as the “most 
climate friendly company”. 
Sourcing
The aim of the Group is to purchase from 
suppliers who have obtained or are working 
towards obtaining an environmental 
management accreditation or systems 
(including ISO14001). In establishing any 
Group-wide purchasing arrangements, we 
will seek to include suppliers who share our 
aims for responsible and sustainable sourcing 
as far as possible. Thus, for example, all the 
suppliers of the Group’s plates and ink have 
ISO14001 certification.
In 2008, the Group set the aim to purchase 
75 per cent of its paper from recycled fibre 
or certified, sustainable managed production 
forests. The Danish division purchases the 
majority of its paper through The Danish  
Press Joint Purchasing organisation which 
has a policy of buying paper from suppliers 
primarily in the local Nordic region with 
environmental certification. 
The policy of the Group is to continuously 
seek alternative chemicals and methods that 
are environmentally superior when purchasing 
new chemicals or introducing new methods. 
Each division will prior to ordering any new 
chemical carry out a risk assessment to 
determine the suitability of the new product. 
In 2008, the printing plants in Denmark 
worked intensively on a project with the target 
of mapping and reducing the number of 
CRAN (Carcinogenic, Reprotoxic, Allergenic 
and Neurotoxic) substances. The project 
was successfully finalised, the total number 
of chemicals used were reduced, and some 
were changed to less harmful products. The 
German print plant substituted petrol cleaning 
fluid used for cleaning the mailroom equipment 
with a new and safe type of cleaning fluid. In 
2008 the Norwegian print plants switched 
from “Transport 100” to “Rig wash” detergent 
used for cleaning press components because 
the latter was more environmentally friendly.
Energy 
All the Group’s printing plants use electricity, 
gas, oil, other energy sources and water as 
efficiently as possible and monitor the energy 
consumption associated with its activities. 
As shown in the next table, the use of 
electricity per ton of printed paper has 
increased marginally in 2008 primarily as a 
result of the increased demand for full colour 
printing, which consumes more energy than 
single colour printing. In addition, building and 
testing of new print presses in the Netherlands 
led to the increase of energy consumption. 
However, once completed, these new 
presses should result in greater efficiency 
leading to better control and a reduction 
of energy consumption. The increase of 
energy consumption in Denmark has arisen 
because print volume has decreased more 
than expected and faster than the possible 
optimisation of production and presses. Such 
optimisation is continuing in order to reduce 
energy consumption.

Waste 
The policy of the Group is to reduce wastage 
insofar as possible given the needs of the 
business, and to recycle all waste materials 
that are recyclable. 
Recyclable waste
In 2008, the Group recycled 100 per cent of 
waste paper, cores and reel-ends. One of 
the first projects initiated by the ESG was to 
share knowledge on the reduction of start-up 
waste while maintaining the print quality. Half 
of the sites which took part in this project had 
a steady improvement throughout the project 
period which lasted for four months. Five of 
the sites showed more than 20 per cent 
improvement from the start of the project. 
At the end of the project period, the amount 
of press start waste was reduced by 7 per 
cent corresponding to a yearly amount of 456 
tonnes reduction in paper use. The importance 
of accurate production reporting is clearly 
demonstrated through this project and all the 
sites now have better analytical tools at hand 
in order to fight start waste. 
Paper waste from the printing process and 
returned unsold newspapers are sold for 
recycling. Paper waste statistics are provided 
in the table below. The 2007 figures in the table 
below were adjusted and recalculated from 
last year following a review of the definitions to 
ensure like-for-like comparisons between the 
divisions. The definition of waste paper has 
been amended to include cores and reel-ends 
and exclude inserts and all other paper waste 
which does not relate to newsprint. 
The percentage of waste paper has reduced 
slightly in 2008. The differences in waste 
rates between the countries can be explained 
by the differences in the printed products. 
The smaller the circulation of a print run 
and the more colour in that run, the larger 
the percentage of waste. This is particularly 
applicable to Media Regionalne whose printed 
products are primarily regional weeklies, bi-
weeklies and monthlies with low circulation, 
and to some extent Edda Media whose daily 
local newspapers have low circulation.
Waste paper as a percentage of total paper consumption  2008 2007
Wegener    Netherlands 7.5% 7.9%
Limburg    Netherlands 7.9% 7.9%
Berlingske Media    Denmark 9.7% 9.8%

Presspublica    Poland 9.3% 8.8%
Berliner Verlag    Germany 6.4% 6.1%
Total Mecom      9.2% 9.3%
Non-recyclable waste
Hazardous wastage is kept to a minimum 
and where usage of hazardous substances is 
unavoidable, they are stored and disposed of 
in accordance with local laws and regulations. 
Each division in the Group also seeks where 
possible to use and/or develop energy-
saving materials and environmentally friendly 
technologies with particular focus on key 
chemicals. 
As stated last year, Computer to Plate (“CTP”) 
processes to eliminate the chemicals used 
during the old film-to-plate processes had 
been implemented in all but two plants in 
the Netherlands and three plants in Poland. 
The remaining plants in the Netherlands 
and another plant in Poland successfully 
implemented CTP processes in 2008. 
In Norway, the transition from silver-based to 
polymer-based printing plates was finalised 
during 2008. The plates are significantly more 
environmentally friendly and the waste from 
the processors is now free of silver residues. 
The amount of processor waste was reduced 
by 52 per cent. The waste is collected in 
closed tanks and delivered for destruction.

Overview
Environmental management systems
In 2008, the Group operated 25 printing plants 
of which seven are in the Netherlands, five in 
Denmark, four in Norway, eight in Poland (six 
of which are owned by Media Regionalne and 
two by Presspublica) and one in Germany. 
Of these, five of the plants in the Netherlands 
and one of Presspublica’s plants are already 
ISO14001 certified. In addition, a further 
two plants in Denmark have 9001:2001 
certification. The Group continues to carry 
out a risk assessment of each print plant once 
every two years.
One of the Group’s objectives is that all 
printing plants will work towards obtaining an 
ISO14001 certification in the next two years. 
Three printing plants in Denmark obtained 
ISO14001 certification in 2008. During 2008, 
the Norwegian printing plants also applied 
for the “Svanemerket” (a Scandinavian Eco-
label which can be used on paper and other 
products which fit certain environmental 
standards). 
A number of Media Regionalne printing plants 
have installed movement sensors in the 
administration area of the printing plants in 
order to save energy. 
Our Dutch division is working on obtaining the 
Forest Stewardship Council (“FSC”) Standard 
for Chain of Custody Certification for one of 
their print plants. Not only does this support 
our environmental aims and policies, products 
carrying an FSC label are independently 
certified to assure consumers that they come 
from forests that are managed to meet the 
social, economic and ecological needs of 
present and future generations.

Takeovers Directive
Pursuant to section 992 of the Companies Act 2006, which 
implements the EU Takeovers Directive, the Company is required to 
disclose the following additional information:
Appointment and replacement of directors
The Articles of Association of the Company (“Articles”) provide that 
the number of directors shall be no less than two and no more than 
15. Directors may be appointed by the Company by ordinary 
resolution or by the Board. A director appointed by the Board shall 
hold office only until the next annual general meeting and shall then 
be eligible for election, but shall not be taken into account in 
determining the directors or the number of directors who are to 
retire by rotation at that meeting. The Board may from time to time 
appoint one or more directors to hold executive office with the 
Company for such period (subject to the provisions of the Companies 
Acts) and upon such terms as the Board may decide and may 
revoke or terminate any appointment so made. In addition, any 
director who would not otherwise be required to retire shall retire by 
rotation at the third annual general meeting after his last appointment 
or re-appointment. 
At every annual general meeting of the Company, a minimum of 
one-third of the directors shall retire by rotation. The first directors to 
retire by rotation shall be those who wish to retire and not offer 
themselves for re-election. Any further directors so to retire shall be 
those of the other directors subject to retirement by rotation who 
have been longest in office since their last election or re-election 
but, as between persons who became or were last elected or re-
elected directors on the same day, those to retire shall (unless they 
otherwise agree among themselves) be determined by lot. 
The shareholders of the Company may by ordinary resolution 
remove any director before the expiration of his term of office. No 
special notice need be given of any resolution to remove a director 
in accordance with the Articles and no director proposed to be 
removed in accordance with the Article has any special right to 
protest against his removal. A person ceases to be a director as 
soon as: 
(i) that person ceases to be a director by virtue of any provision of 
the Companies Act 2006 or is prohibited from being a director 
by law; 
(ii) a bankruptcy order is made against that person; 
(iii) a composition is made with that person’s creditors generally in 
satisfaction of that person’s debts; 
(iv) a registered medical practitioner who is treating that person 
gives a written opinion to the Company stating that that person 
has become physically or mentally incapable of acting as a 
director and may remain so for more than three months; 
(v) by reason of that person’s mental health, a court makes an 
order which wholly or partly prevents that person from personally 
exercising any powers or rights which that person would 
otherwise have; 
(vi) notification is received by the Company from the director that 
the director is resigning or retiring from office, and such 
resignation or retirement has taken effect in accordance with its 
terms, or his office as a director is vacated pursuant to Article 
119; or  50 Mecom Group plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Governance
(vii) that person receives notice signed by not less than three-
quarters of the other directors stating that that person should 
cease to be a director. In calculating the number of directors 
who are required to give such notice to the director, (a) an 
alternate director appointed by him acting in his capacity as 
such shall be excluded; and (b) a director and any alternate 
director appointed by him and acting in his capacity as such 
shall constitute a single director for this purpose, so that notice 
by either shall be sufficient.
Powers of the directors
Subject to the Company’s Memorandum of Association and the 
Articles, the Companies Acts and any directions given by special 
resolution, the business of the Company will be managed by the 
Board who may exercise all the powers of the Company, whether 
relating to the management of the business of the Company or not, 
including powers relating to the issue and/or buying back of the 
Company’s shares. In particular, the Board may exercise all the 
powers of the Company to borrow money and mortgage or charge 
any of its undertakings, property and assets and uncalled capital 
and to issue debentures and other securities for any debt, liability or 
obligation of the Company to any third party. The directors have 
authority in place for them to allot relevant securities (as defined in 
section 80 of the Companies Act 1985) up to an aggregate nominal 
amount of £2,594,131. This authority expires at the 2009 AGM.
The directors have the authority for purchase by the Company of its 
own shares up to a maximum of 10 per cent of the issued share 
capital of the Company. No purchases have been made under this 
authority as at the date of this report. This authority expires at the 
2009 AGM.
Further details on the renewal of authorities are contained in  
the Chairman’s letter to shareholders accompanying the Notice  
of AGM.
Significant agreements
Under the new Takeover Directive, a company is required to disclose 
any significant agreements to which the Company is party that take 
effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company 
following a takeover bid, and the effects of any such agreements. 
On 31 October 2007 (as amended by an amendment and 
restatement agreement dated 6 November 2007), the Company 
entered into a €1 billion credit facility agreement between, amongst 
others, the Company, ING Bank NV (as “Facility Agent”) and the 
banks and institutions named therein as original lenders (the 
“Facility”), whereby upon a change of control (subject to an 
agreement not being reached with the Company within 15 days of 
the Facility Agent notifying the lenders of such change of control) 
the total commitments of the original lenders under the Facility will 
be cancelled and all outstanding utilisations, ancillary outstandings, 
accrued interest and other amounts accrued under the finance 
documents shall become immediately due and payable. 
The Company is in the process of negotiating amendments to this 
credit facility with the original lenders. It is not expected that the 
provision relating to a change of control and its effect on the total 
commitments outstanding will change.
For these purposes, a change of control occurs if any person or 
group of persons acting in concert gains control of the Company. 
The change of control provisions for the various share schemes 
operated by the Company are provided in the Remuneration report 
on pages 58 to 63.
Rights attaching to shares
The Company has one class of ordinary shares and the rights 
attaching to the ordinary shares in addition to those conferred on 
their holders by law are defined in the Articles, copies of which can 
be obtained from the Company Secretary. A shareholder whose 
name appears on the Company’s register of members can choose 
whether his shares are evidenced by share certificates (in certificated 
form) or held in electronic (uncertificated) form in CREST (the 
electronic settlement system in the United Kingdom).
Subject to any restrictions below, shareholders may attend any 
general meeting of the Company and, on a show of hands, every 
shareholder (or his representative) who is present at a general 
meeting has one vote on each resolution and, on a poll, every 
shareholder (or his representative) who is present has one vote on 
each resolution for every ordinary share of which they are the 
registered shareholder. A resolution put to the vote of a general 
meeting is decided on a show of hands unless (before or on the 
declaration of the result of a vote on a show of hands) a poll is 
demanded by the chairman of the meeting, or by at least five 
shareholders (or their representatives) present in person and having 
the right to vote, or by any shareholders (or their representatives) 
present in person having at least 10 per cent of the total voting 
rights of all shareholders, or by any shareholders (or their 
representatives) present in person holding ordinary shares on which 
an aggregate sum has been paid up of at least 10 per cent of the 
total sum paid up on all ordinary shares.
Shareholders can declare final dividends by passing an ordinary 
resolution but the amount of the dividends cannot exceed the 
amount recommended by the Board. The Board can pay interim 
dividends on any class of shares of the amounts and on the dates 
and for the periods they decide provided the distributable profits of 
the Company justify such payment. The Board may, if authorised by 
an ordinary resolution of the shareholders, offer any shareholder the 
right to elect to receive new ordinary shares, which will be credited 
as fully paid, instead of their cash dividend.
Voting at general meetings
Any form of proxy sent by the Company to shareholders in relation 
to any general meeting must be delivered to the Company, whether 
in written form or in electronic form, not less than 48 hours before 
the time appointed for holding the meeting or adjourned meeting at 
which the person named in the appointment proposes to vote.
No shareholder is, unless the Board decides otherwise, entitled to 
attend or vote either personally or by proxy at a general meeting or 
to exercise any other right conferred by being a shareholder if he or 
any person with an interest in shares has been sent a notice under 
section 793 of the Companies Act 2006 (which confers upon public 
companies the power to require information with respect to interests 
in their voting shares) and he or any interested person failed to 
supply the Company with the information requested within 14 days 
after delivery of that notice. The Board may also decide where the 
relevant shareholding comprises at least 0.25 per cent of the 
nominal value of the issued shares of that class that no dividend is 
payable in respect of those default shares and that no transfer of 
any default shares shall be registered.
Transfers of shares
The Board may refuse to register a transfer of a certificated share 
which is not fully paid, provided that the refusal does not prevent 
dealings in shares in the Company from taking place on an open 
and proper basis. The Board may also refuse to register a transfer 
of a certificated share unless: (i) the instrument of transfer is lodged, 
Directors’ report continued 51
Governance
duly stamped (if stampable), at the registered office of the Company 
or any other place decided by the Board, accompanied by the 
certificate for the share to which it relates and such other evidence 
as the Board may reasonably require to show the right of the 
transferor to make the transfer; (ii) is in respect of only one class of 
shares; and (iii) is in favour of not more than four transferees.
Transfers of uncertificated shares must be carried out using CREST 
and the Board can refuse to register a transfer of an uncertificated 
share in accordance with the regulations governing the operation  
of CREST.
Variation of rights
If at any time the capital of the Company is divided into different 
classes of shares, the special rights attaching to any class may be 
varied or revoked either: (i) with the written consent of the holders of 
at least 75 per cent in nominal value of the issues shares of the 
class; or (ii) with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a 
separate general meeting of the holders of the shares of the class. 
Without prejudice to any rights conferred on the holders of any 
existing shares or class of shares, any share may be issued with or 
have attached to it such rights and restrictions as the Company may 
from time to time by ordinary resolution determine, or in the absence 
of such a resolution, as the Board may determine.
Exercise of Rights in Employee Share Schemes
The Company operates an employee benefit trust (“EBT”) for the 
benefit of past, current and future employees of the Group. It was 
primarily established for the operation of the Share Incentive Plan 
(“SIP”). During the year a linking agreement has been entered into 
between the trustee of the EBT and the Company so that the shares 
required to satisfy the Company’s obligations under the Executive 
Share Option Plan and Deferred Bonus Plan may be acquired by the 
EBT. Further details on the number of ordinary shares to be acquired 
by the trustee of EBT for the purpose of the SIP are detailed in the 
Remuneration report on page 60. The trustee has not acquired or 
been granted any shares at the date of this report. No shares are 
currently held by the EBT therefore the trustees do not have any 
voting rights currently.
Directors’ compensation
In accordance with the new Takeover Directive, the Company is 
required to disclose any agreements between the Company and  
its directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of 
office or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid. The 
agreements between the Company and its Executive Directors 
which satisfy this requirement are disclosed in the Remuneration 
report on pages 58 to 63.
Directors’ statement as to disclosure of information 
to auditors 
In accordance with section 234ZA(2) of the Companies Act 1985, 
each of the directors in office at the date of this report confirms that: 
so far as he is aware, there is no relevant audit information of •	
which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and 
he has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a •	
director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are 
aware of that information. 
Auditors 
Resolutions to re-appoint Ernst & Young LLP as the Company’s 
auditors and to authorise the directors to determine their 
remuneration will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM. 
Annual General Meeting
The AGM of the Company will be held at the offices of J.P. Morgan 
Cazenove Limited, 20 Moorgate, London EC2R 6DA on 10 June 
2009 at 11.00am. Full details of the business of the meeting, together 
with explanatory notes on the resolutions that will be put 
to the meeting, may be found in a separate circular with the Notice 
of AGM.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities 53
Governance
The Board is committed to maintaining high standards of corporate 
governance. The Board considers that the Company has during 
2008 complied with the provisions of the Combined Code on 
Corporate Governance (the “Code”), save for areas where an 
explanation has been provided below. Further details of how the 
principles of the Code have been applied for the year 2008 are set 
out below and in the Remuneration report on pages 58 to 63. 
The Board
The Board is collectively responsible for the success of the Company 
and sets the strategy and objectives of the Group. It formulates the 
values and standards within the Code of Business Conduct which 
is available on Mecom’s website and ensures that the Company’s 
obligations to its shareholders and other stakeholders are 
understood and met. 
At the beginning of 2008, the Board comprised eight members 
being the Executive Chairman, two other executive directors and 
five non-executive directors. At the end of 2008, the Board consisted 
of nine members, six of whom were non-executive directors. Keith 
Allen, who was previously Group Finance Director, became the 
Chief Operating Officer with effect from 14 March 2008 and John 
Allwood who had joined the Board on 27 February 2008 was 
appointed as Group Finance Director on 14 March 2008. Jan 
Houwert, who was previously an executive director, became a non-
executive director with effect from 8 May 2008. All other directors 
served throughout 2008. 
As announced on 16 January 2009, John Allwood, Robin Miller, Jan 
Houwert, John McNeil, Richard North and Rob Pieterse resigned as 
directors of the Company. At the same time Stephen Davidson was 
appointed the Senior Independent Director and Henry Davies was 
appointed acting Group Finance Director. Henry Davies became the 
Group Finance Director on 13 February 2009. The Board currently 
comprises three executive directors and two non-executive directors 
including the Chairman and biographies of each Board member are 
presented on page 47. 
The Code recommends the separation of the roles of the Chairman 
and the Chief Executive and as disclosed last year, the Company 
has given an undertaking that the roles will be separated. Accordingly 
on 16 January 2009 the Company announced that Alasdair Locke 
would become the Chairman of the Company and David Montgomery 
would remain as Chief Executive. There is a clear division of 
responsibility between the Chairman and the Chief Executive set 
out in writing and agreed by the Board. Alasdair Locke as Chairman, 
is responsible for leadership of the Board, ensuring its effectiveness 
on all aspects. He also ensures effective communication with 
shareholders. David Montgomery, the Chief Executive reports to the 
Board and is responsible for running the Group’s business.
The Chief Executive’s other business commitments are disclosed in 
the Remuneration report on page 61 and there have been no 
significant changes during the year relating to these commitments.
There is a schedule of matters reserved for the decision of the Board 
including the approval of acquisitions and disposals, investment 
strategy, dividend policy, capital expenditure, significant contractual 
commitments, Group borrowings, issues of securities, approval of 
the annual report and financial statements, and the Group annual 
operating plan and budget. Certain decision-making and operational 
matters are delegated to senior management including Country 
CEOs and CFOs, who are responsible on a day-to-day basis for the 
operation of their division as well as the application of the processes 
and procedures supporting the strategic objectives. The Board also 
Corporate governance
considered reports from the Executive Chairman and the Group 
Finance Director at each of its scheduled meetings for the year 
under review. 
The Board delegates specific responsibilities to the Audit, 
Nomination and Remuneration Committees. Each Committee has 
its own terms of reference. The current terms of reference are 
available on Mecom’s website. Reports of these Committees are 
set out on pages 54 to 56. All directors received copies of all 
Committee minutes and the Chairman of each Committee provides 
an update on matters of significance at the Board meeting following 
the relevant Committee meeting.
Attendance at meetings
The Board met each month during the year under review. Thirteen 
scheduled meetings were held and one additional meeting was 
convened. No one, other than the members of the Board, is allowed 
to attend the meetings other than by invitation. The non-executive 
directors also met as a group during the year under review, under 
the chairmanship of the Senior Independent Director, without the 
presence of the executive directors.
The following table sets out the attendance of each director at 
Board and Committee meetings during the year under review. For 
each director the number of meetings held during his term as 
director and member of the relevant Committee is shown.

director in May 2008.
3  Left the Audit Committee in May 2008.
4  Joined the Nomination Committee and left the Remuneration Committee in  
May 2008.
The Board noted the absences of Alasdair Locke from Board and 
Committee meetings which were primarily due to the unanticipated 
amount of time he was required to devote to the Abbot Group plc 
(now known as Abbot Group Limited where he was and remains the 
executive chairman) following the sale of this company in 2008. He 
received Board and Committee papers and sought to contribute to 
the Board meetings by passing comments to the Senior Independent 
Director and the other directors where appropriate. The Board  
is satisfied that he is now able to commit and allocate sufficient  
time to meet the expectations in his new role as Chairman of  
the Company.
Board balance and independence
Throughout the year in 2008, the Board comprised a majority of 
independent non-executive directors, excluding the Executive 
Chairman, and had a good balance between executive and non-
executive directors. In 2008, the Board considered each of the 
non-executive directors to be independent apart from Jan Houwert 
due to his long and continuing relationship with Wegener.  54 Mecom Group plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Governance
In the case of Robin Miller, the Board reviewed his position carefully 
and was satisfied that he was independent in character and 
judgement notwithstanding the fact that he was a potential 
beneficiary under the Company’s Share Incentive Plan. His long-
standing participation in the Share Incentive Plan derived from his 
role as one of the founder directors of Mecom. He did not participate 
in any other incentive arrangement operated by the Company. 
Following his resignation from the Board on 16 January 2009, he is 
no longer a beneficiary under the Share Incentive Plan.
Following the announcement of the various Board changes on 
16 January 2009, a search for further non-executive directors is 
under way to restore the balance between executive and non-
executive members of the Board.
The terms and conditions of appointment of each director are 
available for inspection at the registered office of the Company 
during usual business hours or on request to the Company 
Secretary. In accordance with the Articles of Association, all 
directors are subject to re-appointment at the first annual general 
meeting after their appointment and thereafter to re-election every 
three years. The recommendations of the Board in relation to 
directors seeking re-appointment or re-election are set out in the 
Notice of Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) accompanying this 
Annual report. 
Information and professional development
The Board is provided with timely information in a form and of a 
quality appropriate to enable it to discharge its duties. All directors 
have access to all relevant information and to the services of the 
Company Secretary, who is responsible to the Board for ensuring 
that Board procedures are complied with. The Company Secretary 
also advises the Board on all governance matters. Independent 
professional advice is available to the directors and to the Board 
and its Committees at the expense of the Company.
All new directors benefit from an induction programme which 
provides them with information about the Board and the relevant 
Committees and includes meetings with key personnel. 
The Board is committed to ensuring that directors continually 
update their skills, knowledge and familiarity with the Group to 
enable them to fulfil their role on the Board and its Committees. 
Consequently, some Board meetings were held at key sites during 
the year under review. During the year under review the Board was 
also provided with briefings on matters of significance to the Group 
through internal or external advisers as appropriate, such as updates 
on the implementation of the Companies Act 2006, the Code and 
the proposed Climate Change Bill as well as changes to legal, 
regulatory and financial reporting matters as appropriate.
Board evaluation
The Board has considered the performance evaluation 
recommendation of the Code for 2008 and decided to conduct 
such evaluation in 2009 following the appointment of the new 
Chairman.
Nomination Committee 
Composition
The Nomination Committee is appointed by the Board and was 
chaired by Robin Miller, the Senior Independent Director in 2008. It 
comprised all the other non-executive directors during the year 
under review (Jan Houwert, John McNeil, Alasdair Locke, Richard 
North, Rob Pieterse) as well as David Montgomery who was the 
Executive Chairman. Jan Houwert was invited to join the Committee 
following his appointment as a non-executive director in May 2008. 
The Company Secretary acts as the Secretary of the Committee.
With effect from 13 February 2009, Alasdair Locke was appointed 
the Chairman of the Committee and Stephen Davidson became  
a member of the Committee. They are both independent non-
executive directors.
Meeting
The Committee meets as and when required. During the year under 
review, two meetings were held. Attendance of the Committee 
members is shown on page 53.
Role
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on Mecom’s 
website and reviewed annually to ensure that they meet best 
practice. The principal responsibility of the Committee is to keep the 
composition and balance of the Board and make recommendations 
to the Board on all new appointments and re-appointments of 
directors based on a rigorous selection process. 
During the year under review, the Committee recommended to the 
Board the appointment of John Allwood as Group Finance Director, 
Keith Allen as Chief Operating Officer and Jan Houwert as non-
executive director taking into consideration their experience and 
expertise in media and newspaper publishing. The Committee also 
met to consider the re-election of directors under the retirement by 
rotation provisions of the Company’s Articles. The Committee also 
considered succession planning and the balance of skills and 
expertise needed on the Board during the year under review  
and decided to conduct such evaluation in 2009 following the 
appointment of the new Chairman.
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee is appointed by the Board and is 
responsible for setting remuneration for all executive directors, and 
monitors the level and structure of remuneration for the next most 
senior category of executives. The Remuneration report, set out on 
pages 58 to 63, includes details of the Committee and its activities 
during the year, the Company’s remuneration policy together with 
information on the share interests of directors. 
With effect from 13 February 2009, Alasdair Locke was appointed 
the Chairman of the Committee and Stephen Davidson became  
a member of the Committee. The Company recognises the 
recommendation of the Code that the Chairman of the Company 
should not chair the Remuneration Committee. The position will be 
reviewed when new non-executive directors join the Board.
Audit Committee 
Composition
The Audit Committee is appointed by the Board and consists of 
independent non-executive directors. In April 2008 Richard North 
took over from John McNeil as the Chairman of the Committee. He 
was previously group finance director of Bass plc and The Burton 
Group Plc. The Board therefore considered Richard North to have 
recent and relevant financial experience during the time he was 
Chairman of the Committee. The other members of the Committee 
during the year under review were John McNeil, Robin Miller, and 
Rob Pieterse. Alasdair Locke was a member of the Committee from 
the beginning of 2008 to May 2008. The Company Secretary acts 
as the Secretary of the Committee. 
With effect from 13 February 2009, Stephen Davidson was 
appointed as Chairman of the Audit Committee and Alasdair Locke 
Corporate governance continued 55
Governance
became a member of the Committee. Stephen Davidson was 
finance director, then chief executive officer, of Telewest 
Communications plc and has held various positions in investment 
banking, most recently at West LB Panmure where he was vice 
chairman of Investment Banking. The Board considers Stephen 
Davidson to have recent and relevant financial experience.
Meeting
The Committee meets at least three times a year and met five times 
during the year under review. Attendance of the Committee 
members is shown on page 53. Only members of the Committee 
have the right to attend the meetings of the Committee. However, 
other individuals such as the Group Finance Director, Head of Group 
Audit, the external auditors and representatives from other finance 
functions may be invited to attend some or all of the meetings as 
and when appropriate. The Committee also met the external 
auditors three times during the year under review without the 
presence of the executive directors.
Role
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on Mecom’s 
website and are reviewed annually to ensure that they continue to 
meet best practice. The principal responsibilities of the Committee 
include: 
Monitoring the integrity of the financial statements, including •	
annual and half-year reports, interim management statements, 
preliminary results announcements and any other formal 
announcement relating to financial performance.
Reviewing the effectiveness of systems of internal control and •	
management of risks, including approving statements 
concerning internal control and risk management in the annual 
report.
Reviewing the activities, organisational structure and the •	
effectiveness of the internal audit function.
Reviewing and approving changes to the Group’s key accounting •	
policies.
Making recommendations to the Board, to be put to •	
shareholders, for approval at the annual general meeting, in 
relation to the appointment, re-appointment and removal of the 
external auditor.
Reviewing and monitoring of the external auditors’ independence, •	
objectivity and effectiveness of the audit process.
Setting and approving policy on non-audit services, and •	
approving audit fees and non-audit services.
The Group’s internal audit function which is led by the Head of 
Group Audit reports to the Committee and the Group Finance 
Director. The purpose of the Group’s internal audit function is to 
review and test key internal controls on which management seeks 
to place reliance in its mitigation of risk. Where necessary it will 
make recommendations for improvement in controls and follow up 
with management to ensure that agreed actions are taken on a 
timely basis. The Committee receives internal audit reports from the 
Head of Group Audit at every Committee meeting covering areas 
such as effectiveness of financial and IT controls that support 
reliable financial reporting, project management of change initiatives 
which are driving the Group’s transition to a content and consumer 
business and security over the websites of the Group which allow 
customers access to the online services and products of the Group. 
The Committee chairman reports on the key items at Board 
meetings. Following the creation of an internal audit function in 
2007, the Committee has reviewed its effectiveness in 2008 and will 
continue to monitor, and provide direction to its activities.
The Committee regularly monitors and approves all services being 
provided to the Group by its external auditors and has established 
a pre-approval requirement for the provision of non-audit services 
to ensure that there is no impairment of auditor independence. For 
this purpose auditing the accounts of subsidiaries and associates 
pursuant to legislation and other services provided pursuant to 
legislation are regarded as audit services. The pre-approval 
requirement is subject to annual review by the Committee. The fees 
for audit services and non-audit services provided by the external 
auditors are disclosed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial 
statements. 
An evaluation of the effectiveness of the external audit process was 
carried out in 2008 by the Head of Group Audit taking into account 
the views of the relevant senior management and the Committee 
members. The results of evaluation were discussed with the external 
auditors. Ernst & Young LLP was appointed external auditors of the 
Company in 2005. Since then the Committee has not considered 
tendering the audit given the significant changes that have taken 
place within the Group that required continuity and an in-depth 
knowledge of the Group by its auditors. Going forward, the Audit 
Committee intends to tender the external audit every five years.
The Committee is also responsible for reviewing the arrangement 
for employees to raise any concerns they may have, in confidence, 
about possible wrongdoing, dishonest or unethical behaviour. A 
whistleblowing policy is in place and the Code of Conduct protects 
anyone that steps forward to make such a disclosure. Should a 
disclosure be made, the Head of Group Audit, in consultation with 
the Company Secretary will decide an appropriate method and level 
of investigation. The Committee is notified of all disclosures, results 
of investigations and actions taken, and has the power to conduct 
further inquiries itself or order additional actions as it sees fit. 
Internal control and risk management
The Board (through delegation to the Audit Committee) recognises 
that it has ultimate responsibility for the Group’s system of internal 
control and maintains a sound system of internal control to safeguard 
shareholders’ investment and the Group’s assets. No system of 
internal control can provide absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. Instead the Company operates a system 
which is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure 
to achieve business objectives and to provide the Board with 
reasonable assurance that problems are identified on a timely basis 
and dealt with appropriately. 
The Group follows a process of identifying, assessing and managing 
the significant risks faced by divisional businesses and by the Group 
as a whole. The key aspects of this process are summarised as 
follows:
The Board and management
The Group carries out a comprehensive annual strategy review 
which is supported by a budgeting and planning process whereby 
detailed operating budgets for the following financial year are 
prepared by divisional and corporate management for approval by 
the Board. The day-to-day management is undertaken by the senior 
management of the divisions and of the Group who have the 
responsibility for providing visible leadership and ensuring that risk 
management is integrated into all operations and functions. 56 Mecom Group plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Governance
Organisational structure and authorisation procedure
The Group has an established organisation structure with clearly 
stated delegated responsibility and reporting. Authorisation 
procedures in respect of matters such as capital expenditure, 
acquisitions, investments or disposals and treasury transactions 
are clearly defined and communicated across the Group. 
Risk assessment
In reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal 
control, the Board first considers the risk management system and 
all aspects of risks which include strategic, financial, operational 
and compliance risks. It then considers whether the key controls 
designed to mitigate these risks are working as intended for both 
“business as usual” and the “strategic initiatives” that will drive 
change across the divisions, business units and joint-ventures. This 
approach improves the effectiveness of control without necessarily 
increasing the number or cost of controls in the business. 
The Corporate Risk Register (the “Register”) provides a consistent 
method for managing and reporting risks across the Group and 
ensures that significant risks are understood and visible to divisional 
and corporate management, as well as to the Board. The Register 
sets out the top risks as defined by divisional and corporate 
management. The Head of Group Audit discusses risk with the 
Country CEOs and prioritises the top risks against the likelihood of 
occurrence and impact on achievement of the Group’s objectives. 
The Register, which also sets out the mitigating controls and actions, 
is reviewed and assessed on a quarterly basis by the Board. A 
summary of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group is 
provided on pages 38 to 39.
In line with the Turnbull Guidance, the process for identifying, 
monitoring and reporting risks is reviewed regularly by the Board 
based on the recommendations of the Audit Committee. The 
process described has been in place for the year under review and 
up to the date of the approval of this Annual report and accounts.
Financial and management reporting
The results of the business units are reported to the Group on a 
monthly basis and monitored against budget and latest forecasts. 
The controls that support the Group’s financial reporting procedures 
are considered as part of the Group’s ongoing risk assessment 
process and are reviewed for effectiveness by the Group’s internal 
audit function.
Reviewing and monitoring the effectiveness of internal controls
The Group’s internal control framework is based on the Board’s 
assessment of risk and comprises a combination of self-assessment, 
management oversight and independent review by the Group’s 
internal audit function. 
In having regard to this framework, the Audit Committee’s activities 
during the year under review included:
Reviewing the work of management and the Group’s reporting •	
accountants in preparing for the move of the Company’s shares 
from AIM to the main list of the London Stock Exchange in April 
2008. This included a review of the Group’s risk management 
system, financial reporting procedures and working capital 
projections at that time.
Monitoring the implementation of standard policies and •	
procedures across the Group. These policies and procedures 
relate primarily to financial reporting, accounting policies, risk 
management and internal control. Each business had, at the 
time of acquisition by Mecom, its own set of financial policies 
and procedures which, whilst providing for locally-oriented 
financial reporting and internal control, were necessarily not 
common across the enlarged Group and required improvement 
to deal with the standards expected of a fully listed company in 
the United Kingdom. New systems implementations and the 
effect of business reorganisations have delayed the complete 
roll-out in the Group’s Danish and Norwegian businesses, but 
continues to receive management priority. During the year the 
Committee received, and continues to receive, regular reports 
from the Head of Group Audit on the status of this  
implementation.
Considering recent guidance issued by the Financial Reporting •	
Council on the financial control and reporting implications in  
the light of the current economic conditions. The Committee 
has received reports on relevant issues from management and 
at each of its meetings since the guidance was issued has 
reviewed a schedule of the Group’s position for each of the 
questions raised.
The Board is satisfied that the information it received throughout  
the year enabled it to formally complete its annual review of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control. In conducting 
its review, the Board has identified certain aspects of internal control 
which require improvement. Progress in these areas continues to 
be reviewed on a regular basis and additional steps have been 
taken to further embed risk management and internal control into all 
operations of the Group.
Financial reporting
Through the detailed reviews of the Group’s performance  
and financial position, together with the Directors’ report and  
the financial statements thereto, the Board seeks to present a 
balanced and understandable assessment of the Group’s position 
and prospects. A statement of the directors’ responsibilities in 
preparing the financial statements and a statement by the external 
auditors on their reporting responsibilities are presented on pages 
52 and 65 accordingly. 
Communication with shareholders
The Board as a whole has the responsibility for ensuring that a 
satisfactory dialogue with shareholders takes place. It encourages 
two-way communication with both its institutional and private 
shareholders and responds quickly to all queries received orally or 
in writing. During the year under review, Robin Miller as the Senior 
Independent Director, was available to the shareholders to 
understand their views and to address any issues they may have 
had. From 16 January 2009, Alasdair Locke as Chairman and 
Stephen Davidson as the Senior Independent Director have been 
and are available to the shareholders. In order to develop an 
understanding of the views of the major shareholders, the Board 
receives, with the papers circulated before each Board meeting, 
analysts’ and brokers’ reports and briefings as well as a summary of 
the main movements in shareholdings. 
Corporate governance continued 57
Governance
Shareholders are kept informed of the progress and performance of 
the Group through the annual report, half-year results, interim 
management statements and the AGM. This information and other 
significant announcements of the Group are released to the London 
Stock Exchange and are made available on Mecom’s website.
Notice of the AGM and related papers are sent to shareholders at 
least 20 working days before the meeting. The Chairmen of the 
Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees will be available 
at the AGM to answer any queries. In addition, the Chairman 
encourages all directors to attend the AGM so shareholders will 
have an opportunity to meet them. Voting on resolutions is 
conducted by polls at general meetings and voting results are 
announced through the London Stock Exchange and are available 
on Mecom’s website or on request.
At the 2008 Annual General Meeting, the Company’s Articles of 
Association were amended to permit the Company to send or 
supply communications to shareholders electronically and the 
Company now supplies information such as notices of meetings, 
forms of proxy and the Annual report via the website. Shareholders 
will be notified by email or post when new information is available on 
the website. The Company will continue to send hard copy 
communications to those shareholders who have requested to 
receive communication in hard copy form. Shareholders may at any 
time revoke a previous instruction in order to receive hard copies or 
electronic copies of shareholder information. 58 Mecom Group plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Governance
The Directors present their Remuneration report for the year ended 
31 December 2008, which will be submitted to shareholders for 
approval at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. This report 
has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 
7A of the Companies Act 1985 and describes how the principles set 
out in the Combined Code (the “Code”) have been applied. Apart 
from the information relating to the directors’ remuneration, share 
options and share interests on pages 60, 62 and 63, this report is 
not subject to audit.
In this report, the expression “Executive Directors” includes the 
Executive Chairman (for his appointment up to 16 January 2009), 
unless otherwise stated.
Remuneration Committee
Composition
The Remuneration Committee is appointed by the Board and 
consists of independent non-executive directors. John McNeil 
chaired the Remuneration Committee during 2008 (up to his 
resignation on 16 January 2009) and the other members of the 
Committee were Alasdair Locke and Robin Miller (up to his 
resignation on 16 January 2009). Richard North and Rob Pieterse 
were members of the Committee from the beginning of 2008 up  
to April 2008. The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to  
the Committee.
With effect from 13 February 2009, Alasdair Locke was appointed 
the Chairman of the Committee and Stephen Davidson became  
a member of the Committee. The Company recognises the 
recommendation of the Code that the Chairman of the Company 
should not chair the Remuneration Committee. The position will be 
reviewed when new non-executive directors join the Board.
Meetings
The Committee met formally three times during the year under 
review. The attendance of the Committee members is shown on 
page 53. Members of the Committee consulted with relevant parties 
internally, and the Executive Chairman and Group Finance Director 
were invited to attend Committee meetings as appropriate during 
the year under review, although no individual was present during 
discussions relating to his own remuneration.
Role
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on Mecom’s 
website and reviewed annually to ensure that they continue to meet 
best practice. The Committee is responsible for setting the 
framework and policy for the remuneration of the Executive Directors 
and reviewing them annually for appropriateness and relevance. It is 
also responsible for determining the specific elements of the 
Executive Directors’ remuneration, their contractual terms and their 
compensation arrangements. In addition, the Committee monitors 
the level and structure of remuneration for the next most senior 
category of executives and approves the structure and targets for 
their bonus plans. It also oversees any major changes in employee 
benefit structures. 
Independent advice
The Committee has appointed Deloitte LLP (“Deloitte”) as its 
principal external adviser. During the course of the year Deloitte 
provided advice with regard to general remuneration levels and 
comparator group benchmarking to ensure that remuneration 
remains competitive and in line with best practice. Deloitte have 
also provided ad hoc finance and tax advice to the Company and 
the Group during the year. 
Remuneration policy
The Committee’s primary objective is to ensure that reward 
packages for directors and senior managers are competitive in 
order to attract and retain the best talents, and are directly  
linked to the achievement of performance targets that extend 
beyond budget. 
The Committee undertakes an annual review of market practice 
and considers the remuneration levels of directors in companies of 
similar size and complexity both within and outside the industry 
sector. The Group also aims to incentivise and reward its Executive 
Directors in a way that is consistent with the Group’s commercial 
objectives and to align the interests of the directors with those  
of shareholders. To achieve this, the Executive Directors’ total 
remuneration comprises both fixed and variable elements, details of 
which are set out below. 
During 2008 the remuneration packages for the Executive Directors 
consisted of basic salary, benefits and participation in the annual 
bonus scheme and the Deferred Bonus Plan (“DBP”). As founder 
executives of the Company, David Montgomery and Keith Allen also 
participated in the Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”) which was approved 
by shareholders at the time of the Company’s admission to the 
Alternative Investment Market (“AIM”) of the London Stock Exchange 
in 2005. Further details of these arrangements are provided below.
In the event of outstanding performance, the performance-related 
incentives (excluding participation in the SIP) for David Montgomery 
and Keith Allen will equate to approximately 60 per cent of total 
remuneration. If performance is below budget, then no cash bonus 
is payable. 
As disclosed in the Annual Report last year, the remuneration of Jan 
Houwert, an executive director of the Company until 8 May 2008, 
was governed by his pre-existing contract with Wegener. From that 
date, Jan Houwert stepped down as CEO of Wegener and became 
a non-executive director of the Company on the same terms of 
appointment as the other non-executive directors. Jan Houwert’s 
pre-existing contract was superseded when he stepped down as 
CEO of Wegener. In addition to his non-executive directorship fees, 
he receives a fixed salary, pension and other benefits in consideration 
for providing consultancy services and advice to Wegener’s 
Supervisory Board under a contract entered into with Wegener on 
3 March 2008. 
Salary
Basic salaries are reviewed annually by the Committee. The aim of 
the Group is to provide a competitive remuneration package to 
attract, retain and motivate key executives. Basic salaries are 
intended to provide market competitive levels of reward for the role 
and individual contribution. Basic salaries for 2008 and 2009 have 
been set within a market competitive range derived from analysis of 
salaries paid by companies within the FTSE All Share index, taking 
account of the relative complexity and size of the index constituents 
compared with Mecom. 
When positioning the Executive Directors’ basic salaries the 
Committee considers:
salary levels for similar jobs in relevant comparator companies; •	
specific factors relating to the individual (including personal •	
performance, experience and the individual’s role within the 
Group);
an enhanced or reduced scope or responsibility compared with •	
the norm for a given role;
Remuneration report 59
Governance
the balance between fixed and variable reward; and •	
relative remuneration levels throughout the Group. •	
Basic salaries during 2008 were £540,000 for David Montgomery, 
£350,000 for John Allwood and £325,000 for Keith Allen. With effect 
from 1 January 2009, these remain unchanged. Following the 
resignation of John Allwood, he is entitled to receive his medical 
insurance benefit and his pension entitlement up to 31 March 2009. 
Jan Houwert, who was an executive director from 1 January 2008 
up to 8 May 2008, received a basic annual salary of €412,452. With 
effect from 8 May 2008, he received a fee of £45,000 per annum as 
a non-executive director. Henry Davies, who was appointed Group 
Finance Director on 13 February 2009, receives a basic salary of 
£250,000 with effect from his appointment to the Board.
The Committee is of the view that in each case these basic salary 
levels reflect the competitive market level for the role and the 
individual’s contribution.
Annual bonus and Deferred Bonus Plan (“DBP”)
The purpose of the annual bonus and DBP is to incentivise and 
reward Executive Directors and senior executives for the  
achievement of annual Group and divisional targets, to encourage 
share ownership and to facilitate retention of key individuals.
Annual bonuses for Executive Directors and senior executives  
(in particular Country CEOs) are determined by reference to 
performance targets set by the Remuneration Committee. The 
performance targets are reviewed annually and relate to financial 
budgets, which are commercially sensitive and are therefore not 
disclosed in this report. 
The maximum 2008 annual cash bonus that could be earned by the 
Executive Directors and senior executives was 100 per cent of basic 
salary (Jan Houwert was not entitled to any bonus in the year under 
review). For the Executive Directors, their potential annual cash 
bonus was based on achieving or exceeding Group adjusted profit 
before tax (that is, profit before tax stated before exceptional items 
and the amortisation of acquired intangibles). 
In order to encourage share ownership amongst the most senior 
executives, participants are invited to express a preference to 
receive all or part of their bonus in shares, rather than cash, under 
the terms of the DBP prior to the determination of any bonus that 
might be paid. To the extent that a participant opts to receive shares 
rather than cash, he or she will receive an award over shares worth 
150 per cent of the cash bonus that might otherwise have been 
paid. Rights attaching to share awards under the DBP are exercisable 
at the end of a three-year period following the date of the award. In 
the event of a change of control, awards vest in full and may be 
exercised within six months of the change of control (or such earlier 
date as may be specified).
No bonus was payable in cash or shares to the Executive Directors 
who served during 2008 in respect of the year ended 31 December 
2008.
The Committee intends to review the structure and performance 
conditions for the 2009 annual bonus. The level of bonus awarded 
will continue to depend on the level of performance achieved  
and appropriately challenging targets will be set for the level of 
bonus contemplated.
Executive Share Option Plan (“ESOP”)
The purpose of the ESOP is to incentivise and reward Executive 
Directors and senior executives and to align their interests with 
those of shareholders.
There is no consideration payable for the grant of an option, and 
exercise is not conditional upon satisfaction of any performance 
condition for grants made to senior executives. Options will not 
normally be capable of exercise prior to the third anniversary of the 
date of grant and, to the extent not exercised, will lapse no later than 
the tenth anniversary of the date of grant. In the event of a change 
of control occurring within three years of the date of grant, the 
proportion of any option that may be exercised will be determined 
by reference to the period of time elapsed since the date of grant.
Options under the ESOP are not granted to participants in the SIP, 
a category which includes two of the Executive Directors. Prior to 
granting any options to Executive Directors, the Board will consult 
with shareholders as to the appropriate form of performance 
conditions to be attached to the exercise of those options, and 
would subsequently make full disclosure of the performance 
measures adopted. 
The criteria for making grants of share options to senior executives 
is reviewed by the Committee on an annual basis. In 2008, options 
worth up to 100 per cent of salary, with a small number of exceptional 
grants at 125 per cent of salary, were granted to 48 participants 
over approximately 1.4 per cent of the Company’s issued share 
capital.
The Committee intends to review the structure, criteria and quantum 
of long-term incentive awards to senior executives prior to the grant 
(if any) of share options during 2009.
Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”)
The SIP provides the founder executives with a long-term incentive 
linked to the delivery of shareholder value. It is operated via an 
offshore employee benefit trust (“EBT”), established by the Company 
for the benefit of the past, present and future employees of the 
Group following admission of the Company’s shares to trading on 
AIM in 2005.
The Company has granted an option over ordinary shares to the 
Trustee of the EBT generally, the exercise price being the nominal 
value of a share. The number of ordinary shares to be acquired by 
the Trustee on exercise of this option is calculated in accordance 
with a formula that entitles the Trustee to acquire ordinary shares 
with an aggregate value equivalent to 10 per cent of the increase in 
market capitalisation of the Company, less the market value at the 
date of issue of any new equity issued by the Company but adding 
back dividends paid, either five years from the date of admission to 
AIM or earlier in the event of an offer for the Company. This formula 
ensures there is a direct link between the reward that would be  
paid out to the founder executives and the value delivered  
to shareholders.
At the Extraordinary General Meeting held on 5 March 2007 the 
terms of the SIP were amended in certain minor respects relating to 
leaver provisions and the period within which options granted under 
the SIP can be exercised. 60 Mecom Group plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Governance
The founder executives who participate in the SIP are David 
Montgomery (35 per cent share), Keith Allen (15 per cent share), 
Robin Miller (7.5 per cent share) and one senior manager. The SIP is 
not open to any other participants and no further awards will be 
made under the SIP. Following the resignation of Robin Miller from 
the Board on 16 January 2009, he is no longer a beneficiary in the 
SIP. In accordance with the SIP plan rules, the interest of the other 
participants will not increase as a consequence of another 
beneficiary ceasing to be a participant.
Had the option vested on 31 December 2008, based on the 
Company’s market capitalisation at that date (calculated by 
reference to the prevailing share price of 1.05 pence), no benefit 
would have been realised by any participant in the SIP.
Wegener’s Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)  
(audited information)
As described in the Annual Report last year, Jan Houwert was 
entitled to an LTIP operated by Wegener. At the beginning of the 
year, Jan Houwert’s awards under Wegener’s LTIP comprised: 
 
  EVA
®
 
 Number of performance  
 depositary measurement  
Date of grant receipts year Earliest vesting date
23 April 2005 15,000 2007 23 April 2008
19 June 2006 8,000 2008 19 June 2009
18 June 2007 8,000 2009 18 June 2010
Jan Houwert’s entitlement to all such awards lapsed when he 
stepped down as CEO of Wegener. 
Dilution
The Company has, at all times, complied with the dilution limit 
contained within the rules of each share plan (principally a limit of 10 
per cent of the issued share capital of the Company in any 10 year 
period) and the Committee reviews the position before any proposed 
grant to ensure this limit is not breached.
Subsisting options granted under the ESOP and DBP to date equate 
to approximately 1.3 per cent of the Company’s current issued 
share capital. As stated above, if the SIP had vested on 31 December 
2008, no shares would have been issuable under the option granted 
to the Trustee. Based on the issued share capital of the Company at 
31 December 2008 but (for the purposes of assessing potential 
dilution) assuming a share price of 75 pence at the date of vesting 
of the SIP awards, the number of shares issuable under the SIP 
would equate to approximately 0.68 per cent of the Company’s 
issued share capital at that date.
Directors’ pension arrangements
The Company has not put in place any pension arrangement for 
Keith Allen. During the year 2008, the Company contributed £100 
per month to a defined contribution pension arrangement for David 
Montgomery. This arrangement was originally set up whilst David 
Montgomery was employed at the Mirror Group plc and was later 
assigned to the Company. With effect from 6 November 2008 this 
arrangement has now ceased. John Allwood received an amount 
equal to 20 per cent of his basic annual salary from the Company as 
a contribution to a pension arrangement nominated by him. 
Following the resignation of John Allwood from the Board on 16 
January 2009, his pension contribution will lapse after 31 March 
2009. Henry Davies who was appointed Group Finance Director on 
13 February 2009 receives 15 per cent of his basic salary from the 
Company as a contribution to a pension arrangement nominated by 
him.
Jan Houwert is entitled to a pension equivalent at age 65 of 2.25 per 
cent of pensionable salary for each year’s pensionable service. 
Pensionable salary is fixed annual salary less the amount covered 
by the Dutch state pension provision. This pension promise is 
funded partly through the Wegener General Pension Fund (“APW”), 
which provides 1.75 per cent of pensionable salary up to the 
maximum allowed under the rules of the APW, and partly through a 
separate top-up arrangement. The APW is a collective defined 
contribution arrangement, and the contribution rates applicable for 
2008 were 16.1 per cent (employer) and 9.6 per cent (employee), 
making 25.7 per cent in total. The cost of the top-up arrangement is 
met by Wegener. Jan Houwert also participates in the FWG VUT (a 
collective bargaining early-retirement arrangement), which provides 
an early retirement pension between the ages of 63 and 65, funded 
by employee and employer contributions. Jan Houwert can take 
early retirement from the age of 62, in which case Wegener will pay 
him the difference between the FWG VUT early retirement pension 
and 70 per cent of his final fixed annual salary until he reaches age 
65. The aggregate pension contributions made by Wegener for the 
benefit of Jan Houwert are disclosed in the Directors’ remuneration 
table on page 62. 
Directors’ service contracts
Each of the Executive Directors has a service contract with the 
Company which can be terminated by either party on 12 months’ 
written notice. Upon leaving service at the request of the Company 
(other than for gross misconduct) the Executive Director is entitled 
to receive predetermined compensation equivalent to 12 months’ 
basic salary and benefits. In the event of a change of control of the 
Company, the Executive Director must be offered employment by 
the Company’s successor or by any company in the Group on 
terms in all respects no less favourable than those applicable 
immediately prior to such change of control. If the Executive Director 
declines this offer, then the Company is entitled to terminate his or 
her contract either by giving the specified notice or by payment of 
the remuneration entitlement corresponding to that notice period.
Jan Houwert’s pre-existing contract of employment with Wegener 
was terminable by either party on six months’ written notice. Had he 
left service at the request of Wegener (other than for gross 
misconduct) or in the event of a change of control of Wegener or as 
a result of internal restructuring, he would have been entitled to 10 
months’ fixed salary and benefits plus 18 months’ variable salary 
and bonus, calculated by reference to his average variable salary 
and bonus over the preceding three years. Jan Houwert’s new 
contract with Wegener, which came into effect on 8 May 2008, is for 
a fixed term expiring on 1 February 2011, subject to statutory 
termination rights. In the event that Wegener wishes to terminate 
Jan Houwert’s new contract (other than for gross misconduct) prior 
to 1 February 2011, application will be made to the courts in the 
Netherlands to determine the appropriate level of compensation.
The Executive Directors are subject to non-compete and non-
solicitation restrictive covenants which endure for six months after 
termination of employment, and to confidentiality undertakings of 
unlimited duration.
The contract of employment between the Company and David 
Montgomery came into effect on 15 March 2005, as did the contract 
of employment between the Company and Keith Allen. John 
Allwood’s contract of employment with the Company came into 
effect on 8 May 2007 when he joined the Company and was 
amended with effect from 27 February 2008 when he joined the

Board. His contract is terminated on 16 January 2009 following his 
resignation. Jan Houwert’s pre-existing contract came into effect 
on 1 January 1992, but acknowledged his continuity of employment 
since joining Uitgeversmaatschappij Arnhem B.V. on 6 June 1983. 
This contract has now been superseded by his new contract 
described above. Henry Davies’s contract of employment with the 
Company came into effect on 1 September 2007 although he joined 
the Company on 30 July 2007 and was amended with effect from 
13 February 2009 when he became Group Finance Director.
Policy on external appointments
Executive Directors may only hold external appointments with the 
prior agreement of the Nomination Committee.
David Montgomery is currently a non-executive director of Tournigan 
Energy Limited and Roto Smeets de Boer. He retains the earnings 
relating to his appointment in Tournigan Energy Limited but not in 
Roto Smeets de Boer. During 2008, David Montgomery’s earnings 
from external appointments were: £8,125 from Northern Ireland 
Energy Holdings Limited where he was a non-executive director up 
to 31 March 2008; CND7,500 from Tournigan Energy Limited; and 
€33,000 from Roto Smeets de Boer. Keith Allen held no external 
appointments. 
John Allwood is a member of the Council of the University of Exeter 
which is unremunerated. Jan Houwert is a non-executive director of 
Eden Design & Communication and of De Goudse NV, from which 
he received fees of €2,800 and €8,800 respectively for the period 
when he was an executive director of the Company. He also serves 
on the boards of a number of Dutch organisations promoting the 
arts, education and commerce. These posts are unremunerated, 
save for the College of Higher Education of Arnhem and Nijmegen, 
which paid Jan Houwert €1,800 for the period when he was an 
executive director of the Company. Jan Houwert retains his earnings 
from these external appointments. He is also an executive director 
of Van der Loeff Beheer B.V. an investment vehicle for the extended 
Houwert family.
Non-executive directors
The fees payable to the non-executive directors are determined by 
the Board, taking into account the time commitment required, the 
responsibilities assumed and comparative market rates. No director 
plays a part in any discussion about his or her own remuneration. 
The fees currently paid to non-executive directors as presented in 
the table below are subject to the limits set in the Articles of 
Association of the Company.

Financials
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Mecom 
Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2008 which comprise 
the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of 
recognised income and expense, the consolidated balance sheet, 
the consolidated cash flow statement and the related Notes 1 to 43. 
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under 
the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the parent company financial 
statements of Mecom Group plc for the year ended 31 December 
2008 and on the information in the Remuneration report that is 
described as having been audited. That report is modified by the 
inclusion of an emphasis of matter. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to 
them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members 
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual report and 
accounts in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the consolidated financial statements in 
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the consolidated financial 
statements give a true and fair view and whether the consolidated 
financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given 
in the Directors’ report is consistent with the financial statements. 
The information given in the Directors’ report includes that specific 
information presented in the Chairman’s statement, the Chief 
Executive’s review, the Market overview, the Divisional reviews, the 
Group Finance Director’s report, Principal risks and uncertainties 
and Corporate social responsibility that is cross referred from the 
Directors’ report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Group has not kept 
proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified 
by law regarding director’s remuneration and other transactions is 
not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate governance report reflects the 
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006 
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not 
required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal 
control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or 
its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual report and 
accounts and consider whether it is consistent with the audited 
consolidated financial statements. The other information comprises 
only the following sections: Introduction, Transformation, New 
revenues, Titles, Our people, Our divisions, the Chairman’s 
statement, Group highlights, the Chief Executive’s review, Market 
overview, the Divisional reviews, the Group Finance Director’s 
report, Principal risks and uncertainties, Corporate social 
responsibility, The Board, the Directors’ report, Corporate 
governance, the unaudited part of the Remuneration report and 
Shareholder information. We consider the implications for our report 
if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material 
inconsistencies with the consolidated financial statements. Our 
responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant 
to the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial 
statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant 
estimates and judgments made by the directors in the preparation 
of the consolidated financial statements, and of whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary in 
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable 
assurance that the consolidated financial statements are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity 
or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall 
adequacy of the presentation of information in the consolidated 
financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view, in •	
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of 
the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2008 and of 
its loss for the year then ended; 
the consolidated financial statements have been properly •	
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; and
the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with •	
the consolidated financial statements.
Emphasis of matter – Going concern
In forming our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, 
which is not qualified, we have considered the adequacy of the 
disclosure made in Note 4 concerning the amendments to the 
existing bank facility agreement, the raising of additional equity and 
the repayment of the convertible loan notes. These conditions, 
along with the other matters explained in Note 4 to the consolidated 
financial statements, indicate the existence of material uncertainties 
which may cast significant doubt about the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements 
do not include the adjustments that would result if the Group was 
unable to continue as a going concern.

April 2009. 
2. Definitions of terms
The Group uses the following terms, with the definition given, in 
these consolidated financial statements and in its internal monitoring 
of financial performance:
Adjusted EBITDA/Adjusted EBITDA margin
The Group monitors the performance of its segments on an earnings 
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”) basis. 
This measure includes any profit or loss from associates but 
excludes any exceptional items. Adjusted EBITDA margin (expressed 
as a percentage) is defined as adjusted EBITDA for a period divided 
by revenue for the same period.
Adjusted operating profit/Adjusted operating profit margin
Adjusted operating profit or loss is stated before exceptional items 
and amortisation of acquired intangibles. Adjusted operating profit 
margin (expressed as a percentage) is defined as adjusted operating 
profit for a period divided by revenue for the same period. 
Exceptional items
The Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the income 
statement those material items of income and expense which, 
because of their nature and/or expected infrequency of the events 
giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders 
to understand better the elements of financial performance in the 
period, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods. 
Net debt
The Group presents as “net debt” the net of cash and cash 
equivalents, borrowings, obligations under finance leases and 
derivative financial instruments. The Group also includes in net debt 
any of the above items that have been classified as held for sale.

4. significant accounting policies (including basis of 
preparation)
Statement of compliance
The Group’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union as they apply to the 
financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 
2008. A summary of the Group’s significant accounting policies 
now follows. 
Basis of preparation: (i) Preparation of the consolidated 
financial statements on the going concern basis
The basis on which the consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared on the going concern basis, and the uncertainties related 
to the Group’s ability to continue in operational existence in the 
foreseeable future, are set out below.
The Group’s financial risk factors are set out in Note 27 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
Background to negotiations on revised bank agreement and 
proposals for an equity issue
The Group’s primary sources of funding are shareholders’ equity 
and bank borrowings. During the second half of 2008, a marked 
deterioration in advertising revenues affecting the Group’s 
profitability indicated that the Group’s leverage was too high for the 
current economic conditions.
In December 2008, the Group announced its intention to reduce 
borrowings and, at the same time, entered into an agreement with 
its lending banks to defer the testing of financial covenants in its 
bank facilities agreement from 31 December 2008 to 28 February 
2009 (which was subsequently deferred further to 31 March 2009, 
then further to 30 April 2009 and further to 31 May 2009, as 
explained below) and engaged in discussions to renegotiate the 
terms of its bank facilities. 
The Group announced the disposal of its German operations in 
January 2009 for consideration of €152.0m (£147.0m) and of its 
northwest Norwegian operations in February 2009 for NOK559.3m 
(£55.5m) as part of its strategy to reduce its borrowings. The cash 
proceeds from these disposals were received by the Group on 27 
March 2009 and 2 April 2009, respectively.
The Group announced on 23 March 2009 that it has been examining 
the merits of an equity fund-raising.
The Group announced on 1 April 2009 that it had also agreed with 
the holders of its convertible loan notes an extension to the maturity 
of these notes from 12 April to 12 May 2009, although it was agreed 
that this extension would accelerate to 30 April 2009 under certain 
conditions. 
On 29 April 2009, the Group entered into an agreement with its 
lending banks for a further deferral of the testing date of financial 
covenants until 31 May 2009 and the Group agreed a further 
extension of the maturity of the convertible loan notes to 12 July 
2009, although it was agreed that this extension would accelerate 
to 31 May 2009 under certain conditions. 
In principle agreement with lending banks on proposed  
revised bank facility agreement and with investors on  
proposed equity issue
On 29 April 2009, the Group:
reached ‘in principle’ agreement with its lending banks (subject •	
to the completion and signing of full documentation and subject 
to the completion of the proposed equity issue by no later than 
14 July 2009) on the terms of a proposed revised bank facility 
agreement. The agreement given by the banks on the key terms 
of the proposed revised facility agreement are not binding on 
the banks but each of the banks has received credit committee 
approval for the same and the Group believes that it is highly 
likely that full documentation will be signed in May 2009; and
received non-binding commitments from current and •	
prospective shareholders (which will be conditional upon, inter 
alia, the Company agreeing acceptable banking terms with its 
lenders, publishing a prospectus and obtaining shareholder 
approval) to subscribe to a proposed share issue of approximately 
£140m (before expenses). The Group intends repaying the 
convertible loan notes from these proceeds.
The Group expects to complete and to sign full banking 
documentation during May 2009, after which it expects that a 
prospectus for the issue of new shares will be issued with a view to 
receiving the proceeds of the equity issue during June 2009.
In the event that full banking documentation is not completed on the 
terms currently agreed or that the proposed equity issue does not 
happen, the Group would continue discussion with its bank lenders 
with a view to agreeing alternative banking terms, but the directors 
cannot determine at this stage whether, or on what basis, alternative 
terms would be agreed.
In the event that full banking documentation is not completed on the 
terms currently agreed or that the proposed equity issue does not 
happen, the Group would also expect to enter into discussions with 
the holders of the Group’s convertible loan notes to restructure the 
maturity of these notes, which would then be due currently and 
which the Group would be unable, in the absence of the agreement 
of the Group’s lending banks, to repay. The directors cannot 
determine at this stage what the outcome of these discussions 
would be.
In the event that the full banking documentation is not completed on 
the terms currently agreed or that the proposed equity issue does 
not happen, the Group’s ability to continue operating as a going 
concern would be dependent, therefore, on the outcome of these 
discussions with its lending banks and with the holders of the 
convertible loan notes.
Key terms of the proposed revised bank facility agreement
The key terms of the revised bank deal (on the basis that share issue 
proceeds and after applying the proceeds of the share issue) will be 
as follows:
total facilities of circa €600m, including a term facility maturing •	
in October 2013 of €350.0m, a revolving credit facility of up to 
€200.0m maturing in October 2013 and an additional term loan 
facility of circa €50m;
the amount of the revolving credit facility will vary according to •	
the Group’s projected working capital requirements and to the 
amount of gross cash on the Group’s balance sheet; 72 Mecom Group plc Annual report and accounts 2008

of the Group, tested annually from 31 December 2009; and
warrants over the Company’s shares issued to the banks which •	
would represent 5% of the existing (pre-equity issue) share 
capital of the Company.
In assessing the Group’s ability to remain in compliance with the 
terms of the revised facility agreement in the foreseeable future, the 
directors have taken into account the fact that the leverage, interest 
cover and operating cash flow covenants would not be tested under 
the proposed revised facility agreement within twelve months of the 
date of these financial statements. 
The directors have also considered the Group’s financial projections 
for the twelve month period from these financial statements as they 
affect the proposed revised bank facility agreement in respect of 
conditions other than the leverage, interest cover and operating 
cash flow covenants. In making its financial projections for these 
purposes, the Group has taken into account that it currently 
generates around 50% of its revenue from advertising, the markets 
for which have tended in the past to reflect the general economic 
conditions of the countries in which the Group operates. The 
remainder of the Group’s revenue includes circulation revenue 
(around 35% of total revenue), which has more stable characteristics 
compared with advertising revenue and has not previously been 
affected by prevailing economic conditions to the extent that 
advertising revenue has been.
The Group’s advertising markets have experienced a considerable 
and systematic downturn in recent months and, although the 
experience of recent weeks’ trading suggests that some stabilisation 
at these lower levels has occurred, the advertising environment 
remains challenging and uncertain. 
In making assumptions of future advertising revenue for the 
purposes of assessing its ability to comply with the terms of the 
proposed revised facility agreement, the Group has used a 
combination of long-term trends, industry and third-party forecasts 
and internal estimates which reflect recent experience in each of our 
markets. If the actual outturn is adverse to these assumptions, the 
Group has identified a number of further mitigating actions that it 
could take to reduce costs or borrowings further.
Going concern basis in the financial statements
The directors believe that the combination of the circumstances 
described above, in particular (a) the uncertainty as to the completion 
of a revised facility agreement on the terms currently agreed (b) the 
uncertainty as to whether the non-binding commitments of investors 
to underwrite the issue of new share capital will result in new shares 
being issued, with the completion of the revised facility arrangements 
and the issue of equity being inter-conditional, and (c) the uncertainty, 
in the event that the revised facility agreement is not completed on 
terms currently agreed or that the new share capital is not issued, 
as to whether the Group could reach satisfactory agreement with 
the holders of its convertible loan notes as to an extension of the 
maturity of those notes, all of which three factors existing within a 
highly uncertain advertising environment, represent a material 
uncertainty that casts significant doubt on the Group’s and the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Nevertheless, 
after making enquiries, and considering the uncertainties described 
above, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
and the Company have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. For these reasons, 
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
Annual report and accounts.
Basis of preparation: (ii) Other
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a 
historical cost basis, except for available-for-sale financial assets, 
derivative financial instruments and share-based payments that 
have been measured at fair value.
These consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling 
and all values are shown in millions, rounded to the nearest one 
hundred thousand pounds, except when otherwise indicated. The 
significant exchange rates for the Group, applied during the current 
and prior periods, are as follows:

NOK 10.4 11.7 10.1 10.8
DKK 9.4 10.9 7.7 10.2
Differences in spot rates from 31 December 2007 to 31 December 
2008 have caused the Group’s assets (including goodwill and other 
intangibles) and liabilities (including borrowings) which are 
denominated in foreign currencies to increase in value when 
retranslated into sterling, resulting in foreign exchange differences 
of £270.8m being credited to reserves in the year ended 
31 December 2008 (year ended 31 December 2007: £91.6m).
The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which 
apply in preparing the financial statements for the year ended  
31 December 2008. Judgements made by management in  
the application of IFRS that have a significant effect on  
these consolidated financial statements and estimates with a 
significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed 
in Note 5 below.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended 31 December 2008 73
Financials
4. significant accounting policies (including basis of 
preparation) continued
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial 
statements of the parent company (Mecom Group plc) and its 
subsidiary undertakings (the “Group”). Subsidiaries are fully 
consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which 
the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the 
date such control ceases. All intra-group balances, transactions, 
income and expenses and profits and losses resulting from intra-
group transactions are eliminated in full.
Minority interest represents the portion of profit or loss and net 
assets not held by the Group and is presented within equity in the 
consolidated balance sheet, separately from parent shareholders’ 
equity. 
Business combinations 
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase 
method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of 
the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities 
incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group 
in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly 
attributable to the business combination. The acquiree’s identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions 
for recognition under IFRS 3 Business Combinations are recognised 
at their fair values at the acquisition date.
In certain circumstances, the initial accounting for a business 
combination is only determined on a provisional basis. The Group 
has up to 12 months from the date of an acquisition to complete its 
work on the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired and finalise 
the cost of the acquisition. Any adjustments the Group makes to the 
provisional values are recognised as if they had occurred at the date 
of the acquisition, causing certain comparative numbers in the 
financial statements to be restated. 
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially 
measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business 
combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the 
acquiree’s identifiable assets (including other intangible assets) and 
liabilities. Any negative goodwill is recognised immediately in the 
income statement. The interest of minority shareholders in the 
acquiree is initially measured at the minority’s proportion of the 
acquiree’s net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the average rate 
applicable during the financial year, unless by doing so a material 
difference arises versus using the spot rate. In this instance, spot 
rates are used. At each balance sheet date, items denominated in 
foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the 
balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on settlement 
and on retranslation of foreign currency items are included in the 
income statement for the period.
Differences on the retranslation of the Group’s net investment in a 
foreign operation at the balance sheet date are recognised directly 
in equity. In the event of the disposal of the net investment, cumulative 
foreign currency differences recorded in equity related to that 
investment are recognised in the income statement as part of the 
gain or loss on disposal.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the 
economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be 
reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the 
consideration receivable for the sale of goods and rendering of 
services, net of discounts, rebates and excluding other sales taxes 
or duty. The following criteria must also be met before revenue  
is recognised: 
(a) Sale of goods
Sale of goods consists of the sale of advertising, newspapers and 
other goods to newspaper and website customers. Revenue from 
the sale of goods is recognised at the time of delivery. Estimated 
returns on non-subscription sales are deducted from revenue.
(b) Rendering of services
Rendering of services consists primarily of the sale of printing and 
distribution services. This revenue is recognised as and when 
services are provided. 
(c) Revenue from barter transactions
Revenue includes amounts recognised from barter transactions. 
The majority of the Group’s barter transactions involve advertising 
services. The Group recognises revenue in relation to barter 
transactions involving advertising services only when the services 
exchanged are dissimilar in nature and when the fair value of the 
advertising services it provides in a barter transaction can be reliably 
measured by reference only to non-barter transactions that:
involve advertising similar to the advertising in the barter •	
transaction;
occur frequently; •	
represent a predominant number of transactions and amount •	
when compared to all transactions to provide advertising that is 
similar to the advertising in the barter transaction;
involve cash and/or another form of consideration that has a •	
reliably measurable fair value; and 
do not involve the same counterparty as in the barter transaction. •	
If the above criteria are met, the Group recognises revenue, with an 
equal and opposite cost recognised as a cost of sale, adjusted for 
any cash payments made from/to the Group. 
(d) Deferred revenue
The proportion of sales revenue relating to the future provision of 
services and goods is recorded as deferred revenue and recognised 
in the income statement as and when the services and goods  
are provided. 
(e) Finance income
Finance income primarily comprises bank interest receivable. This is 
recognised as interest accrues, using the effective interest method.
Tax
(a) Income tax
The tax expense/credit represents the sum of current income tax 
and deferred tax.
The current income tax amount is based on taxable profit for the 
period. Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the 
income statement because it excludes items of income or expense 
that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes 
items that are not taxable or deductible. 74 Mecom Group plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Financials
4. significant accounting policies (including basis of 
preparation) continued
(b) Deferred tax assets and liabilities
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on 
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in 
the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in 
the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the 
liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for 
all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be 
available against which deductible temporary differences can be 
utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences, except where the deferred tax liability arises from the 
initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction 
that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, 
affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit and loss.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary 
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, 
except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the 
temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or 
part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted 
basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when 
the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and 
tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the 
income statement, except when it relates to items charged or 
credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also 
dealt with in equity.
Leases
Assets acquired under a lease that transfer substantially all of the 
risks and rewards of ownership to the Group are capitalised as 
either property, plant and equipment or software. Lease payments 
are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of 
the outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to each 
period during the lease term resulting in a constant periodic rate of 
interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
All other leases are classified as operating leases and rentals 
payable are charged in the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the lease term.
Government grants
Government grants are recognised when it is reasonable to expect 
that the grants will be received and that all related conditions will be 
met, usually on submission of a valid claim for payment. 
Where a grant relates to the purchase of an asset – typically an item 
of property, plant and equipment – the grant is netted off against 
the cost of the asset, thereby reducing future depreciation 
charges. 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
for the year ended 31 December 2008
Grants of a revenue nature are credited to income so as to match 
them with the expenditure to which they relate.
Where a grant is received in the form of a tax reduction, the grant is 
recognised as a reduction in the income tax charge for the period. 
Exceptional items
As explained above, the Group presents as exceptional items on 
the face of the income statement those material items of income 
and expense which, because of their nature and/or expected 
infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate 
presentation to allow shareholders to understand better the 
elements of financial performance in the period, so as to facilitate 
comparison with prior periods. 
Continuing and discontinued operations
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group that has 
either been disposed of, or is classified as held-for-sale (see page 
76 for further details) and (i) represents a separate major line of 
business or geographical area or (ii) is part of a single co-ordinated 
plan to dispose of separate major lines of business or geographical 
areas of operations or (ii) was acquired exclusively with a view to 
resale. 
In the consolidated income statement of the reporting period,  
and of the comparable period of the previous year, income and 
expenses from discontinued operations are reported separately 
from continuing income and expenses, even when the Group retains 
a non-controlling interest in the subsidiary after the sale. The 
resulting profit or loss (after taxes) is reported separately in the 
income statement.
In certain Notes to these consolidated financial statements, the 
Group differentiates between items relating to the “continuing 
operations” and items relating to the “discontinued operations”. 
Goodwill
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is initially measured  
at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination 
over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Following initial 
recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated 
impairment losses. 
As required by IFRS, goodwill is tested for impairment at least 
annually or at other times when circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value of goodwill may be impaired.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit (or group of 
cash-generating units) and the cash-generating unit or an operation 
within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the 
cash-generating unit or operation disposed of is included in the 
carrying amount when determining the gain or loss on disposal.
Other intangible assets
An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination  
is recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises 
from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be 
measured reliably. 75
Financials
4. significant accounting policies (including basis of 
preparation) continued
The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination  
is the fair value as at date of acquisition. Following initial  
recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any 
accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. 
Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the useful life 
of the assets.
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are measured 
on initial recognition at cost. 
Internally developed IT infrastructure and software assets (for own 
use) are recognised on clearly defined projects when the recognition 
criteria of IAS 38 Intangible Assets, are met. Otherwise such 
expenditure is written off as incurred. 
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over their useful lives 
and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that 
the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and 
the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful 
life are reviewed at least at each financial year end. 
Intangible assets are amortised over the following periods:
Customer relationships    2–14 years
Brands    4–20 years
Purchased and developed software   2–7 years
No intangible assets are assessed as having indefinite lives.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment in value. Depreciation is 
calculated on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the assets. 
Costs associated with assets under construction are capitalised 
during the implementation period and are not depreciated. On 
completion of the project implementation the asset is transferred  
to another property, plant and equipment asset category  
as appropriate.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed 
for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
The Group reviews residual values and useful lives on an annual 
basis and any adjustments are made prospectively. 
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon 
disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise 
from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the 
derecognition of the asset is recorded in the income statement in 
the period of derecognition.
Property, plant and equipment is depreciated over the following 
periods:
Buildings 10–50 years
Leasehold improvements Shorter of 20 years  
 and term of lease
Machinery and equipment 6–20 years
Fixtures and fittings, motor vehicles, computers  
 and other operational assets    3–10 years
Interests in associates
The Group’s interests in its associates are accounted for using the 
equity method of accounting.
Under the equity method, the investment in the associate is carried 
in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the 
Group’s share of net assets of the associate less distributions 
received and any impairment in value. Goodwill relating to an 
associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment and 
is not amortised. The income statement reflects the share of the 
results of operations of the associate after tax. Profits and losses 
resulting from the transactions between the Group and the associate 
are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate. The 
financial statements of the Group’s associates are prepared for the 
same reporting period as the Group. Where necessary, adjustments 
are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of  
the Group.
Interests in joint ventures
The Group has interests in joint ventures which are jointly controlled 
entities. The Group recognises its interest in joint ventures using 
proportionate consolidation, under which the Group combines its 
share of each of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of the 
joint venture with similar items, line-by-line, in its consolidated 
financial statements. The financial statements of the Group’s joint 
ventures are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. 
Where necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting 
policies in line with those of the Group.
Impairment of non-financial assets 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets are  
tested annually for impairment (as required by IFRS in the case of 
goodwill) or when circumstances indicate that the carrying values 
may be impaired. 
If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for 
an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an 
asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (“CGU”) fair value less costs to sell 
and its value-in-use and is determined for an individual asset, unless 
the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent 
of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying 
amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the 
asset is considered to be impaired and is written down to its 
recoverable amount. In assessing value-in-use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. In 
determining fair value less costs to sell, an appropriate valuation 
model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation 
multiples or other available fair value indicators.  76 Mecom Group plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Financials
4. significant accounting policies (including basis of 
preparation) continued
Impairment losses on continuing and discontinued operations are 
recognised in the income statement as exceptional items. 
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, including the cost incurred 
in bringing each product to its present location and condition and 
net realisable value. The cost of inventories is measured on a first-in, 
first-out basis. 
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the 
estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Assets held for sale
Disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying 
amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than 
through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only 
when the sale is highly probable and the disposal group is available 
for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be 
committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for 
recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date  
of classification.
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets once classified 
as held for sale are not depreciated/amortised.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s 
balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
(a) Financial assets
Financial assets are recognised when the Group becomes party to 
the contracts that give rise to them and are classified as:
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; •	
held-to-maturity investments; •	
available-for-sale financial assets; •	
loans and receivables, or as •	
derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective •	
hedge, as appropriate. 
(i) Initial recognition
Financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case 
of investments not at fair value through profit or loss, directly 
attributable transaction costs.
The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at 
initial recognition and, where allowed and appropriate, reassesses 
this designation at each balance sheet date. 
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets 
within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the 
marketplace (regular way purchases) are recognised on the trade 
date, i.e., the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell  
the asset.
The Group’s financial assets include cash and cash equivalents, 
trade and other receivables, loans and other receivables, quoted 
and unquoted investments and derivative financial instruments.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
for the year ended 31 December 2008
(ii) Subsequent measurement
The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their 
classification as follows:
(iii) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
Financial assets classified as held-for-trading and other assets 
designated as such on inception are included in this category. 
Financial assets are classified as held-for-trading if they are acquired 
for sale in the short term. Once a financial asset has been classified 
into this category, such classification cannot be revoked. 
The Group’s interest rate swaps fall within this category to the extent 
they are not designated as effective hedging instruments. Assets in 
this category are included within derivative financial instruments 
within non-current assets or current assets and are carried in the 
balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognised in the 
income statement. At 31 December 2008, the Group had no 
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss because all of its 
derivative financial instruments were designated as effective hedging 
instruments. At 31 December 2007, the Group balance sheet 
included £5.1m of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
(see Note 22).
(iv) Held-to-maturity investments
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments 
and fixed maturity are classified as held-to-maturity when the  
Group has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. At 
31 December 2008 and 2007, the Group had no held-to-maturity 
investments.
(v) Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial 
assets that are either designated in this category or are not classified 
in any of the other categories. They are included in non-current 
assets unless the Group intends to dispose of the investment within 
12 months of the balance sheet date.
The Group’s quoted investments are classified as available-for-sale. 
After initial recognition, they are measured at fair value by reference 
to bid prices at the close of business on the balance sheet date. 
Unrealised gains or losses are recognised, net of related taxes, 
directly in equity via the revaluation reserve until the investment is 
derecognised or until the investment is determined to be impaired 
(see below) at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously 
reported in equity is included in the income statement.
The Group’s unquoted investments are also classified as available-
for-sale. They are carried at cost less impairment since reliable fair 
values are not available for the investments.
(vi) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed 
or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, 
do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as 
either fair value through profit and loss or available-for-sale. 
They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities 
of more than 12 months after the balance sheet date which are 
classified as non-current assets. Accounts receivable and cash and 
cash equivalents are classified as loans and receivables in the 
balance sheet. 77
Financials
4. significant accounting policies (including basis of 
preparation) continued
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method if the time value of money is significant. Gains and losses 
are recognised in the income statement when the loans and 
receivables are derecognised or impaired (see below), as well as 
through the amortisation process.
(vii) Derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an 
effective hedge
Refer to page 78 for the accounting policy on items within this 
classification. 
(viii) Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is 
any objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial 
assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets  
is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence 
of impairment as a result of one or more events that has occurred 
after the initial recognition of the asset (an incurred “loss event”)  
and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash 
flows of the financial asset or the group of financial assets that can 
be reliably estimated. 
In the case of equity securities classified as available-for-sale, a 
significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below 
its cost is considered as an indicator that the securities are 
permanently impaired. If any such evidence exists for available- 
for-sale financial assets, the cumulative loss – measured as the 
difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, 
less any permanent impairment loss on that financial asset previously 
recognised in profit or loss – is removed from equity and recognised 
in the income statement. Impairment losses recognised in the 
income statement on equity instruments are not reversed through 
the income statement – increases in the fair value after impairment 
are recognised directly in equity. 
When securities classified as available-for-sale are sold or 
permanently impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments 
recognised in equity are recycled through the income statement.
In relation to trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made 
when there is objective evidence (such as the probability of 
insolvency or significant financed difficulties of the debtor) that the 
Group will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the 
original terms of the invoice. The carrying amount of the receivable 
is reduced through use of an allowance account. Impaired trade 
receivables are derecognised when they are assessed as 
irrecoverable.
(ix) Derecognition of financial assets
A financial asset is derecognised when the contract that gives rise 
to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
(b) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at 
bank and in-hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity 
of three months or less. For the purpose of the consolidated cash 
flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash 
equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
(c) Trade receivables
Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by 
appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. A 
provision is made and charged to the income statement where 
there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect 
all amounts due according to the original terms.
(d) Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified  
according to the substance of the contractual arrangements  
entered into. The Group’s financial liabilities include borrowings, 
trade and other payables, compound instruments and derivative 
financial instruments. 
(i) Initial recognition
Financial liabilities are classified as:
loans and borrowings; •	
derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective •	
hedge, as appropriate; or as
financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, as •	
appropriate.
The Group determines the classification of its financial liabilities at 
initial recognition. Financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair 
value and in the case of loans and borrowings, directly attributable 
transaction costs.
(ii) Subsequent measurement
The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification 
as follows:
(iii) Loans and borrowings
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method.
(iv) Derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an 
effective hedge
Refer to page 78 for the accounting policy on items within this 
classification. 
(v) Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss includes financial 
liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon 
initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial liabilities are classified as held-for-trading if they are 
acquired for the purpose of selling in the near term. This category 
includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Group 
that do not meet the hedge accounting criteria as defined by IAS 39 
Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. 
Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the 
income statement.
At 31 December 2008 and 2007, the Group has not designated any 
financial liabilities as at fair value through profit or loss. 78 Mecom Group plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Financials
4. significant accounting policies (including basis of 
preparation) continued
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the 
liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation 
process. Gains and losses on the repurchase, settlement or 
otherwise cancellation of borrowings are recognised in finance 
income and finance expense, respectively.
(e) Trade payables
Trade payables are stated at their nominal value.
 
(f) Compound instruments
The component parts of compound instruments issued by the 
Group are classified separately as financial liabilities and equity in 
accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement. At 
the date of issue, in the case of a convertible bond that will either be 
repaid or converted into ordinary shares of the Company, the 
instrument is split for accounting purposes between the liability 
element and the equity component, representing the fair value of 
the embedded option to convert the liability into equity. The fair 
value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing 
market interest rate for a similar non-convertible instrument. This 
amount is recorded as a liability on an amortised cost basis using 
the effective interest method until extinguished upon conversion or 
at the instrument’s maturity date. 
The unwinding of the discount in respect of the amount recognised 
as a liability on issue is recognised within finance expense in the 
income statement. 
 
(g) Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, such as interest 
rate swaps, to hedge its risks associated with interest rate 
fluctuations. Such derivative financial instruments are initially 
recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is 
entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. 
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and 
as liabilities when the fair value is negative. 
Derivative instruments are classified as current or non-current or 
separated into a current and non-current portion based on an 
assessment of the facts and circumstances (i.e., the underlying 
contracted cash flows).
The Group has a policy not to undertake any speculative activity in 
financial instruments.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by reference to 
market values for similar instruments.
(i) Hedge accounting
For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge 
accounting is desired, the hedging relationship is formally designated 
and documented at its inception. This documentation identifies the 
risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, 
the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature 
of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured 
throughout its duration. Such hedges are expected at inception to 
be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows 
and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they 
actually have been highly effective throughout the reporting period 
for which they were designated.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
for the year ended 31 December 2008
For the purpose of hedge accounting, the Group classifies its 
hedges as either:
cash flow hedges •	 when hedging exposure to variability in cash 
flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated 
with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast 
transaction; or
hedges of a •	 net investment in a foreign operation.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivatives 
that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to the 
income statement (see above). 
The treatment of gains and losses arising from revaluing derivatives 
designated as hedging instruments depends on the nature of the 
hedging relationship, as follows:
(ii) Cash flow hedges
The Group applies cash flow hedge accounting when it hedges 
exposure to variability in cash flows associated with a recognised 
asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction and where 
the hedge is expected to be highly effective.
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument 
is recognised directly in equity, while any ineffective portion is 
recognised immediately in the income statement (see above).
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement 
when the hedged transaction affects the income statement. Where 
the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or non-financial 
liability, the amounts previously taken to equity are transferred to the 
initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts 
previously recognised in equity are transferred to the income 
statement. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated 
or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as 
a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity remain 
in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are transferred to 
the income statement or to the initial carrying amount of a non-
financial asset or liability, as above. 
(iii) Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation
Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation, including a hedge 
of a monetary item that is accounted for as part of the net investment, 
are accounted for in a way similar to cash flow hedges. Gains or 
losses relating to the effective portion are recognised directly  
in equity while any gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion 
are recognised in the income statement. On disposal of the  
foreign operation, the cumulative value of any such gains or  
losses recognised directly in equity is transferred to the  
income statement.
(h) Derecognition of financial liabilities
A financial liability is generally derecognised when the contract that 
gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires. Where an 
existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender 
on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability 
are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is 
treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition 
of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying 
amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in 
the income statement. 79
Financials
4. significant accounting policies (including basis of 
preparation) continued
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation 
as a result of a past event, where the obligation can be estimated 
reliably, and where it is probable that an outflow of economic 
benefits will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are 
measured at the directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required 
to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted 
to present value where the effect is material. Where discounting is 
used, the increase in the provision due to unwinding the discount is 
recognised as a finance expense.
Employee benefits
For defined contribution pension plans, the contribution to employees’ 
pension savings is expensed over the period to which it relates. 
For defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit 
arrangements, pension expenses and pension liabilities are 
calculated based on the projected unit credit method, which 
attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period and to prior 
periods, using assumptions for various factors including discount 
rates, future salary adjustments, pensions, future return on pension 
plan assets, mortality rates and transfers out of the plan. Pension 
plan assets are valued at fair value and deducted from net pension 
liabilities in the balance sheet. Any surplus is recognised to the 
extent that it is likely that the surplus may be utilised or repaid. 
 
The interest element of the defined benefit cost represents the 
change in present value of scheme obligations resulting from the 
passage of time, and is determined by applying the discount rate to 
the opening present value of the benefit obligation, taking into 
account material changes in the obligation during the period.
The expected return on plan assets is based on the long-term 
market return on scheme assets adjusted for the effect on the fair 
value of plan assets of contributions received and benefits paid 
during the period. The difference between the expected return on 
plan assets and the interest cost is recognised in the income 
statement as part of operating expenses.
Past service costs are recognised in the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period or immediately if the 
benefits have vested. Changes in the pension liability due to changes 
in pension plans are expensed immediately if vested. Changes in 
liabilities and pension plan assets due to actuarial gains or losses 
from the estimated assumptions are recognised immediately in the 
statement of recognised income and expense.
Equity instruments 
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual 
interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Share-based payments 
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value 
(excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions) at the 
date of grant. The fair value is calculated using either a Monte Carlo 
simulation model or a binomial model depending on the 
appropriateness of the model to the grant in question and is 
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. There is a 
corresponding amount recognised in reserves, equivalent to the 
expense recorded in the period.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense 
is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period 
has expired and management’s best estimate of the achievement 
or otherwise of non-market performance conditions, and hence the 
number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The movement 
in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is 
recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in 
equity.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional 
share dilution in the computation of earnings per share (see  
Note 14).
5.  significant accounting judgements and key 
sources of estimation uncertainty 
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are 
described in Note 4 above, the directors are required to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts 
reported for assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date and 
the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the year. 
However, the nature of estimation means that actual outcomes 
could differ from those estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in 
the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects that 
period only, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the 
revision affects both current and future periods. 
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting 
policies
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, the 
directors have made the following judgements, apart from those 
involving estimations, which have the most significant effect on the 
amounts recognised in the financial statements:
(a) Taxation 
The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to routine tax audits 
and also a process whereby tax computations are discussed  
and agreed with the appropriate authorities. Whilst the ultimate 
outcome of such tax audits and discussions cannot be  
determined with certainty, management estimates the level of 
provisions required for both current and deferred tax on the basis  
of professional advice and the nature of current discussions with the 
tax authority concerned. 
(b) Recoverability of deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all unused tax losses to the 
extent that it is probable that a taxable profit or loss will be utilised. 
Significant management judgement is required to determine the 
amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon 
the likely timing and level of future taxable profits. Details of deferred 
tax balances are contained in Note 28.
Estimates and assumptions
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources 
of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are 
discussed below. 80 Mecom Group plc Annual report and accounts 2008

6. segment information
The Group’s primary reporting format is determined to be geographical segments as the Group’s risks and rates of return are affected 
predominantly by the territories in which each of the businesses operates. The Group does not report a secondary segment format as the 
Group considers it has only one business segment, being the operation of newspaper publishing, content and consumer businesses  
in Europe.
The geographical segments are based on the location of the Group’s assets. Sales to external customers disclosed in the geographical 
segments are based on the geographical location of its customers. The segment “Norway” incorporates certain operations in Sweden and 
the segment Poland incorporates certain operations in Ukraine. 
The segment “Central and other” from the start of 2008 comprises only the Group’s head-office activities whereas for the year ended 31 
December 2007 it also included the Group’s Direct Marketing activities, which were disposed of during 2008 (see Note 39 for further 
details). Segment result is shown both before and after exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles. There are no significant 
inter-segment revenues. Finance income and finance expense, gains or losses on disposal of subsidiaries and investments and income tax 
expense/credit are treated as unallocated. 
Segment assets comprise all classes of assets except for cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments, current tax assets 
and deferred tax assets which are treated as unallocated. Segment liabilities comprise all classes of liabilities except borrowings, derivative 
financial instruments, current tax liabilities and deferred tax liabilities which are treated as unallocated. Capital expenditure excludes any 
items purchased via a business combination and for the purposes of this note includes both property, plant and equipment additions and 
software additions. Acquired non-current assets comprise goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment purchased 
during the year as part of a business combination. The following tables present the revenue, result and asset and liability information 
regarding the Group’s geographical segments.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
for the year ended 31 December 2008
5.  significant accounting judgements and key 
sources of estimation uncertainty continued
(a) Impairment of goodwill and acquired intangibles
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least on an 
annual basis. This requires an estimation of the value-in-use of the 
cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. Estimating 
a value-in-use amount requires the directors to make an estimate of 
the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and 
also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the 
present value of those cash flows. Details of goodwill are contained 
in Note 15. 
As part of the Group’s goodwill impairment review, the Group’s 
acquired intangibles (comprising customer relationships and 
brands) are also assessed for impairment at least annually, using 
the same approach as described in the above paragraph. When a 
CGU’s goodwill is fully impaired, any remaining excess of book 
value over recoverable amount in firstly written-off against the 
CGU’s acquired intangibles. Details of the impairment of acquired 
intangibles are contained in Note 16.
(b) Valuation of acquired intangibles 
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase 
method and the purchase consideration is allocated over the net fair 
value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
acquired with any excess consideration representing goodwill. In 
determining the fair value of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
acquired, the directors may make significant estimates and 
assumptions, including those with respect to cash flows and 
unprovided liabilities and commitments.
(c) Useful lives of acquired intangibles
On acquisition of subsidiaries the Group will consider the useful 
lives of any intangible assets acquired. The length of useful lives of 
customer relationships is assessed based on the average lives  
of historic customer relationships for all main titles. The length of 
useful lives of brands is assessed based on the directors’ view  
of the market and on the length of the time that the main titles have 
been established.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an 
intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at each 
financial year end. Details of asset lives are contained in Note 4.
(d) Provisions 
The amounts provided for restructuring and redundancy provisions 
and other provisions are based on the directors’ best estimates of 
costs likely to be incurred to the extent that they are recognisable 
under relevant reporting standards. To the extent that events or 
costs differ in future, the carrying value of provisions may change. 
Details of provisions are contained in Note 30.
(e) Employee benefit obligations
The cost of defined benefit pension plans and other retirement 
benefits is determined using actuarial valuations. The actuarial 
valuation involves making assumptions about discount rates, 
expected rates of return on assets, future salary increases, mortality 
rates and future pension increases. Due to the long-term nature of 
these plans, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. 
Details of employee benefit obligations are contained in Note 31.

10. Exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles 
The Group presents as exceptional items separately on the face of the income statement those material items of income and expense 
which, because of their nature and/or the infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders 
to understand better the elements of financial performance in the period, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods. The Group also 
separates the amortisation of acquired intangibles on the face of the income statement since, whilst accounting standards require the 
recognition of this amortisation as an expense, it is not an underlying operating expense of the Group’s businesses.

2008 exceptional items
Continuing operations
Staff redundancy costs for the year ended 31 December 2008 relate to the Group’s cost reduction programmes through the reduction of 
full-time equivalent employee numbers. The staff redundancy costs include charges for restructuring in the Netherlands of £43.0m and in 
Denmark of £10.0m. Title restructuring costs relate primarily to the change of format of titles in the Netherlands from broadsheet to tabloid. 
Site and other restructuring costs include charges related to the reorganisation and refurbishment of the Copenhagen offices and costs 
associated with the moving of the listing of the Company’s shares from AIM to the main list of the LSE. 86 Mecom Group plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Financials
10. Exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles continued
Impairment charges of £861.3m resulted from the Group’s assessment of the recoverable amount of non-current assets and reflect  
the effect that the current economic climate has had on the value of the Group’s assets. Further details are given in Notes 15, 16, 17,  
18 and 20. 
The mark-to-market losses on interest rate swaps arose on swaps associated with the Group’s previous borrowing facility. These swaps 
were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes and therefore movements in the fair value of the swaps (which were non-cash) 
were recognised in the income statement. These swaps were cancelled and new swaps, which are designated as cashflow hedges of the 
Group’s variable rate borrowings, were entered into in March 2008.
The Group paid a fee to its lending banks of £2.3m and incurred additional related costs of £1.0m on agreeing a deferral of the December 
2008 covenant tests under the Group’s bank borrowings. Of the total amendment fee on renegotiation of borrowings of £3.3m, £2.9m 
relates to continuing operations. 
The Group has recorded exceptional finance costs of £1.2m related to the unwinding of discount on exceptional restructuring provisions.
In addition to the exceptional items noted above, an exceptional tax credit of £7.8m was recorded in 2008. £15.4m of this is due to deferred 
tax credits arising on the amortisation of the Group acquired intangibles. Further credits of £10.4m and £2.2m arose as a consequence of 
impairing Denmark’s and Poland’s acquired intangibles by £41.7m and £11.6m, respectively (see Note 16). A charge of £32.4m arose on the 
write-down of the Group’s Denmark tax assets after it was determined that these were not recoverable. The remaining balance of £12.2m 
relates to exceptional tax credits recorded on exceptional operating and finance items.
Discontinued operations
Staff redundancy costs relate to the discontinued operation’s cost reduction programmes through the reduction of full-time equivalent 
employee numbers. As described in more detail in Note 13, the impairment charge in respect of goodwill results from the write-down of the 
assets of the Group’s Germany operations to the net proceeds of the disposal which completed in March 2009. The finance exceptional 
costs relate to market-to-market losses on interest rate swaps (£0.2m), a share of the amendment fee on renegotiation of borrowings 
(£0.4m) and unwinding of discounts on exceptional provisions (£0.3m). 
In addition to the exceptional items noted above, an exceptional tax charge of £2.9m was recorded in 2008. A charge of £5.4m arose on 
the write-down of Germany’s deferred tax assets after it was determined that these were not recoverable. This was offset by £1.9m due to 
deferred tax credits arising on the amortisation of Germany’s acquired intangibles. £0.6m relates to an exceptional tax credit arising from 
the reversal of an exceptional tax provision made in 2007. 
2007 exceptional items
Continuing operations
Staff redundancy costs for the year to 31 December 2007 related to the Group’s continuing cost reduction programmes through the 
reduction of full-time equivalent employee numbers. Title restructuring costs for the year to 31 December 2007 related primarily to the 
losses at the DATO free-sheet business in Denmark until its closure in early April 2007 and the related costs of closure. Site and other 
restructuring costs for the year to 31 December 2007 related to the costs of reorganising the Group’s acquired operations and of establishing 
the Group head office and financial and operating procedures.
The income and expense arising on the ending of hedge relationships on interest rate swaps and the write-off of deferred debt issue costs 
relate to the refinancing of the Group’s borrowing facilities in October 2007. Further details of the refinancing are contained in Note 26.
In addition to the exceptional items noted above, an exceptional tax credit of £23.1m was recorded in 2007. £8.4m of this is due to deferred 
tax credits arising on the amortisation of the Group acquired intangibles. £1.9m of this credit arose on the reduction of previously recorded 
net deferred tax liabilities in Denmark following the change in the income tax rate from 28.0% to 25.0%. The remaining balance of £12.8m 
relates to exceptional tax recorded on exceptional operating and finance items. 
Discontinued operations
Staff redundancy costs related to the discontinued operation’s cost reduction programmes through the reduction of full-time equivalent 
employee numbers. Site and other costs related to the costs of reorganising the acquired German operations. The finance exceptional cost 
related to the write-off of unamortised debt issue costs on the Group’s refinancing in 2007.
As noted above, an exceptional tax credit of £7.0m was recorded in 2007. £1.3m of this is due to deferred tax credits arising on the 
amortisation of the Group acquired intangibles. £3.8m of this credit arose on the reduction of previously recorded net deferred tax liabilities 
in Germany following the change in the income tax rate from 38.9% to 30.2%. The remaining balance of £1.9m relates to exceptional tax 
recorded on exceptional operating and finance items.
Amortisation of acquired intangibles for the years ended 31 December 2008 and 2007
Continuing operations
In the year ended 31 December 2008, the Group recorded a charge of £60.6m (year ended 31 December 2007: £33.4m) in respect of its 
acquired intangibles. The primary reason for the increase in the charge from the prior period is that the acquisition of Wegener occurred in 
October 2007, resulting in a full year amortisation charge in 2008 but only a partial charge in 2007. Note 6 above analyses the amortisation 
of acquired intangibles by geographical segment.

Discontinued operations
In the year ended 31 December 2008, the discontinued operation recorded a charge of £6.3m (year ended 31 December 2007: £3.9m) in 
respect of its acquired intangibles. The reason for the increase in the charge from the prior period is that the acquisition of Berliner Verlag 
occurred in April 2007, resulting in a full year amortisation charge in 2008 but only a partial charge in 2007. 
11. Finance income and expense 
Below is an analysis of the Group’s finance income and expense, split between continuing and discontinued operations and also split 
between regular and exceptional items. The prior year comparative figures are shown as restated, arising from the directors opting to

The non-tax deductible expenses in 2008 relate primarily to the Group’s £951.9m impairment charge in respect of goodwill which does not 
attract any tax credits. 
During the year, the Group wrote-off a total of £37.8m of deferred tax assets (see Note 28). £28.0m of this is shown above as “write off of 
deferred tax balances”, with £9.8m being included in “current year losses for which no deferred tax is recognised”.
As explained in Note 10, the credit arising on the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of changes in the statutory 
corporation tax rates in Denmark and Germany was treated as an exceptional item in 2007. 
13. Discontinued operations and assets held for sale
Year ended 31 December 2008
On 12 January 2009, the Group entered into a sale agreement to dispose of all of its German operations. On a cash- and debt-free basis, 
the purchase price agreed with the purchaser, M. DuMont Schauberg Expedition der Kölnischen Zeitung GmbH & Co KG, was €152.0m, 
or £147.0m at the closing 2008 exchange rate. The disposal is part of the Group’s strategy to strengthen its balance sheet and to ensure 
the remaining Group is in a stronger position to operate successfully in the current market conditions. To this end, the proceeds from this 
disposal were used to reduce the Group’s borrowings. At 31 December 2008 negotiations for the sale were at an advanced stage and the 
disposal completed on March 27 2009. 
This operation was accounted for as a subsidiary in 2008 before being classified as a discontinued operation and a disposal group held for 
sale. This operation, which represents a major component of the Group, is a separate reportable geographical segment in both 2008 and 
2007 (see Note 6).

As noted above, the purchase price on a cash- and debt-free basis was £147.0m. The terms of the sale and purchase agreement allowed 
for certain adjustments to be made to this amount in order to arrive at the actual gross proceeds that flowed into the Group on completion 
of the disposal. After deducting £4.5m for debt assumed and £3.9m for estimated selling costs and adding £0.1m for certain working capital 
adjustments, the net proceeds were £138.7m. It should be noted that the amount of £138.7m is net of £5.5m of cash sold with the business 
on a euro-for-euro basis.
On completion of the disposal, the Group was contractually obliged to immediately repay £99.8m (€103.3m) of the net proceeds to the 
lending banks, this being a condition of the 22 December renegotiation (see Note 26 for further details).
As a consequence of the net disposal proceeds being lower than the disposal group’s book value, an impairment charge has been 
recognised in 2008 of £149.3m in order to write the disposal group’s net assets down to their fair value less costs to sell. This amount is 
included within the disposal group’s exceptional operating costs of £159.2m, as set out above. 
Year ended 31 December 2007
During 2007, the Board resolved to dispose of the Group’s De Trompetter operations in the Netherlands and its Direct Marketing operations 
in Norway and Sweden. The disposal of De Trompetter arose because of a condition imposed by the competition authorities in the 
Netherlands related to the Group’s acquisition of Wegener in October 2007. The Group decided to dispose of its Direct Marketing operations 
because management consider it to be a non-core activity. Both of these operations were accounted for as subsidiaries before being 
classified as held for sale.
These operations were classified as disposal groups held for sale and presented separately in the balance sheet at 31 December 2007. The 
De Trompetter and Direct Marketing operations are included in “The Netherlands” and “Central and other” segments, respectively, in the 
segmental analysis in Note 6. 
At 31 December 2007, the disposal proceeds for each of these operations were expected to exceed the book values of the respective 
related net assets. Accordingly no impairment losses were recognised in 2007 on the classification of these operations as held for sale. 
The major classes of assets and liabilities constituting the operations classified as held for sale at 31 December 2007 were as follows:

In 2008, the De Trompetter and Direct Marketing operations were disposed of. Refer to Note 39 for details of these disposals. 
14. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net profit/(loss) for the period attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
Basic adjusted earnings per share is calculated by dividing adjusted earnings for the period attributable to ordinary equity holders of the 
parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Adjusted earnings are the profit/(loss) for the 
period attributed to ordinary equity holders of the parent adjusted to exclude exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles (net 
of related tax and minority interests).

14. Earnings per share continued
Diluted earnings per share and diluted adjusted earnings per share are calculated after assessing the effect of potentially dilutive shares 
issued under convertible loan notes (see Note 26) and the Group’s share-based payment awards (see Note 35). The potential shares did 
not give rise to a decrease in profit per share or an increase in loss per share. As such, potential shares were considered anti-dilutive and 
did not lead to adjustments in diluted earnings per share or diluted adjusted earnings per share.
There have been no other transactions involving ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares between the reporting date and the date of 
authorisation of these financial statements.

Adjusted earnings per share
The directors believe that the presentation of adjusted earnings per share, being the basic earnings per share adjusted for exceptional items 
and amortisation of acquired intangibles, helps to explain the underlying performance of the Group. A reconciliation of basic to adjusted

The carrying value of goodwill by CGU was as follows at 31 December:
       2008 2007 
CGu s       £m £m
The Netherlands       132.3 520.8

Poland       – 14.0
Germany       – 178.3
       204.2 976.7
The CGUs given above to which goodwill arising from business combinations has been allocated are also the reportable segments of the 
Group, since the management of the Group’s operations and the derivation of its cash flows are done at the country level.
Annual impairment test
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. The recoverable 
amount of each CGU is determined either from (a) “value-in-use” calculations, using cash flow projections based on the most recent 
financial budgets approved by the Board and management forecasts beyond the period of these budgets or, if higher, (b) current valuations 
of disposal proceeds less costs to sell, based on prospective transactions involving the specific Group assets involved in disposals 
transactions, recent comparable transactions or valuations of publicly traded companies.
The key assumptions to which the value-in-use calculations are most sensitive are:
revenue growth rates (for periods within the cash flow projections and in perpetuity for the calculation of the terminal value); •	
EBITDA margins (as a driver for the cash generation of segments before working capital requirements); •	
future levels of maintenance capital expenditure; and •	
discount rates. •	
Revenue growth rates, EBITDA margins and future levels of capital expenditure are based on past experience and expected future 
developments in the Group’s CGUs. Cash flows for periods beyond the Group’s own budgets and forecasts are projected at rates that take 
into consideration forecast GDP growth rates for each country. Longer-term and perpetuity growth rates do not exceed the average long-
term growth rates for each country of the Group’s operations.

15. Goodwill continued
The discount rate applied to each CGU is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to each CGU’s cash flow projections, based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital.
The discount rates and growth rates used in the value-in-use calculations by CGU are as follows:
 
     Discount rate Growth rate Discount rate Growth rate 
     2008 2008 2007 2007 
CGu s     % % % %
The Netherlands     12.5% 1.2% 9.8% 1.5%
Denmark     10.3% 1.4% 9.0% 1.5%
Norway     13.0% 1.6% 10.1% 1.5%
Poland     14.8% 1.7% 11.4% 1.5%
Germany     n/a n/a 9.9% 1.5%
No value-in-use calculation was carried out for the Germany CGU at 31 December 2008 since it was accounted for as held for sale, at the 
estimated proceeds of the disposal of that business (see Note 13).
The growth rates given in the table above are those used in perpetuity in the calculation of value-in-use.
The calculation of impairment charges in Norway used (i) value-in-use calculations for the elements of the business that the Group continue 
to own after the disposal of the Northwestern Norway assets sold in April 2009 (see Note 41) and (ii) the recoverable amount of the assets 
sold. 
Impairment charges resulted from the 2008 impairment test, or in the case of the Group’s Germany segment, the write-down of assets held 
for sale to recoverable amount, as set out below. The impairment charges result from the effect that the deteriorating economic conditions 
have had on the future cash flows of the Group’s businesses, all of which have been acquired recently in markets where valuation multiples 
have been higher and growth prospects better.

The impairment losses have been recognised in the same reportable segment as indicated above.
Since the value-in-use calculations above have been used to determine the carrying amount of goodwill, in the case of the Netherlands and 
Norway where goodwill remains on the balance sheet, any adverse change in a key assumption used would cause the carrying amount to 
exceed the recoverable amount, resulting in further impairment charges to be recognised. 94 Mecom Group plc Annual report and accounts 2008

During the year, the directors reviewed the classification of certain items within the Group’s property, plant and equipment. As a result of 
this, a net transfer of £9.3m to software from property, plant and equipment was recorded. 
The impairment charge recorded in the year to 31 December 2008 of £53.3m relates to the Group’s Denmark and Poland segments and 
resulted from the value-in-use calculations described in Note 15 above. This amount represents the remaining excess of these CGUs’ book 
values over their recoverable amounts after their goodwill had been fully written-down. On recording the impairment charge, the related 
deferred tax liability was reduced by £12.6m (see Note 10).

During the year, the Group’s investment in Asker og Bærum Budstikke ASA was impaired, resulting in a charge of £0.5m which is included 
within exceptional items in the consolidated income statement. 
At 31 December 2008, the Group includes within interests in associates its 54.6% (2007: 59.9%) stake in Nationale Regiopers C.V. because, 
whilst this investment is above 50%, the Group does not have either control or joint-control over its operating and financial policies.
There were no unrecognised losses relating to the Group’s interests in associates in the years ended 31 December 2008 and 2007. The 
directors note that there are no significant restrictions on the ability of associates to transfer funds to the Group and no associate interest 
has a reporting date different to that of the Group.

1 The Group acquired an additional 50.0% of this entity in March 2009 and will fully consolidate its results and balance sheet from that date.
At 31 December 2008 and 2007, the Group’s stake in AD NieuwsMedia B.V. of 37.0% is classified as a joint venture because, whilst the 
Group owns less than 50% of this entity, it does have joint control over its operating and financial policies.
At 31 December 2008 and 2007, the Group’s stake in Mensenlinq B.V. of 65.0% is classified as a joint venture because, whilst the Group 
owns more than 50% of this entity, it does not have sole control of its operating and financial policies, but it does have joint control. 
At 31 December 2008 and 2007, the Group’s stakes in Bilzonen A/S, Dansk Avis Omdeling A/S and Jobzonen A/S are classified as  
joint ventures because, whilst the Group owns less than 50% of these entities, it does have joint control over their respective operating and  
financial policies.
The Group’s share of the assets and liabilities of the jointly-controlled entities as reported in these financial statements as at 31 December 
2008 and 2007 is set out in the following table. No individual joint venture represents a material proportion of the totals below.

In the absence of a signed revised facility agreement for its bank borrowings (as explained further in Note 4 above), the Group has classified 
all bank borrowings as current at 31 December 2008. In addition, the convertible loan notes of £30.1m (at 31 December 2008) became 
payable within one year. At 31 December 2007, only £22.0m of bank borrowings were recorded as payable within the next 12 months and

On 31 October 2007, the Group entered into a five-year syndicated credit agreement providing loan facilities of €1,000.0m (£966.9m and 
£734.3m at 31 December 2008 and 2007 balance sheet rates, respectively). The facilities comprise a multi-currency €600.0m (£580.2m 
and £440.6m at 31 December 2008 and 2007 balance sheet rates, respectively) five-year amortising term loan facility (“term loan”) and a 
€400.0m (£386.8m and £293.7m at 31 December 2008 and 2007 balance sheet rates, respectively) multi-currency, five-year revolving 
credit facility (“RCF”). As explained below, the RCF was subject to a cap from 22 December 2008.

On 22 December 2008, the Group announced that the 31 December 2008 covenant test date under its banking facilities had been deferred 
to 28 February 2009, by agreement with its lending banks. As part of this agreement, the Group paid its lending banks a covenant 
amendment fee of £2.3m, and also incurred related professional fees of £1.0m. The total charge of £3.3m has been treated as an exceptional 
finance charge for the year ended 31 December 2008 (see Notes 10 and 11). In addition to paying a fee, the Group’s interest rate margin 
increased to 3.5% with immediate effect (see below) and the Group’s RCF was capped at €195.0m. 
In 2008 (up to the 22 December covenant test date extension) and 2007, the interest rates of the facilities were charged by reference to a 
specified margin over the relevant LIBOR or EURIBOR rate. The initial margin was 1.75% per annum for the first six months following the first 
utilisation date in 2007. After this period, the interest rate margin was dependent on the Group’s ratio of net debt to EBITDA (the leverage 
ratio). Below is a summary of how the interest margin would have varied depending on the Group’s leverage up to 22 December covenant 
test date extension.
 
 Interest rate margin per annum up to 22 December 2008 
Leverage ratio covenant test date extension and 2007
Greater than 3.0 times        1.75%

Equal to or less than 2.0 times but greater than 1.5 times       1.00%
Equal to or less than 1.5 times        0.75%
As noted above, from 22 December to 31 December 2008, the Group’s interest rate margin increased to 3.5%, irrespective of the Group’s 
net debt to EBITDA ratios. 
At 31 December 2008 and 2007, the amounts drawn under the term loan and the RCF, together with the amount of related unamortised 
debt issue cost, are set out below, with euro equivalent amounts also provided.

As noted above, the Group’s term loans and RCF are multi-currency facilities. At 31 December 2008, the actual underlying gross borrowings 
(term loan and RCF) comprise €540.1m (2007: €536.8m), NOK1,597.6m (2007: NOK1,608.0m), DKK190.0m (2007: DKK209.5m) and £10.0m 
(2007: £nil), with all sterling amounts calculated using the closing rates as set out in Note 4. 
Note 4 above sets out the details of further extensions to the 31 December 2008 covenants testing and the key features of a proposed 
revised facility with the Group’s lending banks.
Convertible loan notes
As part-consideration for the acquisition of Berliner Verlag on 13 April 2007 (see Note 38), the Group issued £30.6m unsecured zero coupon 
convertible loan notes. The terms of the convertible loan notes were such that they were to be either repaid or converted into ordinary 
shares of Mecom Group plc, at a price of 76 pence per share, on the redemption date of 12 April 2009. As set out in Note 4, the maturity 
of these convertible loan notes has been deferred to 12 July 2009, although it was agreed that this extension would accelerate to 31 May 
2009 under certain conditions.
On issue the convertible loan notes were split for accounting purposes between the liability element and an equity component, representing 
the fair value of the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Company. The balances in these financial statements in 
respect of these two elements are as follows:
        £m
Equity component at date of issue and at 31 December 2008 and 2007      3.4

26. Borrowings continued
The equity component of £3.4m was credited to the share-based payment reserve in 2007. The accreted interest is a non-cash finance 
expense (see Note 11) and represents the unwinding of the discount in the amount recognised on issue as a liability. 
Other loans
Other loans at 31 December 2008 include a floating-rate mortgage of £0.5m (2007: £0.5m) that expires in December 2017. At 31 December 
2008 and 2007, the average interest rate of this mortgage was 5.2%. 
Also included in other loans at 31 December 2008 are two variable-rate unsecured Danish krone loans totalling £2.0m, with interest being 
charged at CIBOR plus 2.5% and which expire in 2010. There is an additional secured variable-rate Danish krone loan of £0.3m, which had 
an interest rate of 8.0% at 31 December 2008 and expires in 2016. The Group also has three fixed-rate Danish krone loans (two of which 
are secured; one is unsecured) totalling £0.9m at 31 December 2008 with interest rates of between 3.0% and 5.1%. These expire in 2010, 
2011 and 2024. All of the Danish krone loans described above are the Group’s share (after proportional consolidation) of external loans 
within certain of its joint-ventures, namely Bilzonen A/S and A/S Trykcentralen 1969. At 31 December 2007, other loans included the 
Group’s share of a 2.5% fixed-rate joint-venture loan of £1.1m that expired during 2008.
At 31 December 2007, other loans included a 3.5% fixed-rate loan of £4.3m that expires in April 2013 that relates to the Group’s German 
operations. The 31 December 2008 balance of £4.5m is included within liabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale 
(see Note 13). 
27. Financial risk management
Overview
The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management, including financial risks. The 
Group has established an Audit Committee with delegated responsibility for developing and monitoring the Group’s risk management 
policies.
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise bank borrowings, convertible loan notes and cash and cash equivalents, the main 
purpose of which is to provide finance for the Group’s operations. The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade 
receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operating activities.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions, principally interest rate swaps. The purpose is to manage the interest rate risks arising 
from the Group’s operations and its sources of finance. The Group does not trade in derivatives.
The Group’s key financial risks arising from its operating activities and its financial instruments are:
market risk (including interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and funding risk); •	
liquidity risk; and •	
credit risk. •	
The Group uses derivatives and other financial instruments to reduce these risks in accordance with the Group’s financial policy as set out 
below. 
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises primarily from the Group’s long-term borrowings, being the risk that a movement in interest rates will affect the 
Group’s obligations, cash flows and income.
The Group’s policy is to keep between 40% and 80% of its borrowings at fixed interest rates. This is achieved primarily by entering into 
interest rate swaps which are designated as hedges to the underlying floating rate bank borrowings. The Group classifies such interest rate 
swaps as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.  102 Mecom Group plc Annual report and accounts 2008

1 Bank borrowings exclude unamortised debt issue costs at 31 December 2008 of £9.3m (2007: £12.2m). Fixed bank borrowings include floating borrowing where the exposure is 
effectively fixed due to an assigned floating to fixed interest rate swap that is a being accounted for as a cash flow hedge.
Interest charges on financial instruments classified as floating rate are repriced at intervals of less than one year. Interest on financial 
instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument. The other financial instruments of the Group not included in 
the above table are non-interest bearing and therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
Floating rate financial assets comprise cash and deposits on money market deposits at call, seven day and monthly rates. The Group’s 
other financial assets do not accrue interest and have no fixed maturity date.
Interest rate swap contracts
With interest rate swap contracts, the Group enters into an agreement to exchange the difference between floating and fixed rate interest 
amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts. Such contracts enable the Group to manage the risk of a change in underlying 
interest rates on the Group’s cash flows. The fair value of the interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future 
cash flows using yield curves at the reporting date. In 2008 interest rate swaps were entered into fixing the interest rate on €225.0m and 
NOK810.0m of floating rate debt (2007: €60.0m)
On 31 October 2007, the Group’s long-term borrowings were refinanced. On refinancing, the majority of the interest rate swaps that had 
been in place to hedge the previous borrowings ceased to be classified as cash flow hedges. The cumulative amount recorded in equity of 
£6.2m was recognised immediately in the income statement as exceptional finance income, as shown in Note 10. These interest rate swaps 
were closed out in March 2008. Between 31 October and March 2008, changes in fair value of these interest rate swaps were recorded 
directly in the income statement. 
Information related to the Group’s interest rate swaps is shown below. At 31 December 2007, the majority of the Group’s interest rate swaps 
were not accounted for as hedges, as explained above. The information in the table below relates only to interest rate swaps accounted for 
as hedges, which are recorded in the balance sheet at a fair value of £9.4m (liability) (2007: asset of £1.6m). The following tables indicate the 
periods in which the cash flows associated with derivatives that are cash flow hedges are expected to occur:

The cash flow hedges are expected to affect the income statement in the same periods as shown in the table above.
In 2008 the fair value changes in interest rates swaps designated as cash flow hedges was £(9.2)m pre-tax (2007: £4.4m). The fair value 
change was recorded directly in the cash flow hedge reserve. During 2008, £2.1m was realised in the income statement from the cash flow 
hedge reserve as a credit to interest expense (2007: £6.1m).

Sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments
The following table shows the sensitivity of the Group’s profit before tax and net assets/equity, arising from the effect on the Group’s variable 
rate financial assets and liabilities, to an interest rate and parallel yield curve shift of 2%. This assumes the interest-bearing borrowings in 
existence at these dates remain constant at the underlying interest rates, with all other variables held constant.

31 December 2007     3.6 (3.6) 1.4 (1.4)
A 2% increase in interest rates has been used and represents the assessment of a reasonably possible change.
Interest rates used for determining fair value
Interest rates are linked to LIBOR, EURIBOR, NIBOR or CIBOR, depending on the origin of the underlying instrument.
Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk arises where the Group entities have an exposure to a currency that is not their functional currency. 
The Group’s operations are in based in the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Germany and Poland. The exposure of the Group to operational 
currency risk is limited because in general each of the operating companies sells its products in the territory where they are produced. The 
currency exposure connected with the Group’s ownership of foreign subsidiaries has been limited by aligning interest-bearing borrowings 
with the cash flows generated by the underlying operations of the Group (primarily euro, NOK and DKK), so providing an economic hedge. 
No derivatives have been entered into for this purpose.
Mecom Finance Limited (“MFL ”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group, is the main financing entity of the Group and has a sterling 
functional currency. At 31 December 2008, MFL had foreign currency borrowings of €195.5m, NOK1,597.6m and DKK190.0m (2007: 
€152.5m, NOK1,608.0m and DKK209.5m). These borrowing have been made under the Group’s syndicated credit agreement, as described 
in Note 26. They are designated as a net investment hedge of the Group’s European trading operations and translation differences are 
recorded directly in equity.
At 31 December 2008 and 2007 there are no currency hedges of future cash flows.

Funding risk
Funding risk is the risk associated with maintaining the Group’s long-term borrowing arrangements. These include the risk of obtaining less 
favourable terms on refinancing, the risk of not meeting covenant requirements and the risks associated with a concentration of form, 
maturity or counterparty.
Notes 4 and 26 set out the details of the Group’s discussions with its lending banks over proposed revisions to the facility agreement and 
deferrals to the testing of 31 December 2008 covenants.
Capital management
Capital comprises equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent. The Group’s capital management policy is to ensure healthy 
covenant ratios are maintained in order to support operations and strategic objectives of the business as well as to maximise shareholder 
value. The Group monitors its capital and funding structure using net debt to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to net adjusted interest 
expense ratios. 
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group aims to mitigate liquidity 
risk by ensuring the presence of flexible borrowing facilities and managing the cash generation of its operations. The Group places the 
majority of its cash in interest-bearing bank accounts and on short-term deposit. The Group monitors short- and medium-term interest rates 
and places cash on deposit for periods to optimise the amount of interest earned while maintaining access to sufficient funds to meet day-
to-day cash requirements.  104 Mecom Group plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Financials
27. Financial risk management continued
Debt maturities are spread over a range of dates where possible and the Group makes early repayments where possible, thereby ensuring 
that the Group is not exposed to excessive refinancing risk in any one year. The Group’s liquidity risk arises from timing differences between 
cash inflows and outflows. The Group manages these risks through committed credit facilities.
For details of the Group’s credit facilities and of discussions with the Group’s lending banks over proposed versions to the terms of these 
facilities, see Notes 4 and 26.

The restatement of the 2007 amounts relates primarily to the balances within trade and other payables and results from the exclusion of 
non-financial liabilities from the previously stated numbers to match with the current year’s presentation.
Refinancing risk management
The Board controls refinancing risk by spreading the financing obligations (both principal and interest) of the Group over a number of years. 
This policy prevents the Group from having an excessively large amount of borrowings to refinance in any given year. Details of discussions 
with the Group’s leading banks on proposed revisions to its facility agreement are set out in Notes 4 and 26.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations. The Group has procedures and guidelines in place to limit credit risks for each counterparty or market as follows: 
credit is only extended to new customers after a credit check has been carried out. External agencies are used to assess the credit- •	
worthiness of significant customers; 
credit limits are reviewed at least annually; and •	
new sales orders are not approved if the customer is in excess of its approved credit limit and/or payments are overdue. •	
Credit risk is reduced further by requiring that subscriptions to the Group’s newspapers are payable in advance.
Exposure to credit risk
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting 
date was:

Utilisation       4.3 0.7
Balance at 31 December       (13.6) (9.2)
The provision for doubtful debts is used to record provisions unless the Group is satisfied that no recovery of the amount owing is possible; 
at that point amounts outstanding are considered irrecoverable and written-off against the trade receivable directly. 
At 31 December 2008, the Group had trade receivables past due of £55.9m (2007: £59.7m), to which the provision of £13.0m (2007: £9.2m) 
relates, including £41.1m that were less than 90 days overdue (2007: £44.5m).
Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities
As permitted by IFRS, the Group does not disclose the fair value of its financial assets and financial liabilities for both 2008 and 2007 
because the carrying amounts of these are a reasonable approximation of fair value. 
The fair value of interest-bearing loans is calculated based on discounting expected future principal and finance cash flows using the 
prevailing interest rate applicable to each loan. The fair value of interest rate derivatives is calculated by discounting the expected future cash 
flows using prevailing market interest rates as at the balance sheet date.
Quoted investments are carried at fair value, as calculated by reference to published share prices ruling at the balance sheet date.
Other non-current receivables, non-interest bearing loans and loans to employees are carried at amortised cost. Their fair value is based 
on the effective interest rate method if the time value of money is significant.
28. Deferred tax
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using a tax rate relevant to each tax jurisdiction. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are attributable to the following items:

31. Employee benefit assets and obligations
Defined contribution plans
The Group participates in defined contribution pension plans in the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway. These include the Wegener General 
Pension Fund (APW) which was established on 1 January 2005 as a defined contribution fund. Wegener made a commitment to make 
contributions to this fund, such that the total employer and employee contributions total 25.7% of the pension entitlement each year, for a 
five year period from 1 January 2005. The contributions made do not cover the financing of increases in conditional entitlements or benefits 
which are attributable to past service. Wegener, at the end of the current five-year term of pension contributions is not liable to supplement 
any shortfalls and is not entitled to repayment of any surplus accrued. An agreement for the payment of pension contributions in the period 
beyond 1 January 2010 is expected to be reached during 2009. 
The Group participates in certain funded multi-employer pension plans in the Netherlands, where the annual pension contribution payable 
by the employer is set independently of the demographic profile of each employing company and benefits are paid from the pooled assets 
contributed by the participating employers. The Group does not have access to sufficient information on which to base a reliable estimate 
of its share of the assets and liabilities of these multi-employer plans (because this is not supplied by the plan) and so accounts for these 
plans on a defined contribution basis.
Defined benefit plans
The Group operates defined benefit plans in the Netherlands and Norway, where the Group is responsible, according to local legislation, 
for the payment of salary-related pension obligations through its funding of separate pension plans. Other defined benefit obligations (for 
example in Germany where a closed scheme exists for a small number of employees) are not material to the Group as a whole.
Pension liabilities and costs for the Group’s defined benefit plans are calculated by independent actuaries, using the project unit credit 
method. The overall expected return on assets is based on best estimates for the expected long-term real rates from the main assets 
classes, where equity is assumed to have a higher rate of return than other plan assets.
The Group expects contributions to defined benefit plans in future years to continue broadly at current levels.

rotary newspaper presses, under which the Group is entitled (but not obliged) to purchase all of the plant and equipment for the residual 
value at the end of the lease term.

On 5 April 2007, 731,065,137 ordinary shares were issued via a placing in order to provide financing for the acquisitions of Berliner Verlag 
and Wegener, both of which are described in further detail in Note 38. This issue of shares gave rise to a premium of £565.8m which was 
recorded in the share premium account.
 
On 1 November 2007, 109,857,372 ordinary shares were issued as acquisition consideration for Wegener, further details of which are given 
in Note 38. Although these shares were issued on 1 November 2007, they were valued using the closing share price at the date of exchange 
(25 October 2007). This issue of shares gave rise to a premium of £83.9m which was recorded in the share premium account.
 
Contingent rights to shares
At 31 December 2008, the only options that were outstanding over ordinary shares were those granted to the Trustee of the Employee Benefit 
Trust (“EBT”) in connection with the operation of the Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”), the Executive Share Option Plan (“ESOP”) and the Deferred 
Bonus Plan (“DBP”), further details of which may be found in the Remuneration report and also in Note 35 to the consolidated financial

Cash flow hedge reserve
The cash flow hedge reserve is used to record the unrealised gain or loss on the cash flow hedges entered into by the Group. The gain or 
loss is recognised in reserves only to the extent that it is considered to represent an effective hedge of the underlying instrument.
Share-based payment reserve
This reserve represents the accumulated share-based payment expenses the Group has recorded together with the equity component of 
convertible debt instruments (see Note 26).
Revaluation reserve
The Group includes on its balance sheet publicly traded investments, which are classified as available-for-sale. These are carried at market 
value. Temporary unrealised holding gains and losses on such investments are included within the revaluation reserve. Where there is a 
permanent diminution in value of investments, this impairment charge is recognised in the income statement. Any unrealised gains within 
this reserve are undistributable.
As shown in the statement of recognised income and expense on page 67, during the year £0.8m was transferred from the revaluation 
reserve to the income statement on the impairment of available-for-sale investments. This amount is included within the Group’s exceptional 
operating costs of £996.1m.

the currency translation reserve to the income statement on the disposal of foreign operations. This amount is included within the Group’s

(ii) Information relating to option valuation techniques
Options granted under the Mecom ESOP have been valued using a binomial option pricing model. Assumptions used by the model are  
as follows:
Expected volatility
As shares in Mecom Group plc have been listed for a relatively short period of time, there is insufficient share price history to calculate 
historical volatility. Accordingly, to arrive at a reasonable volatility assumption an analysis of the share price volatility of comparable companies 
was performed.
Expected dividend yield
A dividend yield of 0% has been used as it was not anticipated at the time of the valuation that a dividend would be introduced in the  
near future.
Risk-free rate
The assumption has been based on the yield available on similar dated zero coupon UK government bonds at the time the options were 
granted, using historical information taken from the Bank of England.
Participants’ exercise behaviour
The figures used are based on analysis of the ratio of the share price and exercise price using historical information from companies of a 
similar size to Mecom Group plc.
The weighted average estimated fair values and the inputs into the binomial pricing model for the ESOP are as follows:

Mecom Share Incentive Plan
The SIP provides the founder executives with a long-term incentive linked to the delivery of shareholder value. It is operated via an offshore 
employee benefit trust (“EBT”), established by the Company for the benefit of the past, present and future employees of the Group following 
admission of the Company’s shares to trading on AIM in 2005. 
Nil cost options over ordinary shares in Mecom Group plc were granted to the Trust such that the number of shares to be acquired by the 
SIP on exercise of the options will be calculated on the basis of a formula, the effect of which entitles the Trustees to acquire ordinary shares 
with an aggregate value equivalent to 10% of the increase in market capitalisation of the Company, less the market value of any new equity 
issued by the Company but adding back dividends paid, either five years from the date of admission or in the event of an offer for the 
Company. At the Extraordinary General Meeting held on 5 March 2007 the terms of the SIP were amended in certain minor respects relating 
to leaver provisions and the period within which options granted under the SIP can be exercised.
The Trustees have established discretionary sub-funds for the proposed beneficiaries under the SIP, into which the options will be allocated. 
The Trustees have appointed a reversionary interest in the sub-trusts to the individual beneficiaries concerned such that the sub-trust 
property will vest absolutely to the individuals at the end of the vesting period specified above.
If an individual ceases employment before the reversionary interest vests, the interest in the sub-trust property will lapse and the options 
allocated to that sub-trust could then become available to benefit Group employees generally. Further sub-trusts can be created for future 
employees should the Trustees consider it appropriate. 
In accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, the Group has recognised a charge which reflects the fair value of the options issued 
under the SIP. The fair value, calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model, is £2.8m which is being expensed over the period from 23 
March 2005 to 23 March 2010. 
The estimated fair values and the inputs for the valuation of the SIP are as follows:
        
Growth rate per annum        7.0%
Expected volatility        40.0%
Expected dividend yield        0.0%

Acquisitions during the year ended 31 December 2008
HR North AB
On 15 January 2008, the Group acquired 60.0% of the issued share capital of HR North AB (“HR North”), a leading online recruitment 
company incorporated in Sweden. HR North was acquired for £11.0m, comprising £8.3m cash consideration and £2.7m contingent 
consideration. The contingent consideration relates to a put option that the Group issued to the remaining shareholders of HR North, who 
own 40.0% of its equity. This has been included for accounting purposes within the Group’s 100.0% stake in HR North, although these 
shares will not be purchased until 2009 and 2010. For this reason, the Group has not recognised any minority interest on this acquisition. 
This purchase has been accounted for as an acquisition.
The acquisition of HR North is consistent with the Group’s increasing focus on digital platforms in order to secure its market position in a 
changing media environment. By acquiring the company, the Group has the opportunity to establish a platform for growth in the Swedish 
online media market. In addition, the company’s considerable expertise in recruitment classified sales can potentially be leveraged  
across other markets in which the Group operates. For the reasons outlined above, the Group paid a premium on the acquisition, giving 
rise to goodwill. 
Based on the final assessment of the fair values assigned to the cost of the combination and the acquiree’s net assets at the acquisition 
date, goodwill has been calculated at £9.6m, as summarised below.

actually be paid in 2010 and 2011. This payable is denominated in NOK. At 31 December 2008, £1.3m is included within non-current other payables and the current portion of 
£1.4m is included within trade and other payables (see Note 29 above). 
The net cash outflow recorded in the year ended 31 December 2008 on the acquisition was £7.6m, comprising total cash consideration of 
£8.3m less cash and cash equivalents acquired of £0.7m.  116 Mecom Group plc Annual report and accounts 2008

useful lives of four years.
HR North contributed revenue of £4.5m and £0.5m loss before tax for the period from the date of acquisition to 31 December 2008. The 
results of the Group would not have been significantly different had the acquisition of HR North occurred on 1 January 2008. 
Other acquisitions
During 2008, the Group made a number of acquisitions that are individually immaterial to these consolidated financial statements. The total 
goodwill recognised in relation to these acquisitions was £3.4m. Other intangible assets acquired totalled £0.8m and are being amortised 
over their useful lives of five years. The net cash outflow recorded on these acquisitions was £1.5m, with a further £11.7m being paid in 
relation to prior year acquisitions. 
Acquisitions during the year ended 31 December 2007
During 2007, the Group made two material acquisitions as described below. 
Berliner Verlag Deutsche Zeitungholding GmbH
On 13 April 2007, the Group acquired 78.0% of the issued share capital of Berliner Verlag Deutsche Zeitungholding GmbH (“Berliner 
Verlag”), a leading newspaper publisher in Berlin, Germany, of which the Group previously owned a further 15.0%. Berliner Verlag was 
acquired for £129.4m, comprising £90.6m cash consideration, £5.3m deferred consideration, £30.6m convertible loan note consideration 
and £2.9m of related acquisition expenses. The deferred consideration related to a put option that the Group issued to the remaining 
shareholders of Berliner Verlag, who owned 7.0% of its equity. This was included for accounting purposes within the Group’s 85.0% stake 
in Berliner Verlag, although these shares were not purchased until January 2008. For this reason, the Group did not recognise any minority 
interest on this acquisition. This purchase was accounted for as an acquisition. 
The acquisition of Berliner Verlag was consistent with the Group’s strategy to build a pan-European newspaper publishing business. 
Berliner Verlag is a leading newspaper publisher in Berlin. Its titles include the quality broadsheet Berliner Zeitung, East Berlin’s leading 
tabloid Berliner Kurier, the leading weekly advertising free-sheet Berliner Abendblatt and TIP, a bi-weekly Berlin entertainment guide. In 
addition, Berliner Verlag owns a modern print plant which prints both Group and third-party publications. For the reasons outlined above, 
the Group paid a premium on the acquisition, giving rise to goodwill. 
This acquisition was treated as a step-acquisition involving two steps, with each step representing a significant investment made by the 
Group. As required by step-acquisition accounting, the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired, the consideration in relation to the 
acquisition and any subsequent goodwill were determined at each step. 
In the prior period and from 1 January to 12 April 2007, the Group’s stake in Berliner Verlag was treated as an associate because, although 
during these periods the Group exerted significant influence, it did not have control over Berliner Verlag’s operating and financial policies.
The accounting for the second step of this acquisition made on 13 April 2007 had only been determined on a provisional basis at 31 December 
2007 because the Group was still in the process of completing its work on the fair values assigned to the cost of the combination and the 
acquiree’s net assets. As a result of completing this work in 2008, no adjustments to either the cost of the combination or the acquiree’s 
net assets were required.

With regards to the first step of this acquisition, being 15.0% acquired during 2005, the fair value of the net liabilities acquired was £3.2m. 
The consideration for this stake was £9.6m, giving rise to goodwill of £12.8m. Therefore, total goodwill arising on the acquisition of Berliner 
Verlag was £163.7m. 
The net cash outflow recorded in 2007 on the acquisition made on 13 April 2007 was £86.9m, comprising cash consideration of £90.6m 
plus directly attributable costs of £2.9m less cash and cash equivalents acquired of £6.6m. 
In 2008, the Group recorded a cash outflow of £5.3m on this acquisition, being the settlement of the deferred consideration. 
As described in further detail Notes 4 and 26, the terms of the convertible loan notes were such that they were to be either repaid or 
converted into ordinary shares of Mecom Group plc, at a price of 76 pence per share, on the redemption date of 12 April 2009. As set out 
in Note 4, the maturity of these convertible loan notes has been deferred to 12 July 2009, although it was agreed that this extension would 
accelerate to 31 May 2009 under certain conditions.

and Hamburger Morgenpost. Brands are being amortised over their estimated useful lives of 16 to 20 years.

Koninklijke Wegener N.V. 
On 13 April 2007, the Group made an investment of £115.6m in Koninklijke Wegener N.V. (“Wegener”), a leading newspaper publisher based 
in Apeldoorn, the Netherlands, representing a stake of 23.6%. The Group acquired a further 29.7% stake in Wegener during the period from 
17 August to 14 September for total consideration of £162.5m. On 25 October 2007, the Group acquired a further stake of 33.1% in Wegener 
for total consideration of £205.8m. At 25 October 2007, the Group owned in total 86.4% of Wegener and gained control over its operating 
and financial policies on this date. 
The acquisition of Wegener represented a further step towards the implementation of the Group’s strategy to build a pan-European 
newspaper publishing business. Wegener is a substantial newspaper publisher in the Netherlands, whose titles include Brabants Dagblad, 
De Gelderlander and de Stentor, and this acquisition offered the Group the potential to create value in conjunction with its assets in Limburg, 
acquired in 2006. For these reasons, the Group paid a premium on the acquisition, giving rise to goodwill. As a consequence of this 
acquisition, the competition authorities in the Netherlands imposed a condition that the Group had to dispose of its De Trompetter operations. 
Further details of this are provided in Notes 13 and 39.
This acquisition was treated as a step-acquisition involving three steps, with each step representing a significant investment made by the 
Group. As required by step-acquisition accounting, the fair values of the cost of the combination and the acquiree’s net assets and any 
subsequent goodwill were determined at each step.
For the period from 13 April to 13 September 2007, the Group’s stake in Wegener was treated as an investment rather than an associate 
because the Group had made a public offer for the entire share capital of Wegener, during which period Mecom’s ability to exercise 
significant influence over Wegener’s policies was restricted due to both the negotiation process and uncertainty with regards to the outcome 
of the offer. 
For the period from 14 September to 24 October, the Group’s stake in Wegener was treated as an associate because, although during this 
period the Group exerted significant influence, it did not have control over Wegener’s operating and financial policies.
With regard to the third step of the acquisition on 25 October 2007 (from which date the Group controlled Wegener’s operating and financial 
policies), total consideration was £205.8m, comprising £112.1m cash consideration, £84.6m share consideration and £9.1m of related 
expenses. The fair value of the shares issued in the Company was based on 109.9 million shares at the fair value of those equity instruments 
at the date of exchange. 
The accounting for the Wegener acquisition had only been determined on a provisional basis at 31 December 2007 because the Group was 
still in the process of completing its work on the fair values assigned to the cost of the combination and the acquiree’s net assets. As a result 
of completing this work in 2008, no adjustments to either the cost of the combination or the acquiree’s net assets were required.
Included within Wegener’s equity at each of the three steps of the acquisition were 4.2 million cumulative financing preference shares, each 
with an issue price of €7.00, to which voting rights are attached. The Group did not acquire any of the cumulative financing preference 
shares on the first and second steps of the acquisition and as such their fair value has been removed from the provisional fair value of 
Wegener’s total net assets at these steps. However, on the third step of the acquisition the Group acquired 100.0% of the cumulative 
financing preference shares for zero goodwill.

Total goodwill arising on the acquisition of Wegener was therefore £397.0m. The minority interest arising on the acquisition was £11.0m, 
representing 13.57% of the fair value of Wegener’s net assets attributable to ordinary shareholders of £81.3m at 25 October 2007. 
From 13 April to 14 September 2007, the Group’s stake in Wegener was treated as an investment, meaning that the Group did not record 
its share of Wegener’s result for this period in its income statement. As a consequence of step-acquisition accounting, the Group recorded 
a credit of £2.1m in retained earnings (see Note 34) in 2007, which represented the Group’s share of Wegener’s result not recorded in the 
income statement while Wegener was held as an investment together with any changes in fair values from step one to step three of the 
acquisition.
The total net cash outflow recorded on the acquisition was £401.1m, comprising cash consideration of £390.2m, directly attributable costs 
of £8.3m and acquired net bank overdrafts of £2.6m. £0.8m of fees remained unpaid at 31 December 2007 and were included within trade 
and other payables. 120 Mecom Group plc Annual report and accounts 2008

Customer relationships of £183.8m represented the fair value of existing customer contracts. Customer relationships are being amortised 
over their estimated useful lives of five to 14 years. 
Brands of £164.0m represented the fair value of several well-established and recognised titles, which include Brabants Dagblad, De 
Gelderlander and de Stentor. Brands are being amortised over their estimated useful lives of five to 20 years. 
Wegener contributed £95.3m revenue and £3.7m profit before tax to the Group’s loss before tax for the period from the date of acquisition 
(25 October 2007) to 31 December 2007.
If the acquisition of Wegener had been completed on 1 January 2007, Group revenues for 2007 would have been £1,352.2m and the 
Group’s operating profit would have been £0.3m. 
Other acquisitions
During 2007, the Group made a number of acquisitions that are individually immaterial to these consolidated financial statements. The total 
goodwill recognised in relation to these acquisitions was £8.3m. The net cash outflow recorded on these acquisitions was £14.4m.
39. Disposals
Disposals during the year ended 31 December 2008
Direct Marketing
In January and February 2008, the Group completed the disposal of its Direct Marketing activities in Norway and Sweden for total cash 
consideration of £4.8m. As described in Note 13 above, these operations were classified as a disposal group held for sale at 31 December 
2007. The Direct Marketing activities made a loss before tax of £nil from 1 January 2008 up to the date of disposal (2007: loss before tax of

Uitgevermaatschappij De Trompetter B.V.
On 18 April 2008, the Group sold its 100% interest in the ordinary share capital of Uitgevermaatschappij De Trompetter B.V. (“De Trompetter”) 
for total cash consideration of £16.1m, less £0.3m of directly attributable costs. As described in Note 13 above, De Trompetter was classified 
as a disposal group held for sale at 31 December 2007. The profit before tax of De Trompetter from 1 January 2008 up to the date of 
disposal was £0.4m (2007: £1.3m).

1 Cash and cash equivalents of £1.0m were not included within assets held for sale at 31 December 2007. On disposal, this balance was sold, with proceeds increasing by a 
corresponding amount. The net cash proceeds on disposal were therefore £3.8m. At the date of disposal the net assets of Direct Marketing were retranslated into sterling at the 
rate prevailing on that date, resulting in a £0.5m increase to the net assets of the disposal group. 
2 On a final assessment of De Trompetter’s net assets at the date of disposal, the director’s attributed the following amounts to the disposal group in addition to the £5.6m of net 
assets that were held for sale at 31 December 2007: £8.5m of goodwill, £0.4m of trade and other receivables, £1.0m of employee benefit obligations, £0.4m of trade and other 
payables and £0.3m of current tax liabilities. The total of these items is £7.2m. At the date of disposal the net assets of De Trompetter were retranslated into sterling at the rate 
prevailing on that date, resulting in a £0.4m increase to the net assets of the disposal group.
Disposals during the year ended 31 December 2007
During 2007, the Group made a number of disposals of subsidiaries that were individually immaterial to the consolidated financial statements. 
The net proceeds received for these disposals were £6.4m, which equalled the net book value of the net assets disposed, resulting in no 
gain or loss being recorded.  122 Mecom Group plc Annual report and accounts 2008

41. Events after the balance sheet date
As described in Note 13, on 12 January 2009 the Group entered into a sale agreement to dispose of its German division to M. DuMont 
Schauberg Expedition der Kölnishen Zeitung GmbH & Co. KG for a price of £147.0m (€152.0m) on a cash- and debt-free basis. Completion 
of the disposal took place on 27 March 2009.
On 18 February 2009 the Group also announced the disposal of its Norway Northwestern assets to Polaris Media ASA for cash consideration 
of £55.5m (NOK559.3m). Completion of the disposal took place on 2 April 2009. 
On 27 April 2009, the Group announced that it had, via its Netherlands division, agreed in principle the sale of its joint-venture interest in 
ADNieuwsMedia B.V (“ADNM”) to PCM Uitgevers B.V. (“PCM”). The Group has a 37% economic interest and a 50% controlling interest in 
ADNM. As part-consideration for the disposal, the Group will receive 100% of the shares in PCM Lokale Media B.V., a subsidiary of PCM. 
Both of these transactions are expected to be completed in the first half of 2009.
On 29 April 2009, the Group reached ‘in principle’ agreement with its lending banks (subject to the completion and signing of full 
documentation and subject to the completion of the proposed equity issue) on the terms of a proposed revised bank facility agreement. 
The agreement given by the banks on the key terms of the proposed revised facility agreement are not binding on the banks but the Group 
believes that it is highly likely that full documentation will be signed, in May 2009. The key terms of the new bank deal are provided in Note 
4. On the same date, the Group received non-binding commitments from current and prospective shareholders (which will be conditional 
upon, inter alia, the Group agreeing acceptable banking terms with its lenders, publishing a prospectus and obtaining shareholder approval) 
to subscribe to a proposed share issue of approximately £140m (before expenses). The Group intends repaying the convertible loan notes 
from these proceeds. The Group expects to complete and to sign full banking documentation during May 2009, after which it expects that 
a prospectus for the issue of new shares will be issued with a view to receiving the proceeds of the share issue during June 2009.
In addition to the above, on 29 April 2009, the holders of the convertible loan notes relating to the acquisition of Berliner Verlag which were 
due for payment on 12 April 2009, agreed an extension of the maturity date to 12 July 2009, although it was agreed that this extension 
would accelerate to 31 May 2009 under certain conditions.

Independent auditors’ report to the members  
of Mecom Group plc
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Mecom 
Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2008 which comprise 
the Company balance sheet and the related Notes 1 to 14. These 
parent company financial statements have been prepared under 
the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the 
information in the Remuneration report that is described as having 
been audited. 
We have reported separately on the consolidated financial statements 
of Mecom Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2008. That 
report is modified by the inclusion of an emphasis of matter.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to 
them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members 
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual report and 
accounts, the Remuneration report and the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom 
law and Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of directors’ 
responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial statements 
and the part of the remuneration Report to be audited in accordance 
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company 
financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the parent 
company financial statements and the part of the Remuneration 
report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our 
opinion the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent 
with the parent company financial statements. The information 
given in the directors’ report includes that specific information 
presented in the Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s review, 
the Market Overview, the Divisional reviews, the Group Finance 
Director’s report, Principal risks and uncertainties and Corporate 
social responsibility that is cross referred from the directors’ 
report. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not 
kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the 
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information 
specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other 
transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual report and 
accounts and consider whether it is consistent with the audited 
parent company financial statements. The other information 
comprises only the following sections: Introduction, Transformation, 
New revenues, Titles, Our people, Our divisions, the Chairman’s 
statement, Group highlights, the Chief Executive’s review, Market 
overview, the Divisional reviews, the Group Finance Director’s 
report, Principal risks and uncertainties, Corporate social 
responsibility, The Board, the Directors’ report, Corporate 
governance, the unaudited part of the Remuneration report and 
Shareholder information. We consider the implications for our report 
if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material 
inconsistencies with the parent company financial statements. Our 
responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant 
to the amounts and disclosures in the parent company financial 
statements and the part of the Remuneration report to be audited. 
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and 
judgments made by the directors in the preparation of the parent 
company financial statements, and of whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary in 
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable 
assurance that the parent company financial statements and the 
part of the Remuneration report to be audited are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. 
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the 
presentation of information in the parent company financial 
statements and the part of the Remuneration report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
the parent company financial statements give a true and fair •	
view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice, of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2008; 
the parent company financial statements and the part of the •	
Remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with •	
the parent company financial statements.
Emphasis of matter – Going concern
In forming our opinion on the parent company financial statements, 
which is not qualified, we have considered the adequacy of the 
disclosure made in Note 1 concerning the amendments to the 
existing bank facility agreement, the raising of additional equity and 
the repayment of the convertible loan notes. These conditions, 
along with the other matters explained in Note 1 to the parent 
company financial statements, indicate the existence of material 
uncertainties which may cast significant doubt about the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. The parent company financial 
statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the 
Company was unable to continue as a going concern.

The basis on which the Company’s financial statements have been 
prepared on the going concern basis, and the uncertainties related 
to ability of the Company’s principle subsidiaries to continue in 
operational existence in the foreseeable future are set out below. 
References to “Group” mean the Company and all its subsidiaries 
(direct and indirect) on a consolidated basis.
Background to negotiations on revised bank agreement and 
proposals for an equity issue
In December 2008, the Company announced its intention to reduce 
borrowings in its subsidiaries and, at the same time, entered into an 
agreement with its lending banks to defer the testing of financial 
covenants in its bank facilities agreement from 31 December 2008 
to 28 February 2009 (which was subsequently deferred further to 
31 March 2009, then further to 30 April 2009 and further to 31 May 
2009, as explained below) and engaged in discussions to renegotiate 
the terms of its bank facilities. 
The Company announced the disposal of its German operations 
(held indirectly by the Company) in January 2009 for consideration 
of €152.0m (£147.0m) and of its northwest Norwegian operations 
(held indirectly by the Company) in February 2009 for NOK559.3m 
(£55.5m) as part of its strategy to reduce borrowings. The cash 
proceeds from these disposals were received by the Group on 27 
March 2009 and 2 April 2009, respectively.
The Company announced on 23 March 2009 that it has been 
examining the merits of an equity fund-raising.
The Company announced on 1 April 2009 that it had also agreed 
with the holders of its convertible loan notes an extension to the 
maturity of these notes from 12 April to 12 May 2009, although it 
was agreed that this extension would revert to 30 April 2009 under 
certain conditions. 
On 29 April 2009, the Company entered into an agreement with its 
lending banks for a further deferral of the testing date of financial 
covenants until 31 May 2009 and the Company agreed a further 
extension of the maturity of the convertible loan notes to 12 July 
2009, although it was agreed that this extension would accelerate 
to 31 May 2009 under certain conditions. 
In principle agreement with lending banks on proposed revised 
bank facility agreement and with investors on proposed equity 
issue
On 29 April 2009, the Company:
reached ‘in principle’ agreement with its lending banks (subject •	
to the completion and signing of full documentation and subject 
to the completion of the proposed equity issue by no later than 
14 July 2009) on the terms of a proposed revised bank facility 
agreement. The agreement given by the banks on the key terms 
of the proposed revised facility agreement are not binding on 
the banks but each of the banks has received credit committee 
approval for the same and the Company believes that it is highly 
likely that full documentation will be signed in May 2009; and
received non-binding commitments from current and •	
prospective shareholders (which will be conditional upon, inter

alia, the Company agreeing acceptable banking terms with its 
lenders, publishing a prospectus and obtaining shareholder 
approval) to subscribe to a proposed share issue of approximately 
£140m (before expenses). The Company intends repaying the 
convertible loan notes from these proceeds.
The Company expects to complete and to sign full banking 
documentation during May 2009, after which it expects that a 
prospectus for the issue of new shares will be issued with a view to 
receiving the proceeds of the equity issue by during June 2009.
In the event that full banking documentation is not completed on the 
terms currently agreed or that the proposed equity issue does not 
happen, the Company would continue discussion with its bank 
lenders with a view to agreeing alternative banking terms, but the 
directors cannot determine at this stage whether, or on what basis, 
alternative terms would be agreed.
In the event that full banking documentation is not completed on the 
terms currently agreed or that the proposed equity issue does not 
happen, the Company would also expect to enter into discussions 
with the holders of the Company’s convertible loan notes to 
restructure the maturity of these notes, which would then be due 
currently and which the Company would be unable, in the absence 
of the agreement of the Company’s lending banks, to repay. The 
directors cannot determine at this stage what the outcome of these 
discussions would be.
In the event that the full banking documentation is not completed on 
the terms currently agreed or that the proposed equity issue does 
not happen, the Company’s ability to continue operating as a going 
concern would be dependent, therefore, on the outcome of these 
discussions with its lending banks and with the holders of the 
convertible loan notes.
Key terms of the proposed revised bank facility agreement
The key terms of the revised bank deal (on the basis that share issue 
proceeds and after applying the proceeds of the share issue) will be 
as follows: 
total facilities of circa €600m, including a term facility maturing •	
in October 2013 of €350.0m, a revolving credit facility of up to 
€200.0m maturing in October 2013 and an additional term loan 
facility of circa €50m.
the amount of the revolving credit facility will vary according to •	
the Group’s projected working capital requirements and to the 
amount of gross cash on the Group’s balance sheet;
margin on the term loan facility of 350 basis points over the •	
relevant inter-bank rate, with a 200 basis points additional non-
cash margin on the additional term loan facility accruing from  
1 January 2010 and increasing by a further 200 basis points on  
1 June 2010 and by a further 200 basis points on 1 January 
2011 ;
margin on the revolving credit facility of 300 basis points; •	
cash margin under both the term and revolving credit facilities •	
are subject to downward adjustment in the event that the 
Group’s leverage falls below 3.0 times or 2.0 times, 
respectively;
leverage, interest cover and operating cash flow covenants •	
tested at 30 June 2010, 31 December 2010 and quarterly 
thereafter; 
June 2010 leverage covenant of 5.25 times, falling to 4.50 times •	
at 31 December 2010; and
covenants on the total capital expenditure and exceptional items •	
of the Group, tested annually from 31 December 2009;  128 Mecom Group plc Annual report and accounts 2008

1. Accounting policies continued
warrants over the Company’s shares issued to the banks which •	
would represent 5% of the existing (pre-equity issue) share 
capital of the Company.
In assessing the Company’s ability to remain in compliance with the 
terms of the revised facility agreement in the foreseeable future, the 
directors have taken into account the fact that the leverage, interest 
cover and operating cash flow covenants would not be tested under 
the proposed revised facility agreement within twelve months of the 
date of these financial statements. 
The directors have also considered the Group’s financial projections 
for the twelve month period from these financial statements as they 
affect the proposed revised bank facility agreement in respect of 
conditions other than the leverage, interest cover and operating 
cash flow covenants. In making its financial projections for these 
purposes, the Group has taken into account that it currently 
generates around 50% of its revenue from advertising, the markets 
for which have tended in the past to reflect the general economic 
conditions of the countries in which the Group operates. The 
remainder of the Group’s revenue includes circulation revenue 
(around 35% of total revenue), which has more stable characteristics 
compared with advertising revenue and has not previously been 
affected by prevailing economic conditions to the extent that 
advertising revenue has been.
The Group’s advertising markets have experienced a considerable 
and systematic downturn in recent months and, although the 
experience of recent weeks’ trading suggests that some stabilisation 
at these lower levels has occurred, the advertising environment 
remains challenging and uncertain. 
In making assumptions of future advertising revenue for the 
purposes of assessing its ability to comply with the terms of the 
proposed revised facility agreement, the Group has used a 
combination of long-term trends, industry and third-party forecasts 
and internal estimates which reflect recent experience in each of our 
markets. If the actual outturn is adverse to these assumptions, the 
Group has identified a number of further mitigating actions that it 
could take to reduce costs or borrowings further.
Going concern basis in the financial statements
The directors believe that the combination of the circumstances 
described above, in particular (a) the uncertainty as to the completion 
of a revised facility agreement on the terms currently agreed (b) the 
uncertainty as to whether the non-binding commitments of investors 
to underwrite the issue of new share capital will result in new shares 
being issued, with the completion of the revised facility arrangements 
and the issue of equity being inter-conditional, and (c) the uncertainty, 
in the event that the revised facility agreement is not completed on 
terms currently agreed or that the new share capital is not issued, 
as to whether the Company could reach satisfactory agreement 
with the holders of its convertible loan notes as to an extension of 
the maturity of those notes, all of which three factors existing within 
a highly uncertain advertising environment, represent a material 
uncertainty that casts significant doubt on the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. Nevertheless, after making enquiries, 
and considering the uncertainties described above, the directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the Company have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. For these reasons, they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the Company’s financial statements.
Basis of preparation: (ii) Other
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost 
convention, in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and 
applicable accounting standards in the UK.
Under section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985 the Company  
is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and  
loss account.
As consolidated financial information has been disclosed under 
IFRS 7, the parent is exempt from FRS 29 Financial Instrument 
Disclosures. The disclosures in respect of the Company are included 
in the consolidated accounts. The Group accounts have been 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRS”) as adapted by the European Union and are 
presented on pages 66 to 124.
Change in accounting policy and explanation of prior year 
restatement 
As a result of the listing of the Company’s shares moving from the 
Alternative Investment Market (“AIM”) to the main LSE list in April 
2008, the Company adopted FRS 26 Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement during the year. As a consequence 
of adopting this Standard, it is now the policy of the Company to 
recognise changes in the fair value of its listed and unlisted 
investments directly in reserves (net of tax) instead of recognising 
such changes in the profit and loss account, unless such a change 
in fair value is deemed to be a permanent diminution of value.
The effect of adopting the Standard is that the Company has had to 
restate its 2007 balance sheet. An amount of £846,000 has been 
debited to the revaluation reserve and the same amount has been 
credited to the profit and loss account, causing that account to 
change from an accumulated loss of £6,108,000 to an accumulated 
loss of £5,262,000 at 31 December 2007. The profit for year ended 
31 December 2007 has also been restated from £4,762,000 to 
£5,608,000. 
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is 
provided on all tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write-off 
the cost or valuation of each asset on a straight-line basis over its 
expected useful life, as follows:
Leasehold improvements Shorter of 20 years and term of lease
Fixtures and fittings 5 years
Office equipment    3 years
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for 
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the 
carrying value may not be recoverable.
Shares in Group undertakings
Investments in subsidiaries are  valued at cost less provisions for 
impairment. The Company has assessed the recoverable amount of  
its investments in Group undertakings in conjunction with the relevant 
amounts of post-impairment shareholders’ funds in the consolidated 
balance sheet. The required adjustment to the carrying amount of its 
investments in Group undertakings has been recognised in the 
Company’s profit and loss account. 
Listed investments
Listed investments are carried at market value, which is determined 
by reference to bid prices at the close of business at the balance 
sheet date. Revaluation gains and losses on listed investments are  
Notes to the Company financial statements continued

Financials
1. Accounting policies continued
recorded in reserves net of tax. Where an investment is considered 
to have a permanent diminuation in value, the loss is recorded in the 
profit and loss account.
Unlisted investments
Unlisted investments are initially recognised at cost. In future periods 
the rebuttable assumption is that cost approximates fair value. 
Where there is a clear indicator of a change in fair value, then the 
asset is revalued through reserves (net of tax). Where an investment 
is considered to have a permanent diminuation in value, the loss is 
recorded in the profit and loss account.
Foreign currency
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies have been 
translated into sterling at actual rates of exchange ruling at the date 
of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies have been translated at rates ruling at the balance 
sheet date. Exchange differences arising on translation are taken to 
the profit and loss account.
Related party transactions
As the results of the Company are being presented together with  
its consolidated financial statements, the Company has taken 
advantage of the exception contained in FRS 8 Related Party 
Disclosures and has therefore not disclosed transactions or 
balances with entities which form part of the Group (or investees of 
the Group qualifying as related parties).
Deferred tax
The tax charge is based on the profit for the period and takes into 
account tax deferred because of timing differences between the 
treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all 
timing differences that have arisen but not reversed at the balance 
sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date 
that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or 
to receive more, tax with the following exceptions:
A provision is made for tax on gains arising from the revaluation •	
(and similar fair value adjustments) of fixed assets, and gains on 
disposal of fixed assets that have been rolled over into 
replacement assets, only to the extent that at the balance sheet 
date, there is a binding agreement to dispose of the assets 
concerned. However, no provision is made where, on the basis 
of all available evidence at the balance sheet date, it is more 
likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into 
replacement assets and charged to tax only where the 
replacement assets are sold.
A provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on •	
remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries and 
associates only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, 
dividends have been accrued as receivable.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the •	
directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be 
suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the 
underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to •	
apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based 
on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date.
Share-based payments
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value 
(excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions) at the 
date of grant. The fair value is calculated using either a Monte Carlo 
simulation model or a binomial model depending on the 
appropriateness of the model to the grant in question and is 
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. There is a 
corresponding amount recognised in reserves, equivalent to the 
expense recorded in the period.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is 
calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has 
expired and management’s best estimate of the achievement or 
otherwise of non-market performance conditions, and hence the 
number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The movement in 
cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised 
in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share 
dilution in the computation of earnings per share.
Financial instruments presentation and disclosure
In accordance with FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and 
Presentation, when the Company issues a financial instrument that 
comprises both liability and equity components, such as convertible 
debt, it is treated as a compound instrument. Upon initial recognition, 
the fair value of the liability component is calculated as the present 
value of the contractual stream of future cash flows discounted at  
the market rate of interest that would have applied to an instrument 
of comparable credit quality with substantially the same cash flows, 
on the same terms, but without the conversion option. The 
subsequent accretion of the financial liability is recorded as a finance 
charge in the profit and loss account.
The equity portion is calculated by deducting the initial amount of 
the financial liability from the value of the instrument as a whole. The 
resultant amount is credited to the share-based payment reserve 
and is not re-measured.
Operating leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the profit 
and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Cash flow statement
The Company is exempt under the terms of FRS 1 (Revised 1996) 
Cash Flow Statements from the requirement to publish its own cash 
flow statement, as its cash flows are included within the consolidated 
cash flow statement of the Group.
2. Loss attributable to the Company
The loss for the financial year dealt with in financial statements of 
the Company is £807,651,000 (2007: restated profit of £5,608,000). 
As permitted by Section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985, no 
separate profit and loss account is presented in respect of the 
parent company.
3. Auditors remuneration
The audit fees payable to the auditors for the audit of the financial 
statements of the Company are £20,000 (2007: £20,000).
Fees paid to the auditor and its associates for non-audit services to 
the Company itself are not disclosed in the individual accounts of 
the Company because consolidated financial statements are 
prepared which are required to disclose such fees on a consolidated 
basis. 130 Mecom Group plc Annual report and accounts 2008

As a consequence of the significant impairments of non-current assets in the consolidated financial statements, during the year the 
directors carried out an impairment review of the Company’s investments in Group undertakings. It is the policy of the Company to carry its 
investments in Group undertakings at the lower of cost and the shareholders’ funds in the consolidated balance sheet. At 31 December 
2008, shareholders’ funds in the consolidated balance sheet were £182,900,000, resulting in an impairment charge of £791,385,000 being 
recognised in the Company’s profit and loss account. At 31 December 2008, the cost and valuation of shares in Group undertakings were 
£974,838,000 and £183,453,000, respectively (2007: cost of £974,725,000).
During the year, further investments were made in Mecom Finance Limited via capital contributions of £113,000.
Listed investments
At 31 December 2008, the Company owned 170,000 (2007: 1,700,000) ordinary shares in STV Group plc (which during the year made a 
1-for-10 share-split) and at 31 December 2008 had a closing price of 77.50 pence (2007: 16.25 pence). The charge resulting from the 
change in market value of this investment during the year, which was treated as impairment, of £144,500 is included within the Company’s 
result for the year. In 2007, the change in market value of £846,000 was recorded in the revaluation reserve. At 31 December 2008, the cost 
and valuation of the investment in STV Group plc was £1,424,500 and £131,750, respectively (2007: £1,424,500 and £276,250).
u nlisted investments
As part of an intra-group reorganisation, on 1 January 2008 Mecom UK Management Company Ltd (“MUK”) transferred its investments in 
Espresso Broadband Limited (“Espresso”) and Hightex Group plc (“Hightex”) to Mecom Group plc. 
Espresso is a private company incorporated in England and Wales. At 31 December 2007, MUK owned 518,179 ordinary shares, 786,137 
A ordinary shares and 2,474,929 B ordinary shares in Espresso, with a total valuation of £411,080. In addition, at 31 December 2007 MUK 
held A loan notes, B loan notes and C loan notes in Espresso, with nominal values of £101,157, £13,966 and £53,277, respectively. These 
investments were transferred to Mecom Group plc on 1 January 2008 at the book value of £579,480. During the year, certain of the loan 
stock with a valuation of £53,277 were redeemed. Also during the year, an impairment charge of £285,305 was recorded against the 
carrying value of this investment. At 31 December 2008, the cost and valuation of the investment in Espresso was £526,203 and £240,898, 
respectively. 
Hightex is listed on the Alternative Investment Market and is incorporated in England and Wales. At 31 December 2007, MUK owned 
205,000 ordinary shares in Hightex, with a total cost of £11,408. This investment was transferred to Mecom Group plc on 1 January 2008 
at the book value of £11,408. During the year, the Company purchased a further 205,000 shares in Hightex, at a cost of £17,938. At 31 
December 2008, the cost of the investment in Hightex was £29,346.

loan notes on 13 April 2007. The terms of the convertible loan notes were such that they were to be either repaid or converted into ordinary 
shares of Mecom Group plc, at a price of 76 pence per share, on the redemption date of 12 April 2009. As set out in Note 1, the maturity 
of these convertible loan notes has been deferred to 12 July 2009, although it was agreed that this extension would accelerate to 31 May

Mecom Executive Share Option Plan (“ESOP”)

Nature Grant of options
Service period 3 years
Performance conditions None
Maximum term 10 years
Method of settlement Share distribution
Expected departures (at grant date) 0%
Option exercise price calculation Closing price at the end of the previous trading day
(ii) Information relating to option valuation techniques
Options granted under the Mecom ESOP have been valued using a binomial option pricing model. Assumptions used by the model are  
as follows:
Expected volatility
As shares in Mecom Group plc have been listed for a relatively short period of time, there is insufficient share price history to calculate 
historical volatility. Accordingly, to arrive at a reasonable volatility assumption an analysis of the share price volatility of comparable companies 
was performed.
Expected dividend yield
A dividend yield of 0% has been used as it was not anticipated at the time of the valuation that a dividend would be introduced in the  
near future.
Risk-free rate
The assumption has been based on the yield available on similar dated zero coupon UK government bonds at the time the options were 
granted, using historical information taken from the Bank of England.
Participants’ exercise behaviour
The figures used are based on analysis of the ratio of the share price and exercise price using historical information from companies of a 
similar size to Mecom Group plc. 134 Mecom Group plc Annual report and accounts 2008

31 December 2008 (2007: 510,000 options). The options exercisable at 31 December 2007 have all been forfeited during the year.
Mecom Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”)
The SIP provides the founder executives with a long-term incentive linked to the delivery of shareholder value. It is operated via an offshore 
employee benefit trust (“EBT”), established by the Company for the benefit of the past, present and future employees of the Group following 
admission of the Company’s shares to trading on AIM in 2005.
Nil cost options over ordinary shares in Mecom Group plc were granted to the Trust such that the number of shares to be acquired by the 
SIP on exercise of the options will be calculated on the basis of a formula, the effect of which entitles the Trustees to acquire ordinary shares 
with an aggregate value equivalent to 10% of the increase in market capitalisation of the Company, less the market value of any new equity 
issued by the Company but adding back dividends paid, either five years from the date of admission or in the event of an offer for the 
Company. At the Extraordinary General Meeting held on 5 March 2007 the terms of the SIP were amended in certain minor respects relating 
to leaver provisions and the period within which options granted under the SIP can be exercised.
Notes to the Company financial statements continued
for the year ended 31 December 2008 135
Financials
12. share-based payments continued
The Trustees have established discretionary sub-funds for the proposed beneficiaries under the SIP, into which the options will be allo-
cated. The Trustees have appointed a reversionary interest in the sub-trusts to the individual beneficiaries concerned such that the sub-trust 
property will vest absolutely to the individuals at the end of the vesting period specified above.
If an individual ceases employment before the reversionary interest vests, the interest in the sub-trust property will lapse and the options 
allocated to that sub-trust could then become available to benefit Group employees generally. Further sub-trusts can be created for future 
employees should the Trustees consider it appropriate.
In accordance with FRS 20 Share-based Payment, the Company has recognised a charge which reflects the fair value of the options issued 
under the SIP. The fair value, calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model, is £2.8m which is being expensed over the period from 
23 March 2005 to 23 March 2010.
The estimated fair values and the inputs for the valuation of the SIP are as follows:
        
Growth rate per annum        7.0%
Expected volatility        40.0%
Expected dividend yield        0.0%
13. Obligations under lease contracts
Annual commitments under non-cancellable operating leases for land and buildings which expire between two and five years are £278,000 
(2007: £278,000).
14. Events after the balance sheet date
On 29 April 2009, the Company reached ‘in principle’ agreement with its lending banks (subject to the completion and signing of full 
documentation and subject to the completion of the proposed equity issue) on the terms of a proposed revised bank facility agreement. The 
agreement given by the banks on the key terms of the proposed revised facility agreement are not binding on the banks but the Company 
believes that it is highly likely that full documentation will be signed, in May 2009. The key terms of the new bank deal are provided in Note 1. 
On the same date, the Company received non-binding commitments from current and prospective shareholders (which will be conditional 
upon, inter alia, the Company agreeing acceptable banking terms with its lenders, publishing a prospectus and obtaining shareholder 
approval) to subscribe to a proposed share issue of approximately £140m (before expenses). The Company intends repaying the convertible 
loan notes from these proceeds. The Company expects to complete and to sign full banking documentation during May 2009, after which it 
expects that a prospectus for the issue of new shares will be issued with a view to receiving the proceeds of the share issue during June 
2009.
 
In addition to the above, on 29 April 2009, the holders of the convertible loan notes relating to the acquisition of Galatea Lux One S.à.r.l which 
were due for payment on 12 April 2009, agreed an extension of the maturity date to 12 July 2009, although it was agreed that this extension 
would accelerate to 31 May 2009 under certain conditions.  136 Mecom Group plc Annual report and accounts 2008

Identity theft
Criminals may steal your personal information, putting your 
shareholding at risk.
Tips on protecting your shareholding:
Ensure all your certificates are kept in a safe place or hold your •	
shares electronically in CREST via a nominee
Keep all correspondence from the registrars which shows your •	
shareholder reference number in a safe place, or destroy 
correspondence by shredding
If you change address inform the registrars. If you receive a •	
letter from the registrars regarding a change of address and 
have not recently moved, please contact them immediately.  
You may be the victim of identity theft
If you are buying or selling shares, only deal with brokers •	
registered in your country of residence or the UK
Warning to shareholders
Over the last year many companies have become aware that their 
shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or 
correspondence concerning investment matters which imply a 
connection to the company concerned. These are typically from 
overseas based ‘brokers’ who target UK shareholders offering to 
sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares in 
US or UK investments.
They can be very persistent and extremely persuasive and a 2006 
survey by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) has reported that 
the average amount lost by investors is around £20,000. It is not  
just the novice investor that has been duped in this way; many of  
the victims had been successfully investing for several years. 
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, 
offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free reports into  
the company.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice: 
Make sure you get the correct name of the person and •	
organisation and make a record of any other information they 
give you, e.g. telephone number, address etc 
Check that they are properly authorised by the FSA before •	
getting involved. You can check at www.fsa.gov.uk/register. 
The FSA also maintains on its website a list of unauthorised •	
overseas firms who are targeting, or have targeted, UK investors 
and any approach from such organisations should be reported 
to the FSA so that this list can be kept up to date and any other 
appropriate action can be considered. If you deal with an 
unauthorised firm, you would not be eligible to receive payment 
under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. The FSA 
can, preferably, be contacted by completing an online form at 
http://www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/doing/regulated/law/alerts/
overseas.shtml or, if you do not have access to the internet, on 
0845 606 1234. 
Inform our Registrars on 0870 664 0300. They are not able to •	
investigate such incidents themselves but will record the  
details and pass them on to Mecom Group plc and liaise with 
the FSA. Details of any share dealing facilities that the  
company endorses will be included in company mailings. More 
detailed information on this or similar activity can be found  
on the FSA website http://www.moneymadeclear.fsa.gov.uk/.

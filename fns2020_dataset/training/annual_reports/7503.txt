Overview
3 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
In the UK, having significantly improved our 
customer service over the past year, we are 
focusing on the effectiveness of our sales 
and marketing as we increase activity and 
enhance our existing sales channels. Our 
International businesses have delivered 
strong growth over the past year with 
customer numbers up 19% to 2.6m, and 
these now represent 53% of the Group’s total 
4.9m customers. 
HomeServe’s policies and services continue 
to free customers from the worry and 
inconvenience of home emergencies and 
repairs, with over 1.6m repairs carried out 
over the past twelve months.
Chairman’s statement 
Over the past twelve months HomeServe has made progress in transitioning 
its UK business to a more customer focused operation and has grown its 
International businesses.

Results
In the year, revenue was up 2% to £547m 
(2012: £535m) and adjusted profit before 
tax
2
 was £105.0m (2012: £126.0m). Lower 
profit in our UK business was partially offset 
by a £6m increase from our established 
International businesses. Adjusted earnings 
per share
3
 was 23.0p (2012: 28.0p). The 
Group continues to generate high levels of 
free cash flow
4
 with net debt at 31 March 2013 
reduced to £43m (2012: £66m). 
On a statutory basis, revenue was £547m 
(2012: £535m), profit before tax was £67m 
(2012: £138m) and earnings per share was 
12.9p (2012: 35.4p). The reduction in profit 
before tax is principally due to lower UK 
earnings in FY2013 and the prior year £54.9m 
gain recognised on the re-measurement 
of joint venture interest following the 
acquisition of full control of Doméo. The 
FY2013 statutory result includes exceptional 
expenditure of £25m relating to our UK 
business (£10m) and our French warranty 
business, Société Française de Garantie 
(SFG), (£15m). In the UK, the exceptional 
expenditure includes an estimate of a fine 
arising from the Financial Conduct Authority 
(FCA) investigation and associated costs 
amounting to £6m, together with the costs 
relating to the reduction in the UK headcount 
announced in March 2013 of £4m. There 
remains uncertainty as to the nature or extent 
of the action that the FCA may seek to take 
following the conclusion of its investigation 
and accordingly any related financial effect. 
In respect of SFG, we have recorded a 
£15m charge related to the reduction in the 
carrying value of that business, reflecting the 
challenging conditions in the electrical retail 
market in France. 
UK
In the UK we have strengthened our controls 
and governance, enhanced our focus on the 
customer and have made good progress 
improving customer service and customer 
satisfaction, with 40% fewer complaints 
received over the financial year compared to 
the previous period. The UK business is now 
focusing on the effectiveness of its sales and 
marketing activity and we are starting to see 
better results. 
We have also identified areas for improved 
operational efficiency and are redesigning 
processes and systems, as well as ensuring 
that our resources are aligned with our 
customer numbers. 
The UK management team maintains 
a positive and constructive day-to-day 
relationship with the FCA. We are making 
good progress in completing the business 
improvement initiatives; with our customer 
re-contact exercise on track and in line with 
our expectations. The FCA’s investigation 
into our past issues is making progress and 
as a result we have now recorded exceptional 
expenditure of £6m, which is our estimate 
for the costs and fine arising from this 
investigation. We still expect the investigation 
to take a number of months to complete.
 Overview
5 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
International business development
We have continued to achieve strong growth 
in our established International businesses. 
HomeServe USA has increased its customer 
numbers by 25% over the past 12 months 
and now has 1.3m customers with over 
2m policies. In Spain, Reparalia increased 
its customer numbers by 50% and policy 
numbers were up 43%, while in France, 
Doméo has increased its retention rate  
to 89%.
We are also continuing to invest in the 
development of new overseas businesses.  
In Italy, we are pleased to have signed  
long-term affinity partner agreements with 
Enel Energia and Veritas and are planning to 
significantly increase our marketing activity 
in FY2014. In Germany, we are focusing on 
developing affinity partnerships. 
Dividend
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 
7.67p per share bringing the total dividend for 
the year to 11.3p (2012: 11.3p). 
Board changes
I would formally like to welcome Johnathan 
Ford to the Board. Johnathan joined the 
Group as Chief Financial Officer in September 
2012 and was previously the Group Finance 
Director of NWF Group plc, an AIM listed 
specialist distribution group. He is already 
making a strong contribution to the business.
People
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all 
our employees for their contribution over the 
past year. 
I would like to particularly note our UK 
employees’ professionalism and commitment 
during a period of significant change, whilst in 
our International businesses our teams have 
again delivered strong growth.
Summary and outlook
HomeServe’s products continue to meet 
clear customer needs and our business 
model continues to deliver long-term 
value. Our financial results in FY2013 are 
in line with expectations. While it remains a 
challenging time for HomeServe in the UK, 
we are confident that the actions we are 
implementing will deliver long-term value to 
all our stakeholders.
HomeServe continues to be a profitable 
business with a strong balance sheet and 
a cash generative business model. We 
expect to stabilise UK customer numbers 
at around 1.9m by the end of FY2014 and 
are planning for continued strong growth 
in our International businesses. While our 
performance in FY2014 is expected to reflect 
the impact of lower UK customer numbers, 
we remain confident that the plans we are 
implementing will allow the Group to return to 
modest growth in FY2015.

20% higher at £34m (including the benefit

We have reinforced a customer focused 
culture across all our operations. In particular, 
in the UK, customer satisfaction has 
increased and the number of complaints  
has reduced by 40%. We are also improving 
our cost efficiency by reducing complexity, 
sharing best practice and investing in 
new systems and technology. In the UK, 
for example, we have focused our affinity 
partnerships on utilities, manufacturers of 
installed appliances and financial services 
companies and we announced in March that 
we are going to invest in a new packaged IT

UK
UK revenue reduced by £45m to £309m 
(2012: £354m) reflecting the reduction 
in customer numbers and related repair 
income. Adjusted operating profit
1
 in the UK 
was £78m (2012: £103m) with the reduction 
in revenue being partially offset by lower 
costs. The lower costs are a result of a 
reduced headcount and lower marketing 
expenditure, partially offset by increased 
governance and control costs. UK statutory 
operating profit was £68m (2012: £78m) 
including exceptional expenditure of £10m, of 
which £6m is our estimate for the costs and 
fine arising from the FCA investigation, and 
the remaining £4m relates to the reduction of 
around 300 roles announced in March 2013. 
Customer numbers in the UK have fallen to 
2.3m, in line with our expectations (2012: 
2.7m). The reduction is a result of the low 
level of marketing activity in FY2013, which 
was insufficient to replace those customers 
that did not renew in the ordinary course. As 
we increase our marketing activity we expect 
the number of new customers acquired to at 
least equal the number not renewing, which 
should enable us to stabilise the UK customer 
base at around 1.9m customers from  
March 2014. 
Our UK gross new policy sales, and customer 
and policy numbers have all reduced during 
the year as a result of lower marketing activity 
whilst we focused on the development 
and testing of new marketing materials, 
sales channel enhancements, new product 
development, the restructuring of our call 
centre operations and the implementation 
of improved governance and controls. Gross 
new customers in FY2013 were 0.1m (2012: 
0.3m) and gross new policy sales were 0.2m 
(2012: 0.7m). Total policies at the end of 
March 2013 were 5.5m, a reduction of 18% 
on the prior year (2012: 6.7m), similar to the 
reduction in customer numbers. 
Income per customer increased to £106 
(2012: £99), reflecting the benefit from price 
rises and the mix of policies.
The policy retention rate increased from 78% 
in the first half of the year to 79% for the full 
year (2012: 80%) and was above 80% in 
the final quarter. The increase in the second 
half of the year is a result of the high levels of 
customer satisfaction across all our touch 
points and the implementation of a number 
of ongoing retention initiatives as well as a 
reduction in the number of first year policies, 
which have a lower retention rate.
During the year, our network of 289 directly 
employed engineers and over 450 sub-
contractors completed 0.7m repairs. 
80% of our plumbing and drains repairs 
were completed by our directly employed 
engineers, who typically received the highest 
levels of customer satisfaction. 
 12 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Our affinity partners continue to remain 
supportive of our plans and actions and we 
are pleased to confirm that two of our larger 
water utilities have signed new long-term 
agreements. 
During the second half of FY2013, the 
UK business saw improvements in the 
effectiveness of its sales and marketing 
activity. We are now planning to significantly 
increase the scale of our marketing activity 
in FY2014 as we aim to double the number of 
new customers to around 0.2m, up from 0.1m 
in FY2013, but compared to 0.6m in FY2011. 
Direct mail marketing activity is expected 
to more than double in FY2014 and we are 
also planning to increase sales through 
our partner call centres and continue the 
development of our internet and digital 
sales channels. We have, during FY2013, 
recommenced policy sales through our 
partner call centres and during FY2014 we 
expect to increase the number of partners 
who operate this sales channel and to build 
on the call conversion rates achieved during 
the final quarter of FY2013.
We are increasing our investment in internet 
and digital channels. We have already 
recruited and have in place a new team who 
have significant experience and expertise in 
internet and digital marketing activity. During 
FY2014, we will be refocusing our internet 
site on customer acquisition, improving our 
search engine optimisation and enhancing 
the HomeServe pages within our affinity 
partners’ websites. We will continue to use 
the outbound telephony channel primarily for 
selling to existing customers. 
The planned increase in new customer 
acquisition volumes and retention will also be 
supported by the roll-out of new products, 
including an improved Plumbing and 
Drainage product, which includes cover for 
non-emergency items such as dripping taps 
and leaking overflows. 
As customer numbers have reduced in 
the UK we have taken action to reduce our 
operating costs and improve our operating 
efficiency. The average number of UK 
employees has reduced by 377 over the past 
year and we announced a further reduction 
of 300 roles in March 2013 reflecting the 
expected reduction in customer numbers 
from 3m in September 2011 to around 1.9m 
by March 2014. We have also started a 
number of process re-engineering projects 
to simplify processes to further improve the 
customer experience and improve efficiency.
In November 2011, we commenced a number 
of business improvement initiatives, which 
were consistent with the feedback received 
from our Supervisory team at the FCA. 
These initiatives focused on our sales and 
marketing, controls and governance and 
complaints handling issues. Our customer re-
contact exercise is the only initiative still to be 
completed and this is progressing as planned.
We are now close to completing the review 
of the complaints that were received during 
winter 2010 and we are also making progress 
in contacting customers who may have 
suffered detriment as a result of the way 
in which they were sold their policy. This 
exercise is expected to be completed by 
March 2014.
The FCA investigation into our past issues in 
the UK business is ongoing and is expected to 
take a number of months to complete.

22% higher than a year ago driven by a 25% 
increase in customer numbers. Adjusted 
operating profit
1
 was £9.5m (2012: £9.0m).
We are a national business, licensed to 
operate in all 50 USA states, and we now work 
with 35 partners in the USA and Canada. 
Over the past year we have signed ten new 
utility affinity partnerships in ten states with a 
mix of gas, electric and water utilities across 
both public and municipality ownership. 
The new partnerships include a long-term 
marketing agreement with Montana 
Dakota Utilities (MDU), which serves 260k 
households in the states of North and 
South Dakota, Montana and Wyoming. This 
agreement was part of the acquisition of 
MDU’s policy book, which was completed in 
March 2013. MDU’s 52k home assistance 
policies, which provided protection for a 
property’s primary heating appliance and 
water heater across 26k customers, have 
now transferred to HomeServe. 
Gross new policy sales (excluding acquired 
policies) during the year were 0.7m (2012: 
0.6m). This growth, together with a good 
retention performance, has resulted in 
customer numbers increasing by 25% to 
1.3m (2012: 1.1m) and policy numbers also 
increasing by 25% to 2.1m (2012: 1.7m). 
We are making good progress in broadening 
the range of sales channels used in North 
America. Direct mail remains the main 
channel for new customer acquisition 
although during the year we have significantly 
increased the number of partners who  
either use their call centres to sell our  
policies or transfer potential sales calls to 
our agents. We have also commenced online 
policy sales via our HomeServe USA website. 
We expect to increase sales through our 
partners’ call centres in the future as well as 
significantly grow sales via our USA internet 
and digital channels.
Over the past 12 months we have more than 
doubled the number of marketing mailings 
as a result of the increase in the number 
of affinity partners and our own brand 
marketing activity. Despite the significant 
growth in direct mail activity, our response 
rates and payback periods have continued to 
be attractive and in line with our expectations.
Raising the awareness of homeowners’ 
responsibilities for the pipes and wires in and 
around their home is key to the continued 
strong growth in customer numbers. We were 
therefore pleased to announce in February 
2013 an association with Giuliani Partners 
and former New York City Mayor, Rudy 
Giuliani. Giuliani Partners and Mayor Giuliani 
will advise us on increasing awareness of 
the need for water and sewer infrastructure 
investment and consumer protection across 
the USA.

The USA retention rate has increased to 
80% (2012: 79%). In the USA, we continue 
to achieve retention rates of around 90% 
where we bill the customer via their utility bill 
and therefore we are planning to increase the 
number of partners who use ‘on bill’ payment 
collection for our products in FY2014. A key 
benefit from the system improvements being 
planned across the Group will be the ability to 
more quickly integrate our billing processes 
with those of utilities in the future.
There remain significant opportunities 
for growth in North America and we are 
therefore continuing to invest in people and 
infrastructure as well as additional marketing 
activity. Over the past year, we have 
strengthened our business development 
team, increased our IT and digital expertise 
as well as enhanced our senior management 
team with a number of new positions. 
As we grow the number of customers and 
policies, we also need to ensure we maintain 
and improve our operational efficiency and 
have, for example, outsourced the processing 
of postal policy applications to a specialist 
and have recently announced the closure 
of our Miami administration centre. The 
work currently undertaken in Miami will be 
transferred to our other USA locations, in 
Stamford and Chattanooga, and a third party 
specialist outsourcer. 
Our 134 directly employed technicians  
and network of around 700 high quality 
 sub-contractors completed 0.27m jobs 
during FY2013.

Doméo
In its first full year of 100% HomeServe 
ownership, Doméo contributed revenue of 
£74m in FY2013 compared to £52m in the 
previous year (when it was 49% owned by 
HomeServe for the first 8 months of the year 
and 100% for the final 4 months). Adjusted 
operating profit
1
 was £22m (2012: £17m). 
On a like-for-like basis, revenues increased 
by 1% and adjusted operating profit
1
 by 
8% reflecting good cost control and less 
outbound marketing activity. 
French customers continue to remain very 
loyal, with the policy retention rate increasing 
to 89% (2012: 88%). This high rate reflects 
the proportion of customers using a monthly 
continuous payment method to pay for their 
policy, a consistently high level of customer 
satisfaction and a low level of customer 
complaints.
Doméo achieved gross new policy sales 
of 0.3m (2012: 0.4m) with total customer 
numbers increasing by 2% to 0.91m (2012: 
0.89m) during the year. Policy numbers grew 
0.01m to 2.34m (2012: 2.33m). 
Income per customer increased by 2% to 
€98 (2012: €96), reflecting the mix and price 
of policies held by customers.
The majority of our new customers in France 
are acquired through direct mail marketing. 
We are however developing new sales 
channels in Doméo to enable us to increase 
customer growth in the future. Over the past 
year we have increased the proportion of 
sales generated through Veolia’s call centres 
as a result of improving the call conversion 
rate as well as increasing the number of 
Veolia call centres transferring calls to our 
sales teams. 
During the second half of FY2013, we 
developed and tested new plumbing 
emergency and drainage products in France 
with favourable customer feedback. We are 
therefore planning to focus our new customer 
acquisition campaigns on these products 
in FY2014. We are also developing a revised 
water loss product in France, which will be 
principally used in cross-sell activity. 
Acquiring 100% control of Doméo in 
December 2011 has given us an opportunity 
to broaden our range of affinity partners in 
France and we have reorganised the business 
to increase the focus and resource allocated 
to new partner development. We have, over 
the past year, started early stage discussions 
with a number of energy and water utilities.
All of our repairs in France are managed 
through our network of 950 sub-contractors 
who completed a similar number of repairs 
compared to the previous year.

Spain
In Spain, revenue was £61m (2012: £60m) 
and adjusted operating profit
1
 was £3.1m 
(2012: £2.8m). The growth in adjusted 
operating profit
1
 reflects the increase in 
customer and policy numbers and the benefit 
of higher claims handling volumes and 
margins, partially offset by increased sales 
and marketing activity in the membership 
business.
Customer and policy numbers continue  
to show strong growth. Customer numbers 
increased by 50% to 0.4m (2012: 0.3m)  
and policy numbers were up 43% to 0.5m 
(2012: 0.3m).
Gross new policy sales were 0.3m, up 
from 0.2m in FY2012, as we increased our 
marketing activity with both our affinity 
partners; Endesa and Agbar. 
During FY2013, we continued to increase 
the proportion of sales generated through 
our partners’ call centres and the outbound 
telephony channel. Sales through our 
partners’ call centres accounted for 56% of 
gross new policy sales (2012: 14%). 
Sales of our Electrical Assistance policy by 
Endesa’s call centre agents have proven 
very successful over the past 12 months. 
Over 68% of new customers in FY2013 were 
acquired through this sales channel and 
we expect this to increase in FY2014. Our 
Electrical Assistance product covers the cost 
of the call out for any electrical emergency 
and two hours of labour together with two 
electrical handyman services per annum, 
each of two hours. The product, which is 
offered at a 50% discount in the first year, 
is sold by Endesa to customers when they 
switch their electricity tariff and is billed via 
the utility bill.
Our claims handling business in Spain 
continues to perform well with continued 
growth in the number of claims managed and 
a higher margin. Our network of 2,100 sub-
contractors and the 147 Reparalia franchised 
engineers completed 0.5m repairs over the 
past twelve months. 
New Markets 
  Long-term agreement with Enel Energia 
enabling us to market to 3.5m households 
in Italy
  Focusing on the development of affinity 
partnerships in Germany
Our New Markets segment includes our 
developing businesses in Italy and Germany 
as well as Société Française de Garantie 
(SFG), our French warranty business.
The New Markets businesses reported 
revenue of £9.4m, lower than the £11.6m in 
the prior year, primarily as a result of the sale 
of our Belgian businesses in March 2012. 
The increased adjusted operating loss
1
 of 
£4.8m (2012: £3.4m) reflects the additional 
investment in Italy and Germany over the 
past 12 months as well as lower earnings  
from SFG.
As the Spanish policy base is still relatively small and growing quickly we do not currently report the retention rate and income per customer metrics.
 Chief Executive’s review
20 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
In Italy, we have signed a long-term 
agreement with the energy utility Enel 
Energia, enabling us to market to 3.5m 
households and have recently completed 
the systems development to enable us to bill 
Italian customers on their utility bill. During 
FY2014, we will be significantly increasing our 
marketing activity to Enel Energia customers 
and our Italian water utility partner Veritas, 
as well as targeting the development of other 
affinity partnerships.
In Germany, we completed a test marketing 
campaign with BS Energy (part of the Veolia 
group) and will be focusing on developing 
additional affinity partnerships in FY2014. 
Earnings from our SFG retail warranty 
business have been impacted by the 
reduction in retail sales of electrical goods in 
France together with the full year impact of 
the loss of one of our larger retailers following 
a take-over by a retailer who manages 
warranties in-house. 
Outlook
Our business model continues to deliver 
value for customers, affinity partners 
and shareholders, and remains very cash 
generative. We expert to stabilise our UK 
customer numbers at around 1.9m by  
31 March 2014, and are confident that we 
can continue to grow our International 
businesses, enabling the Group overall to 
return to modest growth from FY2015.
UK
In FY2014 we are planning to recruit around 
0.2m new customers in the UK, double the 
number recruited in FY2013, as we develop 
and increase the scale of our marketing 
activity. By FY2015 we are planning to 
recruit around 0.3m new customers a year 
enabling us to stabilise the UK customer 
base at around 1.9m customers. The planned 
increase in new customer acquisition 
volumes will be supported by the roll-out of 
new products as well as more support from 
our water affinity partners, with an increasing 
proportion of sales coming from their call 
centres, and the development of our internet 
and digital sales channels. 
We continue to expect the full year UK 
underlying retention rate (excluding losses 
from the run-off of non-core manufacturer 
warranties and customer re-contact exercise) 
to increase to around 80% in FY2014 and 
would expect it to increase further in future 
years as we benefit from the roll-out of 
new products and increasing customer 
satisfaction.
In FY2014, the reduction in the number of 
customers renewing will result in around 
£35m of lower contribution (compared to 
FY2013), which is expected to be partially 
offset by headcount savings of around £10m.
UK revenue in FY2015 is expected to reduce 
further by around £20m (compared to 
FY2014) as a result of a lower number of 
renewing customers and the continued 
marketing and roll-out of new enhanced 
products. 
This reduction will be partially offset by 
full year savings in direct costs and further 
operating efficiencies.
 Business review
21 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
International
In our International businesses we are 
confident that we will continue to deliver 
strong and sustainable growth in customers 
and earnings. As a result, we expect our 
established International businesses to 
deliver over 50% of the Group’s operating 
profit in FY2015.
Our USA business provides our most 
significant growth opportunity and in FY2014 
we expect it to significantly benefit from 
the 25% increase in customer numbers in 
FY2013 and to continue to deliver a high 
customer growth rate in the future. In France, 
we expect customer numbers to increase 
although the rate of customer and profit 
growth is likely to be modest until we sign 
another major utility affinity partner. In 
Spain, we are planning for continued strong 
growth in customer and policy numbers in 
our membership business as we continue 
to invest in our marketing activity and grow 
our renewal revenue. As our businesses in 
Italy and Germany invest in growing their 
customer numbers we expect our New 
Markets segment to report an operating loss 
of around £6m per annum.
System developments
To support our growth plans and improve 
our operational efficiency, we are investing 
in a new packaged IT system which will be 
implemented across the entire Group. This 
investment, amounting to around £30m over 
the next three years (FY2014 - FY2016), will 
start to deliver operational benefits in FY2015 
with financial benefits starting to accrue from 
FY2016.
In the UK, the new system will improve our 
marketing effectiveness, reduce our costs 
and improve our compliance and control 
processes. In our US business, it will enable 
us to on-board affinity partners and integrate 
our charging processes into their billing 
systems more quickly. Across the Group,  
the system will provide call centre agents in 
all parts of the business with a single view of 
the customer. 
Summary
The financial impact of the reduction in 
UK customer numbers has unfortunately 
more than offset the strong growth in our 
International businesses in FY2013. We are 
however implementing plans to stabilise UK 
customer numbers at around 1.9m by the 
end of March 2014, which will then enable 
customer numbers across the Group to 
grow again. UK earnings are expected to 
be negatively impacted in both FY2014 and 
FY2015, but we expect the growth in our 
International business to enable the Group 
overall to return to modest growth in FY2015.
We are confident that we can stabilise 
UK customer numbers as well as grow 
our established overseas businesses. We 
are therefore continuing to invest in the 
development of our new businesses in Italy 
and Germany as well as implementing a new 
group-wide IT system.
Our products and services continue to meet 
clear customer needs and we are confident 
that our business model can continue to 
deliver long-term value for all stakeholders.

Segmental Results
The Group has five operating segments – UK, 
USA, Doméo, Spain, and New Markets. The 
New Markets division combines the results of 
our businesses in Italy, Germany and SFG in 
France. The revenue and adjusted operating 
profit
1
 for each of these segments are set out 
in the table below.
Group revenue has increased by 2% to 
£546.5m (2012: £534.7m), with growth in 
our established International businesses 
offsetting a reduction in the UK. Adjusted 
operating profit
1
 reduced to £107.6m 
(2012: £128.2m) with lower profits in the UK 
partially offset by growth in our established 
International businesses.
UK revenue has reduced by £44.5m to 
£309.0m, due principally to the 16% 
reduction in customer numbers.

Doméo for the full reporting period. 
The Group adjusted operating margin 
(adjusted operating profit/(loss)
1
 divided by 
revenue) has reduced from 24.0% to 19.7% 
principally as a result of the reduction in 
the UK operating margin and the increased 
investment in our New Markets businesses.
UK
Our UK business reported revenue of 
£309.0m (2012: £353.5m), a reduction of 
£44.5m and adjusted operating profit
1
 of 
£78.3m (2012: £103.1m), a reduction of 
£24.8m compared to the prior year. The lower 
revenue and profit
1
 is principally a result of the 
reduction in customer numbers from 2.7m at 
31 March 2012 to 2.3m at 31 March 2013.
Revenue in the UK business can be analysed 
as ‘net income’ (income per customer 
multiplied by the number of customers) 
of £240.9m (2012: £267.5m), with the 
remaining income of £68.1m (2012: £86.0m) 
representing £55.1m of repair network 
revenue (2012: £70.9m) and other income 
of £13.0m (2012: £15.1m), which includes 
third party claims handling revenue as well as 
revenue from transactions with other Group 
companies. 
Income per customer has increased to £106 
(2012: £99), principally reflecting the benefit 
from price rises and the mix of policies.
Operating costs within the UK business 
reduced by £19.7m compared to the previous 
year. This reduction was driven by lower 
staff numbers following the redundancy 
programmes in February and May 2012, 
lower repair network costs reflecting the 
reduction in customer numbers and reduced 
marketing expenditure as we focused on 
testing new sales and marketing initiatives. 
These savings were partially offset by the 
increased costs of additional compliance and 
quality checking and improved governance 
and control processes.
The UK adjusted operating margin was 
25.3% (2012: 29.2%).

Financial review
USA
In the USA, revenue has increased by 22% to 
£100.8m (2012: £82.3m) driven by the 25% 
growth in customer and policy numbers. 
Adjusted operating profit
1
 increased from 
£9.0m to £9.5m. The growth in profit is 
slower than the growth in revenue as a result 
of an 84% increase in marketing expenditure 
during the year as well as the ongoing 
investment in people and infrastructure.
We expect the strong growth in customer 
numbers in FY2013 to benefit our 
performance in FY2014 as these customers’ 
policies renew and the rate of growth in 
marketing and sales costs is reduced.
The increased investment in marketing has 
resulted in the adjusted operating margin 
reducing from 11.0% to 9.5%. As we continue 
to target strong growth in customer numbers, 
we expect the USA adjusted operating margin 
to remain in the 10% to 15% range. 
Doméo
Doméo contributed revenue of £73.8m 
compared to £51.8m in the previous year 
(when it was 49% owned by HomeServe for 
the first 8 months of the year and 100% for 
the final 4 months). Adjusted operating profit
1
 
was £21.5m (2012: £16.7m). 
On a like for like basis, revenue was 1% higher 
compared to the prior period whilst adjusted 
operating profit
1
 increased by 8%, reflecting 
good cost control and less outbound 
marketing activity. 
The adjusted operating margin was 29.2% 
(2012: 32.2%). On a like for like basis, the 
margin increased by 2ppts as a result of 
improved efficiency. 
Spain
In Spain, revenue was £60.5m, £0.3m higher 
than in the prior year. 
Membership revenue increased by 16% 
to £10.0m (2012: £8.6m) as a result of 
the strong growth in customer and policy

Total adjusted operating profit
1
 was £3.1m, 
£0.3m higher than in the previous year  
(2012: £2.8m). 
Increased sales and marketing costs within 
the Membership business were more than 
offset by improved operational efficiency in 
the Claims Handling business. 
Spain has reported an adjusted operating

Our New Markets businesses reported 
revenue of £9.4m (2012: £11.6m) and an 
adjusted operating loss
1
 of £4.8m 
(2012: £3.4m). 
Revenue from our New Markets businesses 
reduced by £2.2m over the past 12 months 
principally due to the sale of our Belgian 
businesses in March 2012 and lower 
revenues from SFG. The Belgian businesses 
contributed £1.9m of revenue in FY2012.
The higher adjusted operating loss
1
 reflects 
increased investment in Italy and Germany, 
lower earnings from SFG and the impact 
of the sale of our Belgian businesses which 
contributed £0.5m of adjusted operating 
profit
1
 in FY2012.
Cash flow and financing
Our business model continues to be highly 
cash generative with cash generated by 
operations in FY2013 amounting to £128.2m 
(2012: £114.3m), representing a cash 
conversion ratio against adjusted operating 
profit
1
 of 119% (2012: 89%). 
Working capital decreased by £7.8m in 
FY2013, compared to an increase of £1.2m 
in FY2012. Working capital increased in the 
UK as a result of the expenditure related to 
addressing the sales and marketing issues 
provided for in March 2012 and also in 
our International businesses as a result of 
the strong growth in customer and policy 
numbers. These increases were however 
more than offset by a reduction in working 
capital as a result of the lower number of 
UK customers and policies and the FY2013

Business review
 26 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Financial review
During the year, we incurred net capital 
expenditure of £29.9m (2012: £16.9m).  
This expenditure related to the implementation 
of a new group-wide financial management 
system, completing work on the network 
transformation project in the UK with a new 
contractor appointment booking system as 
well as the costs of re-engineering processes 
in our UK business. Capital expenditure also 
includes payments made to affinity partners 
for the long-term provision of exclusive 
database access and branding rights. 
We expect to maintain a higher than usual 
level of capital expenditure over the next  
3 years (FY2014 - FY2016) as we implement 
a new packaged IT system across the entire 
Group. The new system which will support 
both our growth plans and improve our 
operational efficiency, will start to deliver 
operational benefits in FY2015 with financial 
benefits starting to accrue from FY2016. 
Free cash flow during the period was £69.0m 
(2012: £64.4m). 
At 31 March 2012, we had a balance sheet 
provision of £21.0m in respect of expenditure 
related to addressing the issues in the UK, 
including, where appropriate compensating 
customers. Over the past 12 months we have 
incurred £9.5m of actual expenditure and 
the balance sheet provision at 31 March 2013 
has reduced to £11.5m and is expected to be 
spent over the next 12 months. The expected 
cost of re-contacting customers and the 
extent of any compensation due is based on 
our experience to date and represents our 
estimate. It is possible that our assumptions 
regarding the number of customers, level of 
compensation payable, response rate and 
the upheld rate could be different to those 
currently assumed. 
At this stage, however, we believe that the 
provision is sufficient to cover the costs of 
the remaining customer re-contact exercise, 
including customer compensation.
In FY2013 we incurred exceptional 
expenditure of £10.0m relating to the 
reorganisation of the UK business, 
announced in March 2013, and the FCA 
investigation. At the end of FY2013, we had 
incurred £1.7m of actual expenditure and had 
a balance sheet provision of £8.3m.
Despite a reduction in operating profit, the 
cash generative nature of the business 
resulted in net debt reducing by £23.1m  
over the 12 month period. Net debt at  
31 March 2013 was £42.9m (2012: £66.0m), 
significantly within our facility limit of £250m, 
which is committed through to July 2016. 
Group statutory results
The headline statutory financial results for 
the Group are presented below.
Statutory profit before tax was £66.5m, 
£71.5m lower than in FY2012 (2012: 
£138.0m). Statutory profit before tax is after 
the amortisation of acquisition intangibles 
and exceptional expenditure and in the prior 
period, a gain on the re-measurement of our 
joint venture interest following the acquisition 
of the remaining 51% shareholding and tax on 
the earnings from Doméo during the period in 
which it was a joint venture.
Amortisation of acquisition intangibles
The amortisation of acquisition intangibles 
of £13.4m (2012: £10.4m) principally relates 
to customer and other contracts held by the 
acquired entities at the date of acquisition. 
The £3m increase in the amortisation charge 
principally reflects a full 12 month impact 
from the acquisition of the 51% shareholding 
in Doméo in December 2011. 
 27 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Exceptional expenditure
The exceptional expenditure of £25.1m 
includes costs related to reorganising the UK 
business and the FCA investigation, as well as 
a reduction in the carrying value of the assets 
of our French warranty business, SFG. In the 
prior year there was exceptional expenditure 
of £31.1m as detailed in note 6.
FY2013 UK exceptional expenditure
The £10m charge relates to the reorganisation 
of the UK business announced in March 2013 
and the FCA investigation.
In March 2013 we announced plans to reduce 
the number of roles in our UK business by 
around 300, reflecting the planned reduction 
in customer numbers over the next 12 
months. This reorganisation will incur costs 
of £4m and generate savings of around £10m 
in FY2014.
The FCA investigation has progressed, and 
having taken advice and reviewed internal and 
external available information, the Board has 
decided to record exceptional expenditure 
of £6m in relation to the anticipated costs of 
managing the investigation and a fine which 
represents our estimate. There remains 
uncertainty as to the nature or extent of 
the action that the FCA may seek to take 
following the conclusion of its investigation 
and accordingly any related financial effect. 
Société Française de Garantie (SFG)  
asset values 
The exceptional expenditure also includes 
a £15.1m charge related to the write down 
of the carrying value of SFG, our French 
warranty business. This write down reflects 
the challenging conditions in the electrical 
retail market in France.

Financial review
Finance costs
The Group’s net finance costs were £2.6m, 
£0.4m higher than in FY2012 reflecting a 
higher level of net debt in the first six months 
of the year compared to the prior period. 
Taxation 
The tax charge in the financial year was 
£24.6m (2012: £23.7m). In order to calculate an 
effective tax rate that reflects the ongoing tax 
burden of the Group, it is necessary to exclude 
the £15.1m exceptional expenditure relating to 
the write-down of the carrying value of SFG, 
which is not tax deductible and the £6m of 
exceptional expenditure in the UK related to 
the FCA investigation. Excluding these items 
the adjusted effective tax rate is 28.8%, which 
is comparable to the underlying joint venture 
adjusted tax rate of 28.4% in FY2012. 
We expect the tax rate to gradually increase in 
future years as our International businesses, 
all of which are based in countries with a 
higher corporation tax rate than the UK, 
contribute an increasing proportion of profits.
Earnings per share
Adjusted earnings per share

 for the period 
decreased from 28.0p to 23.0p. The average 
number of shares in issue increased from 
322m to 324m. 
On a statutory basis, earnings per share 
decreased from 35.4p to 12.9p. 
Dividend
The proposed final dividend of 7.67p per 
share together with the payment of the 
interim dividend of 3.63p per share brings 
the total dividend for the year to 11.3p  
(2012: 11.3p). The final dividend, subject  
to shareholder approval, will be paid on  
1 August 2013 to shareholders on the  
register on 5 July 2013. 
Acquisitions
Acquisition spend during the year totalled 
£5.8m (2012: £87.8m). This expenditure 
relates to a number of individually small 
acquisitions including Montana Dakota 
Utilities’ Combined Gas & Electrical Contract 
Business in the USA, which completed in 
March 2013, acquisitions to support the 
continued development of our directly 
employed network of plumbers in the UK 
and deferred consideration relating to 
acquisitions completed in prior periods.
Foreign exchange impact
The impact of changes in the € and $ 
exchange rates between FY2013 and FY2012 
has resulted in the reported revenue of our 
International businesses reducing by £5.7m

Business review
 30 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
The table below sets out what the Board 
believes to be the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the Group, the 
mitigating actions for each, and an update 
on any change in the profile of each risk 
during the past year. These should be read 
in conjunction with the Chief Executive’s 
and Financial reviews. Additional risks and 
uncertainties of which we are not currently 
aware or which we currently believe are not 
significant may also adversely affect our 
strategy, business performance or financial 
condition in the future.
These risks are assessed in relation to the 
Group’s strategy, business performance 
and financial condition and a formal risk 
mitigation plan is agreed with clear ownership 
and accountability. Risk management 
operates at all levels throughout the Group, 
across geographies and business lines. 
Risks to HomeServe’s business are either 
specific to HomeServe’s business model, 
such as affinity partner relationships and 
underwriting, or more general, such as 
the impact of competition and regulatory 
compliance.
Principal risks and uncertainties
HomeServe has a risk management process which provides a structured and 
consistent framework for identifying, assessing and responding to risks.
Risk – Description/Impact Mitigation Change since 2012 Annual Report
Ability to implement an updated 
strategy successfully within the 
UK business
The successful implementation 
of an updated strategy and the 
restoration of a customer focused 
culture in the UK business is of 
considerable importance to our 
future.
If we are not able to implement the 
strategy or achieve the restoration 
as effectively or as rapidly as we 
intend, the future performance of 
the UK business may be adversely 
affected, potentially materially.
There is no certainty as to the 
scope and cost of the additional 
activities that we may need to 
undertake to achieve our desired 
culture. 
We have strengthened the UK 
management team and have a 
number of new developments that 
we are testing and implementing. 
The UK business has a detailed 
project plan for improving its sales 
and marketing effectiveness, its 
governance and controls and 
customer service. These actions 
are being carefully monitored 
and updated as we complete 
initiatives.  
The Business has the financial 
strength to incur additional costs 
if necessary.
During FY2013 we have made good 
progress in restoring our customer 
focused culture in the UK, with 
improved customer satisfaction and 
a significantly reduced number of 
customer complaints.
It has taken longer than initially 
planned to test and improve our 
sales and marketing effectiveness, 
which is expected to result in a 
continued reduction in UK earnings 
in FY2014 and FY2015. Customer 
numbers are expected to stabilise at 
around 1.9m from the end of March 
2014.
 31 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Risk – Description/Impact Mitigation Change since 2012 Annual Report
Commercial relationships
Underpinning the success in 
our chosen markets are close 
commercial relationships (affinity 
partner relationships) with utility 
companies, household appliance 
manufacturers and financial 
institutions. The loss of one of these 
relationships could impact our 
future customer and policy growth 
plans and retention rates.
While these partnerships are 
secured under long-term contracts, 
which increase the security of these 
relationships over the medium-
term, they can be terminated in 
certain circumstances. 
We have regular contact 
and reviews with the senior 
management of our affinity 
partners to ensure that we 
respond to their needs and 
deliver the service that they 
expect.
There are a number of 
partnerships across our markets 
that mitigate, in part, the impact 
of losing any single relationship.
We have continued to sign and 
renew affinity partnerships with 
utilities in the UK, USA and Italy. 
In the UK, we have renewed two of 
our larger water utility partnerships 
during the year. 
In the USA, we have signed new 
agreements with 10 utilities. 
In Italy, we have signed long  
term agreements with Enel Energia 
and Veritas.
In Spain, we are planning for 
continued strong growth in 
customer and policy numbers  
in FY2014. 
Competition
There are a number of businesses 
that provide services that are 
similar to those of the Group and 
could therefore compete in one 
or more of our chosen markets. 
Increased competition could  
affect our ability to meet our 
expectations and objectives for the 
Business in terms of the number of 
customers, policies or the financial 
returns achieved. 
The market and the activities of 
other participants are regularly 
reviewed to ensure that the 
strategies and offerings of current 
and potential competitors are 
fully understood.
Both qualitative and quantitative 
research is undertaken to  
ensure that our products and 
services continue to meet the 
needs of our customers whilst 
retaining a competitive position  
in the market. 
We believe we have a compelling 
proposition for customers, 
providing them with real value. 
This helps reduce the impact of 
increased competition. 
There has been no significant 
change in the competitive  
landscape in any of the countries in 
which we operate.
In the UK, we have seen increased 
media advertising by our main 
competitor but this has not had an 
impact on our ability to achieve 
our targets.
In the USA, we continue to acquire 
policy books from utilities who run 
their own programmes. During 
FY2013 we have acquired 52k 
policies from Montana Dakota 
Utilities.
In France and Spain, there has 
been no significant change in the 
competitive landscape.
Customer loyalty/retention
A key element of our business 
model is customer loyalty. Any 
reduction in the proportion of 
customers renewing their  
policies could significantly  
impact our revenues.
The policy retention rate is one  
of our Key Performance 
Indicators. Any variance to 
budget is carefully investigated to 
identify why customer behaviour 
is changing and to implement 
corrective action. 
We have a wide range of tools 
available to manage retention 
rates including specific retention 
propositions.
There are also dedicated retention 
call centre agents who are trained 
and experienced in talking to 
customers who are considering 
not renewing their policy.
Retention remains high in all  
our countries.
In the UK, the rate has fallen to 
79% compared to 80% in the 
previous year. The rate has been 
increasing during the second half 
of the year as the number of first 
year renewing customers reduced 
and we implemented a number 
of new retention tools for our call 
centre agents. The new product 
propositions that we have been 
testing in the UK should also 
contribute to an improved retention 
rate in future years. 
We remain confident that the  
UK retention rate can increase to 
over 80%.
In the USA, the rate has increased 
from 79% to 80%.
In France, Doméo has increased its 
retention rate from 88% to 89%.

 32 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Risk – Description/Impact Mitigation Change since 2012 Annual Report
Marketing effectiveness
A significant reduction in the 
response rates on direct marketing 
or telesales campaigns could have 
a significant impact on customer 
and policy numbers.
The performance of each 
marketing campaign and channel 
is regularly reviewed, with any 
significant deviation to the 
expected response rate quickly 
identified and remedial action 
taken for subsequent campaigns.
We are continuing to test different 
product and pricing propositions in 
our direct mail marketing in the UK. 
In the UK, we are planning to develop 
the internet channel and sales 
through our partner call centres to 
reduce our reliance on direct mail.
In the USA and Spain, we continue 
to see strong customer growth with 
good results from our direct mail 
marketing in the USA and telesales 
activity in Spain.
Exposure to legislation or 
regulatory requirements
We are subject to a broad spectrum 
of regulatory requirements in each 
of the markets in which we operate, 
particularly relating to product 
design, marketing materials, sales 
processes and data protection. 
Failure to comply with the 
regulatory requirements in any 
of our countries could result 
in us having to suspend, either 
temporarily or permanently,  
certain activities. 
In addition, legislative changes 
related to our partners may change 
their obligations with regard to 
the infrastructure they currently 
manage and hence the products 
and services we can offer to 
customers. It is possible such 
legislative changes could reduce, or 
even remove, the need for certain  
of our products and services.
We have regulatory specialists 
and compliance teams within 
each of our businesses to help 
ensure that all aspects of the 
legislative regime in each territory 
are fully understood and adopted 
as required. 
Specifically in the UK, we are 
maintaining a regular dialogue 
with the FCA, ensuring our actions 
are in line with their feedback.
We keep up to date with changes 
in government and regulatory 
policy, which ensures that our 
products and services are 
designed, marketed and sold in 
accordance with all relevant legal 
and regulatory requirements and 
that their terms and conditions 
remain appropriate and meet the 
customer need.
During FY2013 we have 
strengthened our regulatory and 
compliance teams across all our 
businesses.
In the UK, we have completed the 
implementation of the majority 
of our business improvement 
initiatives which were in line with  
the feedback from our FCA 
supervisory team.
The FCA investigation into our 
historic UK issues is ongoing and 
is expected to take a number of 
months to complete. 
In the USA, we have been proactively 
working with local attorney generals 
and media commentators to ensure 
they understand the service offered 
by HomeServe and to minimise 
the risk of any negative media 
commentary when we launch ‘own 
brand’ campaigns into new states.
Financial cost of customer  
re-contact exercises
The cost of re-contacting 
customers and the possible 
compensation that may be paid  
to them if any detriment is 
identified, have been based on 
our estimates. It is possible that 
the actual number of customers, 
response rates and level of 
compensation could be different.
Our original provision has to 
date been sufficient to cover 
the cost of these exercises. Our 
assumptions for the remainder 
of the exercise remain in line with 
our expectations.
The UK business is a cash 
generative, profitable business 
which, if necessary, could set 
aside additional funds to meet 
higher costs.
During FY2013 we began to 
re-contact all customers whose 
complaints may not have been 
appropriately managed during the 
winter of 2010 and to roll out the 
process for re-contacting customers 
who may have suffered detriment 
as a result of the way in which they 
were sold their policy.
At 31 March 2013 we have £11.5m 
of the original provision remaining 
which we believe will be sufficient to 
cover the remaining costs. 
Principal risks and uncertainties
 Business review
33 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Risk – Description/Impact Mitigation Change since 2012 Annual Report
Availability of underwriters
The policies that we market and 
administer with customers are each 
individually underwritten by third 
party underwriters, independent of 
HomeServe. 
We act as an insurance 
intermediary and do not take on 
any material insurance risk.
If these underwriters were unable/
unwilling to underwrite these risks 
it would require us to insure these 
risks directly, thereby exposing the 
business to material insurance risk, 
which is contrary to our preferred 
operating model.
We use a number of underwriters, 
with the main provider in the UK 
being separate to those in the rest 
of Europe and the USA.
We have regular contact 
and reviews with the senior 
management of the underwriters 
to ensure that claims frequencies, 
repair costs and service 
standards are in line with their 
expectations. 
The principal underwriters 
are subject to medium-term 
agreements, with the rates 
subject to regular review.
In addition, we maintain 
relationships with a number 
of underwriters and regularly 
review the market to ensure 
we understand current market 
conditions, how these apply to our 
policies and how we can mitigate 
the loss of an existing underwriter.
We continue to review our 
underwriting relationships on a 
regular basis to ensure they provide 
the best returns for customers and 
shareholders.
Quality of customer service
Our reputation is heavily  
dependent on the quality of our 
customer service. 
Any failure to meet our service 
standards or negative media 
coverage of poor service could have 
a detrimental impact on customer 
and policy numbers.
We monitor customer service 
standards at a number of different 
customer contact points in each 
of our operations using both 
internal data and an independent 
third party company.
The results of these are reviewed 
on a regular basis and action  
plans produced to address  
the key issues. 
Processes have been established 
to ensure that all directly 
employed engineers and sub-
contractors meet minimum 
standards. These include criminal 
record checks and minimum 
qualification requirements.
In FY2013 we have implemented 
a new process for monitoring 
customer satisfaction across all our 
operations at a number of different 
customer contact points.
In the UK, our focus on improving 
customer service has been 
particularly successful with the 
number of complaints received 
reduced by 40%. 
Dependence on recruitment and 
retention of skilled personnel
Our ability to meet growth 
expectations and compete 
effectively is, in part, dependent 
on the skills, experience and 
performance of our personnel. 
The inability to attract, motivate or 
retain key talent could impact on 
our overall business performance. 
Our employment policies, 
remuneration and benefits 
packages and long-term 
incentives are regularly reviewed 
and designed to be competitive 
with other companies.
Employee surveys, performance 
reviews and regular 
communication of business 
activities are just some of the 
methods used to understand  
and respond to employees’ views 
and needs.
Processes are in place to identify 
high performing individuals and 
to ensure that they not only have 
fulfilling careers, but we are 
managing succession planning.
We have continued to strengthen 
our management teams across 
all our operations – particularly in 
the areas of compliance, project 
management and IT.
We have significantly strengthened 
the UK management team and 
board during the year including  
the appointment of a new Marketing 
Director, HR Director and  
Non-Executive Chairman.
 34 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Risk – Description/Impact Mitigation Change since 2012 Annual Report
Exposure to country and  
regional risk
As a result of our growing 
international footprint we are 
subject to increased economic, 
political and other risks associated 
with operating in overseas 
territories. 
A variety of factors, including 
changes in a specific country’s 
political, economic or regulatory 
requirements, as well as the 
potential for geographical turmoil 
including terrorism and war, could 
result in the loss of service.
The criteria for entering a new 
country include a full assessment 
of the stability of its economy and 
political situation, together with a 
review of the manner and way in 
which business is conducted.
When entering a new country, we 
generally do so on a small scale 
test basis. This low risk entry 
strategy minimises the likelihood 
of any significant loss.
During FY2013 we completed a test 
marketing campaign in Germany.
We have also signed long-term 
affinity partner deals in Italy, having 
tested marketing activity over the 
past 2 years. 
Our Spanish business continues to 
see strong growth in its customer 
and policy numbers despite the 
country having difficult economic 
conditions.
Our IT systems become a 
constraint to growth and drive 
inefficiency instead of efficiency 
improvements
The Group’s core IT system 
‘Ensura’ is used in each of our 
businesses. The system is now 
around 20 years old and has had a 
number of ‘in house’ developments. 
The system is dependent on 
internal development resource and 
knowledge.
The Group reviews its systems 
and processes on a regular basis. 
As part of these reviews it looks 
at the future plans of each of the 
businesses in terms of customer 
and policy growth, product and 
process design and development 
requirements and the potential 
impact on IT systems.
All system developments and 
enhancements undergo a 
rigorous financial review and 
the proposed benefits are 
monitored and subject to post 
implementation reviews.
Our IT developments are subject 
to a prioritisation process which 
takes into account the availability 
of both internal and external 
resource and the proposed 
benefits of the project.
During FY2013 we used external 
consultants to review our core 
operational system, ‘Ensura’. 
As a result of their 
recommendations we are planning 
to implement a new packaged IT 
system across the entire business 
over the next 3 years.
The updated system will reduce our 
reliance on in house expertise and 
will also enable us to implement new 
developments more quickly and 
more effectively than in the past.
Financial strategy and  
treasury risk
The main financial risks are  
the availability of short and  
long-term funding to meet business 
needs, the risk of suppliers  
and policyholders not paying 
monies owed and fluctuations in 
interest rates.
Interest rate risk
Our policy is to manage our 
interest cost using a mix of fixed 
and variable rate debts. Where 
necessary, this is achieved by 
entering into interest rate swaps 
for certain periods, in which we 
agree to exchange, at specified 
intervals, the difference between 
fixed and variable rate interest 
amounts calculated by reference 
to an agreed notional principal 
amount. These swaps are 
designated to hedge underlying 
debt obligations.
As a result of our relatively low level 
of bank borrowings and a stable 
interest environment we have not 
entered into any swaps during 
FY2013.
There has been no significant 
change in the level of mid-term 
policy cancellations.
Our banking facility is not due for 
renewal until FY2017. Our net debt 
at 31 March 2013 was £42.9m, 
significantly within the facility limit 
of £250m.

Risk – Description/Impact Mitigation Change since 2012 Annual Report
Financial strategy and treasury 
risk (continued)
Credit risk
The risk associated with cash 
and cash equivalents is managed 
by only depositing funds with 
reputable and creditworthy 
banking institutions.
The risk of a policyholder 
defaulting is mitigated as  
any policy cover will cease as  
and when any premium fails to 
be paid.
Liquidity risk
HomeServe manages liquidity 
risk by maintaining adequate 
reserves and banking facilities 
and continuously monitoring 
forecast and actual cash flows.
Going concern and asset impairment
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position are set out in the Chairman’s statement and Chief Executive’s 
review. This Financial review also includes the headline financial results, cash flow and financing 
information as well as details on the principal risks and uncertainties.
The Directors have reviewed the Group’s budgets, forecasts and cash flows, including reviewing a 
number of scenarios in connection with the future financial performance of the UK business, and 
have concluded that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
In addition, the Directors have considered the carrying value of goodwill and other assets in the UK 
business and have concluded that there is no impairment of these assets.

Corporate responsibility
Our corporate responsibility objectives 
support our vision and values, with our key 
focus being on the following four areas:
1. Customers
  Implement and maintain ethical, 
sustainable and responsible principles 
throughout the supply chain
  Ensure that the customer remains at the 
heart of everything we do
  Treat customers fairly throughout the 
customer experience. 
2. Employees
  Embed customer values and behaviours
  Hire, develop and retain talented people 
to ensure that our customers enjoy a 
consistently good experience 
  Provide a safe, healthy and inclusive 
environment for our people.
We aim to:
  Achieve sustainable profits 
for our shareholders
  Build enduring relationships 
with key stakeholders, 
including our customers, 
partners and the community
  Value our employees
  Respect the environment
  Use our core skills to give 
something back to our local 
communities.
We are committed to developing and implementing a successful corporate 
responsibility programme that benefits key stakeholders and utilises our  
core skills to make a sustainable difference to the communities we operate in.  
We believe that a successful business must also be a responsible business. 
 37 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Corporate responsibility
Employees
Our values and behavioural characteristics 
continue to underpin our focus on delivering 
consistently good customer service and are 
embedded in our recruitment, selection, 
development and reward arrangements. 
Using our behavioural characteristics 
effectively has ensured that individuals hired 
or promoted possess the right attitude and 
core behaviours, as well as the necessary 
commercial and technical skills. We continue 
to review both performance and potential 
against the characteristics as a key part 
of our annual performance management, 
career development and succession  
planning processes.
Our Group Leadership Development 
Programme, delivered in conjunction with 
Cranfield University, has run throughout the 
year and received strong endorsements from 
both participants and senior management. 
In addition, our operating businesses have 
continued to provide focused management 
and customer service training and 
development to colleagues, supporting 
the delivery of consistently good customer 
service across the Group.
We attach considerable importance to 
ensuring that all our employees benefit  
from effective communications and 
engagement, using regular business  
updates, senior management lunches 
and “surgeries”, question and answer 
opportunities and constructive relationships 
with employee representatives. A group-wide 
employee survey is run each year, with results 
reported to the Board and action plans 
devised and implemented locally. Employees 
are actively involved in the creation and 
delivery of these plans. 
3. Community
  Use our core skills to give something 
back to the community
  Support more vulnerable members  
of the community by helping them in 
their homes
  Develop partnerships with charitable 
and other organisations which are 
closely aligned to our business activities 
and therefore maximise our contribution
  Support and encourage employee 
involvement in charitable giving and 
volunteering, using relevant employee 
skills to support the community.
4. Environment
  Reduce our carbon emissions  
per employee
  Use resources efficiently
  Support and educate customers 
and employees to reduce emissions, 
specifically in their homes.
These corporate responsibility principles are 
part of the way we operate on a daily basis 
and reflect in the way we deal with customers, 
employees, partners and the community. 
Customers
In 2012, our UK business introduced a 
Customer Charter which outlined our 
commitment to our customers; we’ll 
make things easy for customers and treat 
customers fairly, every step of the way.  
The charter has been committed to by all of 
our colleagues, from the management team 
to our front line. Similar charters are now 
being developed in our other established 
businesses. 
 38 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
 
Charity 
In September 2012, our UK business reached 
its target of donating £1 million to its national 
charity partner, Marie Curie Cancer Care.  
The three year target was reached six  
months early, an incredible achievement.  
The partnership has been extended for 
another year, until March 2014. 
To date £1,268,000 has been raised in 
total. £475,000 has been raised through 
employee fundraising, business donations 
and sponsorship of Walk Ten. We have also 
provided free home emergency cover to 
Marie Curie patients, to provide practical 
support at home (from fixing a boiler to 
unblocking a toilet) through our network of 
engineers. This cover, along with other gift in 
kind activities has raised a further £793,000.
Since reaching the fundraising milestone, 
employees have been encouraged to visit 
Marie Curie hospices to see for themselves 
the genuine difference their fundraising  
has made.
It is our policy that all persons should be 
considered for employment, training, career 
development and promotion on the basis 
of their abilities and aptitudes, regardless 
of physical ability, age, gender, sexual 
orientation, religion or ethnic origin. 
We apply employment policies that are fair 
and equitable for all employees and these 
ensure that entry into, and progression 
within, the Group are determined solely by 
the fair application of relevant job criteria and 
by personal ability and competence.
Full and fair consideration (having regard to 
the person’s particular aptitudes and abilities) 
is given to applications for employment and 
the career development of disabled persons. 
Our training and development policies also 
make it clear that we will take all practicable 
steps to ensure that if an employee becomes 
disabled during the time they are employed, 
their employment can continue.
Noddy Holder helps 
celebrate raising £1m
  Slade legend Noddy Holder made 
a welcome appearance in Walsall 
to help us celebrate raising £1m for 
Marie Curie Cancer Care. 
Noddy commented: 
        I’m delighted to be here to 
represent Marie Curie Cancer Care 
and help HomeServe celebrate such 
an incredible achievement. 
 Corporate responsibility
39 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
The partnership has been recognised by  
two prestigious industry bodies; it has been 
short-listed in the Third Sector Business 
Charity Awards in the category of  
‘Employee Engagement’ and the Institute 
of Fundraising has nominated it for ‘Best 
Business Charity Partnership’. 
In March 2013, our UK business also 
supported the Comic Relief media appeal 
for the ninth consecutive year by taking calls 
in our Walsall call centre. 250 volunteers 
answered over 4,000 donation calls while 
the live show was broadcast by the BBC 
and £130,000 was raised to help vulnerable 
people in the UK and in Africa. 
In the USA, we have continued to work 
with Habitat for Humanity which seeks to 
eliminate poverty housing and homelessness 
by building houses in partnership with 
families in need. In addition, a Hurricane 
Sandy Relief Fund was established using 
social media sites and employees also raised 
$10,000 for colleagues who had sustained 
significant damage to their homes as a result 
of the hurricane.
In France and Spain, we have continued to 
support local charities both by fund raising 
and volunteering. Activities have included 
cooking Christmas lunch for disadvantaged 
people, painting walls in a school for disabled 
children and toy and food collections.
Health & Safety
We are committed to health and safety 
excellence through a process of continual 
health and safety improvement for all 
employees, contractors and the communities 
in which we operate. We actively focus on 
providing a safe working environment for our 
office and mobile workforces. We recognise 
that everyone must play their part in the 
achievement of health and safety excellence 
and we promote and support staff in their 
efforts to achieve zero work related injuries 
and illnesses.
Risks
We have a variety of physical and 
psychological health and safety risks to 
manage. All our businesses have suitable and 
proportionate health and safety management 
systems, reflecting the risks within each 
particular business. 
Our services are often delivered via 
partnerships with contractors, franchisees 
and other suppliers. We work with these 
partners to ensure that our health and  
safety expectations are understood and  
met, and that the work they undertake on  
our behalf is managed as safely as is 
reasonably practicable.
 40 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
In France, Doméo and SFG received 
favourable reports from the three 
Government Inspectors (the Medecins 
du Travail) who are statutorily obligated 
to visit each business multiple times each 
year. Each business also invites the relevant 
inspector to their joint management and 
consultative committee meetings. French 
performance is strong; particularly as they 
have to record employee accidents that occur 
from the minute they step out of their homes 
(commuting to/from their place of work is 
considered a work activity) and report all 
accidents to the safety regulator.
The German and Italian businesses continue 
to be accident free.
Accidents/incidents 
Reporting of accidents and incidents has 
continued to improve allowing us to monitor 
trends, anticipate issues and cascade 
knowledge across the Group. 
 2013 2012 2011
  No of accidents 141 148 144
  Accident incidence rate 3,471 3,496 3,531
The accident incidence rate is the number of accidents divided by the 
number of employees, multiplied by 100,000.
There have been no prosecutions or other 
enforcement actions taken in respect of our 
businesses by any of the national health and 
safety regulators for breaches of health and 
safety laws.  
Environment
We take our environmental responsibilities 
seriously and recognise that sustainable and 
responsible performance is important to the 
future growth of our business. 
Performance
During the year, we strengthened our health 
and safety performance across the Group. 
There has been a reduction in the number 
of accidents reported and there were no 
regulatory interventions following accidents 
anywhere in the Group. Martin Bennett, Chief 
Operating Officer, continues to be the Board 
Champion for health and safety.
We have redeveloped our Group Health 
& Safety Policy Statement to provide 10 
key guiding principles to underpin our 
arrangements. 
In the UK, our employed network was 
successful in achieving RoSPA’s Gold 
Award for occupational health and safety 
performance for the third year running.  
This prestigious award follows a rigorous  
self-assessment and submission of a 
portfolio of evidence against the judging 
criteria. This third Gold Award follows a 
previous Silver Award.
Our US business has a firmly embedded 
health and safety management structure with 
consultative committees providing oversight 
of the delivery of their health and safety 
improvement plan. The plan has progressed 
in the face of a very challenging winter and 
serious adverse weather events in the North 
East with Hurricane Sandy. With a strong 
focus on incident reduction, a comprehensive 
driver safety scheme was successfully 
introduced.
Reparalia in Spain continues to utilise 
specialist third party auditors to undertake 
inspections and make recommendations to 
local management in respect of health and 
safety improvements.
 Corporate responsibility
41 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Performance
During the year we strengthened our 
environmental performance and there  
were no regulatory interventions anywhere  
in the Group. 
We have launched a Group Environmental 
Policy Statement to provide 10 key guiding 
principles for all of our businesses. We have 
audited direct and indirect greenhouse gas 
emissions in preparation for formal reporting 
in the UK from FY2014.
In the UK, our employed network continues to 
monitor MPG and aspects of driver behaviour 
through telematics in each vehicle. A car 
share scheme was successfully launched 
in our Walsall head office and to reduce our 
energy consumption further, LED lighting is 
under live trial in one of the call centres.
Our US business has established a project 
team to drive forward third party Energy 
Star accreditation. Energy Star is a voluntary 
programme that helps businesses and 
individuals save money and protect the 
climate through superior energy efficiency.
In France, an innovative recycling programme 
has been launched for office paper. Working 
in conjunction with ‘La Poste’, the national 
mail carrier, waste paper is collected by 
postal workers when they deliver the mail 
(reducing empty vehicle journeys) and is 
sorted by offenders as part of a community 
service scheme.
Throughout the year we have given our 
customers tips and hints on how they can 
reduce costs whilst reducing their impact on 
the environment. 
UK waste reduction
We have reduced the volumes of general 
waste leaving our UK sites, reducing the 
amount of waste that ends up in landfill:
 2013 2012 2011
  UK recycling rate 95% 94% 83%

 44 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Directors’ report
The Directors have pleasure in presenting their Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended  
31 March 2013.
Principal activities
During the year the Group was engaged in the provision of home emergency repairs. Details of the 
Group’s activities and a review of the business including the key performance indicators used to 
manage it are set out in the Chairman’s statement, Chief Executive’s review and Financial review.
A description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group is included in the Financial 
review. Information relating to the environment and employees is included in the Corporate 
responsibility report. 
Financial results and dividends
The Group’s results are shown in the Group income statement. The Directors are recommending 
the payment on 1 August 2013 of a final dividend of 7.67p per ordinary share to shareholders on 
the register at the close of business on 5 July 2013 which, together with the net interim dividend 
of 3.63p per ordinary share paid on 3 January 2013, results in a total net dividend for the year 
of 11.3p per share (2012: 11.3p). For further details of the dividend see note 12 to the financial 
statements.
Capital structure
The Companies Act 2006 abolished the requirement for a company to have an authorised share 
capital and the Articles of Association as approved and adopted at the AGM in 2010 reflect this. 
Details of the issued share capital, together with details of shares issued during the year, are set 
out in note 25. There is one class of ordinary shares which carries no right to fixed income. Each 
share carries the right to one vote at a general meeting of the Company.
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding nor on the transfer of shares, which are 
both governed by the general provisions of the Articles of Association and prevailing legislation. 
The Directors are not aware of any agreements between holders of the Company’s shares that 
may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights.
Details of employee share schemes are set out in note 36. No votes are cast in respect of the 
shares held in the Employee Benefit Trust and dividends are waived.
No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s share capital and all issued shares 
are fully paid. Subject to the Companies Act 2006 and any relevant authority of the Company in 
general meeting, the Company has authority to issue new shares.
The AGM held in 2012 authorised the Directors to allot shares in the capital of the Company within 
certain limited circumstances and as permitted by the Companies Act. A renewal of this authority 
will be proposed at the 2013 AGM. 
 45 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Governance
Authority to purchase shares
The Company was authorised at the 2012 AGM to purchase its own shares, within certain limits 
and as permitted by the Articles of Association. A renewal of this authority will be proposed at the 
2013 AGM. No shares were purchased during the year and no shares are held in Treasury.
Significant agreements – change of control
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of 
control of the Company such as commercial contracts, bank loan agreements, property lease 
arrangements and employees’ share plans. None of these are considered to be significant in 
terms of their likely impact on the business of the Group as a whole. Furthermore, the Directors 
are not aware of any agreements between the Company and its Directors and employees that 
provide for compensation for loss of office or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid.
Annual General Meeting
The 2013 Annual General Meeting of the Company is to be held on 26 July 2013. The notice of the 
meeting accompanies this report.
Disclosure of information to auditor
Each of the Directors confirms that:
• so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s 
auditor is unaware; and
• the Director has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have taken as a director in order 
to make himself or herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of  
s418 of the Companies Act 2006.
A resolution proposing the reappointment of Deloitte LLP as auditor and authorising the Board  
to fix their remuneration will be put to the Annual General Meeting.
Fixed assets
Capital expenditure on tangible fixed assets amounted to £6.2m (2012: £5.3m) during the year.
Donations
Charitable donations of £126,000 (2012: £70,000) were made during the year. No political 
contributions were made in either year. Further details of the Company’s charitable activities are 
available in the Corporate responsibility report.
Payment of creditors
The Group’s policy is to pay suppliers in line with the terms of payment agreed with each of them 
when contracting for their products or services. Trade creditors at 31 March 2013 represented  
61 days of purchases during the year (2012: 39) for the Group and 20 for the Company (2012: 28).

Corporate governance
The Board believes that good corporate governance underpins good business performance.  
This report explains how the Board applied the principles of the 2010 UK Corporate Governance 
Code (‘the Code’). Commentary on the Code’s principles relating to remuneration matters is

the Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s review and the Financial review.
HomeServe complied with the provisions set out in the Code throughout the year.
The Board
The powers of the Directors are set out in the Company’s Articles of Association which are 
available on request. The Articles of Association may be changed by special resolution. The 
Directors also have responsibilities and duties under other legislation and in particular, the

Corporate governance
The Board is led by the Chairman, Barry Gibson. The Chairman’s responsibilities are clearly 
defined in a written specification agreed by the Board and which make clear the division of 
responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief Executive. They include the smooth running 
of the Board, effective communication between Executive and Non-Executive Directors and the 
general progress and long-term development of the Group. 
During the year, in addition to the Chairman, four independent Non-Executive Directors (Messrs 
Chippendale, Mingay and Morris and Mrs David) with extensive business, finance and marketing 
backgrounds, provided the Board with a breadth of experience and with independent judgement. 
Ian Chippendale served as the Company’s independent Senior Non-Executive Director. 
In accordance with the provisions of the Code, each Director is subject to election by the 
Company’s shareholders at the Annual General Meeting immediately following his appointment 
and is subject to re-election every year thereafter.
Short biographies of each of the Directors including their membership of committees can be 
found on page 42.
The beneficial interests of the Directors in the shares of the Company and the options held as at 
31 March 2013 and 21 May 2013 are set out in the Remuneration report. None of the Directors 
serving at the year end had a beneficial interest in the share capital of any subsidiary company.
Succession planning
A succession planning process has been established across the Group. Each business and 
corporate function prepares and maintains succession plans with the support of local and Group 
HR. The Executive Committee reviews the plans in detail twice a year and the Board reviews the 
high level plan at least annually. There is a clear need to ensure that there is an appropriate pool 
of talented and capable individuals to fill senior roles and the identification and development of 
this group remains a key focus.
Diversity
Although no target has been set in respect of the percentage of women on the Board, we are 
committed to ensuring that the Board has relevant experience and appropriate diversity. When 
seeking to recruit for Board positions we ensure that ‘long lists’ include women candidates and in 
respect of non-executive positions we ensure that candidates from a wider pool are considered, 
including those with little or no listed company board experience.

Board meetings
Up to ten regular meetings are held each year to review and monitor current and forecast 
performance. Regular reports on monthly performance and other matters of importance to the 
Group ensure that the Board is supplied in a timely manner with the information necessary to 
make informed judgements. In addition, the Board has an annual strategy meeting, also attended 
by senior operational management, to devise and discuss the Company’s medium and long-term 
strategic focus and management development strategy. 
Regular formal and informal presentations are given and meetings held in order to inform 
Directors of issues of importance affecting the Group. Occasionally, meetings of the Board are 
held at the Company’s operating sites other than Walsall, in order to afford the Board, particularly 
the Non-Executive Directors, with the opportunity to meet with local management.
Attendance at meetings
All Directors are expected to attend all Board and relevant committee meetings. Details of 
attendance by Directors at meetings during the year are set out in the table below. Directors 
who were unable to attend specific meetings reviewed the relevant papers and provided their 
comments to the Chairman of the Board or Committee. Any Director who misses a meeting will, 
as a matter of course, receive the minutes of that meeting for reference.

Board development
The Board actively encourages all Directors to deepen their knowledge of their roles and 
responsibilities and to gain a clear understanding of the Group and the environment in which 
it operates and has adopted a formal policy on the induction and training of Directors. Newly 
appointed Board members are required to undergo an induction programme, which includes 
obtaining a thorough understanding of the Group’s various operations, and they have the 
opportunity to receive formal training from external providers if they wish. During the year, the 
Non-Executive Directors have met with various members of the Group’s management teams and 
external advisers and Johnathan Ford undertook an induction programme.
Board evaluation
The Board has implemented a formal process for reviewing its own effectiveness, that of its 
Remuneration and Audit & Risk committees and its individual members. In addition, it continued 
to ensure that regular meetings of the Non-Executive Directors were held without the Executive 
Directors, and at least once a year, without the Chairman present, in order to evaluate his 
performance. 
An external Board evaluation process was completed during 2011/12 by Lintstock Limited. 
Directors completed evaluation questionnaires and these were followed up by individual 
interviews with Lintstock who then compiled a formal written report summarising the Directors’ 
views and containing recommendations to further improve the effectiveness of the Board. 
Lintstock presented this report to the Board in February 2012. 
During 2012/13 Directors again completed evaluation questionnaires and these were used  
by Lintstock to compile a further report which was considered by the Board in February 2013.  
The Board concluded that it was operating effectively, although a number of recommendations 
for further improvement were approved. 
Committees
The Board operates a number of committees to which it has delegated certain specific 
responsibilities, each of which has formally adopted terms of reference. These comprise the 
Nomination, Audit & Risk and Remuneration Committees. The terms of reference of each of 
the Board’s committees are available on request from the Company Secretary and are on the 
Company’s website. The membership and activities of the Remuneration Committee are detailed 
in the Remuneration report.

internal control systems
• agree audit strategy
• monitor the scope and results of the annual audit 
• review the independence and objectivity of its auditors

confidence, about possible wrongdoing in financial reporting or other matters.
The Audit & Risk Committee is chaired by Mark Morris who has recent and relevant financial 
experience. He worked in audit, business advisory and corporate finance before becoming a plc 
finance director. 
The internal and external auditors, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Executive Officer and 
the Chairman are invited but are not entitled to attend all meetings. Where appropriate, other 
Executive Directors also attend meetings at the Chairman’s invitation. The external and internal 
auditors are provided with the opportunity to raise any matters or concerns that they may have, 
in the absence of the Executive Directors, whether at Committee meetings or, more informally, 
outside of them.
 53 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Governance
During the year and following the issues identified in the UK in 2011, the decision was taken to 
extend the remit of the Committee to include risk. The name of the Committee was changed to 
the Audit & Risk Committee and the terms of reference were amended to reflect the extended 
scope of the Committee’s activities. 
Specifically, the following duties were added:
• advising the Board on the Group’s overall risk appetite, tolerance and strategy, taking account 
of the current and prospective macroeconomic and financial environment
• advising the Board on the current risk exposures and future risk strategy of the Group and its 
material subsidiary undertakings
• reviewing and approving the means by which the Group and its regulated subsidiary 
undertakings seek to comply with their respective regulatory obligations and periodically 
reviewing the effectiveness of the regulatory compliance policies of the Company.
The Committee receives regular reports from the Group Director of Risk, the Non-Executive Chair 
of the UK business’s Risk Committee and those responsible for risk and compliance matters 
across the Group. 
During the year, the Committee reviewed the Group’s risk appetite and a revised statement and 
supporting policy was recommended to the Board for approval. 
The Committee has implemented a policy relating to the use of the external auditors for non-audit 
services and monitors fees paid in respect of such services. This policy provides that the total 
fees payable to the auditor for non-audit related work in any financial year should not normally be 
more than 100% of the total fees payable in respect of audit and compliance services. In addition, 
any proposed spend over a predetermined limit must be approved by the Committee. 
The fees payable to the auditor for non-audit related work (excluding compliance services) 
totalled £193,000 and the fees payable in respect of audit and compliance services totalled 
£282,000. Further detail on the fees paid is provided in Note 7. 
In accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK & Ireland) 260 and Ethical Statement 
1 issued by the Accounting Practices Board, and as a matter of best practice, the external auditor 
has confirmed its independence as auditor of the Company, in a letter addressed to the Directors.
The Committee has also agreed and implemented a procedure for reviewing and assessing its 
own effectiveness and that of the internal and external audit process. The Committee reviews 
the performance of the external auditor annually. Having reviewed the performance and 
independence of the external auditor, the Committee has recommended that Deloitte LLP be 
proposed for reappointment at the AGM.

Corporate governance
Executive Committee
The day to day running of the business is delegated to an Executive Committee which is led by 
Richard Harpin. Other members of the Executive Committee are Martin Bennett, Johnathan Ford, 
Jonathan King, Rachael Hughes, Chief Executive of HomeServe Europe and Tom Rusin, Chief 
Executive of HomeServe USA. The Committee has adopted formal terms of reference.
Risk Committee
A Risk Committee, comprising the Executive Directors and other representatives of each 
business, operates across the Group and is chaired by Johnathan Ford. Its terms of reference 
have been approved by the Board and its purpose is to advise the Audit & Risk Committee 
in respect of the Group’s risk appetite, to evaluate the risk registers compiled by each of its 
businesses, to monitor the effectiveness of action plans for the mitigation of those risks, and 
to report thereon to the Audit & Risk Committee and thereafter to the Board, which retains 
responsibility for the overall evaluation of the Group’s risk management processes.
Directors’ indemnities and insurance
The Company has made qualifying third party indemnity provisions for the benefit of its Directors 
which were in place during the year and remain in force at the date of this report. The Company 
maintains directors’ and officers’ liability insurance for its Directors and officers.
Advice for Directors
The Board has established a formal procedure for Directors wishing to seek independent legal 
and other professional advice and all members of the Board have access to the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary.
Relationships with shareholders
The Board, on the Company’s behalf, recognises the need to maintain an active dialogue with its 
shareholders. The Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer meet regularly with institutional 
investors and analysts to discuss the Company’s performance and all shareholders have access 
to the Chairman and independent Senior Non-Executive Director, who are available to discuss any 
questions which they may have in relation to the running of the Company and who met with the 
top three shareholders during the year.
The Board encourages shareholders to attend the Annual General Meeting and is always willing 
to answer questions, either in the meeting itself or, more informally, afterwards. In addition, 
shareholders may contact HomeServe direct, either through the website or by telephone.
The Board recognises the need to ensure that all Directors are fully aware of the views of 
major shareholders. Copies of all analysts’ research relating to the Company are circulated 
to Directors upon publication. The Board receives a monthly Investor Relations report which 
includes an analysis of the Company’s shareholder register as well as any feedback received from 
shareholders and analysts.
 55 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Governance
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position are set out in the Chairman’s statement and the Chief Executive’s 
review. Principal risks and uncertainties are detailed in the Financial review. In addition, the 
Financial review includes, amongst other things, cash flow and financing information.
The Directors confirm that, after reviewing the Group’s budget and projected cash flows, they 
have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the accounts.
Internal controls
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its 
effectiveness. The Board has delegated the day to day management of the Company to the Group 
Chief Executive and the other Executive Directors. The system of internal control is designed to 
manage and mitigate rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and 
can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The issues identified in the UK business in 2011/12 indicated that there had been a breakdown 
in certain internal controls which gave rise to exceptional expenditure. As reported last year, the 
Board commissioned a thorough review of the issues which was led by the Group Chief Executive 
and the Group Assurance Director. The Board considered the outcome of this review and agreed a 
number of specific actions. In addition to the general internal review, a number of specific reviews 
of the UK business were undertaken by external advisers. A business improvement programme 
was established in 2011/12 consisting of a number of focused workstreams. These workstreams 
were largely completed during 2012/13.
The Board remains committed to ensuring that the Company learns from the experiences in the 
UK business and has sought to ensure that the learnings are shared and policies and procedures 
strengthened across all territories. A review of regulatory compliance outside the UK has 
commenced and it is expected that action plans to address any issues identified will be developed 
and delivered during 2013/14.
 56 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Corporate governance
The Board confirms that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the 
risks faced by the Company. This has been in place for the year under review and up to the date 
of approval of this Annual Report and Accounts. The process is regularly reviewed by the Board 
and accords with the Turnbull Guidance. The key elements of the control framework and review 
processes in place across the Group are as follows:
• The Group’s strategy is set by the Board and three year business plans, annual budgets and 
investment proposals for each business are formally prepared, reviewed and approved by  
the Board.
• The Group’s management operates a formal process for identifying, managing and reporting 
on operational and financial risks faced by each of the Group’s businesses. Risks are reviewed 
in detail at local risk committees and, on an overall basis, by the Risk Committee and the Audit 
& Risk Committee. 
• The Risk Committee meets quarterly and reviews a register summarising the significant risks 
faced by the businesses or the Group as a whole, the likelihood of those risks occurring and 
the steps being taken to minimise or otherwise manage those risks. Quarterly updates are 
provided to the Audit & Risk Committee and the Board.
• The Audit & Risk Committee meets four times a year and reviews the risk register in order to 
advise the Board on current risk exposures and future risk strategy.
• A clearly defined organisation structure is in place with clear lines of accountability and 
appropriate division of duties. The Group’s financial regulations specify authorisation limits 
for individual managers and for local Boards of management, with all material transactions 
being approved by the Board.
• Weekly telephone meetings of the Executive Committee monitor day to day performance, and 
full Executive Committee meetings are held at least eight times a year at which the Directors 
report on the progress of the companies or discipline for which they are responsible and share 
best practice. 
• Consolidated financial results, including a comparison with budgets and forecasts, are 
reported to the Board on a monthly basis, with variances being identified and understood so 
that mitigating actions can be implemented, where appropriate.
• The consolidated accounts are reviewed by the Executive Directors and verified by the 
finance team. The accounts are then considered by the Audit & Risk Committee which makes 
a recommendation in respect of their approval to the Board. The Board then reviews and 
approves the accounts prior to the announcement of the half year and annual results.
• The Group has a dedicated Internal Audit function which reports directly to the Audit & Risk 
Committee and a formal audit plan is in place to address the key risks across the Group.
• Appropriate treasury policies are in place.
• A whistle blowing policy allows employees, franchisees and sub-contractors who wish to 
raise any issues of concern relating to the Group’s activities to do so on a confidential basis by 
contacting an external hotline. 
• A mechanism exists to extend the Group’s formal risk management processes to any 
significant new business acquired or established immediately upon acquisition or start-up. 
In this way, the Board is able to confirm that the necessary process has been operated by the 
Group for the whole of the year.
 57 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Governance
As required by the Turnbull Guidance, the Board has carried out an annual assessment of the 
effectiveness of the system of internal controls. The processes applied by the Board include:
• At the end of the year, the Executive Directors compile a report identifying the key risks faced 
by the Group. This report is considered by the Audit & Risk Committee and by the Board 
before the Annual Report and Accounts is approved.
• The Group has an independent Internal Audit function which reviews the overall effectiveness 
of the risk management process for the key risks and reports independently to the Audit & 
Risk Committee.
• At each meeting, the Audit & Risk Committee reviews reports of the Executive Directors and 
the internal and external auditors on any issues identified as having a potentially substantial 
impact on the results of the Group, or areas of control weakness.
• The Audit & Risk Committee reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s system of managing 
financial risk and refers any risks it considers significant to the Board for its consideration. 
The Risk Committee meets at least quarterly to monitor these risks and to evaluate, in detail, 
risk registers compiled by the Group’s businesses.
• The Audit & Risk Committee considers the Group’s overall risk appetite, tolerance and 
strategy and provides advice to the Board.
• At least twice a year, the Audit & Risk Committee reviews the work plans and results of each of 
the internal and external auditors.
• The Audit & Risk Committee Chairman reports the outcome of all Audit & Risk Committee 
meetings to the Board, which also receives minutes of all such meetings.

 58 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
The Remuneration Committee ( the ‘Committee’) works hard to ensure that the remuneration 
policy for the Executive Directors supports the business strategy and that the level of 
remuneration received is reflective of the overall business performance and the returns received 
by shareholders. A significant proportion of the remuneration package comes from variable pay 
(>60% at target performance), with careful consideration given to the choice of performance 
metrics to ensure that the executives are not encouraged to take inappropriate risks.  
The transition to a more customer focused culture across all our businesses is reflected in the 
use of customer service metrics in the annual bonus scheme. In the UK, our focus on improving 
customer service has been particularly successful with the number of complaints received 
reduced by 40%. Bonus payments for the year ended 31st March 2013 range from 75% to 89% 
of salary (no bonuses were paid for the prior year), reflecting the significant progress made 
in improving the customer experience, the commercial performance of the business and the 
achievement of individual objectives.  
The share-based long-term incentive awards (performance and matching awards) are based 
on relative total shareholder return and, for the 2010 and 2011 awards, an earnings per share 
growth target. HomeServe’s share price underperformed the FTSE 250 during the period to June 
2012 and the 2009 awards lapsed accordingly.  The 2010 awards (due to vest in June 2013) are 
currently below the minimum vesting threshold.
The salary review date for all employees has been moved from 1 April to 1 July.  Martin Bennett 
was the only Executive Director to receive a salary increase last year reflecting his promotion.  
In setting the salary levels for the Executive Directors, the Committee is mindful of the pay and 
employment conditions for all our employees across the Group.  An increase of 2.5% has been 
agreed for 2013 which reflects the average pay increase expected to be given to HomeServe’s 
employees in the UK.
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the current policy supports the needs of the 
business, drives the right behaviours and appropriately rewards executives. Accordingly no 
changes to the remuneration policy are proposed for 2013/14.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 
(the ‘Act’) and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts 
and Reports) Regulations 2008 and has been approved by the Board and the Remuneration 
Committee. The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules and describes 
how the Board has applied the principles within the 2010 UK Corporate Governance Code (the 
‘Code’) relating to Directors’ remuneration. An advisory resolution to approve this report will 
be proposed at the Annual General Meeting. The Act requires the external auditors to report on 
certain parts of this report and to state whether, in their opinion, those parts of the report have 
been properly prepared in accordance with it. The report has therefore been divided into separate 
sections for audited and unaudited information.

Governance
The Remuneration Committee is aware of the proposed changes to the reporting and approval of 
directors’ remuneration that have been put forward by the Department for Business, Innovation 
and Skills. The proposed change will take effect for the Company from 1 April 2014. As the new 
disclosure requirements are still to be finalised at the time of drafting this report, the Committee 
has chosen not to early adopt any of the proposals. Notwithstanding this, the Committee believes 
that the Remuneration report, in its current format, provides a clear and transparent account of 
the policy for Directors’ remuneration and its application during the year under review.
Unaudited information 
Remuneration Committee Members
Ian Chippendale (Chair)
Stella David
JM Barry Gibson
Mark Morris
All of the members are independent Non-Executive Directors. The Board determined that 
the Company Chairman, Barry Gibson, should remain a member of the Committee taking 
account of the fact that he was considered to be independent on appointment and also that, as 
a former Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, his knowledge of the development of the 
remuneration policy and practices at HomeServe is invaluable. He takes no part in discussions 
relating to his own remuneration. 
Responsibilities
The primary responsibilities of the Committee are to:
• determine the Group’s overall remuneration strategy
• determine the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors and other members of the 
Executive Committee
• approve the grant and exercise of executive long-term incentive arrangements and oversee 
the operation of other share-based plans across the Group. 
In determining remuneration policy, the Committee is free to obtain such professional advice as 
it sees fit, and it periodically monitors both the policies of comparator companies and current 
market practice, in order to ensure that the packages provided are sufficient to attract and retain 
Executive Directors of the necessary quality.
The Committee aims to develop and recommend remuneration strategies that drive performance 
and reward it appropriately. In determining its policy, the Committee has paid regard to the 
principles and provisions of good governance contained in the Code. The Committee operates 
under the delegated authority of the Board and its terms of reference are available on the website. 
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is a matter for the Board. No Director is involved 
in determining his or her own remuneration. The Committee has also agreed and implemented a 
procedure for reviewing and assessing its own effectiveness.
 60 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Remuneration report
Advisers
During the year New Bridge Street (‘NBS’), a firm of independent remuneration consultants, 
served as advisers to the Committee. The Company also instructed NBS to advise it on a limited 
number of remuneration matters concerning individuals below the Executive Committee during 
the year. Other than in relation to advice on remuneration, NBS has no other connections with 
the Company. NBS is a trading name of Aon Hewitt Ltd, the ultimate parent company of which 
is Aon plc. Aon Benfield (another Aon company) provides underwriting advice and services to 
HomeServe. The Remuneration Committee is comfortable that this does not present a conflict 
of interest as Aon Benfield and NBS operate entirely independently of one another. The terms of 
engagement for NBS are available on request from the Company Secretary.
The Committee has also received assistance from Richard Harpin, Group Chief Executive, Mike 
Winstone, Group HR Director and Anna Maughan, Company Secretary, all of whom attended 
meetings of the Committee as required. No executive took part in discussions in respect of 
matters relating directly to their own remuneration. 
Remuneration policy
The Committee’s remuneration policy for the remuneration of Executive Directors and other 
senior executives is based on the following principles: 
• to provide a remuneration package that is sufficient, but no more than necessary, to attract, 
retain and motivate high calibre executives;
• to align rewards with the Group’s performance;
• to reward good performance with remuneration that is in line with that payable by broadly 
comparable businesses i.e. companies of a similar size and those with similar operating 
characteristics;
• to reward exceptional performance in such a way as to align the executives’ interests with 
those of the Company’s shareholders, with the potential to deliver above market levels of 
reward for outstanding performance.
To that end, the Committee structures executive remuneration in two distinct parts: fixed 
remuneration of basic salary, pension and benefits and variable performance-related 
remuneration in the form of a cash bonus and long-term incentive arrangements. Remuneration 
for Executive Directors is structured so that the variable pay element forms a significant portion 
of each Director’s package. 
 61 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Governance
The charts below demonstrate the balance between fixed and variable pay at ‘on-target’ and 
maximum performance levels under the normal remuneration policy for the Executive Directors. 
In the case of the long-term incentive arrangements, the charts assume certain levels of share 
price growth. Maximum performance assumes the achievement of maximum bonus and full 
vesting of shares under the Company’s long-term incentive arrangements.
They demonstrate the significant weighting of the package towards variable (performance-
related) pay. In particular, the majority of Executive Directors’ total remuneration at the maximum 
performance level will derive from the Company’s long-term incentive arrangements, which are 
strongly aligned to shareholder value creation.
On-target remuneration Maximum remuneration
Fixed pay Short-term variable pay Long-term variable pay
42%
38%
20%
21%
62%
17%
The Committee is satisfied that neither the structure of the remuneration packages, with the 
high weighting on variable pay, nor the performance measures targeted under the annual bonus 
and long-term incentive arrangements, encourage inappropriate risk taking. The remuneration 
arrangements are designed so as to provide a strong alignment of interest between the 
executives and shareholders and to support the growth and performance aspirations of the 
Company and the Committee is satisfied that the current arrangements meet these objectives. 
Furthermore, a claw-back provision to annual bonuses and long-term incentive awards was 
introduced in 2011 which helps to further guard against excessive risk-taking. 
The Committee has the discretion to take into account performance on environmental, social and 
governance matters when setting the remuneration of the Executive Directors. As detailed later 
in this report, a customer satisfaction related element was added to the bonus arrangements for 
2012/13. However, the Committee has chosen not to take any other matters into specific account 
in setting performance targets in the belief that the structures in place neither encourage nor 
reward inappropriate behaviour and that relevant operational controls relating to such matters 
are in place.

The maximum potential quantum is 100% 
of salary and is set so as to incentivise 
stretch performance and provide a 
competitive level of reward if all the targets 
are achieved. 
For 2012/13, bonus payments were 
determined according to performance in 
respect of commercial (40%), customer 
(40%) and personal targets (20%). This 
policy is to be maintained in 2013/14.
Bonuses are payable in cash but may be 
deferred into shares under the matching 
element of the LTIP .
Long-term 
incentives
To drive long-term 
delivery of the Group’s 
objectives, to align 
Directors’ interests with 
those of the Company’s 
shareholders and to 
encourage exceptional 
performance.
Three years Awards of performance and matching 
shares are granted under the LTIP . Both 
award types are subject to the same 
performance conditions. 
The maximum limit is 200% of salary for 
performance share awards (the normal 
policy limit is 150% of salary) and a 
maximum 2:1 match on investment of up to 
75% of bonus earned.
Awards granted under the LTIP in June 
2012 are subject to a relative TSR 
performance condition and satisfactory 
underlying earnings performance. This will 
also apply in 2013.
Pension To provide benefits 
comparable with 
similar roles in similar 
companies.
N/A Richard Harpin and Jonathan King 
participate in the Water Companies 
Pension Scheme (a defined benefit scheme 
which is closed to new members). The 
other Executive Directors receive a 20% 
contribution to the HomeServe Money Plan 
(a defined contribution scheme). 
Retirement benefits under both schemes 
are restricted by a notional earnings cap 
(£127,628 for 2012/13). An unapproved 
pension contribution equal to 20% of the 
amount by which basic salary exceeds the 
notional cap is paid annually. 
Other

Remuneration for Executive Directors
The main components of the remuneration package for Executive Directors are:
Basic salary
Basic salary for each Executive Director is determined by the Remuneration Committee taking 
into account the roles, responsibilities, performance and experience of the individual. Salary 
levels are determined taking into account pay and employment conditions of employees 
elsewhere in the Company and market data on salary levels for similar positions at comparable 
companies in the FTSE 250.  
Historically, salaries were reviewed annually in April (unless responsibilities changed)  but the 
decision has been taken to move the review date to July to allow performance development 
reviews to be completed and the results to be taken into account when determining any salary 
increases.  As a transitional measure, in 2013 any increase will be retrospectively applied to salary 
earned from 1 April 2013.  
No salary increases were awarded to the Executive Directors in April 2012.  
Martin Bennett was appointed to the new role of Group Chief Operating Officer (from the role of 
CFO) in January 2012.  Given the difficulties facing the business and the newness of the role, the 
Remuneration Committee felt that it was not appropriate to review his salary at that time.   
In November 2012, by which time Martin Bennett was established in the COO role and performing 
well, the Committee agreed to review his salary.  It was agreed that in light of the change in scope 
of his position, his personal performance and criticality to the business an increase should be 
awarded.  A 13.4% increase was applied from October 2012, bringing his salary to £375,000.  
For 2013, an increase of 2.5% has been agreed in respect of Messrs Harpin, Ford and King.   
This reflects the general increase being given to HomeServe employees in the UK.
The current salaries for the Executive Directors are therefore as follows:
Name of Director
R Harpin      £535,819
M Bennett      £375,000
J Ford      £281,875
J King      £377,456

Remuneration report
Annual bonus
The annual bonus is designed to drive and reward excellent short-term operating performance of 
the Company and encourage the delivery of consistently good customer outcomes and real year-
on-year growth in profitability.  No annual bonus is paid unless a very high level of performance is 
achieved.
Executive Directors’ bonuses are paid entirely in cash, though under the Long Term Incentive Plan 
adopted in 2008, Directors have the opportunity to invest part of their net bonus in shares. If they 
choose to do this, they may be awarded a matching award which vests after three years subject to 
a comparative Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) performance condition.
2012/13
The bonus potential was 100% of salary.  As reported last year, the Remuneration Committee 
undertook a detailed review of the bonus objectives and some significant changes were 
introduced with a view to ensuring that customer outcomes were of equal importance to 
commercial outcomes.  Bonus objectives were as follows:
Customer objectives  
(40% of bonus)
Commercial objectives  
(40% of bonus)
Personal objectives 
(20% of bonus
1
)
• A reduction in customer 
complaints
• An increase in customer 
satisfaction
• Profit before tax
• Core renewable customers
• An improvement in employee 
engagement
• Up to four other stretching 
personal objectives
1 
Johnathan Ford joined part way through the year. His bonus entitlement was pro rated accordingly and a higher weighting on personal objectives 
was applied (40% of the total).
Executive Directors with a specific responsibility for a particular territory were able to earn a 
higher proportion of bonus potential based on their respective territory.  This applied to Jonathan 
King and Martin Bennett, both of whom had specific responsibility for the UK.
Stringent bonus gates were applied with the customer objectives being considered first.  If an 
agreed percentage of the customer objectives was not achieved, no bonus would be payable.  
If customer objectives were achieved, the level of profit (and therefore affordability) would be 
considered.  
Strong performance was achieved in respect of the customer objectives with customer 
complaints reducing in all territories (exceeding the stretch target set at the start of the year) and 
improvements in customer satisfaction levels, particularly in the UK and USA.  On the commercial 
objectives, the Group exceeded its target in respect of profit before tax whilst narrowly missing 
the target in respect of core renewable customers (except in the USA where the target was 
achieved).  The Committee reviewed the achievement against the personal objectives (which had 
been set for each of the Directors at the start of the year based on their area of responsibility) and 
payments for this element ranged from 80% to 90% of the maximum.  Total bonuses payable 
in respect of 2012/13 were between 75% and 89% of salary (pro-rated for Johnathan Ford who 
joined part way through the year).    
 65 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Governance
2013/14
Bonus potential will remain at 100% of salary and the bonus objectives will follow the model 
introduced in 2012/13.
Provided their personal objectives are met in full, the normal ‘on-target‘ bonus payable to 
Executive Directors in any year is expected to be in the region of 60% of their basic salary.
Long-term incentives
The Committee’s policy for the provision of long-term incentives to Executive Directors is to grant 
awards of performance shares (performance awards) and to provide them with the opportunity to 
invest their annual bonus voluntarily into a matching share arrangement (matching awards) under 
the Long-Term Incentive Plan adopted in 2008 (the ‘LTIP’). 
The maximum individual award limit under the LTIP is 200% of basic salary for performance 
awards and for matching awards of up to two shares for each share invested, based on a 
maximum investment of the net of tax equivalent of 75% of the maximum bonus potential. 
Awards under the LTIP may be satisfied through a mixture of either market purchase or new issue 
shares. To the extent new issue shares are used, the 2008 LTIP will adhere to a 5% in 10 year 
dilution limit.
2012 awards
Details of the LTIP awards granted in June 2012 are set out later in this report. As set out in last 
year’s Remuneration report, the awards are subject to a relative TSR performance condition. 
It should be noted that in relation to the matching awards, bonuses for 2011/12 were zero, so 
no bonus deferral was possible. However, as permitted under the Rules, Richard Harpin chose 
to invest the equivalent of 25% of his salary, from his own money, in shares thereby receiving a 
corresponding matching award. 
2013 awards
It is the Committee’s intention to grant performance awards in 2013 in line with the normal 
grant policy of 150% of salary. The awards will be subject to the same relative TSR performance 
condition as applied to the 2012 awards. 
Matching awards will also continue to be granted where executives choose to invest in accordance 
with the Rules. The performance condition for the matching awards will be same as for the 
performance awards.
Save As You Earn Scheme
Executive Directors may participate in the Group’s Save As you Earn Scheme (where share 
options are exercisable after three or five years at a discount of up to 20% of the market value of 
the shares at the time of grant). No performance criteria are attached to this scheme.
 66 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Remuneration report
Benefits
Non-pension benefits comprise company car, fuel allowance and medical insurance. The range 
of benefits and their value are considered to be broadly in line with those provided to executive 
directors in similar companies in the FTSE-250. 
Shareholding guidelines
It is the Board’s policy that Executive Directors and certain members of the Company’s senior 
management build up and retain a minimum shareholding in the Company. Each Executive 
Director is encouraged to hold shares of at least equal value to his annual basic salary. 
If the holding guideline has not been fulfilled at the point of exercise of any option or the vesting 
of any other long-term incentive award, the Director must retain 50% of the net proceeds in the 
Company’s shares until the holding requirement is achieved. Details of the current shareholdings 
of the Executive Directors are provided later in this report. 
Service contracts
The Committee’s policy is to offer service contracts with notice periods of one year or less 
(other than in exceptional circumstances, where longer initial notice periods may be offered on 
appointment, and then reduced to one year over time). 
All Executive Directors’ contracts of service are terminable on 12 months’ notice by either party. 
Dates of current contracts are summarised in the table below:
  
Name      Date of contract
R Harpin     18 January 2002
M Bennett     26 June 2012
J Ford     1 October 2012
J King     21 September 2011
The Company may terminate the executive’s employment by making a payment equivalent to 
one year’s remuneration (excluding bonus in the case of Messrs Bennett, Ford and King). Notice 
periods and payments are not extendable in takeover situations.

Pensions
Executive Directors currently participate in one of two pension schemes (with benefits limited 
to their notional capped salary). An unapproved pension contribution is paid in respect of basic 
salary above the cap.
The Water Companies Pension Scheme A funded, Inland Revenue approved occupational 
defined benefit scheme
Members Richard Harpin
Jonathan King
Main features • Pension at normal retirement age of one-half of 
final pensionable salary and a tax free lump sum 
of one and a half times final pensionable salary on 
completion of 40 years’ service at an accrual rate 
of 80ths plus 3/80ths cash;
• Life assurance of five times basic salary;
• Pension payable in the event of ill health; 
• Spouse’s pension on death;
• Normal retirement at age 60.
Special features Non-contributory for Richard Harpin.
The HomeServe Money Plan A funded, Inland Revenue approved occupational 
defined contribution scheme
Members Martin Bennett
Johnathan Ford
Main features • Employer contributions of 20%;
• Life assurance of five times basic salary;
• Permanent health insurance;
• Spouse’s pension on death;
• Normal retirement at age 60.
Unapproved pension provision
A notional earnings cap restricts the benefits  
provided to members of the Water Companies 
Pension Scheme and the HomeServe Money Plan. An 
unapproved pension contribution, equal to 20% of the 
amount by which basic salary exceeds the notional 
cap is paid annually. Executives may choose to have 
this amount paid directly into their pension or may 
receive it as cash. 
The notional cap is indexed in line with earnings 
inflation. For 2012/13 the notional cap was £127,628.

Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors serve under letters of appointment for periods of three years. The Non-
Executive Directors have a notice period of three months but no liquidated damages are payable. 
Their fees are determined by the Executive Directors within the limits set by the Articles of 
Association and are based on information on fees paid in similar companies and the skills and 
expected time commitment of the individual concerned. Non-Executive Directors are not entitled 
to bonus payments or pension arrangements, nor do they participate in the Company’s long-term 
incentive plans. 
Details of their current three year appointments are as follows:
Name      Date of contract
J M B Gibson     1 April 2013

S David     23 November 2010
B Mingay     1 January 2012
M Morris     27 February 2012
The fees for the Non-Executive Directors were last reviewed in January 2010 with the changes 
being effective from 1 April 2010. During the year, the base Board fee was £44,000 with a 
premium for Chairmanship of the Audit & Risk and Remuneration Committees of £8,500. Ian 
Chippendale received an additional fee of £5,000 for his role as Senior Independent Director. 
Barry Gibson received £200,000 for his role as Chairman.

¹ These awards vested on 6 August 2011 and were converted into nil cost options. The price of an ordinary share on 5 July 2012 when the options

The market price of the Company’s shares on 27 June 2012, the date the 2012 LTIP awards were 
granted was £1.509. 
The performance conditions in respect of the LTIP awards granted in 2009 and 2012 are based 
exclusively on a TSR performance condition, an EPS target was added in 2010 and 2011. 
The performance period for the TSR condition runs for three years from the date of grant and 
requires HomeServe’s TSR to match that of the FTSE 250 Index for 25% of the shares to vest, 
rising on a straight-line basis so that full vesting required out-performance of the Index by 15%  
per annum. 
Remuneration report
 75 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Governance
The performance period for the EPS condition (applicable to 50% of the 2010 and 2011 awards) is 
three financial years, starting with the year in which the award is granted. 25% of the EPS awards 
will vest for average annual EPS growth of RPI + 4%, increasing in a straight line basis to 100% 
vesting where average EPS growth is RPI + 10%. 
For the 2009 awards (which are subject to a single TSR condition), HomeServe’s TSR was 
below that of the FTSE 250 Index at the end of the performance period and the awards lapsed 
accordingly.
As at 31 March 2013, for the 2010 and 2011 HomeServe’s TSR performance was below the FTSE 
250 Index. Therefore, if 31 March 2012 were the end of their performance periods, the awards 
which are subject to TSR performance condition would lapse. For the 2012 awards, HomeServe’s 
TSR is currently tracking above that of the FTSE 250 Index. 
General
The market price of the Company’s shares at 31 March 2013 was £2.005 (2012: £2.335). During 
the year the price ranged from £1.375 to £2.525.
The shares required for share options and awards under any of the long-term incentive schemes 
described above may be fulfilled by the purchase of shares in the market by the Company’s 
employee benefit trust (EBT). As beneficiaries under the EBT, the Directors are deemed to be 
interested in the shares held by the EBT which at 31 March 2013 amounted to 5,458,335 ordinary 
shares. Shares may also be fulfilled through newly issued shares, subject to the dilution limits 
within each scheme (fully compliant with investor guidelines).

Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts, Remuneration 
report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under 
that law, the Directors are required to prepare the Group financial statements under International 
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation and have also chosen to prepare the parent Company financial statements under 
IFRS as adopted by the European Union. Under company law, the Directors must not approve 
the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of 
the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. In preparing these financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, 
reliable, comparable and understandable information; and 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are 
insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance and make an 
assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that are sufficient to show 
and explain the Company’s transactions and that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial 
information included on the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.

Group independent auditor’s report
We have audited the Group financial statements of HomeServe plc for the year ended 31 March 
2013 which comprise the Group income statement, the Group statement of comprehensive 
income, the Group balance sheet, the Group statement of changes in equity, the Group cash flow 
statement and the related notes 1 to 39. The financial reporting framework that has been applied 
in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of 
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state 
to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report 
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our 
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities statement, the Directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Group financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK 
and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the Audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In 
addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the Group financial statements: 
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2013 and of its profit 
for the year then ended; 
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; 
and 
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
 Financial statements 
79 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
• the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the Group financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
• the Directors’ statement contained within the Corporate Governance statement in relation to 
going concern; 
• the part of the Corporate Governance statement relating to the Company’s compliance with 
the nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review; and 
• certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on Directors’ remuneration. 
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the parent Company financial statements of HomeServe plc for 
the year ended 31 March 2013 and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration report that 
is described as having been audited.

Notes to financial statements
1. General information 
HomeServe plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act. The 
address of the registered office is Cable Drive, Walsall, WS2 7BN. 
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the Group operates. Foreign operations are included in 
accordance with the policies set out in note 2. 
2. Significant accounting policies 
Basis of accounting 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs, adopted by the European 
Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. 
Adoption of new or revised standards and accounting policies 
‘Improvements to IFRSs (2011)’ have been adopted in the year but their adoption has not had any 
significant impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements. 
Standards in issue but not yet effective 
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements the following Standards and 
Interpretations, which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not 
yet effective (not all of which have been endorsed by the EU): 
Amendments to IFRS1 Government Loans 
Amendments to IFRS7 Disclosures – Transfers of Financial Assets and   
 Financial Liabilities 
IFRS9 Financial Instruments  
IFRS10 Consolidated Financial Statements
IFRS11 Joint Arrangements
IFRS12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities
IFRS13 Fair Value Measurement
Amendments to IAS1 Presentation of other Items of Comprehensive Income
Amendments to IAS12 Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets 
IAS19 (revised) Employee Benefits
IAS27 (revised) Separate Financial Statements
IAS28 (revised) Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
Amendments to IAS32  Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
Improvements to IFRSs (2012) 
The implementation of IFRS9 which the Group expects to adopt for the year beginning on 1 April 
2015 will impact both the measurement and disclosures of Financial Instruments. 
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the other Standards and Interpretations listed 
above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in the future periods.
 86 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
2. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Standards in issue but not yet effective (continued)
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis and on a going concern 
basis as set out in the Corporate Governance statement.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below. 
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and 
entities controlled by the Company made up to 31 March each year. Control is achieved where the 
Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as 
to obtain benefits from its activities. 
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured 
at their fair values at the date of acquisition. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of 
during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of 
acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. 
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the 
accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group. All intra-Group transactions, 
balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The 
consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of 
exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed in exchange for control of the acquiree. 
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred. 
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting 
from a contingent consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition-date fair value. 
Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where 
they qualify as measurement period (see below) adjustments. All other subsequent changes in 
the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in 
accordance with relevant IFRSs. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified 
as equity are not recognised. 
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting 
period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items 
for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the 
measurement period (see below), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new 
information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if 
known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date. 
Y ear ended 31 March 2013
Notes to financial statements
 Financial statements 
87 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains 
complete information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and 
is subject to a maximum of one year. 
Any adjustments to contingent consideration for acquisitions made prior to 31 March 2010  
which result in an adjustment to goodwill continue to be accounted for under IFRS3 (2004)  
and IAS27 (2005).
Goodwill 
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised at cost as an asset at the date 
control is acquired (the acquisition date). Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the 
consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets 
acquired and the liabilities assumed. 
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if there is 
an indication that it may be impaired. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income 
statement and is not subsequently reversed. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash 
generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the recoverable 
amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment 
loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash 
generating unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying 
amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a 
subsequent period. 
On disposal of a subsidiary or joint venture, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the 
determination of the profit or loss on disposal. 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs has been retained at the 
previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written 
off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in 
determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal. 
Investments in joint ventures 
In the prior year, the Group’s share of results of joint ventures was included in the consolidated 
income statement using the equity method of accounting. The Group’s share of their net assets 
was included in the consolidated balance sheet, including associated goodwill. 
 88 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
2. Significant accounting policies (continued) 
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents 
amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of 
discounts, VAT, Insurance Premium Tax and other sales related taxes.
Revenue recorded by the Group includes commissions receivable in the Group’s role as an 
intermediary in the policy sale and administration process. Any third-party costs incurred on 
behalf of the principal that are rechargeable under the contractual arrangement, or where the 
Group’s role is only as an intermediary in the cash collection process, are not included in revenue. 
Consequently, on the sale of a policy, gross revenue consists of only a component of the overall 
policy price, representing the commission receivable for the marketing and sale of the policy, 
stated net of sales related taxes. 
Where a contractual arrangement consists of two or more separate arrangements that can be 
provided to customers either on a stand-alone basis or as an optional extra, revenue is recognised 
for each element as if it were an individual contract. Accordingly, revenue is recognised on the sale 
of a policy except where an obligation exists to provide future services, typically claims handling 
and policy administration services. In these situations, a proportion of revenue, sufficient to cover 
future claims handling costs and margin, is deferred over the life of the policy, as deferred income. 
The assessment of future claims handling takes account of the expected numbers of claims and 
the estimated cost of handling those claims, which are validated through experience of historical 
actual costs. 
The deferred revenue is released over the expected profile of anticipated claims over the policy 
period. The deferral also includes a profit element to recognise the performance of these services 
in the future. 
Revenue on sales of franchises is recognised when the obligations to the franchisee are complete. 
Revenue on the sale of new franchise licences is recognised upon the signing of the related 
franchise agreement. These franchise fees are non-refundable and primarily relate to initial set-up 
services. 
Repair revenue relates to repairs undertaken on behalf of underwriters subject to separate 
contractual arrangements. Such revenue is recognised on completion of the repair. 
Marketing expenses
Costs incurred in respect of marketing activity, including for example, direct mail and inbound/
outbound telephone costs, which is undertaken to acquire or renew a policy, are charged to the 
income statement in the period in which the related marketing campaign is performed.
Y ear ended 31 March 2013
Notes to financial statements
 Financial statements 
89 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Marketing expenses also include payments made to Affinity Partners in recognition of their 
support in selling and renewing policies. The terms of their support and related payments are 
included in contractual agreements with each Affinity Partner. Amounts incurred upon the sale 
and renewal of an individual policy, referred to as Affinity Partner Commissions, are recognised 
as an operating expense when individual policies incept or renew. Commissions are payable to 
Affinity Partners only when HomeServe has collected the premium due on behalf of the third 
party underwriter from the policy holder. 
Leasing 
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially  
all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as  
operating leases. 
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or,  
if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception  
of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a  
finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and 
reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining 
balance of the liability. 
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over 
the term of the relevant lease. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an 
operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange 
prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and 
liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on 
the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign 
currency are not retranslated. 
Borrowings in foreign currencies are treated as monetary liabilities and are translated at the rates 
prevailing on the balance sheet date. Exchange rate movements on foreign currency borrowings 
are recognised immediately in the income statement. Foreign currency borrowings are not 
treated as hedges of net investments.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at 
exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at 
the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly. Exchange 
movements, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. 
Such cumulative exchange movements are recognised as income or expense in the period in 
which the operation is disposed of. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as 
assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
 90 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
2. Significant accounting policies (continued) 
Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred. 
Operating profit 
Operating profit is stated after charging all operating costs and after the share of results of joint 
ventures (net of tax) but before investment income and finance costs. 
Retirement benefit costs 
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they 
fall due. 
For defined benefit retirement schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the 
projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet 
date. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. They  
are recognised outside the income statement and presented in the statement of  
comprehensive income. 
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested,  
and is otherwise amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits 
become vested. 
Any retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of 
the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by 
the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service 
cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Taxation 
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. 
Any tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. The Group’s liability for current 
tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used 
in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available 
against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments 
in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference 
and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Notes to financial statements
Y ear ended 31 March 2013
 Financial statements 
91 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced 
to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all 
or part of the asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the 
liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income 
statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the 
deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off 
current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the 
same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a 
net basis. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. 
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land, over their estimated 
useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: 
Buildings 25 - 50 years 
Furniture, fixtures and equipment  7 years 
Computer equipment 3 - 7 years 
Motor vehicles 3 years (with 25% residual value) 
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same 
basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease. 
Intangible assets
Acquisition intangible assets
Acquired access rights relate to the contractual agreements entered into with the former owners of 
businesses acquired as part of business combinations. These agreements set out the contractual 
terms of the Affinity Partnership and provide the contractual framework within which the Group 
will develop and build relationships with the individual customers of the Affinity Partner. Acquired 
access rights are recorded at fair value by using the estimated and discounted incremental future 
cash flows resulting from the relationship. Acquired access rights are amortised on a straight line 
basis over their estimated useful lives, which are in the range of 3 - 15 years.
Acquired customer databases represent the value attributable to the portfolios of renewable 
customer policies that are acquired as part of business combinations. Acquired customer 
databases are recorded at fair value using the estimated and discounted incremental future cash 
flows resulting from the portfolio of acquired policies over their estimated residual life. Acquired 
customer databases are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives, which 
are in the range of 3 - 15 years.

Other intangible assets
Access rights arise from the contractual agreements with Affinity Partners which provide the 
opportunity to develop and build relationships with the individual customers of the Affinity 
Partners. Access rights are valued at the discounted present value of the contractually 
committed payments, where such payments are not related to the success or otherwise of 
activity under the contractual agreements and are amortised on a straight-line basis over the 
length of the contractual agreement, up to a maximum of 20 years. 
Trademarks represent costs incurred to legally protect the established brand names of the 
Business. Trademarks are stated at cost and amortised on a straight line basis over their useful 
economic lives, up to a maximum of 20 years.
Computer software and the related licences are stated at cost and amortised on a straight line 
basis over their useful lives of 3 - 7 years. 
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill 
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and 
intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an 
impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated 
in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any. Where the asset does not generate 
cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount 
of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing 
value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the assets for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is estimated to be less than its 
carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately. 
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-
generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that 
the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior 
years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.

Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs comprise direct 
materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred 
in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is measured on a first-in, 
first-out (FIFO) basis. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated 
costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Provision is 
made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate.
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the 
Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are 
classified either ‘at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)’ or ‘loans and receivables’. The 
classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the 
time of initial recognition. Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities ‘at FVTPL ’ 
or ‘other financial liabilities’. 
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at amortised cost as reduced by 
appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits, and other short-term 
highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject 
to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the 
contractual arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a 
residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Borrowings 
Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are stated at amortised cost and are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including premiums payable on 
settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis using the 
effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent 
that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at amortised cost. 
Equity instruments 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct 
issue costs.
 94 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
2. Significant accounting policies (continued) 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a 
result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and 
a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognised as 
a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation 
at the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the 
obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present 
obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows. When some or all of the 
economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, 
a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received 
and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably. 
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled 
share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined 
at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis 
over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. The 
Group also provides employees with the ability to purchase the Group’s ordinary shares at a 
discount to the current market value through Save As You Earn schemes. 
The Group also issues cash-settled share-based payments to certain employees. For cash-settled 
share-based payments, a liability is recognised for the services acquired, measured initially at the 
fair value of the liability. At each balance sheet date, until the liability is settled, the fair value of the 
liability is re-measured with any changes in fair value recognised in the profit or loss for the year. 
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model or Monte Carlo simulation models 
depending on the type of scheme. 
Own shares reserve
Shares of the parent Company that are purchased by the HomeServe plc Employee Benefit Trust 
are held at cost and shown as a deduction in equity. Cost comprises consideration paid, including 
directly attributable costs. The shares are held to satisfy obligations under the share option schemes. 
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are items that are unusual because of their size, nature or incidence and 
which the Directors consider should be disclosed separately to enable a full understanding of the 
Group's results.

3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the Directors 
are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and 
associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered 
to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to 
accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision 
affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects 
both current and future periods.
Revenue recognition 
An appropriate proportion of revenue, sufficient to cover future costs and margin, is deferred to 
future periods when the Group has obligations extending to future periods. As a result, judgement 
is required in assessing the extent and associated costs of fulfilling those future obligations. 
The Group uses historical experience and forecast activity levels in determining the appropriate 
amount of revenue to recognise in the current period and how much to defer to future periods. 
An assessment is also made of any factors that are likely to materially affect the economic 
benefits which will flow to the Group such as policy cancellations. To the extent that economic 
benefits are not expected to flow to the Group, the value of that revenue is not recognised. The 
Group uses historical experience in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to recognise. 
Valuation of acquisition intangible assets 
Acquisitions may result in acquired access rights and acquired customer databases being 
recognised as intangible assets. These are valued using the excess earnings method. In applying 
this methodology certain key judgements and estimates are required to be made in respect of 
future cash flows together with an appropriate discount factor for the purpose of determining the 
present value of those cash flows. 
FCA investigation
Having taken advice and reviewed internal and external available information, the Board has 
decided to record exceptional expenditure in relation to the anticipated costs of managing the 
investigation and a fine. Whilst there remains uncertainty as to the nature or extent of the action 
that the FCA may seek to take, this represents management's best estimate.
Customer re-contact programme 
Over the past 12 months we have been addressing the issues identified in the UK, and where 
appropriate compensating customers. The expected cost of re-contacting customers and 
the extent of any compensation due is based on our experience to date and represents our 
best estimate. It is possible that our assumptions regarding the number of customers, level of 
compensation payable, response rate and the upheld rate could be different to those currently 
assumed. At this stage however, we believe that the provision is sufficient to cover the remaining 
costs of the customer re-contact exercise including customer compensation.
 96 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued)
Impairment of goodwill and acquisition intangible assets
The annual impairment assessment in respect of goodwill and acquisition intangibles requires 
estimates of the value in use (or fair value less costs to sell) of cash-generating units to which 
goodwill and acquisition intangibles have been allocated. As a result, estimates of future cash 
flows are required, together with an appropriate discount factor for the purpose of determining 
the present value of those cash flows. The carrying value of goodwill is £248.4m (2012: £260.9m). 
The carrying value of acquisition intangibles is £103.3m (2012: £111.4m). Following the annual 
impairment review, no impairment charge has been recorded against acquisition intangibles in 
either year. As set out in note 6, an impairment charge of £14.8m has been recognised in relation 
to Société Française de Garantie SA, relating to goodwill. This write down reflects the challenging 
conditions in the electrical retail market in France and lower than expected levels of new partner 
business. 
During the prior year, an impairment charge of £3.9m was recorded against goodwill relating to 
the Group’s Belgian operations which were disposed of. 
As set out in note 14, reasonably possible changes in respect of commercial outcomes 
around sales volumes, prices, margins and discount rates can impact the recoverable value. 
Management believes that it is unlikely that there will be any changes to the key assumptions in 
the forthcoming year.
4. Revenue 
An analysis of the Group’s revenue is as follows:
 2013 2012
 £m £m
Provision of services  546.5 534.7
Investment income (note 9)  0.1 0.1
  546.6 534.8
5. Business and geographical segments 
Segment revenues and results 
IFRS8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about 
components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, 
who is considered to be the Group Chief Executive, to allocate resources to the segments and to 
assess their performance. 
Segment profit/loss represents the result of each segment including allocating costs associated 
with head office and shared functions, but before allocating investment income, finance costs, 
gain on re-measurement and tax. This is the measure reported to the Group Chief Executive for 
the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance. 
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in Significant 
Accounting Policies. Group cost allocations are deducted in arriving at segmental operating profit. 
Inter-segment revenue is charged at prevailing market prices.

UK
As a result of the lower customer numbers in the UK and the change programme which is being 
implemented, a charge of £4.0m has been provided for redundancy and reorganisation costs. 
The FCA investigation has progressed, and having taken advice and reviewed internal and 
external available information, the Board has decided to record exceptional expenditure of 
£6.0m in relation to the anticipated costs of managing the investigation and a fine. There remains 
uncertainty as to the nature or extent of the action that the FCA may seek to take following the 
conclusion of its investigation and accordingly any related financial effect. 
New Markets
A charge of £15.1m has been recorded of which £14.8m is in relation to an impairment of goodwill in 
respect of Société Française de Garantie S.A. This write down reflects the challenging conditions in 
the electrical retail market in France and lower than expected levels of new partner business. 
Year ended 31 March 2012
The Group recognised a gain of £54.9m, which related to the deemed disposal of the former joint 
venture interest, as a result of the acquisition of the remaining 51% equity interest in Doméo (and 
its subsidiary Doméo Assistance) in December 2011.
The Group also recognised exceptional expenditure of £31.1m:
• £24.2m in the UK related to the re-organisation and redundancy costs as a result of the 
extensive change programme that was implemented in the UK business; additional third party 
support costs in relation to reviewing scripts, policy documentation terms and conditions 
and call monitoring; costs in relation to the re-contacting of customers including, where 
appropriate, compensation payments; and the Ofcom regulatory fine imposed in April 2012.
• £3.9m related to the loss incurred on the disposal of the Belgian operations; and
• £3.0m related to the acquisition costs of the Doméo business.

tax would reduce to 21% with effect from 1 April 2014, with a subsequent 1% reduction to reach 
20% with effect from 1 April 2015. As these future rate reductions had not been substantively

14. Goodwill (continued)
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated at acquisition to the cash generating 
units (‘CGUs’) that are expected to benefit from that business combination. CGUs are defined 
as geographical territories, because they represent the smallest identifiable group of assets that 
generate cash inflows. The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if 
there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are 
determined from value in use calculations. 
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rate, 
growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period. 
Management estimates the Group discount rate using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money. The growth rates are based on detailed business  
plans. Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on expectations of future changes  
in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and plans 
for the next three years approved by the Directors and extrapolates the annual cash flow using 
estimated, country specific, long-term growth rates. The pre-tax rates used to discount  
the forecast pre-tax cash flows are different for each territory and are detailed below (2012: All 
CGUs 15%):
• UK - 12.1%
• USA - 15.4%
• France - 13.8%
• Spain - 13.2%
Management has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of each CGUs 
carrying value, which also reflects the different risk profile of each CGU. Management believes 
that there are no reasonably possible changes to the key assumptions in the next year which 
would result in the carrying amount of goodwill exceeding the recoverable amount. This view is 
based upon inherently judgemental assumptions, however, it takes account of the headroom 
in management’s internal growth targets versus the conservative growth estimates used in the 
impairment review.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows:

UK   154.6 154.0
United States of America  4.4 4.2

An impairment charge of £14.8m has been recognised in respect of Société Française de Garantie 
S.A, of which £0.5m relates to the movement in exchange rates between 31 March 2012 and 31 
March 2013. Further details are given in note 6.

Trade receivables
The Group has provided fully for those receivable balances that it does not expect to recover. This 
assessment has been undertaken by reviewing the status of all significant balances that are past 
due and involves assessing both the reason for non-payment and the credit worthiness of the 
counterparty.
Of the trade receivables balance at the end of the year, there is no significant concentration of 
credit risk, with exposure spread across a large number of counterparties and customers. There 
are no customers that represent more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables.
Included in the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £3.9m 
(2012: £5.3m) which are past due at the reporting date but for which the Group has not 
provided for as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still 
considered recoverable. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances. The average 
age of receivables not impaired is 18 days (2012: 19 days). Trade debtors to be received from 
customers relating to instalments of policy premiums that are not yet due have been excluded 
from the average age calculation.

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the 
credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting 
date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and 
unrelated. Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in 
excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.

The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to 
their fair value.
Other receivables
The Group serves as an intermediary, whereby it is responsible for the collection of cash on 
behalf of third parties. Other receivables mainly represent those amounts to be collected from 
policyholders, but to be remitted to third parties for obligations such as the cost of underwriting 
and Insurance Premium Tax. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to individual 
receivables being small and spread across a diverse policyholder base. In addition, overall balance 
sheet exposure is mitigated as defaults on these receivables can, in the most part, be offset 
against the corresponding payable included in ’Other creditors’.

The US dollar and euro denominated borrowings are used to provide debt funding to the USA and 
Continental European operations respectively. The borrowings are drawn in the UK and passed to 
the overseas subsidiaries of the Group by way of intercompany loans, denominated in the same 
currencies. These external borrowings and the equivalent intercompany receivable loans are 
treated as monetary liabilities and assets respectively and, as such, the Group’s foreign currency 
exposure risk is minimised.

Revolving credit facilities  1.8 2.3
All the Group’s revolving credit facilities are unsecured. The carrying amount of the Group’s 
borrowings approximates to their fair value, and the currencies in which they are denominated 
reflect the geographical segments for which they have been used.
The other principal features of the Group’s borrowings are as follows:
• The Group has a £250m revolving credit facility with five banks. This facility was taken out on 
22 July 2011 and has a term of five years. This provides the Group with sufficient funding to 
support its strategic objectives.
• The financial covenants associated with the credit facilities are ‘net debt to EBITDA of less 
than 3.0 times’ (2012: 3.0 times) and ‘interest cover greater than 4.0 times EBITDA’ (2012: 4.0 
times). The Group has complied with all covenant requirements in the current and prior year.
• The Group’s principal borrowings are currently at floating rates at margins of 1% (2012: 
between 0.5 and 1.5%) above the relevant reference rate, thus exposing the Group to cash 
flow and interest rate risk.
At 31 March 2013, the Group had available £120.4m (2012: £132.2m) of undrawn committed 
borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met. Information about 
liquidity risk is presented in note 39.

unused tax losses of £8.9m (2012: £10.3m) available for offset against future profits, based on 
estimates of budgeted profits in the forthcoming years. Deferred tax has not been recognised on 
£17.0m (2012: £11.6m) of unused losses due to the uncertainty over the timing of future recovery.
There are expiry dates between 2020 - 2029 (2012: 2020 - 2029) in respect of £6.9m (2012:

Trade creditors and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and 
ongoing costs. The average credit period taken for trade purchases is 61 days (2012: 39 days). 
Deferred income represents revenue where an obligation exists to provide future services. 
An appropriate proportion of monies received in advance are treated as deferred income and 
recognised over the relevant period. 
Other creditors mainly represent those amounts to be collected from policyholders but to be 
remitted to third parties for obligations such as the cost of underwriting and Insurance Premium 
Tax. In addition, short-term cash advances from customers are included in other creditors until 
the services are performed and the customer is invoiced. 
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other payables approximates their

24. Provisions (continued)
The provision for the cost of addressing the UK matters represents management’s estimate 
of the Group’s liability relating to the UK issues identified in FY2012. The remaining provision 
is expected to be utilised within the next 12 months and principally relates to the cost of 
re-contacting customers and potential compensation. The provision has been based on 
management’s forecasts which include initial pilot re-contact exercises. The assumptions used 
relating to the number of customers, level of compensation, response rate and upheld rate 
require the use of judgement and estimation.
The FCA investigation has progressed, and having taken advice and reviewed internal and 
external available information, the Board has decided to record exceptional expenditure of 
£6.0m in relation to the anticipated costs of managing the investigation and a fine. There remains 
uncertainty as to the nature or extent of the action, that the FCA may seek to take following the 
conclusion of its investigation and accordingly any related financial effect. 
In March 2013, the Group announced plans to reduce the number of roles in the UK by around 
300. The costs of this reorganisation have been estimated at £4.0m and these have been 
provided for at 31 March 2013.

36. Share-based payments 
During the year ended 31 March 2013, the Group had five (2012: five) share-based payment 
arrangements, which are described below: 
i) Executive Share Option Plan (‘ESOP’) 
The ESOP provided for a grant price equal to the closing quoted market price of the Company’s 
shares on the day before the date of grant. The vesting period was three years and was dependent 
upon the real increase in Earnings per Share over the vesting period. If the options remain 
unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire. The plan is no 
longer used.
ii) 2005 Key Executive Incentive Plan (‘KEIP’) 
The KEIP provided for a grant price equal to the closing quoted market price of the Company’s 
shares on the day before the date of grant. The awards vested in two tranches, the first being 
between three and four years from the date of grant and the second being on the second 
anniversary of the vesting of the first tranche. The number of awards vesting was dependent 
upon the Profit before Tax of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2008 and was subject to 
a minimum share price criteria during the year ending 31 March 2009. If the options remain 
unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire. The plan is no 
longer used.
iii) Deferred Bonus Plan (‘DBP’) 
The DBP enabled the individual to defer receipt of their annual cash bonus (up to a maximum 
of 100%) and to invest an equivalent amount in the ordinary share capital of the Company. The 
deferred bonus may be matched by the Company dependent upon the Company’s relative Total 
Shareholder Return over a three year period. The shares lapse if not exercised within 10 years 
from the date of grant. The plan is no longer used.
iv) Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) 
The LTIP provides for the grant of performance, matching and restricted awards. The vesting 
period is three years for performance and matching awards and two years for the restricted 
awards. For the performance and matching awards granted in FY2010 and FY2013, vesting 
is dependent upon the Total Shareholder Return performance of the Group over the relevant 
performance period. For the FY2011 and FY2012 awards, 50% of the award is dependent upon 
Total Shareholder Return and 50% is subject to a target based on Earnings per Share growth. The 
restricted awards granted in FY2013 are subject to the continued employment of the participant 
at the date of vesting. 
v) Save As You Earn Scheme (‘SAYE’) 
The SAYE is open to all UK employees and provides for an exercise price equal to the closing 
quoted market price on the day before the date of grant, less a discretionary discount. The 
options can be exercised during a six month period following the completion of either a three or 
five year savings period.

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the 
year was £1.82 (2012: £3.66). 
The estimated fair values are calculated by applying a Black-Scholes option pricing model for the 
ESOP and SAYE and Monte Carlo simulations for the KEIP , LTIP and DBP . The assumptions used 
in the models (which are comparable to the prior year) are as follows: 
Input Assumption
Share price Price at date of grant
Exercise price Per scheme rules
Expected volatility 20% – 56%
Option life Per scheme rules
Expected dividends Based on historic dividend yield
Risk free interest rate 3.1% – 5.2%

119 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Levels of early exercises and lapses are estimated using historical averages. Volatility is calculated 
by looking at the historical share price movements prior to the date of grant over a period of time 
commensurate with the remaining term for each award. 
The Group recognised total expenses of £3.0m (2012: £1.7m) related to equity-settled share-
based payment transactions and total expenses of £nil (2012: £16,000) related to cash-settled 
share-based payment transactions.
37. Retirement benefit schemes 
Defined contribution scheme 
The Group operates a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme for all UK employees.  
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control 
of trustees. Where there are employees who leave the scheme within two years of joining and they 
choose to take a refund, the contributions paid by the Group are forfeited by the employee. 
The total cost charged to income of £3.1m (2012: £3.3m) represents contributions payable to 
these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the scheme. At 31 March 2013, 
contributions of £230,000 (2012: £218,000) due in respect of the current reporting period had 
not been paid over to the schemes.
Defined benefit scheme 
The Group participates in a defined benefit scheme, the Water Companies Pension Scheme, 
which is closed to new members. This is a sectionalised scheme and the Group participates 
in the HomeServe plc Section of the Scheme. The Section is administered by a Trustee and is 
independent of the Group’s finances. Contributions are paid to the Section in accordance with the 
recommendations of an independent actuary. 
The results of the actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2011 were updated to the accounting date by 
a qualified independent actuary in accordance with IAS19. As required by IAS19, the value of the 
defined benefit obligation and the current service cost has been measured using the projected 
unit credit method.
   Valuation at
  2013 2012
Key assumptions used:
Discount rate at 31 March  4.6% 4.8%
Consumer price inflation  2.7% 2.5%
Retail price inflation  3.7% 3.5%
Expected rate of salary increases  2.7% 4.5%
Future pension increases  2.7% 2.5%
Expected rate of return on scheme assets at 31 March  6.6% 7.4%
Life expectancy of male aged 60 at balance sheet date   27.4yrs 26.9yrs
Pensions accounting entries are subject to judgement and volatility, as the assets are largely 
linked to the equity market, whereas the present value of the obligation is linked to yields on  
AA-rated corporate bonds. 
 120 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
37. Retirement benefit schemes (continued) 
As an indication, all other things being equal: 
• an increase in the discount rate of 0.1% would lead to a reduction in the value placed on the 
obligations of the Section of approximately £0.5m
• an increase in the inflation assumption rate of 0.1% would lead to an increase in the value 
placed on the obligations of the Section of approximately £0.5m
• a decrease in the equity market of 25% would lead to an increase in the balance sheet liability 
of approximately £2.1m.

The analysis of the scheme assets and the expected rate of return at the balance sheet date was 
as follows:

The overall expected rate of return on assets for the financial year ending 31 March 2013 was 
6.6% per annum (2012: 7.4% per annum). This rate is derived by taking the weighted average of 
the long-term expected rate of return on each of the asset classes that the Section was invested in 
at 31 March 2013.

Principal financial instruments 
The principal financial instruments used by the Group from which financial instrument risk arises 
are as follows:
• cash and cash equivalents 
• bank overdrafts and revolving credit facilities
• trade receivables 
• other receivables 
• trade payables
• other creditors 
All principal financial instruments are stated at amortised cost.
Capital risk management 
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group are able to continue as going 
concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the appropriate balance of debt 
and equity. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings 
disclosed in note 20, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the 
parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 25 to 31 
and the Group Statement of Changes in Equity.
The table below presents quantitative data for the components the Group manages as capital: 
  2013 2012
  £m £m
Shareholders’ funds  375.2 366.4
Revolving credit facilities  129.6 117.8
Certain of the entities in the Group are subject to externally imposed capital requirements 
from the Financial Conduct Authority. Where such requirements exist, the Group manages the 
risk through the close monitoring of performance and distributable capital within the entities 
impacted by the regulations. The Group has complied with all such arrangements throughout the 
current and preceding year. 
Financial risk management objectives 
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans and overdrafts and cash 
and cash equivalents. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for 
the Group’s operations. The Group also has various other financial instruments such as trade 
receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its operations. 
Financial risk management is overseen by the Board according to objectives, targets and policies 
set by the Board. Treasury risk management, including management of currency risk, interest 
rate risk and liquidity risk is carried out by a central Group Treasury function in accordance with 
objectives, targets and policies set by the Board. Treasury is not a profit centre and does not enter 
into speculative transactions.

39. Financial instruments (continued)
Classification of financial instruments 
In addition to the other financial assets and liabilities set out above in ‘Principal financial instruments’, 
the Group also has financial assets and liabilities disclosed in notes 19 and 22. The main risks arising 
from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. 
Interest rate risk 
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the 
Group’s long-term debt requirements with floating interest rates. The Group’s policy is to manage 
its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debts. 
The maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities based on contractual maturities is provided 
in the table below. Interest is payable on the bank overdraft and revolving credit facilities. Deferred 
and contingent consideration payments are stated on the basis of expected cash outflows before 
discounting. 
The actual payment profile of ‘Other creditors’ is principally dependent upon the collection of 
the corresponding ’Other receivables’ from policyholders. These amounts principally relate to 
underwriting, which are collected from policyholders and remitted to underwriters following cash 
collection. Therefore, the actual cash flows may differ from those presented, but will not result in 
the acceleration of the settlement of the liability.

The revolving credit facility is drawn down and associated interest is settled on a monthly basis. 
The principal is included in the previous table when the facility is due to expire. 
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in 
financial instruments shall be undertaken. 
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change of 10% increase 
in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Group’s profit before tax (through 
the impact on floating rate borrowings).

Credit risk 
The Group trades only with creditworthy third parties. It is the Group’s policy that, with the 
exception of our policy membership customers, customers who wish to trade on credit terms are 
reviewed for financial stability. 
The majority of the Group’s trade receivables consist of a large number of individual members 
and hence for these balances the Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to 
a single counterparty. As a result, the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not considered to be 
significant. 
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise 
cash and cash equivalents, the Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the 
counterparty. 
The Group manages the risk associated with cash and cash equivalents through depositing funds 
only with reputable and creditworthy banking institutions.
The Group has a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of the above receivables and 
instruments.
Liquidity risk 
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Group’s Board which sets the 
framework for the management of the Group’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity 
management requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves 
and banking facilities and continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows. Included in 
note 20 are details of the undrawn facilities that are available to the Group to further reduce 
liquidity risk. 
With the exception of deferred and contingent consideration and the bank overdrafts and the 
revolving credit facilities, all of the Group’s financial liabilities are due for payment within two 
years, based on contractual payment terms.
 126 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
We have audited the parent Company financial statements of HomeServe plc for the year ended 
31 March 2013 which comprise the Company statement of comprehensive income, the Company 
balance sheet, the Company statement of changes in equity, the Company cash flow statement 
and the related notes 40 to 54. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union and applied in accordance with the provision of Companies Act 2006. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of 
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state 
to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report 
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our 
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities statement, the Directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the parent Company financial statements and for being satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the parent 
Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent Company’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial 
statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report 
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of 
any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies, we consider the implications for  
our report. 
Opinion on the financial statements 
In our opinion the parent Company financial statements: 
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2013; 
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and 
as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and 
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
Company independent auditor’s report 
 Financial statements 
127 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and 
• the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the parent Company financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 
requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent Company, or returns adequate 
for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or 
• the parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report 
to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of HomeServe plc for the year 
ended 31 March 2013.

Trade receivables 
The Company has a policy for providing fully for those receivable balances that it does not 
expect to recover. This assessment has been undertaken by reviewing the status of all significant 
balances that are past due and involves assessing both the reason for non-payment and the 
credit worthiness of the counterparty. 
Included in the Company’s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £nil 
(2012: £nil). The average age of receivables not impaired is 30 days (2012: 30 days).

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Company considers any change in the 
credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting 
date. The concentration of credit risk is mitigated through the close management and regular 
review of performance of the subsidiary companies. 
No allowance for doubtful debts is considered necessary based on prior experience and the 
Directors’ assessment of the current economic environment. 
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to 
their fair value.
Cash balances and cash equivalents 
Cash balances and cash equivalents of £84.9m (2012: £44.8m) comprise cash held by the 
Company and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. The 
carrying amount of these assets approximates to their fair value.

The main risks arising from the Company’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign 
currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Interest rate risk 
The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the 
Company’s long-term debt requirements with floating interest rates. The Company’s policy is to 
manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debts.
The maturity profile of the Company’s financial liabilities is provided in the table below. The 
revolving credit facility is drawn down and associated interest is settled on a monthly basis. The 
principal is included in the table below when the facility is due to expire.

Liquidity risk 
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Company’s Board which sets 
the framework for the management of the Company’s short, medium and long-term funding 
and liquidity management requirements. The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining 
adequate reserves and banking facilities and continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash 
flows. Included in note 20 are details of the undrawn facilities that are available to the Company 
and the Group to further reduce liquidity risk. 
With the exception of deferred and contingent consideration and the bank overdrafts and the 
revolving credit facilities, all of the Group’s financial liabilities are due for payment within two years, 
based on contractual payment terms.

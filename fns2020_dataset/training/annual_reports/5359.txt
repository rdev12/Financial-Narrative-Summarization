A global specialty chemicals company OUR SPECIALIST BUSINESSES
Elementis plc
Elementis Specialty Products
Based in London and listed on the London Stock Exchange.  
The role of the Group holding company is to:
–  Set corporate objectives and the strategic direction 
of the Group.
–  Provide leadership and direction to management and 
monitor corporate and business performance.
–  Set high standards in business conduct and ethics,  and 
in business,  employee and community relations.  
–  Set policy and provide oversight for governance,  ﬁ nancial 
control and risk management,  and health,  safety and

What we do
The Specialty Products division provides high value functional 
additives to the architectural and industrial coatings,  personal 
care and oilﬁ eld drilling markets that improve the ﬂ ow 
characteristics and performance of our customers’  products 
or production processes.  The business has a signiﬁ cant 
presence in the science of rheology,  which in its simplest form 
means our technology imparts thickness and viscosity control.  
For example,  paint without rheological additives would 
have the consistency of water,  but paint with our additives is 
smooth,  homogeneous and has a controlled,  even spread on 
a surface.  The same requirements for rheological additives 
exist in personal care products,  such as creams and lotions,  
and in oil and gas drilling applications,  providing the viscosity 
required to extract material during the drilling process.
In addition to rheology additives,  the business provides 
a comprehensive portfolio of specialty additives to its 
customers,  including defoamers,  colourants and tinting 
systems,  waxes and surface active additives.
Key strengths
The Specialty Products business provides an ideal growth platform 
with its balanced geographical exposure across mature and 
emerging economies,  strong technology base and strategic 
market diversiﬁ cation.  The business has a signiﬁ cant technical 
service and application support presence in all its markets,  which 
has been built on long term relationships of trust,  collaboration 
and technical expertise.  The business’s differentiated technology 
innovation is supported by  “best in class” process technology and 
tightly held manufacturing know how.
We own and operate the only rheology grade hectorite mine in the 
world,  which owing to its unique properties makes it a premium 
raw material used in many of our products.

FINANCIAL SUMMARY 02 Elementis plc  Annual report and accounts 2010
CHAIRMAN’S 
STATEMENT
I am very pleased to report on the signiﬁ cant improvement 
in the Group’s ﬁ nancial performance in 2010,  following the 
effects of the general economic downturn in 2009.  The 
results are particularly satisfying to the Board because at the 
core of the improvement are a number of strategic actions 
that have been undertaken by management over the last 
three years to improve the level and quality of the Group’s 
earnings.  These actions have also positioned us for growth 
by placing talented business teams in high growth markets 
and geographies,  where our inherent skills can be fully 
leveraged to produce exceptional performance.  Such 
actions have included the acquisition of Deuchem in 
Taiwan and China,  the acquisition of Fancor in personal 
care,  the reorganisation of the Chromium business and 
several high quality additions to our business teams.  All of 
these actions combined to make a signiﬁ cant contribution 
to this year’s excellent results and ensure the Group is well 
positioned for further proﬁ table growth.
Results
Revenues in the period were $697.4 million compared to 
$563.7 million in the previous year,  which is an increase of 
23 per cent after adjusting for currency and acquisitions.  
Operating proﬁ t in 2010 improved by 183 per cent to 
$102.3 million,  compared to $36.2 million in the previous 
year,  before exceptional items.  In Specialty Products,  the 
Group’s largest business,  sales volumes were well ahead 
of the previous year in both the ﬁ rst and second halves of 
the year,  demonstrating solid underlying growth in this 
business.  In Chromium,  the 2009 restructuring exercise is 
already showing positive results with good earnings and 
cash ﬂ ow improvements in the year.
Earnings per share,  before exceptional items,  in 2010 
improved to 15.2 cents,  compared to 4.3 cents in 2009.  
During the year the Group concluded that it should 
recognise the value of certain deferred tax assets relating 
to past losses,  resulting in a tax credit of $5.8 million.  
As this is a non-recurring,  one-time event it has been 
recorded as an exceptional item in our ﬁ nancial statements.  
Basic earnings per share in 2010,  including the tax credit,  
was 16.7 cents compared to a loss of 12.9 cents in 2009,  
which also included a number of one-time charges.
Balance sheet
As a result of the Group’s strong earnings and cash 
generation in 2010 the balance sheet has continued to 
strengthen and at the end of the year the ratio of net debt 
to EBITDA had fallen to 0.6x (2009: 1.9x).  In addition,  the 
deﬁ cit in the Group’s pension schemes,  as measured under 
IAS 19,  declined by $44.3 million to $67.4 million at the end 
of the year.  
Having also concluded a new four year,  $200 million bank 
ﬁ nancing facility in July 2010,  the Board is very conﬁ dent 
of the Group’s ability to ﬁ nance further growth.
Dividend
In 2009 the Board decided to maintain the dividend 
payout at the 2008 level of 2.9 pence,  despite the economic 
downturn,  because of its conﬁ dence in the Group’s strategy 
and ability to make rapid progress as global economies 
recovered.  This has clearly been borne out by the excellent 
results reported for this year and so the Board feels it is 
appropriate to recommence dividend growth.  The Board is 
therefore recommending a ﬁ nal dividend of 2.6 cents per 
share which will be paid on 3 June 2011 in pounds sterling 
at an exchange rate of £1=$1.619 (equivalent to a sterling 
amount of 1.6 pence per share),  to shareholders on the 
register on 6 May 2011.  This brings the total return to 
shareholders for the year to 4.9 cents (3.1 pence),  
representing an increase of seven per cent over the 
previous year.  Going forward the Board intends to continue 
to progress the dividend as the Group’s dollar earnings and 
cash ﬂ ow permit.
Health,  safety and the environment
I am happy to report that our activities in this important 
area of our business have continued to be of a high 
standard in 2010 with,  again,  no signiﬁ cant incidents 
reported by any of our businesses.
People
The ﬁ rst rate results reported by the Group this year are,  in 
no small part,  the result of the efforts,  dedication and skill 
of our people around the world.  On behalf of the Board 
I would like to thank them all for their tremendous 
contribution to our success.
Outlook
The positive momentum and market demand experienced 
in 2010 has continued into the early part of 2011.  Even 
though the ﬁ rst half of 2010 was positively impacted by 
customer restocking,  our revenues and margins in the 
early part of this year are,  nevertheless,  showing an 
improvement over the previous year and our order book 
is currently robust.  The Board remains conﬁ dent in the 
Group’s strategy of continuing to focus on leveraging the 
unique characteristics of the Specialty Products business 
to generate further added value and growth.  We are 
therefore conﬁ dent of the Group’s ability to make further 
good progress in 2011.

BUSINESS REVIEW
Dear Shareholders,
In last year’s report,  I wrote of our resolute commitment to 
enter 2010 in a stronger competitive position and poised 
to generate material growth,  during what we anticipated 
to be a period of modest progress in global GDP .  I am 
pleased to report that we successfully executed that 
strategy in 2010,  yielding strong ﬁ nancial results across 
all of the Group’s activities.  Group operating proﬁ t,  
operating margin,  free cash ﬂ ow and EPS all improved 
sharply over 2009,  and these improving trends for the 
Group resulted in several earnings upgrades over the 
course of the year.  All three Elementis businesses made 
material contributions to the improvement and amongst 
the highlights were:  
•
  T he signiﬁ cant improvement in Group sales and 
operating proﬁ t.
•
  A continued improvement in Group operating 
margin with an accelerating trend across the year. 
•
  Strong operating cash ﬂ ow performance which 
was enhanced by structural improvements to 
working capital. 
•
  A record performance in Specialty Products with 
sales up 30 per cent,  operating proﬁ t up 132 per cent. 
•
  The solid performance from Chromium which 
delivered strong cash ﬂ ow and good proﬁ t and 
margin growth. 
•
  The signiﬁ cant reduction in our net debt position,  
which reduced by $27 million to $79.3 million.
Specialty Products,  which is our largest business 
representing 70 per cent of Group operating proﬁ t,  
reported its best year ever in terms of sales and operating 
proﬁ t.  This record performance is even more notable 
given that the recovery in the critical North American 
coatings market in 2010 was from a much lower base than 
other regions and therefore bodes well for our future as 
that region continues to recover.  The 2008 Asia Paciﬁ c 
based acquisitions of Deuchem,  a specialty additives 
company,  and Yuhong,  a local organoclay producer,  
have proven instrumental in providing Elementis with a 
powerful growth platform in Asia Paciﬁ c. Asia Paciﬁ c is a 
key component of our future growth strategy and is now 
Specialty Products’  largest sales region,  delivering growth 
in 2010 of 20 per cent year on year. 
Innovation has been and will continue to be at the heart 
of our success in Specialty Products.  Our product portfolio,  
new product development and investment in technology 
are uniﬁ ed by one simple over-arching theme:  to make 
our customers more successful.  We are aligned with the 
market leaders on a global basis and have long term 
relationships with these customers.  We have cultivated 
a reputation as the company that provides the most 
comprehensive and value added solutions for their 
formulary challenges.  This focus on delivering value 
to our customers resulted in signiﬁ cant new business.  
An example is in the shale gas drilling sector where our 
innovative products allow customers to drill faster,  further 
and more efﬁ ciently.  We are investing behind these 
innovative products to build proﬁ table market share and 
have implemented a number of productivity initiatives 
and capacity expansion projects,  including a signiﬁ cant 
capacity expansion at our Charleston,  West Virginia facility 
to support the growth of our shale gas drilling product 
range.  As strong as the innovation programme has been 
to date,  we are equally pleased with the quality of our new 
product pipeline going forward.  
The acquisition of Fancor in December 2009 
strengthened the product offering of our proﬁ table 
personal care business and is consistent with our strategy 
to preferentially invest and grow the Specialty Products 
business.  The quality of the Specialty Products business 
is reﬂ ected in its margins,  which are moving back to the 
peak levels experienced in 2007/8,  a level that we believe 
is sustainable based on the value we deliver to our 
customers.  While our products are a small percentage 
of the overall cost of our customers’  formulations they 
are critical to the performance and therefore highly 
valued.  This characteristic allows the business to pass 
through increases in our input cost and maintain true 
specialty chemical margins.  
Rheology,  the science of ﬂ ow and viscosity,  is a key 
component of our product offering and value proposition 
in Specialty Products.  Elementis owns and operates the 
only commercial grade hectorite clay mine in the world,  
a substance that has unique rheological properties,  
giving Elementis a sustainable competitive advantage.  
Currently we estimate the productive life of the hectorite 
mine to be in excess of 50 years.

GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S OVERVIEW
CONTINUED
Elementis Chromium delivered excellent results in 2010 
reﬂ ecting the beneﬁ ts of the restructured business,  
further validating the new business model and giving 
us greater conﬁ dence in the ability of the business to 
deliver more stable earnings and cash ﬂ ow.  The business 
delivered operating margins of 17 per cent and a return 
on capital of 44.8 per cent in 2010.  The strong demand 
from our customers experienced in 2010 is expected to 
continue into the foreseeable future and conﬁ dence in 
our ability to pass through any cost increases and 
maintain margins is high.  We have also invested in an 
alternative energy project that will allow the Castle Hayne,  
North Carolina facility to operate on natural gas as well as 
fuel oil.  This capital investment will give the business 
greater ﬂ exibility to procure energy in a more cost 
effective manner going forward.  Moreover,  the move to 
natural gas will not only save money for Elementis,  given 
present energy costs,  it also has the potential to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions at Castle Hayne by as much 
as 25 per cent.
The Surfactants business,  based in the Netherlands,  made 
good progress in 2010 in its strategic intent to improve its 
product and market mix,  effectively selling less volume 
into the lowest margin commodity segments and 
more into the better margin markets.  The business also 
improved its operational productivity compared to 
2009,  as volumes improved in key operational segments.  
As such,  earnings showed good improvement over the 
near break-even level in 2009.  This business shares its 
production facility with the Specialty Products business 
and the goal remains to utilise more of the facility over 
time to support the coatings additives that are used by 
Specialty Products.
While we are encouraged and proud of the Group’s 
continuing progress and that our 2010 results are ahead 
of expectations on almost every performance measure,  
we are certainly not satisﬁ ed and believe that there is 
much more that we can achieve.  The reality is we still have 
signiﬁ cant opportunities to drive further improvement in 
performance and results for our shareholders.  Elementis 
is strategically well placed to beneﬁ t from the powerful 
global trends of robust growth in shale gas drilling,  the 
opportunities provided by our established position in 
emerging and high growth markets,  especially in Asia,  
and our portfolio of highly valued and innovative 
products particularly in all-natural personal care 
formulations and high performance coatings.  
We have a collective sense of optimism within Elementis 
about the near and long term future of the Group.  
This optimism is based on the ongoing positive 
transformation of our company into a business that can 
reliably generate strong proﬁ ts and cash ﬂ ow,  giving us 
the ﬁ nancial ﬂ exibility to invest for future growth to 
deliver shareholder value.  
The positive momentum in market demand and growth 
that we experienced in 2010 has continued into the early 
part of 2011.  Our revenues and margins continue to show 
improvement over the same period in 2010 – despite the 
ﬁ rst half of last year being a period of signiﬁ cant customer 
restocking.  Coupled with our robust order book,  these 
trends give us conﬁ dence in our ability to deliver further 
good progress in 2011.  Moreover, our ﬁ nancial strength, 
unique competitive advantages,  reputation in the global 
marketplace and,  most importantly,  the quality and 
character of our people, give us conﬁ dence in our ability 
to deliver further growth well into the future.
I would like to sincerely thank our shareholders and 
customers for their continued conﬁ dence and support.

1.  Preferentially growing the Specialty Products business through 
a mixture of organic growth from new products,  markets,  
applications or geographies,  and selective acquisitions in 
rheology or complementary additives,  with the aim of growing 
revenue and market share whilst maintaining margins.
2.  Consistently delivering a relatively stable and sustainable level of 
earnings from the Chromium business by serving higher margin 
markets and customers,  optimising operational performance from 
the business’s more ﬂ exible and lower cost manufacturing footprint,  
and improving margins through maintaining pricing discipline,  
managing energy and raw material costs and creating more 
efﬁ cient supply chains.  
3.  Steadily upgrading the product portfolio in Surfactants by 
focussing on higher margin applications,  while at the same time 
maintaining cost discipline.
4.  Continually improving the quality of the Group’s balance sheet 
by generating strong free cash ﬂ ow and reducing the proportion 
of non-business items,  such as legacy pension funds.

21 per cent.  Asia Paciﬁ c is now our largest coatings market 
in terms of sales following our acquisition of Deuchem in 
2008.  Sales volumes to the Asia Paciﬁ c coatings market 
grew by a robust 19 per cent,  with additives growing by 
25 per cent,  demonstrating the continued attractiveness 
of this market and the strong position that Elementis 
enjoys.  Overall sales to the global coatings market 
represented 77 per cent of Specialty Products’  total 
sales and coatings volumes grew by 20 per cent.
Sales volumes to the oilﬁ eld drilling sector grew by 
68 per cent in 2010,  with sales in the Americas growing 
by 83 per cent due to signiﬁ cantly increased activity in 
shale gas drilling and a general recovery of market activity 
coupled with rising oil prices.  In Europe sales volumes 
grew by 20 per cent due to increased demand from North 
Sea drilling activities.  
Sales volumes in personal care improved by 78 per cent 
in 2010 or 22 per cent excluding the acquisition of Fancor.  
Sales in Europe,  where the business has its strongest 
customer base,  showed particularly good growth 
(+38 per cent) and the acquisition of Fancor is already 
providing synergistic beneﬁ ts from a broadened product 
offering and an enhanced position in North America.  
Operating proﬁ t in Specialty Products was $71.8 million in 
2010,  an increase of 132 per cent over the previous year.  
The strong increase in sales volumes was the main driver 
of the improvement,  with higher selling prices offsetting 
raw material and energy inﬂ ation.  In addition,  margins 
were improved in selected markets where tight supply 
conditions prevailed.  The year on year comparison also 
beneﬁ ted from $3.8 million of net currency movements,  
with 2009 incurring currency hedging costs of $5.3 million.  
As the business continues to expand in high margin areas,  
additional investments in high quality people and other 
resources have been made,  along with plant resources to 
meet additional volume,  which increased ﬁ xed costs by 
approximately $4 million.  Operating margin for Specialty 
Products was 17.5 per cent in 2010 (2009:  9.8 per cent) 
and improved throughout the year due to strong demand 
and improved pricing.  Operating margin in the ﬁ rst half of 
2010 was 17.3 per cent compared to 17.7 per cent in the 
second half.  
Elementis Specialty Products is a leading manufacturer of 
rheology control additives that are used to enhance the 
performance of our customers’  products.  It is the global 
leader in organoclay technology,  with a unique position in 
hectorite clay,  owning the only rheology grade hectorite 
mine in the world.  Best in class technical support and 
customer service are critical core competencies of the 
business and provide the platform to deliver added 
value in the coatings,  oilﬁ eld drilling and personal care 
markets.  The strategy of the business is to grow in high 
value rheology products and complementary additives 
through new product innovation,  expansion into new 
geographies and bolt on acquisitions.  In coatings,  the 
largest of its markets,  Elementis has a unique global 
position,  providing technical service and a broad product 
offering to both multinational and regional coatings 
companies.  Its position in high growth markets was 
signiﬁ cantly enhanced by acquisitions in Taiwan and 
China in 2008.  In personal care,  Elementis is a signiﬁ cant 
player based on its expertise in hectorite rheology 
and further expanded this position in 2009 with the 
acquisition of Fancor,  which added a number of eco-
friendly,  plant seed oil based products for skin and 
hair care.  In oilﬁ eld drilling,  Elementis is the preferred 
supplier to oil service companies for high performance 
rheological additives used in drilling.  The business’s 
unique technology and strong alignment with key 
industry players have allowed it to beneﬁ t from the 
recent increase in drilling activity for shale gas resources 
in North America.  
Sales in Specialty Products for 2010 were $410.8 million 
compared to $315.2 million in the previous year,  an 
increase of 30 per cent or 32 per cent on a constant 
currency basis.  The acquisition of Fancor in December 
2009 contributed three per cent to current year sales,  
while improvements in volume contributed 26 per cent 
and pricing two per cent.  Successful execution of its 
core strategy has allowed the business to fully leverage 
the economic recovery,  which led to especially strong 
customer demand in the ﬁ rst half of 2010 when sales 
increased by 49 per cent compared to the same period 
in 2009.  Sales in the second half were 14 per cent better 
than the same period in 2009,  demonstrating strong 
underlying demand.
Sales in the Americas coatings market showed a strong 
recovery with volumes improving by 20 per cent on a year 
on year basis.  A similar pattern was evident in coatings 
sales in Europe where full year volumes improved by

BUSINESS COMMENTARIES
CONTINUED
Elementis Surfactants is a specialty surfactant 
manufacturer offering innovative products to markets, 
such as oilﬁ eld chemicals,  textile and leather, construction 
and household products.  Its strategy is to focus on higher 
margin markets,  such as agro-chemicals,  feed, plastic 
and resins,  and over time reduce higher volume,  low 
margin applications.  At the same time the business seeks 
to reduce operating costs by improving the productivity 
of its manufacturing facility in Delden,  the Netherlands,  
which it shares with the Specialty Products business. 
Surfactant sales in 2010 were $88.1 million compared 
to $76.3 million in the previous year,  representing an 
increase of 15 per cent,  or 21 per cent on a constant 
currency basis.  Sales volumes increased by one per cent 
with volumes in oil service chemicals improving by 
31 per cent compared to the previous year,  while 
volumes sold in other,  low margin sectors reduced by 
11 per cent.  This improvement in the mix of products 
sold was in line with management’s strategy.  Selling 
prices were increased throughout the year in response 
to petrochemical raw material cost inﬂ ation.  
Operating proﬁ t in 2010 was $6.1 million compared 
to $0.1 million in 2009.  During the year the business 
beneﬁ ted from its share of a one-time legal settlement 
with a former owner of the Delden site in the amount 
of $2.7 million (see Finance report) and excluding this 
gives an underlying result for 2010 of $3.4 million.  The 
net increase over 2009 of $3.3 million is the result of 
improvements in productivity and product mix,  as 
mentioned above,  and tightly controlled ﬁ xed costs.
Business strategy
To focus on higher margin markets,  such as 
agro-chemicals,  feed,  plastic and resins to balance 
the base-load activity in high volume commodity 
applications.

 Annual report and accounts 2010 Elementis plc   09
Elementis Chromium is one of the world’s largest suppliers 
of chrome chemicals,  which are used in a variety of end 
markets including metal alloys,  metal ﬁ nishing,  leather 
tanning and refractory applications.  Supply/demand 
balances are a signiﬁ cant driver of margins in the global 
chromium chemical market and Elementis Chromium seeks 
to produce stable earnings and cash ﬂ ow by serving higher 
value markets and by utilising its ﬂ exible manufacturing base 
to adjust to changes in demand.  As the only global producer 
with its manufacturing base located in the United States,  
Elementis Chromium is uniquely positioned to serve this 
market with value added products,  offering just in time 
service via custom designed delivery systems.
Sales in 2010 were $209.7 million compared to 
$183.4 million in the previous year,  which is an increase 
of 14 per cent,  with currency having no material impact on 
the comparison.  Volumes recovered strongly in the ﬁ rst half 
of the year,  driven by the economic recovery and customer 
restocking,  and demand generally remained strong 
throughout the year.  All of our markets,  with the exception 
of US construction,  showed a year on year improvement.  
Consequently plant operating rates remained close to 
capacity for most of the year.  Overall,  volumes for the year 
were 12 per cent higher than in 2009,  with ﬁ rst half volumes 
45 per cent higher than the same period last year.  Sales 
volumes in the second half of 2010 remained at,  or near,  
plant capacity but were nevertheless ten per cent lower 
than the previous year due to the closure of Eaglescliffe 
and sale of the remaining inventory at the site during the 
latter part of 2009.  Regionally,  volumes to North America 
and Asia Paciﬁ c grew by 32 per cent and 25 per cent 
respectively,  with volumes to Europe 31 per cent lower 
than the previous year as a result of the UK plant closure.
Operating proﬁ t in 2010 improved by 158 per cent over 
the previous year to $35.8 million.  Operating margin for 
2010 was 17.0 per cent compared to 7.6 per cent in the 
previous year.  The margin in the second half of the year 
was 18.7 per cent compared to 15.4 per cent in the ﬁ rst 
half.  (All 2009 comparatives here are before exceptional 
items.)  Strong volume gains and improved pricing 
contributed most of the improvement and margins were 
improved by the closure of the Eaglescliffe plant which 
reduced sales of non-differentiated products.  The year on 
year result also beneﬁ ted from relatively stable energy and 
raw material costs during 2010.  These costs were ﬁ xed for 
the year,  mostly during the second half of 2009,  as part of 
the business’s annual hedging programme to help 
minimise cost volatility and stabilise earnings.  As these 
contracts expire,  variable costs will trend higher,  but will 
be offset by selling price initiatives.  In addition the year on 
year comparison was positively impacted by $5.2 million 
of currency hedging costs incurred in 2009.  
Business strategy
To produce stable earnings and cash ﬂ ow by serving 
higher value markets,  providing high quality,  higher 
margin products,  such as chromic acid and chromic 
oxide to its customers;  and utilising its ﬂ exible 
manufacturing base to adjust to changes in demand.

BUSINESS REVIEW 10 Elementis plc  Annual report and accounts 2010
Brian T aylorson
Finance Director
Group results
Group sales in 2010 were $697.4 million compared 
to $563.7 million in the previous year,  an increase of 
24 per cent,  or 23 per cent on a constant currency basis 
after excluding acquisitions.  All three Group businesses 
showed a strong rebound in sales following the economic 
downturn of 2009.  Customer restocking was a prominent 
feature during the ﬁ rst half of 2010,  in both Specialty 
Products and Chromium,  but customer demand 
remained robust throughout the balance of the year.  
Selling prices across the Group improved by ﬁ ve per cent 
in response to raw material inﬂ ation and sales volumes 
increased by 17 per cent compared to 2009.  
Group operating proﬁ t was $102.3 million in 2010 
compared to $36.2 million (before exceptional items) in 
2009.  Strong growth in volumes,  combined with higher 
selling prices were the main drivers of the improvement.  
Group operating margin for 2010 was 14.7 per cent 
compared to 6.4 per cent (before exceptional items) in 
2009 and showed improvement throughout the year due 
to strong market demand for our differentiated products,  
high plant utilisation rates and selective price increases.  
Operating margin in the ﬁ rst half of 2010 was 13.6 per 
cent and increased to 15.8 per cent in the second half.  
The price of energy across the Group remained relatively 
stable in 2010,  compared to 2009,  due to the Group’s 
policy of ﬁ xing energy costs ahead of time in order to 
reduce earnings volatility.  In the second half of 2010 the 
Group reached a settlement with a former owner of the 
Delden site,  in which Elementis received Euro 2.75 million 
($3.8 million) in return for releasing that party from certain 
historical indemnities relating to the site.  This amount 
was added to operating proﬁ t in the year and,  as the site 
serves both businesses,  was allocated between Specialty 
Products ($1.1 million) and Surfactants ($2.7 million).  
These amounts were not treated as exceptional items 
as they did not meet the relevant materiality threshold.

 Annual report and accounts 2010 Elementis plc   11
Currency hedging
Following the Group’s decision in February 2010 to 
change its reporting currency to US dollars,  currency 
hedging activities have been signiﬁ cantly reduced,  
focussing mostly on exposures to the euro and pounds 
sterling.  However in 2008,  when the reporting currency 
was still pounds sterling,  currency hedges in US dollar/
sterling were transacted by the Group to hedge its 
anticipated dollar earnings for 2009.  The net cost of these 
hedges in 2009 was $10.2 million,  resulting from the 
strengthening of the dollar in that year,  and was divided 
equally between Specialty Products and Chromium.  
Consequently,  the year on year comparison of operating 
proﬁ ts in 2010 is positively impacted by these amounts.
Central costs
Central costs are costs that are not identiﬁ able as expenses 
of a particular business,  and are comprised of expenditures 
of the Board of directors and the corporate ofﬁ ce.  In 2010 
central costs increased by $2.7 million to $11.4 million 
largely as a result of an increase in the value of performance 
related compensation programmes,  reﬂ ecting the Group’s 
improved share price and earnings performance.
Exceptional items
An exceptional tax credit of $5.8 million has been 
recognised during the year in respect of deferred tax 
assets relating to past losses and other timing differences 
which are now considered recoverable against future 
UK trading proﬁ ts.  It has been treated as an exceptional 
item on account of its size and non-recurring nature.  
Exceptional items in 2009 consisted mainly of $33.5 million 
relating to European Commission ﬁ nes and $44.5 million 
associated with the strategic review and subsequent 
closure of the Eaglescliffe chromium plant.

Net pension ﬁ nance expense (1.9) (6.0)
Discount on provisions (1.1) –
 (6.3) (7.9)
Net interest costs reduced by $1.6 million to $6.3 million.  
The net cost of borrowing increased by $1.4 million to 
$3.3 million due mainly to increased margins on the 
Group’s main borrowing facility,  which was renewed in 
July 2010,  and additional costs from interest rate hedges 
transacted in September 2010.  The interest rate hedges 
were entered into in order to swap $51 million of Group 
debt from ﬂ oating to four year ﬁ xed rates.
Net pension ﬁ nance expense reduced by $4.1 million in 
2010 to $1.9 million.  The decline was largely due to an 
improvement in the expected return on pension assets 
between the two periods.
Discount on provisions of $1.1 million relates to 
environmental provisions on the balance sheet which are 
calculated on a discounted basis,  hence the cost of the 
discount is recognised each year as an interest charge.  
In 2009 the charge was adjusted to zero as part of a 
provision rebalancing exercise.

The pre-exceptional tax charge which is an effective 
tax rate of 28.9 per cent (2009:  32.8 per cent) reﬂ ects a 
reduction in levels of taxation due to the geographical 
split of proﬁ ts and changes to underlying rates of 
tax payable.
The exceptional items relate to the credit arising on 
the recognition of a UK deferred tax asset in respect of 
UK losses and other timing differences which are now 
considered recoverable against future UK trading proﬁ ts.  
In addition a further UK deferred tax asset has been 
established in respect of the UK pension fund deﬁ cit and 
the related credit accounted for within the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income.
Earnings per share
Note 9 to the Financial Statements sets out a number of 
calculations of earnings per share.  To better understand 
the underlying performance of the Group,  earnings per 
share reported under IFRS is adjusted for items classiﬁ ed 
as exceptional. 
Diluted earnings per share,  before exceptional items,  was 
15.2 cents compared to 4.3 cents in the previous year and 
the improvement was mainly due to the operating proﬁ t 
performance noted above. 
Basic earnings per share including exceptional items is 
after taking account of the one-time tax credits noted 
above and was 16.7 cents compared to a loss of 12.9 cents 
in 2009.  The impact of exceptional items was to increase 
reported earnings per share by 1.5 cents (2009:  reduced 
by 17.2 cents).
Distribution to shareholders
During 2010 the Group paid a ﬁ nal dividend in respect of 
the year ended 31 December 2009 of 2.2 cents (1.4 pence) 
per share.  An interim dividend of 2.3 cents (1.5 pence) 
per share was paid on 8 October 2010 and the Board is 
recommending a ﬁ nal dividend of 2.6 cents (1.6 pence) 
per share which will be paid on 3 June 2011.

  EBITDA – earnings before interest,  tax,  exceptional items,  
depreciation and amortisation
Net borrowings reduced by $27.0 million in 2010 to 
$79.3 million,  resulting in a ratio of net debt to EBITDA 
of 0.6x (2009:  1.9x).  In 2009 net debt increased by 
$14.3 million.  This positive outcome for the year was 
generated by a signiﬁ cant improvement in Group 
EBITDA and a positive performance in working capital 
management.  EBITDA improved from $56.7 million in 
2009 to $123.7 million in 2010 as a result of the increase in 
operating proﬁ t for the year,  while the Group’s excellent 
progress in working capital management delivered a 
positive cash ﬂ ow of $1.9 million in a year when sales grew 
by 24 per cent.  In other categories of cash ﬂ ow,  payments 
towards the Group’s pension deﬁ cit were $18.4 million in 
2010 compared to $10.7 million in the previous year 
(see comments later in this section).  Interest and tax 
payments increased by $0.2 million to $8.8 million,  
largely due to increases in tax payments as a result of 
the higher earnings in the year.  Cash outﬂ ows related 
to exceptional items were $40.7 million and included 
the EU ﬁ ne ($33.5 million) and spending on the closure 
of the Eaglescliffe site,  both of which were reported on 
in the 2009 Annual Report.
All of the Group’s businesses made good progress 
in working capital management during 2010 due to 
continued emphasis on high quality supply chain 
management and rigorous credit management.  
As a result,  inventory days for the Group reduced by 
15 days to 75 days,  debtor days remained stable at 
50 days and creditor days improved by nine days to 
60 days.  All of this was achieved during a period of rapid 
sales growth,  further demonstrating the high quality of 
our efforts in this area.

(2009:  decreased by $99.6 million) mainly due to the 
current year proﬁ t after tax of $74.1 million (2009:  loss 
of $57.4 million),  a decrease in Group liabilities for 
retirement beneﬁ ts of $44.3 million (2009:  increase 
of $40.7 million) and dividends paid or accrued of 
$20.0 million (2009:  $20.0 million).  Other net assets 
increased by $67.8 million in 2010 (2009:  decreased by 
$98.0 million) mainly due to a decrease in retirement 
beneﬁ t liabilities,  a decrease in Group provisions of 
$42.3 million (2009:  increase of $59.4 million) and an 
increase in net deferred tax liabilities of $16.1 million.  
Comments on the changes in Group provisions and 
deferred tax are included elsewhere in this report.

Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the 
Group has a present obligation as a result of past events 
which is expected to result in an outﬂ ow of economic 
beneﬁ ts in order to settle the obligation.  At the end of 
2010 the Group held provisions of $48.5 million (2009:  
$90.8 million).

 Annual report and accounts 2010 Elementis plc   13
During the year an amount of Euro 23.5 million was paid 
in respect of the European Commission’s ﬁ nes following 
on from their investigation into heat stabilisers,  which 
were highlighted in last year’s Annual Report and had 
been provided for in the 2009 accounts.  The Group has 
since ﬁ led an appeal with the General Court of the EU,  
vigorously asserting its position that the EU Commission 
was precluded from imposing any ﬁ ne on the Group.
The Group’s environmental provision has been calculated 
using a methodology consistent with previous years and 
with the Group’s external consultants having performed 
an updated assessment of liabilities during the latter part 
of the year.  Including the costs associated with the closure 
of the Eaglescliffe facility,  the Group had a provision for 
environmental costs of $46.2 million at 31 December 2010 
(2009:  $54.7 million) of which $31.2 million relates to 
sites maintained by the Group (2009:  $38.3 million) with 
the remainder relating to sites no longer under Group 
control.  $8.1 million was spent on the Eaglescliffe 
closure programme with an anticipated spend in 2011 
of $7.1 million.

The Group operates several pension plans in different 
countries and a retirement medical scheme in the US.  
The largest of these is the UK deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension 
scheme (“UK Scheme”) which had a deﬁ cit under 
IAS 19 of $28.9 million at the end of 2010,  a decrease 
of $40.5 million compared to 2009.  The UK Scheme is 
relatively mature with approximately 68 per cent of its 
gross liabilities represented by pensions in payment.  
During 2010 the Group concluded the latest triennial 
valuation and funding agreement,  in pounds sterling,  
with the Trustees of the UK Scheme.  The valuation exercise 
resulted in an agreed deﬁ cit,  for funding purposes,  of 
£101.7 million as at 30 September 2008.  Under the related 
funding agreement the Group has agreed to make deﬁ cit 
contributions of £7.1 million in 2010 and,  thereafter,  an 
annual amount of either £8.0 million or £10.0 million,  
depending on whether an EBITDA threshold amount of 
£53.2 million is achieved by the Group in the previous 
ﬁ nancial year.  The higher amount being paid for any 
year in which the threshold is exceeded.  The agreement 
also includes a commitment to increase the annual 
contribution by the same percentage as any increase in 
shareholder dividend,  once the annual dividend exceeds 
the equivalent of 3.5 pence per share.  The next triennial 
valuation will be conducted as of 30 September 2011 and 
the related funding discussions with the Trustees should 
be concluded during 2012.
In 2010 the UK Scheme deﬁ cit,  under IAS 19 and 
excluding currency effects,  declined as a result of an 
increase in the scheme assets of $44.7 million (2009:  
$57.9 million) which more than offset an increase in 
scheme liabilities of $6.5 million (2009:  $105.0 million).  
Scheme liabilities were positively impacted by 
$11.7 million relating to a change in the basis for 
revaluing deferred pensions,  which in the future will 
be based on CPI rather than on RPI.  This change in the 
treatment of deferred member pensions is as a result 
of recent announcements by the Government that it 
intends to use CPI as the  “statutory rate”  for pension 
purposes.  The scheme assets increased in value largely as 
a result of a 12 per cent return on investments in the year 
(2009:  16 per cent).  With the support of the Company 
the Trustees have developed an investment strategy 
that broadly includes 50 per cent of the assets being 
invested in a  “liability matching fund”  and 50 per cent in 
an  “investment fund” .  The liability matching fund consists 
of bonds,  gilts and liquid assets,  plus a portfolio of interest 
and inﬂ ation rate swaps,  constructed in such a way as to 
match the interest and inﬂ ation risks inherent in a similar 
percentage of the scheme liabilities.  The purpose of 
this fund is to ﬁ nance a portion of the liabilities without 
creating signiﬁ cant volatility in the reported deﬁ cit.  The 
investment fund,  on the other hand,  consists of a portfolio 
of  “return seeking”  assets,  largely equities,  with the aim of 
funding part of the liabilities by generating higher returns 
at an acceptable risk while also contributing to reducing 
the deﬁ cit over time.  
The US liabilities in 2010 consist of a pension plan,  with 
a deﬁ cit value of $26.2 million (2009:  $31.3 million) and a 
post-retirement medical plan with a value of $8.2 million 
(2009:  $8.1 million).  The US pension plan is smaller than 
the UK Scheme and is closed to future accruals.  The deﬁ cit 
in the plan declined by $5.1 million (2009:  $10.2 million) 
during the year,  due to an increase in the scheme assets 
of $11.2 million and an increase in the scheme liabilities of 
$6.1 million.  The scheme assets were 74 per cent invested 
in equities and had a return of 15 per cent in the year 
(2009:  28 per cent),  which was the main contributor to the 
increase in value.  The scheme liabilities increased mainly 
due to a fall in real bond yields during the year.
Other liabilities amounted to $4.1 million (2009:  
$2.9 million) and relate to pension plans for a relatively 
small number of people in Germany and an insured plan 
in the Netherlands.

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICA TORS 
The Group’s key performance indicators are a standard set of measures against which each business reports on a 
monthly basis.  Incentive plans include targets against the annual operating plan for operating proﬁ t and average 
trade working capital to sales ratio.  
1.  Operating proﬁ t/operating margin
Operating proﬁ t is the proﬁ t derived from the normal operations of the business.  Operating margin is the ratio of 
operating proﬁ t or loss,  before exceptional items,  to sales.  The Group achieved an operating proﬁ t of $102.3 million 
for the year ended 31 December 2010 (2009:  $36.2 million before exceptional items).  The Group’s operating margin 
was 14.7 per cent compared to 6.4 per cent in 2009.
2.  Average trade working capital to sales ratio
The trade working capital to sales ratio is deﬁ ned as the 12 month average trade working capital divided by sales,  
expressed as a percentage.  Trade working capital comprises inventories,  trade receivables and trade payables.  
It speciﬁ cally excludes prepayments,  capital or interest related receivables or payables,  working capital related to 
acquisitions made in the year and items classiﬁ ed as other receivables and other payables.  The Group’s 12 month 
average trade working capital to sales ratio at 31 December 2010 was 18.0 per cent (2009:  27.7 per cent).  
3.  Return on operating capital employed
The return on operating capital employed is deﬁ ned as operating proﬁ t before exceptional items divided by 
operating capital employed,  expressed as a percentage.  Operating capital employed comprises ﬁ xed assets 
(excluding goodwill),  working capital and operating provisions.  Operating provisions include self insurance and 
environmental provisions but exclude restructuring provisions and retirement beneﬁ t obligations.  The Group’s 
return on operating capital employed was 39.7 per cent for the year ended 31 December 2010 (2009:  13.3 per cent).
4.  Lost time accidents
A lost time accident (“LTA”) is any work related injury or illness sustained by an employee or directly employed 
contractor whilst working at the Group’s premises that results in greater than three days lost,  excluding the day of 
accident.  There were four LTAs in 2010 (2009:  two).  
5.  Contribution margin
Contribution,  which is deﬁ ned as sales less all variable costs,  divided by sales and expressed as a percentage is the 
deﬁ nition of contribution margin.  The Group’s contribution margin in 2010 was 36.2 per cent (2009:  31.6 per cent).  
6.  Operating cash ﬂ ow
The operating cash ﬂ ow is deﬁ ned as the net cash ﬂ ow from operating activities less net capital expenditure but 
excluding income taxes paid or received,  interest paid or received,  pension contributions net of current service cost 
and exceptional items.  In 2010 the operating cash ﬂ ow was $112.9 million (2009:  $49.5 million). COMPANY OVERVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
Risk management framework and review
The Board is ultimately responsible for the management 
of risk in the Group.  With guidance from management 
and advisers,  where appropriate,  it sets the tone for 
the Group’s policies on risk,  appetite for risk and levels 
of risk tolerance and speciﬁ cally approves:  the Group’s 
insurance programme and risk management policies 
and plans;  signiﬁ cant insurance and/or legal claims 
and/or settlements;  major acquisitions,  disposals and 
capital expenditures;  and the Group’s Annual Operating 
and Three Year Plans.  The day to day management 
of risk is delegated to the executive directors and the 
management team,  who have speciﬁ c responsibility for 
ensuring compliance with and implementing policies 
at corporate,  divisional and business unit level.  The 
Board retains an oversight role and has a schedule of 
matters speciﬁ cally reserved to it for decision,  with 
strict delegation of authority limits that have been 
communicated throughout the businesses and 
are well understood by the management team and 
business leaders.
Figure 1 shows the key components of the Elementis risk 
management framework.  It shows that the management 
of risk is embedded at every level throughout the 
Group,  and involves a continuous and active process 
of risk evaluation and review of policies,  processes and 
compliance.  In addition,  our holistic approach to risk 
management is supported by speciﬁ c roles and activities 
that are undertaken during the year,  and these are 
summarised on the right.
Principal features of the Elementis risk 
management system
The Group’s risk management arrangements and 
processes are integrated with the management of the 
businesses and comprise the following elements:
•
  Regular review at Board level (as a formal agenda 
item in at least four meetings each year plus on an 
ad hoc basis);  
•
  Monthly review at management team level,  including 
of policies,  organisation,  resources and business and 
corporate risks;  
•
  Schedule of matters reserved for Board decision only 
together with speciﬁ c delegation of authorities;  
•
  Group risk management policy and associated 
guidance and procedures;  
•
  Insurance and risk transference strategy;  
•
  Group compliance audit and employee training 
programmes;  
•
  Presentations and reports from business units to 
management team and Board;  
•
  Risk mapping and assessment exercises,  with a 
comprehensive Group risk register identifying risk 
mitigation actions;  
•
  Business continuity planning including testing and 
simulation exercises;  
•
  Review of litigation by the Board in conjunction with 
the Group General Counsel;  
•
  Internal audit programme;  and 
•
  Role of Audit Committee in monitoring ﬁ nancial 
controls and the reporting of performance.

A key aspect of our risk management system is the 
Company’s system of internal control and the processes 
that have been put in place to manage the associated 
ﬁ nancial,  operational and compliance risks and keep 
them under review.  An important part of the internal 
control framework is the internal audit service and the role 
of the Audit Committee.  The internal audit programme 
is managed by PricewaterhouseCoopers,  under the 
direction of the Finance Director,  reports to the Audit 
Committee and involves a series of planned and surprise 
audits at Group and tolling sites during the year.  These 
have a strong emphasis on ﬁ nancial controls but often 
include other aspects of business risks and controls,  
such as health,  safety and environment reporting,  and 
compliance with anti-corruption policies.  The report of 
the Audit Committee,  including a description of its role,  
and the statement on internal control are set out in the 
Corporate governance report on pages 31 to 33.  
Principal risks and uncertainties
A list of the principal risks to the business that were 
discussed by the Board during the year is shown in 
the table opposite,  together with the context of the 
discussions relative to the Group’s strategy and operating 
plans,  business model and performance.  The Board also 
discussed other risks and risk mitigation action,  as part 
of its review of the Group’s risk register,  that are not 
disclosed opposite.  These more general discussions 
included anti-corruption policies and procedures,  our 
business continuity and emergency response plans (for 
example to a major site incident),  and site operational 
matters (such as plant security,  safety and key role 
succession plans).  
Treasury policies and objectives
Treasury activities are governed by policies and 
procedures approved and monitored by the Board.  
The Group operates a central treasury function which 
manages and monitors external and internal funding 
requirements and the following treasury risks:
•
 Credit risk,
•
 Liquidity risk,
•
 Market risk.
These risks and the Group’s policies to manage them are 
set out in Note 22 to the Financial Statements.

Risk and Impact
1) Double-dip recession
Poor trading conditions or slower than forecast GDP growth 
rates mean lower volumes,  which can lead to lower output 
and capacity utilisation levels;  erosion of operating margins;  
reduced productivity and proﬁ tability;  lower earnings and 
cash ﬂ ow can lead to bank covenant breach.
2) Disruption to raw material supplies
Shortage of key raw materials owing to supply difﬁ culties,  
transportation strikes or increased prices,  would disrupt 
operations,  leading to lower output and capacity utilisation 
levels,  erosion of operating margins,  and reduced 
productivity and proﬁ tability.
3) Availability of ﬁ nancing
Availability of ﬁ nancing (on acceptable terms) to the 
Company to ensure funding for growth plans and,  if 
available,  acquisitions.  Failure would compromise growth 
and acquisition plans,  and place a strain on cash ﬂ ows.
4) Litigation and other claims from products and 
historical and ongoing operations
Costs of defending claims or regulatory actions,  or 
obligations to pay damages or ﬁ nes,  could reduce 
proﬁ tability;  negative press coverage could damage 
business reputation and value.
5) UK pension fund
Changes to assumptions used in valuing UK pension fund 
deﬁ cit can lead to an increase in funding costs;  size of 
pension deﬁ cit can impact the Company’ s share price 
and value.
6) Loss of strategic direction
Either through not identifying and making acquisitions or not 
diverting enough resources to developing new products/
markets,  leading to loss of competitive advantage. COMPANY OVERVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION

BUSINESS REVIEW Elementis joined the 
FTSE4Good Index in 
September 2009
18 Elementis plc  Annual report and accounts 2010
Introduction
Elementis has continued to run its businesses with a 
high level of interest in,  and concern for,  its corporate 
and social responsibilities (“CSR”).  The Company has 
developed its programme in this area over a number of 
years and our commitment was recognised in September 
2009 when Elementis was judged to have met the 
criteria for inclusion in the FTSE4Good global responsible 
investment index.  
The Company’s CSR activities are centred on four core 
areas:  people,  community,  environment and business 
relationships.  Each of these areas is critical to the 
operation of the business and long term success of the 
Company,  which is why the Group Chief Executive is 
responsible for these areas at Board level.  
People
Our employees are our most valuable asset and drive the 
success of our Group at all levels,  from product innovation 
and technology leadership to business performance and 
customer service.  With our workforce spread across three 
continents (41 per cent in North America,  27 per cent 
in Europe and 32 per cent in Asia),  it is essential that we 
have one set of corporate values that all our employees 
can identify with and our HR policies and practices are 
designed to do exactly that.  We have one Elementis 
culture which is to be innovative,  successful,  responsible 
and leaders in the sectors in which we operate.  To foster 
this kind of culture,  we have policies and guidance 
that encourage and support positive behaviours.  
Some of these policies and examples of our culture 
are described below.
Business ethics 
The Elementis Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
(the  “Code”),  which is supported by anti-corruption 
and anti-harassment policies and related guidance,  is 
something that all employees sign-up to and receive 
training on.  It helps employees understand the standards 
of ethical business practices that are expected from them 
at work,  and to be aware of ethical and legal issues that 
they may encounter in the course of carrying out their 
duties and responsibilities.  In addition,  our businesses are 
required to ensure independent contractors,  consultants,  
agents and sales representatives who represent the 
Group agree to the same high standards as the Group’s 
employees while working on Group business.  
The following is a summary of the Code’s key features:
•  
Knowledge of and compliance with the Code is 
expected and all employees have a duty to report 
violations,  supported by a non-retaliation policy and 
whistleblowing procedures;  
•  
Rules on complying with all applicable laws,  rules and 
regulations including anti-trust,  bribery and insider 
dealing;  and 
•  
Rules and guidance on:  conﬂ icts of interest;  political 
donations and outside activities/interests;  gifts,  
gratuities and loans;  conﬁ dential information and 
privacy;  fair dealing with customers,  suppliers and 
other third parties;  and anti-harassment.  
Health and safety
The Group takes the health and safety of all its employees,  
contractors and visitors to its premises very seriously.  
Policies,  practices and performance,  which are reviewed 
routinely by senior operations management,  are 
supported by guidance and training,  and a programme 
of health and safety compliance audits on a three 
yearly rolling cycle.  There is a well established incident 
notiﬁ cation and reporting system in place,  so that 
all recordable safety incidents are reported to the 
management team and the Board.  Investigations are 
carried out following any incidents or near misses with 
corrective action being taken to mitigate the risk of their 
recurrence,  and the results and improvements are shared 
throughout Group sites.  
A summary of the Group’s policy on health,  safety and 
environmental matters can be found on the Group’s 
website at:  
www.elementisplc.com/governance-responsibility
Safety performance
The Company’s safety goal is zero recordable incidents 
and we seek to achieve this through maintaining our 
strong focus on,  and commitment to,  safety design,  
safe behaviours and high safety standards.  
The principal measure of safety performance used 
across the Group is recordable incidents (as deﬁ ned by 
the US Occupational Safety & Health Administration).  
Recordable incidents are work related injuries and 
illnesses that require medical treatment beyond ﬁ rst aid.  
An important sub-set of recordable injuries is lost time 
accidents (“LTAs”),  which generally reﬂ ect on the severity 
of such injuries and illnesses.  
During 2010,  the number of recordable incidents 
increased from nine in the previous year to 14 globally.  
All incidents were investigated thoroughly to establish 
root causes and identify appropriate corrective actions.  
The primary cause of this increase was due to an unusual 
number of incidents in non-production areas,  for example,  
slipping in the ofﬁ ce car park while it was raining,  falling 
when carrying coffee cups while walking up stairs or 
cutting a thumb when using glass laboratory equipment.  
The number of incidents occurring within plant 
operations was similar to last year.  None of the incidents 
is expected to have long term effects on the employees.  
However,  the abnormal number of ofﬁ ce incidents has 
led to a signiﬁ cant increase in safety awareness training in 
those areas.  The Board has taken a close interest in these 
developments and it is a priority for management that 
these issues are fully addressed.

Elementis recognises international standards for human 
rights and strives to ensure equality of opportunity 
and fair rewards for expertise and knowledge at all its 
locations globally.  Details of our employment policies 
and information about employee communication 
are summarised in the Directors’  report on page 26.  
The Company also recognises that its employees and 
contractors,  customers and suppliers (where relevant),  
have a right to expect the Group to respect their wider 
fundamental human rights and is supportive of this 
view.  The Group’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
sets standards and provides guidance to ensure that,  
wherever relevant or practicable,  consideration is 
taken in business decisions of the wider fundamental 
human rights of all employees,  contractors,  customers 
and suppliers.  
Having policies in place is one way of showing 
commitment to CSR issues,  but the examples that follow 
demonstrate the Elementis culture in action.  During last 
year,  150 employees out of 228 at the Delden facility in 
the Netherlands took part in the Elementis Cup football 
tournament.  In the US,  71 employees were recognised for 
ﬁ ve year service milestones in celebratory presentations 
held at various locations.  Every year,  the management 
headquarters in Hightstown,  New Jersey hosts a 
Thanksgiving event for employees.  At another family 
event,  337 employees and family members attended a 
summer picnic.  At the Songjiang plant,  in Shanghai,  200 
employees took part in a rigorous team-building event,  
complete with obstacle courses.  
These are just a few examples of our Elementis culture 
in action and,  throughout the year,  employees also get 
together to support charities and other community 
events and campaigns in a variety of different ways.  
These are described below.  
Community 
Elementis understands the need to work with local 
communities to provide information on its activities and 
be a responsible neighbour.  A good example of this 
commitment is the ongoing work of employees at our 
Newberry Springs site in California,  which is situated 
in a desert region.  The Specialty Products business is 
a sponsoring partner of the Mojave Environmental 
Education Consortium (“MEEC”),  a partnership 
programme between businesses and state departments 
and agencies,  which provides many environmental 
education programmes and resources for teachers and 
students.  As well as our involvement through the MEEC,  
employees at Newberry Springs,  where our unique 
hectorite mine is located,  also run four educational tours 
each year,  covering various aspects of the plant and mine 
operations,  such as its history,  uses of industrial minerals,  
mining operations and maintenance of plant equipment.
As well as the total number of recordable incidents,  the 
Board monitors the overall trend,  or the recordable 
incident rate,  which for 2010 was 1.10 per 200,000 hours 
worked (2009:  0.69).  Notwithstanding the increase in 
recordable incidents last year,  our recordable incident 
rate (based on American Chemistry Council – Responsible 
Care statistics) continues to show that our performance 
is comparable with companies that are generally viewed 
as  “best in class” .
 
 Elementis

(ACC data for 2010 not available)
Elementis also monitors its safety performance using the 
UK Health & Safety Executive’s deﬁ nition of LTAs (greater 
than three days lost,  not including day of incident).  Using 
this measure,  four of the recordable incidents were 
classed as LTAs in 2010 (2009:  two),  which equates to a 
rate of 0.16 LTAs per 100,000 hours worked (2009:  0.08).
To ensure comprehensive monitoring of our safety 
performance,  Elementis also records and reports 
separately the recordable injury rate for contractors 
working at our sites.  Contractors are closely supervised 
and are subject to compliance with Elementis safe 
systems of work.  As a result,  the safety performance of 
contractors is generally comparable to that for Elementis 
employees.  The contractor recordable injury rate in 2010 
was 1.5 per 200,000 hours worked (2009:  0.63).  
Training,  employment policies and practices
As well as employment policies and related guidance,  the 
Group recognises the importance of providing training.  
Web-based,  modular training courses,  designed in 
conjunction with the Integrity Interactive Corporation,  
are offered to employees across the Group.  Some of these 
courses are mandatory for all employees,  such as training 
on the Code,  and others are only mandatory depending 
on the job,  role or position.  These courses include topics 
such as  “Mutual respect in the workplace” ,   “Human 
rights” ,   “Environmental stewardship” ,   “Anti-trust” ,   “Privacy 
and data protection”  and  “Financial integrity” .  Courses 
are offered in multiple languages.  There is also great 
emphasis at sites on health and safety training.

Another part of our wider commitment involves 
encouraging and supporting employees to be active in 
their communities through volunteer work or fundraising.  
Elementis takes a decentralised approach to working with 
the communities in which we operate.  The Company 
sets guidelines but does not dictate any speciﬁ c areas or 
priority for corporate support,  since we are aware that 
needs and priorities vary from community to community.  
This bottom up approach is designed to encourage 
management and employees at individual sites to focus 
on local issues and to take the initiative.  
The preference is to support the areas and causes in 
which our employees participate.  The following are 
examples of some of the causes that enjoyed corporate 
support in 2010.  Elementis and its employees in the 
US have been supporters for many years of Cape Fear 
Area United Way in Wilmington,  North Carolina near our 
Castle Hayne chromium site and United Way of Greater 
Milwaukee where we have a smaller processing facility 
serving a local leather tannery.  United Way is a network of 
volunteer-driven,  non-proﬁ t organisations that work with 
many other partners and programmes,  involving local 
government departments and agencies and other civic 
and community groups,  to address many different areas 
of need in local communities.  These include,  as examples,  
homelessness,  poverty,  unemployment,  education or 
health related needs.  Our employees support these 
United Way organisations because they target support 
locally at charities and causes in very broad and diversiﬁ ed 
areas.  An example of this very local approach is providing 
after school programming for children from unstable 
homes or providing prescription discount cards to those 
who do not have medical insurance.  As well as ﬁ nancial 
support,  our employees have also served on the board of 
directors in these organisations.  
Other examples of corporate support include:  sponsoring 
an employee who participated in the London Marathon 
to raise funds for the Alzheimer’s Society;  matching 
donations raised by a group of employees from our 
Livingston plant,  who participated in a fundraising 
walk to Ben Nevis,  in order to help fund home care to 
a young girl who has a serious medical condition;  and 
sponsoring a child from Belarus,  organised by the Friends 
of Chernobyl’s Children UK registered charity.  
Including donations made in the UK,  which are disclosed 
on page 28,  the Group made charitable donations worth 
more than $56,040 in 2010 (2009:  $36,724) to over 40 
(2009:  35) different groups or organisations supporting 
various causes in and around the locality of our ofﬁ ces 
and plants around the globe.  As well as the speciﬁ c 
examples given,  organisations and groups supported 
last year include the global Red Cross relief effort for the 
earthquake in Haiti,  local youth and sports clubs,  schools,  
arts groups,  hospice and other welfare related groups,  
a drought relief and education initiative,  and medical 
research and health related charities.  
Environment
Elementis seeks to operate its facilities in a way that 
minimises the impact on the environment.  We view 
compliance with all applicable legal requirements and 
other codes of practice as our minimum standard.  Our 
sustainable development strategy requires that we work 
proactively to reduce emissions,  minimise waste from 
our processes,  conserve valuable natural resources and 
ensure responsible product stewardship throughout the 
supply chain.
In addition to complying with environmental regulatory 
reporting requirements,  Elementis records and 
categorises incidents into tiers based on the severity 
of the incident on the environment or actions taken by 
regulatory authorities.  Tier 3 incidents are those that have 
an impact on the environment and require reporting to 
an external authority,  who are likely to take action.  Tier 2 
incidents have a minor impact and require notiﬁ cation 
but are likely to result in minimal or no action by the 
authorities.  Tier 1 incidents require no external reporting 
and are recorded internally and investigated so that 
continual improvements can be made to reduce the 
likelihood of future Tier 2 and Tier 3 incidents.  
Environmental performance
Our target is to comply with all environmental regulations 
and permits,  with zero environmental incidents classed 
as Elementis Tiers 2 and 3.  Beyond that we strive for 
continual improvement in standards to reduce our impact 
on the environment.
In 2010 Elementis had excellent success in preventing 
environmental incidents:  once again there were no Tier 
2 or Tier 3 incidents (2009:  zero Tier 2 or Tier 3).  As noted 
above we do not report Tier 1 incidents externally as these 
are treated as operational learning opportunities rather 
than non-compliances.
Emissions to air,  discharges to water and waste disposal 
are regulated by external authorities and controlled 
carefully within Elementis.  The table overleaf shows our 
performance in this area as well as our water and energy 
usage over the past three years.  
Some of the data presented in Table 1 is inﬂ uenced 
by production levels,  so an increase or decrease does 
not necessarily mean our performance in these areas 
have improved or deteriorated.  The impact on levels of 
production as a result of the economic recovery in 2010,  
the recession and the closure of the Eaglescliffe facility 
in 2009,  are reﬂ ected in the data for these years.  The 
columns showing per tonne of production are affected 
by changes in the product mix and plant efﬁ ciencies.  As is 
standard practice in the chemical industry,  some emission 
values may be calculated from energy use or based on 
samples rather than continuous monitoring.  However,  
environmental emissions,  discharges and solid waste data 
are subject to periodic internal audits to ensure accuracy 
and consistency of reporting.   COMPANY OVERVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
 Annual report and accounts 2010 Elementis plc   21
Emissions to air
As reported in previous annual reports,  Elementis is 
committed to reducing,  wherever it can,  its emissions of 
greenhouse gases (“GHG”),  such as carbon dioxide (“CO 2 ”),  
and complies with relevant national CO 2 reduction 
schemes,  such as the Carbon Reduction Commitment 
energy efﬁ ciency scheme in the UK.  In addition,  a project 
is underway at our Chromium plant at Castle Hayne 
that will allow the substitution of natural gas for fuel oil 
in powering our production kilns.  This project has the 
potential to reduce combustion generated CO 2 emissions 
at the site by up to 25 per cent.  
The Group’s operations also result in some emissions of 
the oxides of sulphur and nitrogen,  which can cause acid 
rain.  Volatile organic compounds,  where emitted,  can 
damage soil and ground water or combine with nitrogen 
oxide to cause smog.  However,  all these emissions are 
controlled to comply with regulatory permits and,  as the 
volumes are not considered to be signiﬁ cant,  they are not 
reported here.  
Discharges to water
Maintaining the water quality of the areas in which we 
operate is a regulatory issue and vital to protect the 
ecosystems and communities in which we operate.  The 
Group’s production activity generates process efﬂ uent 
with low concentrations of organic material that are 
discharged to water.  This is measured as chemical and 
biological oxygen demand.  These are regulated by 
external authorities and managed carefully by Elementis.  
However,  the volumes of these discharges are not 
considered to be signiﬁ cant and are not reported here.  
Any emissions to air or discharges to water above 
regulatory permitted levels will continue to be reported 
each year under environmental incidents.  
Water consumption
With the exception of the hectorite mine in California,  
the Company does not operate in areas of extreme water 
shortage.  Nevertheless,  water is a valuable resource and 
the Company recognises the global need to conserve 
water.  Water consumption is minimised where possible 
by treatment and recycling.  
As stated above,  in addition to output levels,  product 
mix and plant utilisation can inﬂ uence consumption levels 
at the per tonne level.  With production levels in 2010 
recovering from 2009 to,  and exceeding,  2008 levels,  
total water consumption increased in 2010,  but was less 
than the 2008 ﬁ gure,  owing to product mix.  However,  
the consumption rate per tonne showed a small 
increasing trend over the three years to 2010.  This trend 
reﬂ ects the utilisation levels in 2009,  when plants were 
operating at less than full capacity,  and changes to 
product mix in 2010.  
Energy consumption
The Group is committed to reducing,  wherever it can,  its 
consumption of energy because the use of fossil fuels in 
energy production can contribute to global warming in 
the form of GHG.  There is also the added incentive that 
energy is an expensive resource and its efﬁ cient use has a 
signiﬁ cant effect on the cost of production.  As the Group 
uses a range of fuel sources purchased conventionally in 
a variety of units,  we report usage in gigajoules (“GJ”) to 
provide consistent energy units.  Much of the decrease 
in energy consumption per tonne in 2010 is directly 
attributable to the smaller Chromium business.  The 
production of chromium chemicals accounted for 69.9 
per cent of the energy consumption in the Group (2009:  
73.5 per cent).

BUSINESS REVIEW 22 Elementis plc  Annual report and accounts 2010
Solid waste
As part of our commitment to sustainable development,  
Elementis seeks to minimise the quantity of all types of 
waste.  The quantity of hazardous waste resulting from our 
operations has reduced signiﬁ cantly over the last decade.  
The increase in 2009,  as explained in last year’s annual 
report,  was due to some speciﬁ c site remediation projects.  
The low level that remains is highly controlled and subject 
to licensed disposal.  Non-hazardous waste is minimised 
and recycled as far as possible.  Non-hazardous waste is 
predominantly the inert residue from the chromate kiln 
operations,  which is deposited in our own permitted 
impoundments and licensed landﬁ ll sites adjacent to the 
manufacturing facilities.
The Group encourages the re-use,  reduction and 
recycling of general ofﬁ ce waste and recycling schemes 
are in place at various ofﬁ ce locations.  The amount of 
general ofﬁ ce waste is not reported separately from non-
hazardous waste,  as the volumes are not considered to 
be signiﬁ cant.
Product stewardship 
Elementis recognises its responsibility to ensure that its 
products are safe for intended use,  transport and the 
environment.  Safe use is guided by long experience of 
many of our products in conjunction with third party 
studies and regulatory requirements.  Information is 
provided via technical bulletins,  safety data sheets and 
labelling – supported by discussion with our customers 
and suppliers,  and participation in studies by industry 
associations.  
We continuously adopt a consistent and coordinated 
approach to regulatory matters concerning our products 
at global,  national and regional levels which complement 
industry voluntary efforts.  Where new regulations are 
required,  we believe they should be based on established 
scientiﬁ c risk assessment and risk management 
principles.  They should be predictable,  ﬂ exible and 
capable of responsibly addressing society’s economic,  
environmental and safety requirements.
The Group is fully engaged in the European REACh 
programme with more than 700 substances pre-
registered to cover products manufactured in Europe,  
imported products and required raw materials.  To 
support our global customers and markets,  we 
implemented a structure to enable us to provide  “Only 
Representative”  services under REACh to cover imports 
into Europe by Group entities and key customers.  The 
Product Stewardship team is involved in many consortia 
coordinating the REACh registration of our most 
important product categories.  We will continue providing 
active support to consortia and organisations such as 
CEFIC (European Chemical Industry Council) and SIEF 
(Substance Information Exchange Forum) as appropriate.  
In 2010,  we registered the REACh Tier 1 substances and 
submitted notiﬁ cations of over 1,300 substances to ECHA 
(European Chemicals Agency) for classiﬁ cation,  labelling 
and packaging.  Elementis was compliant with all EU 
Globally Harmonised System (“GHS”) safety data sheets 
(“SDS”) and labels for the required non-mixture products 
on 1 December 2010.  Our new GHS SDS and labels are 
designed with colour HAZCOM pictographs and all 
necessary languages for the EU.  
In addition to complying with the REACh regulatory 
requirements for its products,  during 2010 Elementis 
implemented new systems,  assessments and documents 
to comply with the United Nations GHS for classiﬁ cation 
and labelling rules in many countries around the 
world.  We can now publish documents in more than 
35 languages.  Many other countries are revising and 
authorising new chemical control legislation.  Elementis 
is actively meeting these new regulations in our global 
markets.  For example in Japan,  we have prepared new 
GHS SDS and labels for all products in Japanese for their 
new Chemical Substances Control Law.  In Taiwan,  we 
have notiﬁ ed all substances in our global product range 
for the new Taiwan chemical inventory list.
R&D and sustainable development
Among others,  our R&D projects continue to be driven 
by the speciﬁ c objectives of:  
1.  reduction in the use of materials that contribute to 
greenhouse gases;
2.  elimination of hazardous air pollutants from our 
products;  and 
3.  expanded use of bio-based materials in our products.  
As such,  we are working collaboratively with large global 
coatings producers to replace rheological additives that 
contain a high percentage of volatile organic compounds 
(“VOC”).  Our non-VOC alternatives maintain the desired 
performance and enable a high quality coating.  This 
project is at an advanced stage of implementation.  
Additionally,  we have pro-actively moved to replace the 
hazardous air pollutants (“HAP”) used in our resin binder 
products,  with non-HAP alternatives.  To date we have 
successfully made this change to more than 50 per cent 
of our portfolio of resins and will continue this initiative 
throughout 2011.  
We are also working closely with external agencies to 
speed up our development programmes that expanded 
our portfolio of bio-based materials.  In one effort,  our 
collaboration with a government agency will result in our 
offering to the cosmetics market,  in the very near future,  
more products derived from renewable plant sources.  
Our commitment to these and other environmentally 
friendly initiatives remains very high.

These interactions provide the opportunity for resolving 
minor issues before they become signiﬁ cant.  All 
customer complaints are investigated in a timely fashion,  
documented and a response given to the customer.  
Many in the workforce have been trained in statistical 
techniques and these are utilised where appropriate in 
monitoring the processes and evaluating the ﬁ nal product 
speciﬁ cation.  Like the Specialty Products and Surfactants 
businesses,  some of our products are customised to 
meet the speciﬁ cations and applications of individual 
customers.  
Another area where Elementis Chromium has been 
working with customers closely for many years is in 
reducing exposure to workers using our products.  To 
meet environmental regulations on personal exposure 
limits,  the business has devised an intermediate bulk 
container system,  which mechanises the way products 
are transferred to our customers’  systems,  and has been 
helping customers move away from manual handling of 
small packages to our mechanised bulk transfer system.  
Suppliers and supply chain
Our global sourcing team recognises their role in and 
responsibility for positively inﬂ uencing our worldwide 
suppliers to encourage and promote more social 
responsibility and greater environmental awareness.  
The extensive use of strategic sourcing specialists and 
long term supply relationships have enabled us to 
develop collaborative partnerships with our suppliers.  
Our joint efforts have resulted in the expanded use of 
materials derived from renewable plant sources,  for 
example,  our purchase of plant-based materials,  which 
are more sustainable on the environment than animal-
based materials or derivatives,  have risen by over 150 per 
cent since 2007 to approximately $7 million in 2010.  Plant-
based materials are used in the production of coatings 
additives (castor-based materials) and for use in our 
consumer business.  As we grow this business,  we expect 
our purchase of plant-based materials to increase.
Our supply chain organisation has played a central 
role in leveraging the beneﬁ ts of social responsibility 
and environmental awareness across the global 
organisation to reach all functions and all geographies.  
In 2010 we completed an upgrade to our ERP system 
thus establishing the platform for future initiatives 
with measurable metrics.  To support our work in this 
area,  a Groupwide employee training programme is 
in place which includes courses on Mutual Respect,  
Environmental Awareness in Manufacturing and 
Environmental Stewardship.  
During the year the Group implemented a supplier 
ﬁ nance facility for our businesses in the UK and Europe,  
through one of the members of our bank facility 
syndicate.  This supplier facility helps the business to 
manage its working capital more efﬁ ciently and provides 
participating suppliers with greater ﬂ exibility in terms of 
managing their receivables.  
Biodiversity 
Elementis takes care to ensure that its activities do not 
cause long term damage to the biodiversity in the areas 
where it has operations.  In this regard,  the Group has 
policies and systems in place to ensure full compliance 
with environmental requirements.  
Business relationships 
Customers
Each of our business strategies has as its cornerstone 
superior customer service with a focus on offering 
competitively priced,  high quality products that are 
supported by strong technical support.  Best in class 
customer service is a critical element in helping our 
customers be more successful in their competitive 
markets and in how we differentiate ourselves from 
competition.  In Specialty Products and Surfactants our 
customer service standards were revised and updated 
in 2010 to improve our supply chain efﬁ ciency and 
effectiveness and to make it easier for our customers 
to do business with us.  We monitor our performance 
with metrics such as OTIF (on-time,  in full delivery),  with 
business processes that address customer complaints 
and in capturing the voice of the customer with 
periodic customer satisfaction surveys.  We develop 
and nurture close customer relationships with our key 
account business process,  through our participation in 
trade shows and industry forums as well as conducting 
numerous group workshops,  training seminars and 
hosting collaborative laboratory sessions to work with 
customers one-on-one.  In China alone,  we organised 
seven open and 28 in-house seminars for our customers,  
hosted four technical conferences and participated 
in World Expo 2010 in Shanghai,  ChinaCoat 2010 (the 
largest coatings show in the world) and Paint India Show 
2010.  A similar level of commitment was undertaken in 
North America and Europe,  for example,  the business 
participated in coatings shows held in Las Vegas,  
Charlotte,  Mexico City,  São Paulo as well as in Genoa,  
Dubai and Istanbul,  reaching out to existing and new 
customers in these exciting growing markets.
In terms of quality management systems,  all ten of our 
global manufacturing facilities in the Specialty Products 
and Surfactants businesses are certiﬁ ed to the ISO 90001 
standard.  In addition,  during 2010,  the HSE and quality 
team implemented the 5S workplace organisation 
methodology at all sites in Specialty Products and 
Surfactants.  The 5S methodology helps to focus the 
organisation on effective work place organisation and 
standardised work procedures by simplifying the work 
environment,  reducing waste and non-value activity 
while improving quality,  efﬁ ciency and safety.  Our quality 
systems also utilise statistical process control to ensure 
product quality and consistency,  and to drive process 
improvements.
Elementis Chromium also has an effective customer 
service system that supplies high quality products to 
its customers.  The system incorporates many of the 
elements of ISO 9000 systems.  Since the customer base is 
relatively small,  there are frequent interactions between 
the customers and the commercial services group.

Employment policies
The Group Chief Executive is the Board member responsible for 
employee matters and he is assisted by the Vice-President of Global 
Human Resources.  The Group employs HR specialists throughout its 
worldwide locations to advise on all HR matters including training 
and development,  and various HR performance indicators are 
maintained in order to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of 
employment policies.
Elementis values the diverse backgrounds of all its people and 
works to create an open atmosphere of trust,  honesty and respect.  
Harassment or discrimination of any kind – including that involving 
race,  colour,  religion,  gender,  age,  national origin,  citizenship,  mental 
or physical disabilities,  sexual orientation,  veteran status,  or any other 
similarly protected status – is unacceptable.  This principle applies to 
all aspects of employment,  including recruitment,  hiring,  placement,  
transfer,  promotion,  layoff,  recall,  termination and other terms and 
conditions of employment.  The Group is committed to providing 
equal employment opportunities for all Elementis people and all 
applicants for employment,  based on individual qualiﬁ cations and 
without regard to the factors mentioned above.  It is Group policy to 
comply with all applicable laws governing employment practices 
and not to discriminate on the basis of any unlawful criteria,  and its 
practices include the prohibition on the use of child or forced labour.  
Employment policies are fair and equitable and consistent with the 
skills and abilities of the employee and the needs of the business.  
Elementis respects the rights of its employees to join a trade union or 
participate in collective bargaining arrangements and,  out of its global 
workforce,  approximately one third of all employees are represented 
by a trade union or collective agreements.  
In terms of how our employment policies are applied to employees 
who have or acquire a disability,  the Group’s policy is,  wherever 
practicable,  to provide continuing employment under normal terms 
and conditions and to provide training,  career development and 
promotion to disabled employees wherever appropriate.  
The Board expects the Group to conduct its operations based on 
sound ethical practices which are open and free from discrimination 
and harassment.  Further information about the Group’s policy 
on business conduct and ethics is set out in the Corporate social 
responsibility report.  
Employee communications and involvement
It is Group policy to communicate with all employees on major 
matters to encourage them to take a wider interest in the affairs of 
their employing company and the Group and to make them aware 
of the ﬁ nancial and economic factors affecting the Company’s 
performance.  This is done in a variety of ways including informal 
consultations,  bulletins and brieﬁ ng sessions.  There are well 
established procedures,  including regular meetings with recognised 
unions,  to ensure that the views of employees are taken into 
account in making decisions likely to affect their interests.  Managers 
throughout the Group have a responsibility to keep their staff 
informed of developments and matters of interest.  The Company 
operates savings-related share option schemes allowing UK and US 
employees an opportunity to become shareholders,  details of which 
are set out in Note 25 to the Financial Statements on page 79.
Report and ﬁ nancial statements
The directors submit their report and the audited ﬁ nancial statements 
for the year ended 31 December 2010.
Principal activities,  business review and future development 
For the purposes of this report,  the expression  “Company”  
or  “Elementis”  means Elementis plc and the expression  “Group”  means 
the Company and its subsidiaries.
The main activities of the Group are the manufacture and sale of 
specialty chemicals.  The Chairman’s statement and the Business 
review both form part of this report.  The Business review,  on pages 
2 to 23,  contains a fair review of,  and likely future trends and factors 
that might affect,  the development,  performance and position of 
the Group.  A review of the Group’s risk management framework as 
well as principal risks and uncertainties is set out on pages 15 to 17,  
and policies on ﬁ nancial risk can be found in Note 22 to the Financial 
Statements on page 66.  The Corporate social responsibility report 
on pages 18 to 23 summarises the Group’s policy on business 
conduct and ethics,  and sets out its approach to health and safety,  
the environment,  social responsibility and community matters.
The Group undertakes,  on a continuing basis,  research and 
development activities for new products and to improve existing 
products.
Corporate governance
This Directors’  report constitutes the management report for the 
purposes of the UK Listing Authority’s Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules (“DTR”).  In addition,  the Corporate governance report on 
page 30,  the Directors’  responsibility statement on page 29 and the 
biographical information on the directors shown on page 25 all form 
part of this Directors’  report for the purposes of the DTR.

parent amounted to $74.1 million (2009:  loss of $57.4 million).
Dividend
Details about the ﬁ nal dividend for the year are disclosed in the 
Chairman’s statement on page 2.
Directors
The directors of the Company are Robert Beeston,  Ian Brindle,  
Andrew Christie,  David Dutro,  Chris Girling,  Kevin Matthews and 
Brian Taylorson.  All these directors served on the Board throughout 
the ﬁ nancial year.  More information about the directors is provided 
in the Corporate governance report.
The interests of directors in the share capital of the Company are set 
out in the Directors’  remuneration report.
Re-election of directors
The directors decided during the year that they would adopt early 
the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code concerning the 
annual re-election of all directors of FTSE 350 companies.  At the 2011 
Annual General Meeting (“AGM”),  all directors will therefore retire and 
offer themselves for re-election by shareholders.

COMPANY OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
Signiﬁ cant agreements – change of control
Other than as set out in this paragraph,  there are no signiﬁ cant 
agreements to which the Company is a party which take effect,  alter 
or terminate in the event of change of control of the Company.  The 
Company is a guarantor under the Group’s $200 million revolving 
credit facility which runs until 31 July 2014.  Under the terms of that 
facility,  in the event of a change of control,  any lender among the 
facility syndicate,  of which there are six with commitments ranging 
from $20 million to $45 million,  may withdraw from the facility and 
that lender’s participation in any loans drawn down are required 
to be repaid.  
Under David Dutro’s service contract with the Company,  
compensation is payable to him equivalent to one year’s basic salary if 
he terminates his contract upon a change of control provided that the 
Company has not ﬁ rst obtained a written agreement to be bound by 
his service contract from any successor in a change of control.  There 
is no speciﬁ c change of control provision in Brian Taylorson’s service 
contract with the Company but the provisions on early termination 
set out on page 35 of the Directors’  remuneration report apply and 
compensation equivalent to one year’s basic salary and beneﬁ ts 
would be payable if less than 12 months’  notice of termination by the 
Company is given.  
The rules of the Company’s various share incentive schemes set 
out the consequences of a change of control of the Company on 
the rights of the participants under those schemes.  Under the rules 
of the respective schemes,  participants will generally be able to 
exercise their options on a change of control,  provided that the 
relevant performance conditions have been satisﬁ ed and,  where 
relevant,  options are not exchanged for new options granted by an 
acquiring company.  
Signiﬁ cant relationships
The Group has in place a number of supply contracts for key raw 
materials that are essential to the business.  In Specialty Products,  
supply contracts are for clays,  quaternary amines and other chemical 
intermediates.  The suppliers of these contracts are important and,  
although we have sought to develop a strategic long term relationship 
with them,  we have taken steps to maintain a sufﬁ ciently broad base 
of suppliers to mitigate any supply chain risks.  Specialty Products 
also owns and operates a hectorite clay mine in California which 
reduces our reliance on third party suppliers for raw materials.  The 
Surfactants business sources a number of products from a reasonably 
wide base of third party suppliers for use in the manufacturing of 
its products.  These include supplies for ethylene oxide,  propylene 
oxide,  nonylphenol ethoxylate and fatty alcohols.  The Chromium 
division’s key raw materials are chrome ore,  soda ash and sulphuric 
acid.  Chrome ore is sourced from a number of South African mining 
companies,  while soda ash and sulphuric acid are sourced from 
suppliers in the US.  The business is continually looking for new sources 
of supplies to broaden its base of suppliers.  All businesses purchase 
energy in the form of natural gas,  fuel oil or electricity.  It is the Group’s 
practice to enter into agreements with suppliers to lock in the price 
of at least 50 per cent of its energy costs for each year.  Information 
about individual suppliers is not disclosed as the Board considers that 
disclosure would be seriously prejudicial to the Group.  
Going concern 
The Group’s business activities,  together with the factors likely to affect 
its future performance and development are set out in the Business 
review on pages 2 to 23.  The ﬁ nancial position of the Group and 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties are set out above 
in the Finance report on pages 10 to 17.  Note 22 details the Group’s 
exposure to credit,  liquidity and market risk and its mechanisms for 
dealing with these risks.
The Group’s primary source of funding is a syndicated revolving 
credit facility which was renewed during the year.  The expiring 
facility for £150 million was replaced with a new four year facility for 
$200 million on 31 July 2010.  At the year end,  the Group’s net debt 
was $79.3 million.  Compliance with covenants is reported half yearly 
to the syndicate of banks and involves tests for net debt:  EBITDA ratio,  
interest cover and net worth.  No breaches in covenants were reported 
during the year.  Additionally,  the Group uses various short and 
medium term forecasts to monitor anticipated future compliance and 
has modiﬁ ed the modelling to include worst case scenario planning in 
order to stress test the assumptions and identify the headroom on the 
covenant tests.  
After evaluating the covenant compliance modelling and the ongoing 
trading of the businesses,  the directors are satisﬁ ed that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources to continue to operate for the 
foreseeable future as going concerns.  For this reason they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing these ﬁ nancial statements.  
Share capital
The Company’s share capital consists of ordinary shares,  as set out 
in Note 7 to the Parent Company Financial Statements on page 86.  
All of the Company’s issued ordinary shares are fully paid up and rank 
equally in all respects.  The rights attached to them,  in addition to 
those conferred on their holders by law,  are set out in the Company’s 
articles of association (“the Articles”).  Other than those speciﬁ c 
provisions set out in the Articles,  there are no restrictions on the 
transfer of ordinary shares or on the exercise of voting rights attached 
to them.  From time to time the Elementis Employee Share Ownership 
Trust (“Trust”) holds shares in the Company for the purposes of 
various share incentive plans and the rights attaching to them are 
exercised by independent trustees,  who may take into account any 
recommendation by the Company.  As at 31 December 2010 the Trust 
held 5,578,169 (2009: 4,741,243) ordinary shares of ﬁ ve pence each in 
the Company.  A dividend waiver is in place in respect of all shares held 
by the Trust.  
Directors,  Articles and purchase of shares
Rules about the appointment and replacement of directors are set 
out in the Articles.  Changes to the Articles must be approved by 
shareholders passing a special resolution.  The directors’  powers are 
conferred on them by UK legislation and by the Articles.  The Board has 
the power conferred on it by shareholders to purchase its own shares 
and is seeking renewal of that power at the forthcoming AGM within 
the limits set out in the Notice of Meeting.   28 Elementis plc  Annual report and accounts 2010
DIRECTORS’  REPORT
continued
As its businesses are reasonably diverse in terms of the customers 
and sectors they serve,  the Group is not dependent on any particular 
customer and therefore no further information is given.  The Group 
supplies some of its products through approved distributors,  who 
are able to provide or access technical support services,  and has 
a joint venture in China at an organoclay plant and,  whilst these 
relationships are an important part of our business,  the Board does 
not consider any individual relationship to be essential to the Group.  
The Group values all of its employees and,  although some perform 
roles that are more important to the business than others,  the Board 
does not consider that the Group’s success is materially dependent 
on any single individual.  Additionally,  the Board has reviewed its 
management succession plans and is satisﬁ ed that the Company’s 
incentive arrangements are appropriate to attract,  retain and motivate 
key people within the organisation.
Substantial shareholders
As at 1 March 2011 the Company had been notiﬁ ed,  in accordance 
with Rule 5 of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules,  of the following 
interests in its issued ordinary capital:

Auditors
A resolution to re-appoint KPMG Audit Plc as auditors of the Company 
will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM to be held on 21 April 2011.
Each director in ofﬁ ce at the date of this Directors’  report conﬁ rms 
that (a) so far as he is aware,  there is no relevant audit information of 
which the Company’s auditors are unaware and (b) he has taken all the 
steps that he ought to have taken as a director to make himself aware 
of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditors are aware of that information.
Political and charitable donations 
During the year the Group donated $56,040 (2009:  $36,274) for 
charitable purposes of which $12,872 (2009:  $11,160) was made in the 
UK.  The Group made no political donations during the year (2009:  £nil).
Policy on payment of suppliers
The Company’s and the Group’s policies concerning the payment 
to suppliers are to agree terms of payment at the start of business 
with each supplier and to adhere to these,  subject to satisfactory 
performance by the suppliers.  The Company and the Group do not 
follow any code or statement on payment practice.  Trade creditors for 
the Group at 31 December 2010 represented 60 days (2009:  51 days) 
of annual purchases,  adjusted for currency and acquisitions and 
disposals.  The Company has no trade creditors.
Directors’  and ofﬁ cers’  liability insurance
The Company maintains liability insurance for the directors and 
ofﬁ cers of the Company and its subsidiaries.  In addition,  in 2008,  the 
directors of the Company were granted indemnities in respect of 
any liability or loss that may arise out of or in connection with the 
execution of their powers,  duties and responsibilities as directors of 
the Company,  or of any subsidiary,  to the extent permitted under the 
Companies Act 2006.  Copies of these indemnities,  which continue 
to remain in place,  are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered ofﬁ ce during normal business hours and will be available 
for inspection at the AGM.
Directors’  conﬂ ict of interest
The only director who was in receipt of a conﬂ ict authorisation during 
the year is Brian Taylorson,  who is Finance Director and a Trustee of 
the UK pension scheme.  The conﬂ ict authorisation enables him to 
continue to act as a Trustee notwithstanding that this role could give 
rise to a situation in which there is a conﬂ ict of interest.  The conﬂ ict 
authorisation was ﬁ rst put in place in October 2008 and is subject to 
annual review.  The Board has reviewed this and has agreed to extend 
the conﬂ ict authorisation for another year.  Under the terms of the 
conﬂ ict resolution,  reciprocal provisions have been put in place with 
a view to safeguarding information that is conﬁ dential to the Group 
as well as to the Trustees.  Were a conﬂ ict of interest to arise,  Brian 
Taylorson is required to excuse himself from reading the relevant 
pension papers and absent himself from participating in relevant 
Trustee discussions.
Post balance sheet events
There are no post balance sheet events.
Annual General Meeting
The fourteenth Annual General Meeting of the Company will be held 
on 21 April 2011.  The Notice of Meeting is included in a separate 
document sent to shareholders.

COMPANY OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
DIRECTORS’  RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the 
Group and parent company ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and parent 
company ﬁ nancial statements for each ﬁ nancial year.  Under that 
law they are required to prepare the Group ﬁ nancial statements in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and 
have elected to prepare the parent company ﬁ nancial statements 
in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable law 
(UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Under company law the directors must not approve the ﬁ nancial 
statements unless they are satisﬁ ed that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and of their 
proﬁ t or loss for that period.  In preparing each of the Group and parent 
company ﬁ nancial statements,  the directors are required to:
�
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
�
  make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
�
  for the Group ﬁ nancial statements,  state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
�
  for the parent company ﬁ nancial statements,  state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed,  subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent 
company ﬁ nancial statements;  and
�
  prepare the ﬁ nancial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
parent company will continue in business.  
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufﬁ cient to show and explain the parent company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the ﬁ nancial position of the parent company and enable them to 
ensure that its ﬁ nancial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006.  They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to 
prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations,  the directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Directors’  Report,  Directors’  Remuneration 
Report and Corporate Governance Statement that complies with that 
law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and ﬁ nancial information included on the Company’s 
website.  Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of ﬁ nancial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.  
The directors,  all of whom are shown on page 24,  conﬁ rm that to the 
best of their knowledge:
�
  the ﬁ nancial statements,  prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards,  give a true and fair view 
of the assets,  liabilities,  ﬁ nancial position and proﬁ t or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole;  and 
�
  the Directors’  report includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the issuer and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole,  
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face.
The Directors’ responsibility statement has been approved by the 
Board and signed on its behalf by:

Board operation
The Board operates within a framework of controls used to minimise 
risks and has a formal schedule of matters speciﬁ cally reserved to 
it for decision.  These include strategic and annual operating plans,  
the approval of ﬁ nancial statements,  acquisitions and disposals,  risk 
management and compliance programmes including insurance 
arrangements,  major non-recurring projects and major capital 
expenditures.  The Board regularly reviews management performance 
and sets values and standards to ensure that its obligations to 
shareholders and others are understood and met.  It also delegates 
speciﬁ c responsibilities with written terms of reference to the Board 
committees detailed below.  
Information of an appropriate quality is issued in a timely manner 
to assist the Board in performing its duties.  New directors receive 
appropriate induction tailored to their needs.  This includes visits to 
manufacturing facilities and meetings with senior management to 
assist them in building an understanding of how the Group operates 
and the issues that it faces.  New directors are advised of their legal and 
other duties and other obligations as directors of a listed company.  
All members of the Board have access to the advice and services of 
the company secretary and may take independent professional advice,  
as appropriate,  at the expense of the Company.  
The Board holds one of its meetings each year at one of the Group’s 
overseas locations and undertakes site visits when appropriate.  In 
2010,  the Board visited the Chromium facility at Castle Hayne in North 
Carolina and held its overseas Board meeting in Hightstown,  New 
Jersey.  During this trip,  directors met with operational and functional 
managers and business leaders from the Specialty Products and 
Chromium businesses.  The visits involved facility and laboratory 
tours,  informal dinners and more formal business presentations,  
covering a wide range of topics including:  business and Group risks;  
HSE performance;  ﬁ nance and working capital management;  R&D 
progress;  marketing;  procurement/supply-chain and operations 
management;  HR activities;  legal and compliance matters;  and IT 
challenges.  These activities allow the Board to broaden and deepen 
its knowledge of the business,  as well as the issues and risks facing 
the Group (including social,  environmental and governance risks,  in 
addition to commercial,  operational and ﬁ nancial risks).  Exposure to 
the tiers of management below Board level helps the directors better 
understand the talent pool and resources that are available within the 
Group to develop and grow the business.  
Training and development
Directors are encouraged to undertake such activities and training as 
they consider appropriate to help them carry out their duties.  Training 
can take the form of externally run seminars and conferences on 
topical areas,  such as pensions,  investor relations,  risk management,  
executive remuneration or accounting,  and the company secretary 
helps to facilitate this depending on,  and in accordance with,  each 
director’s needs or interests.  Alternatively,  training is arranged in-
house in the form of presentations by advisers at Board meetings.  
Such training given during 2010 included:  the UK Bribery Act,  
pensions and corporate governance.  Directors are also enrolled onto 
the Group’s online training programme,  which includes courses on the 
Group’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics,  and on anti-corruption/
bribery compliance.  The Audit Committee decided towards the end 
of 2010 to run a series of refresher brieﬁ ngs for all directors on speciﬁ c 
aspects of accounting policy and practice,  particularly in areas where 
judgement is required.  These brieﬁ ngs will be incorporated into the 
Audit Committee’s schedule of meetings throughout the year.  
Corporate governance statement
The Board is committed to maintaining high standards of corporate 
governance.  
The Company has throughout the year ended 31 December 2010 
applied fully all the provisions of Section 1 of the Combined Code 
of Corporate Governance (June 2008) as issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council (the  “Combined Code”).  
The Board
Composition
The Board consists of a non-executive Chairman,  Chief Executive,  
Finance Director and four non-executive directors.  The directors and 
biographical information about them are shown on page 25.  The roles 
of the Chairman and Chief Executive are separate and clearly deﬁ ned.  
Non-executive directors are appointed for an initial term of three years,  
and all directors are required under the Articles to retire and offer 
themselves for re-election at least every three years.
During the remainder of 2011,  three of our non-executive directors 
will have their appointment terms up for renewal.  For two,  it would 
be re-appointment for a third three year term.  Kevin Matthews’  term 
expired on 15 February 2011 and he was re-appointed for a third term.  
He,  like all other directors,  will be standing for re-election at the AGM.  
The Board and the Nomination Committee have discussed the Board’s 
succession plans and all non-executives retiring in 2011 have indicated 
their willingness to be re-appointed.  Following these discussions and 
its annual performance evaluation,  the Board is satisﬁ ed that all our 
directors,  both executives and non-executives,  contribute effectively 
and demonstrate appropriate commitment to their role and,  therefore,  
shareholders are asked to support their re-election at the 2011 AGM.  
A key factor that determines Board effectiveness is its composition:  
the mix of knowledge,  skills,  experience,  aptitudes and personalities 
represented on the Board.  The directors consider that the structure 
and composition of the Board is appropriate to take the Company 
through to the next stage of its development and there are no further 
plans for the time being to increase the number of directors on the 
Board.  In coming to this view,  the Board has noted the UK Governance 
Code provisions (applicable in respect of the 2011 reporting year),  
concerning Board diversity.  The Board’s policy on the recruitment of 
directors is to appoint the candidate whose proﬁ le best matches the 
speciﬁ cations agreed by the Nomination Committee for any particular 
role.  Such speciﬁ cations tend to reﬂ ect objective criteria and may 
include,  for example,  knowledge in a speciﬁ c professional or academic 
discipline, business function or of the chemical industry.  To ensure 
objectivity and independence,  specialist Board level recruitment 
advisers are usually engaged to help identify candidates who meet 
these speciﬁ cations.  As part of its medium term succession plans,  the 
Board will continue to follow its policy and ensure that its recruitment 
advisers take into consideration the requirements on Board diversity.
Board independence
The Board considers all the non-executive directors to be independent 
in character and judgement.  The Board is satisﬁ ed that each director 
exercises independent judgement and believes no individual or group 
dominates decision making.

Communication with shareholders
The Board has developed a comprehensive programme to ensure 
that effective communication with shareholders,  analysts and the 
ﬁ nancial press is maintained throughout the year.  Through the annual 
and interim reports,  results and other announcements,  as well as 
through presentations to institutional shareholders,  investor days 
and the dissemination of information via the Group’s website at
www.elementisplc.com,  the Board seeks to present the Company’s 
strategy and performance in an objective and balanced manner.  
Shareholders attending the AGM are invited to ask questions during 
the meeting and also to meet the directors after the formal business 
of the meeting has concluded.  The chairmen of the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees are also available to answer questions from 
any shareholder at the meeting.  Full details of proxy votes cast on each 
resolution are made available to shareholders at the meeting and are 
made available on the Company’s website after the meeting.
The Board receives regular reports from management on meetings 
held with shareholders and analysts,  feedback from investors on both 
corporate and management’s performance from results roadshows 
and copies of research notes published by analysts.  This ensures that 
non-executive directors develop a clear understanding of the views of 
major shareholders.  The Chairman and Senior Independent Director 
are also available for contact by shareholders at any time.  
In addition,  the Chairman and the chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee,  where appropriate,  undertake meetings,  from time to 
time,  with major shareholders to update them on any developments 
in corporate governance matters,  or,  in the case of executive 
remuneration,  to consult them over remuneration proposals.

Board committees
The Board has established Audit,  Nomination and Remuneration 
Committees,  all with deﬁ ned terms of reference,  modelled closely 
on those set out in the Combined Code,  which are available from the 
Company Secretary or can be found on the Company’s website at 
www.elementisplc.com.  
Audit Committee
The chairman and members of the Audit Committee (the  “Committee”) 
during 2010 and their attendance records are shown in the table overleaf.  
The Committee has two members with  “recent and relevant ﬁ nancial 
experience”  as recommended by the Combined Code.  Chris Girling 
is a chartered accountant and was until April 2007 group ﬁ nance 
director of Carillion plc which is a FTSE 250 listed company.  Ian Brindle’s 
experience is based on his career with PricewaterhouseCoopers 
(“PwC”) and his previous roles at the Accounting Standards Board and 
the Financial Reporting Review Panel.
Board performance evaluation
The annual evaluation of the Board’s performance,  including that 
of its committees and individual directors,  was carried out by the 
Nomination Committee between September and October.  The 
process involved a questionnaire and interviews.  The format and areas 
of focus of the questionnaire,  which is designed internally,  is updated 
each year by the company secretary and reviewed by the Chairman,  
Senior Independent Director and executive directors before the 
questionnaire is circulated to all directors for completion.  The results 
are returned to the company secretary who collates the responses and 
prepares a report,  on a non-attributable basis,  which is distributed to 
all directors for discussion at the Nomination Committee meeting.  
The performance of the Board,  its committees,  individual directors 
(executive and non-executive) and the company secretary was 
considered to be effective.  The directors were satisﬁ ed with the:  
amount and quality of the information given by management;  
priorities,  objectives and strategic direction of the Group;  and 
composition and operation of the Board,  and the structure and 
operation of Board committees.  
In addition,  the Chairman held one-to-one meetings with each 
director to discuss privately the results of the evaluation exercise as 
well as the Board’s short term priorities.  The key themes emerging 
from the evaluation process were that there was:  strong commitment 
to grow the Specialty Products business;  a need to communicate 
more effectively the investment opportunity to address the 
Company’s low price earnings ratio (relative to its UK specialty 
chemicals peers);  closer interest in the actions identiﬁ ed and taken to 
mitigate the Group’s major risks,  particularly those relating to legacy 
issues,  such as the UK pension fund deﬁ cit;  and better understanding 
of the resources and talent pool available within the Group to 
grow the business,  particularly within the context of management 
succession planning.  
Towards the end of the year,  the Senior Independent Director chaired 
a meeting of the directors to review the performance of the Chairman 
without him being present.  The conclusion was that the Chairman 
was very effective in his role in terms of his leadership,  the operation 
and priorities of the Board,  and his support and commitment to 
management and the Company.
In carrying out its annual performance evaluation,  the Board noted 
the UK Governance Code requirement for FTSE 350 companies to 
have an externally facilitated evaluation at least every three years 
(applicable in respect of the 2011 reporting year).  The Board operates 
a very open and transparent culture in which directors have many 
opportunities,  both formally at or outside Board meetings and 
informally at frequently held Board dinners,  to raise any concerns 
(whether about the performance of management or the direction or 
priorities of the Company).  The professional and collegiate working 
relationship established between executive and non-executive 
directors allows them to engage in open dialogue and the frank 
exchange of views.  The value of this kind of culture would be difﬁ cult 
to capture or evaluate in the formal ways commonly associated with 
formal appraisal systems,  particularly if they are conducted by an 
external party.  Nevertheless,  the Board will be addressing how it could 
engage external resources in a way that will add value to the existing 
evaluation process.   32 Elementis plc  Annual report and accounts 2010
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
continued
threshold,  in which case the Finance Director has delegated authority 
from the Committee to approve such appointments.  The threshold 
is that any individual non-audit engagement fee is no greater than 
15 per cent of the annual Group audit fee and the total cost of 
non-audit engagements in the same ﬁ nancial year does not exceed 
50 per cent of the annual Group audit fee.  
The external auditors were appointed during the year to undertake 
tax work on behalf of the Group,  which included work on transfer 
pricing,  US debt structure,  tax compliance and general Group dividend 
planning.  The fees for these services amounted to 70 per cent of the 
Group’s audit fee for 2010.  A signiﬁ cant portion of the fees paid to KPMG 
in respect of non-audit services relate to tax advice and planning,  part 
of which is in connection with an ongoing project to restructure debt 
in the US operations and part is in response to changes in tax legislation 
in the UK,  US and Netherlands.  KPMG’s knowledge of the Group’s 
business processes and controls made them best placed to undertake 
this work cost-effectively on the Group’s behalf,  which was a key factor 
in the decision to choose them to carry out this work.  In coming to 
the decision to recommend their re-appointment as external auditors,  
the Committee considered KPMG’s independence and quality control 
procedures,  and concluded that their objectivity was not impaired by 
having provided non-audit services.  Since the year end,  KPMG were 
appointed to undertake some advisory work in relation to our Bribery 
Act compliance programme.
KPMG were appointed external auditors,  after a tender,  in respect 
of the statutory audit for the year ended 30 June 2004.  Since then,  
both UK audit partners and the audit partner in the US have been 
rotated.  During that time,  the senior manager in charge of the audit 
has also changed.  These factors,  together with KPMG’s independence 
and quality control procedures (and their performance),  have led 
the Committee to conclude that KPMG are effective in their role as 
external auditors and why there are no plans to carry out a tender in 
the near future.  The Committee does not consider that there are any 
factors or contracts which exist that restrict its choice of auditors,  were 
it to recommend the appointment of new auditors.  
 The Committee reviewed its policy on whistleblowing during the year 
as well as reports on its operation.  The Group’s whistleblowing policy 
is supported by a non-retaliation policy and a toll-free,  independent 
third party run  “Alert Line”  that is accessible by all our employees in 
their preferred choice of language.  All reports are investigated by 
management and reported to the Committee.  
A description of the remit and work of the Audit Committee 
(“Committee”)
A full description of the Committee’s role is available on the Company’s 
website at:  www.elementisplc.com/governance-responsibility.  The 
following is a summary of the Committee’s remit:
�
  monitoring the integrity of the ﬁ nancial statements,  accounting 
policies and ﬁ nancial reporting;
�
  reviewing the effectiveness of internal control,  compliance and 
risk management systems;  and 
�
  overseeing all aspects of the relationship with the internal and 
external auditors.  
The Committee met four times during 2010 and all meetings were 
also attended by the Chairman of the Company and both executive 
directors,  so that all Board members are kept fully informed on 
the operation and work of the Committee.  The Committee met to 
review the annual and interim reports and ﬁ nancial statements and 
also to receive half yearly reports from the internal audit providers,  
PwC,  as well as representations from management.  As part of its 
programme of work,  the Committee:  reviewed the effectiveness of 
the internal and external auditors,  through meetings and evaluating 
assessment questionnaires completed by management and key 
ﬁ nance staff;  approved the scope of work of and fees for both internal 
and external auditors;  and concluded that,  owing to the complexity 
and international nature of the Group’s businesses,  the internal audit 
function was best served by continuing to outsource to PwC,  given 
their global expertise and resources.  The Committee also considered 
the Company’s business continuity plans during the year,  approved 
updates to the Company’s treasury policies and discussed the 
Group’s bribery compliance programme.  Under the direction of the 
Group General Counsel,  the Group reviewed its Code of Business 
Conduct and Ethics,  and Anti-Corruption Policy towards the end of 
last year and,  with external support,  will be revising these together 
with its guidelines to ensure that its compliance systems will be fully 
compatible with the requirements of the UK Bribery Act.  The review 
programme includes ensuring adequate risk assessment controls 
are in place,  revised policies and guidance (including training) is 
implemented effectively and formal compliance audit and evaluation 
processes are established.
The Committee keeps under review the objectivity and independence 
of the external auditors (“KPMG”) and the nature and extent of 
non-audit services they provide.  The Company’s policy is that any 
appointment of the external auditors to undertake non-audit work 
is subject to the approval of the Committee unless it falls below a

Nomination Committee
The chairman and members of the Nomination Committee 
(the  “Committee”) and their attendance records are shown on 
page 32.  The Committee is responsible for:
�
  reviewing the size and composition of the Board,  together with 
the skills,  knowledge and experience of its members and making 
recommendations for change as necessary;
�
  carrying out an annual performance evaluation of the Board and 
its committees and members;  and
�
  succession planning for the Board and leadership team.
The Committee met three times last year to review the results of the 
Board performance evaluation (“BPE”) exercise and consider succession 
planning matters.  Two of these meetings were attended by both 
executive directors.  One meeting was attended by non-executives 
only,  in compliance with the Combined Code.  There were no issues of 
signiﬁ cant concern raised in the BPE exercise,  and a description of the 
evaluation process and results can be found on page 31.  There are no 
current plans to make any changes to the Board’s composition.  
Remuneration Committee
Details about the Remuneration Committee are set out in the 
Directors’  remuneration report on page 34.
Internal control 
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal 
controls and risk management and for reviewing the effectiveness of 
this system,  which includes ﬁ nancial,  operational and compliance risks 
and controls.  Such a system can only be designed to manage,  rather 
than eliminate,  the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and 
can therefore only provide reasonable,  and not absolute,  assurance 
against material mis-statement or loss.
The Board is of the view that an ongoing process for identifying,  
evaluating and managing signiﬁ cant risks faced by the Group was 
in place throughout the ﬁ nancial year under review and up to the 
date that this Annual Report was approved.  This process is regularly 
reviewed by the Board and accords with the Financial Reporting 
Council’s  “Turnbull”  and  “Smith”  guidance,  as amended,  on internal 
control.  
The key features of the Group’s internal control system are:
Control environment
A key factor in the Group’s approach to internal control is the 
recognition of the need for risk awareness and the ownership of risk 
management by executives at all levels.  
The Group has policies and procedures that set out the responsibilities 
of divisional management,  including authority levels,  reporting 
disciplines and responsibility for risk management and internal control.  
Certain activities,  including treasury,  taxation,  insurance,  pension and 
legal matters are controlled centrally with reports reviewed by the Board 
as appropriate.  Site level policies and procedures are set by divisional 
management as appropriate to the needs of each business unit.  
Risk identiﬁ cation and review
Key identiﬁ ed risks,  both ﬁ nancial and non-ﬁ nancial,  are reviewed 
by the Board as well as by divisional management on an ongoing 
basis,  which is supported by the work of the Audit Committee and 
the internal audit service,  which is provided by PwC.  A formal annual 
review of risks and controls is carried out by both the management 
team and the Board,  and includes presentations from senior managers.  
A fuller description of the risk management systems can be found 
on page 15.
The management team,  which comprises the executive directors,  
divisional managing directors and functional business leaders,  
meets on a regular basis to review each division’s and the Group’s 
performance,  strategy and risk management.  Their work is supported 
by a central risk management unit,  under the direction of the 
company secretary,  whose terms of reference include supporting 
corporate governance requirements,  recommending business risk 
strategy and developing policies and procedures for risk management 
and internal controls.  PwC’s work covers the monitoring of the 
effectiveness of internal controls and the design of processes to test 
the effectiveness of controls.  
At operating level,  all divisions are required to have processes to 
identify risks and,  so far as possible,  take action to reduce those risks.  
In addition annual compliance statements on internal control are 
certiﬁ ed by each operating division.
Financial reporting
There is a comprehensive Groupwide system of ﬁ nancial reporting,  
based on the JDE and HFM consolidation software platforms.  The 
Board reviews at each of its meetings reports from the Chief Executive 
and the Finance Director,  as well as full management accounts,  
comprising monthly and year to date proﬁ t and loss statements,  cash 
ﬂ ows and balance sheet,  with segmental and individual business 
performance analyses.  In addition,  capital expenditure and relevant 
performance indicators are reported.  Actual monthly results 
are monitored against budget,  forecasts and the previous year’s 
results.  Any signiﬁ cant variances are investigated and acted upon 
as appropriate.  As well as monthly management accounts,  each 
operating division prepares an annual and a three year operating plan 
which is approved by the Board.  Thereafter a formal re-forecasting 
exercise is undertaken three times a year.  
The Committee considers that the Group’s systems of internal control 
and risk management,  particularly in this context in relation to the 
ﬁ nancial reporting process,  are robust and effective.  The Committee 
is responsible for ensuring the integrity of the Group’s ﬁ nancial 
statements and other communications to the market about trading 
performance relative to market forecasts.  The Committee approves 
and keeps under review signiﬁ cant accounting policies,  particularly in 
areas where judgements and estimates are made.  
Investment appraisal
There are clearly deﬁ ned investment guidelines for capital expenditure.  
All investment expenditure is subject to formal authorisation 
procedures,  with major proposals being considered by the Board.  
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee plays a critical role within the Company’s system 
of internal control and risk management and a full description of its 
work is given on page 32.

Remuneration policy and practice
The policy of the Committee is to set remuneration at a level which 
is competitive with that of comparable businesses,  enabling the 
Company to attract and retain people with relevant ability,  experience 
and skills.  To ensure that executive directors align their interests 
with those of shareholders,  a substantial proportion of the overall 
remuneration package is linked to corporate performance through 
participation in short term and long term incentive schemes.  Details 
of how these schemes were operated during 2010 and how they will 
operate in 2011 are described later in this report.  
The Committee does not include targets for corporate performance 
on environmental,  social and corporate governance issues when 
considering the remuneration of executive directors.  The safety and 
environmental performance of Group businesses is accorded high 
importance and the Committee considers that management should 
aspire to achieving high standards in both safety and environmental 
performance without the need for incentives.  Corporate governance 
standards are set by the Board as a whole.  
Salaries,  fees and beneﬁ ts
Salaries for executive directors are determined by the Committee,  
which revised its policy on salary reviews towards the end of 2010.  
This followed changes that were made to the annual bonus and 
long term incentive schemes early in 2010,  which were approved at 
last year’s AGM.  The Committee is aware of the over reliance upon 
benchmarking which may lead to a ratchet of pay and has therefore 
adopted a policy that there should be a formal salary review for 
executive directors every three years,  where benchmarking analysis 
would be utilised for reference purposes,  taking into consideration 
the following factors:  corporate performance;  the performance of the 
executive;  market practice;  and changes in responsibility,  complexity 
and size of role over the previous three year period.  In between 
formal reviews,  the policy is that executive directors should receive 
an annual salary increase equivalent to the average local workforce.  
This annual inﬂ ationary increase would still have to be approved by 
the Committee,  taking into consideration whether the performance 
of the executive director merits the award.  This policy,  however,  is 
subject to the structure of the business or role of the executive director 
remaining substantively unchanged and,  when this is not the case,  
the Committee has the discretion to conduct a formal review (with or 
without benchmarking) whenever it considers appropriate.
Since his appointment as Group Chief Executive,  the salary paid to 
David Dutro has been below the US market rate and the Committee,  
in accordance with its policies,  has maintained its intention to increase 
salary towards the median subject to performance and experience.  
In accordance with this intention and following the adoption of the 
new three year review policy in December,  the Committee approved 
an eight per cent pay increase to David Dutro.  This reﬂ ected his 
performance and leadership over the past few years resulting in a 
record ﬁ nancial performance in 2010.  The Committee believes that 
the choice of US benchmark group is appropriate given that David 
Dutro is based in the US and a US national.  The Committee takes into 
account levels paid within a peer group of 17 US chemical companies 
with a similar level of turnover and market capitalisation.  For reference,  
consideration is also given to UK companies with a similar level of 
turnover and market capitalisation.
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee (the  “Committee”) is chaired by Kevin 
Matthews.  The Committee determines the remuneration of the 
Chairman and the executive directors,  and recommends and monitors 
the structure and level of remuneration for senior executives.
Following a comprehensive review of the Company’s annual bonus 
scheme and long term incentive plan that was reported in last 
year’s remuneration report and implemented during 2010,  the 
Committee reviewed its policy on basic salary and salary reviews 
and made changes that apply from 2011.  The Committee considers 
that these three essential elements of executive remuneration 
(basic salary,  annual bonus scheme and long term share incentive) 
are appropriately designed to incentivise the executive team to 
deliver sustainable results.  The performance targets are aligned to 
the Group’s longer term strategy and with shareholders’  interests,  
as well as reﬂ ecting the risk appetite of the Board.  
The Committee met ﬁ ve times last year and its members and 
their attendance records are shown on page 32.  Members of 
the Committee have no personal ﬁ nancial interest other than 
as shareholders in the matters to be decided and no day-to-day 
involvement in the running of the business of the Group.
Advisers to the Committee
The Vice-President of Global Human Resources is the internal adviser 
to the Committee and provides information and advice to facilitate 
discussion and decision making on remuneration matters.  He also 
provides the Company and its subsidiaries with services which include 
the setting of employment policies,  recruitment of senior managers and 
overall responsibility for all major issues involving human resources.
The Committee’s external advisers are Hewitt New Bridge Street 
(“HNBS”) who were appointed after a tender in 2008.  As reported in 
last year’s report,  HNBS provided guidance to the Committee in its 
review of the short and long term incentive plans in the earlier part of 
2010,  particularly in relation to current market trends in structure and 
performance metrics.  They also carried out a benchmarking study 
of executive and non-executive remuneration for reference by the 
Committee and Board towards the end of the year.  The Committee 
is satisﬁ ed that there is no over-reliance on HNBS,  who have no 
connection with the Company other than as remuneration advisers.  
Annual General Meeting (“AGM”)
A resolution to approve this report will be tabled at the AGM and the 
chairman of the Committee will be available to answer questions from 
shareholders on the decisions of the Committee.  
DIRECTORS’  REMUNERATION REPORT  Annual report and accounts 2010 Elementis plc   35
COMPANY OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
Termination payments in relation to departing executive directors 
are not agreed in advance and are determined in accordance with 
the directors’  contractual rights.  It is the Committee’s policy to ensure 
that a director’s duty to mitigate his loss is taken into account in the 
calculation of any termination payments.
The total amount that would be payable to David Dutro for early 
termination by the Company of his service agreement is between 
50 per cent and 100 per cent of the aggregate of (i) his basic annual 
salary and (ii) any bonus which he may be eligible to receive.  The total 
amount that would be payable to Brian Taylorson for early termination 
by the Company of his service agreement is between 50 per cent 
and 100 per cent of the aggregate of (i) his basic annual salary,  (ii) the 
sums that would have become payable to him or on his behalf,  had 12 
months’  notice of termination been given,  by way of pension accruals 
and any pension cash salary supplement,  (iii) the cost of providing 
private medical insurance for him,  his spouse and children aged under 
21 for the 12 months following termination,  and (iv) his monthly car 
allowance for a 12 month period.
The above terms for both executive directors were agreed at the 
time the contracts were made and the Committee is aware that 
governance guidelines ask remuneration committees generally 
to commit to a policy that precludes the inclusion of any payment 
(beneﬁ ts or bonus) other than basic salary in the calculation of 
termination payments.  As stated above,  the Committee’s position is 
to ensure a director mitigates his/her loss,  but the Committee does 
not consider that it would be in the best interests of the Company,  or 
likely to promote its success,  to adopt a policy in public that might 
otherwise restrict its ﬂ exibility in future contract negotiations.  
The non-executive directors during the year held letters of 
appointment with the Company as follows: 
 Date of  Date of
Name appointment re-appointment Date of expiry
R Beeston 21/09/06 21/09/09 20/09/12
I Brindle 06/06/05 06/06/08 05/06/11
A Christie 11/08/08 n/a 10/08/11
C Girling 29/04/05 29/04/08 28/04/11
K Matthews 16/02/05 16/02/08 15/02/11
Each letter provides that the director’s appointment can be terminated 
by the Company on six months’  notice on any grounds without claim 
for compensation.  Copies of all letters of appointment of non-executive 
directors,  as well as the executive directors’  service contracts,  are 
available for inspection at the Company’s registered ofﬁ ce during 
normal business hours and will be available for inspection at the AGM.  
The directors whose term of appointment shown above as expiring 
during 2011 have indicated their willingness to be re-appointed and 
it is the Board’s intention,  subject to all directors being re-elected at 
the AGM,  to renew their appointments for a further three years.  Kevin 
Matthews was re-appointed by the Board on 16 February 2011.
The Committee approved a pay increase to Brian Taylorson of three 
per cent,  after taking into consideration his performance,  the 
requirements of his role as Group Finance Director and the results of 
benchmarking studies.  The increase is similar to the average awarded 
to the general workforce in the UK.
The Committee and Board are fully supportive of these pay increases 
(both effective from 1 January 2011),  which were considered to be 
fully justiﬁ ed on merit and performance.
The Committee conﬁ rms that it is its policy to consider the pay and 
employment conditions of employees elsewhere in the Group when 
determining the level of salaries of,  and pay increases awarded 
to,  executive directors.  This is demonstrated in the new policy on 
executive director pay reviews in which the maximum annual pay 
award,  other than in exceptional circumstances or a formal three yearly 
review,  is similar to general workforce pay inﬂ ation in the US and UK.  
The average pay award to US and UK employees in 2010 were 3 per 
cent and 3.5 per cent respectively.  The next formal review of salaries 
for the executive directors,  under normal circumstances,  will be in 
December 2013.  
Executive directors also receive beneﬁ ts,  which relate to the provision 
of a car,  life assurance and medical cover.  Additionally,  as is standard 
in the US,  David Dutro receives beneﬁ ts covering dental costs,  
accidental death and disablement,  and long term disability.  These 
beneﬁ ts are generally considered to be standard for managerial staff 
and are provided to them,  with variances depending on country or 
local market practice.  Information about pension beneﬁ ts and share 
incentive schemes is provided further below.
Fees for non-executive directors are determined by the Chairman and 
the executive directors,  having regard to fees paid to non-executive 
directors in other UK quoted companies,  the time commitment and 
responsibilities of the role.  The level of fees has not been increased 
since 2005 and,  following a recent review,  the basic fee was increased 
from £35,000 per annum to £40,000 per annum.  The Chairman’s fee 
is determined by the Committee and was also reviewed during the 
year.  The level of fees for the Chairman has remained unchanged 
since 2006 and was increased from £120,000 per annum to £137,150 
per annum.  Both sets of fee increases were made with reference to 
the results of benchmarking analysis,  as well as to the average annual 
increase awarded to employees in the Group,  and are effective from 
January 2011.  These fees will not be reviewed again until December 
2013.  The Company considers the revised fee levels to be appropriate 
for the performance and contribution of our non-executive 
directors (including the Chairman),  their time commitment and the 
responsibilities of the role.  No share options are held by non-executive 
directors and individuals cannot vote on their own remuneration.  
Service contracts
It is the Company’s policy that executive directors should have service 
contracts with the Company that contain a termination notice period 
not exceeding 12 months,  as is the case with the service agreements 
of David Dutro and Brian Taylorson. 36 Elementis plc  Annual report and accounts 2010
DIRECTORS’  REMUNERATION REPORT
continued
Based upon the performance of the Group and its operating divisions 
in 2010,  both the executive directors and business managing directors 
will each receive the maximum bonus allowed under the annual 
bonus scheme,  equivalent to 100 per cent of their respective base 
salaries.  All bonuses,  as in previous years,  are not pensionable.
2011 annual bonus scheme
EPS targets have been set at Threshold,  Plan and Stretch levels,  
with the rate of bonus accrual ﬁ xed at 0 per cent at Threshold and 
50 per cent at Stretch (straight line accrual in between).  The Threshold 
target has been set at the 2010 result (15.2 cents),  but as the targets 
at Plan and Stretch are considered to be commercially sensitive and 
prejudicial if disclosed,  those targets will be disclosed retrospectively 
in the remuneration report for the year ending 2011.  
The structure and accrual scale in respect of the AWC condition is the 
same as in 2010 and,  also due to reasons of commercial sensitivity,  will 
be disclosed in next year’s remuneration report.
Long term incentive arrangements
2003 Executive Share Option Scheme
The Company has since 1998 operated an approved and unapproved,  
discretionary executive share option scheme for executive directors 
and other senior and middle managers in the Group.  The current 
2003 scheme replaced the 1998 scheme and,  up until 2008,  executive 
directors received option grants under the 2003 scheme.  Since then,  
executive directors and both business managing directors have 
received awards under the 2008 and 2010 Long term incentive plans,  
although other senior and middle managers continue to receive 
grants under the 2003 scheme.
The key features of the 2003 scheme are as follows:
�
  Options are granted to purchase shares in the Company at an 
exercise price per share based on the Company’s mid-market 
closing share price on the dealing day preceding the date of grant;
�
  Options,  under normal circumstances,  are capable of exercise 
after three years and within ten years of the date of grant;
�
  The value of options valued at the date of grant for any single 
individual will not normally exceed 1.5 times basic salary in any 
ﬁ nancial year;  and
�
  Options are subject to performance conditions.
Options granted between 2003 and 2007 to executive directors 
and other senior managers were based partly on the Company’s 
EPS growth relative to inﬂ ation and partly on the Company’s total 
shareholder return (“TSR”) relative to an index of comparator 
companies.  The performance conditions attached to the options 
granted to executives in 2008 were based on EPS targets only,  in 2009 
on TSR only,  relative to the comparator companies listed overleaf,  and 
in 2010 on EPS and TSR targets,  but the latter relative to the FTSE All 
Share index (excluding investment trusts).
Short term incentive arrangements
Annual Bonus Scheme
The structure of the annual bonus scheme (“Bonus scheme”) for 
executive directors and business managing directors was changed 
during 2010,  as presented in last year’s annual report,  and the key 
features (which will continue to operate in 2011) are:
�
  maximum bonus opportunity of one times basic salary;  and
�
  two performance conditions:  earnings per share (“EPS”) and 
average trade working capital to sales ratio expressed as a 
percentage (“AWC”) (split 50:50 – for business managing directors,  
the measures are divisional operating proﬁ t and AWC).
The EPS/operating proﬁ t and AWC conditions were selected 
because they are considered to be the most appropriate measures 
of the Group’s strategic and ﬁ nancial performance,  and targets are 
set at levels which the Committee considers to be appropriately 
challenging (taking into consideration the Company’s operating 
and strategic plans,  and assumptions about global macroeconomic 
conditions).  EPS targets are set to ensure that maximum bonuses are 
only payable for exceeding market expectations.  As reported in last 
year’s remuneration report,  the Committee considered remuneration 
guidelines relating to bonus deferral and claw-back provisions and 
factored this into its thinking when it made changes to the structure 
and design of the annual bonus scheme and long term incentive 
plan that were approved by shareholders in 2010.  While there is no 
claw-back provision implemented,  the combination of the annual 
and long term incentives ensures that the executive directors are 
incentivised to deliver short term results that are appropriately 
aligned with the long term strategy and risk appetite of the Board.
Performance targets 
2010 annual bonus scheme
The EPS targets set at Threshold,  Plan and Stretch levels were 
4.2 pence,  4.3 pence and 4.8 pence,  which were equivalent to 
an increase over the 2009 result of 50 per cent,  54 per cent and 
71 per cent respectively.  The corresponding rates of bonus accrual 
at these points were 0 per cent at Threshold,  25 per cent at Plan and 
50 per cent at Stretch (straight line in between).  The EPS targets that 
were set in 2010 reﬂ ected uncertainty regarding the rate of economic 
recovery,  particularly given the low base of earnings in 2009,  all of 
which was explained in the 2009 remuneration report.  Going 
forward,  the growth rate will reﬂ ect more normal trading conditions.  
 The AWC targets set at Threshold,  Plan and Stretch levels were 
23.9 per cent,  23.4 per cent and 22.9 per cent,  with bonus accruing 
at 0 per cent at Threshold,  25 per cent at Plan and 50 per cent at 
Stretch (straight line in between).  
The bonus targets for the business managing directors are based on 
divisional performance at a level that is consistent with and equivalent 
to those for the executive directors in terms of the level of challenge.  
To achieve the maximum of 100 per cent of base pay,  EPS and AWC 
performance would both have to be at Stretch level.  Annual report and accounts 2010 Elementis plc   37
COMPANY OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
The Company’s policy on granting options is that no individual has 
an absolute right of participation and that all grants are made at the 
discretion of the Committee under delegated authority from the 
Board.  Participants are nominated by business and functional heads 
and recommended to the Committee for approval by the Chief 
Executive.  The level of grants are relative to the base salary of the 
participants (ordinarily set at 20 per cent,  35 per cent and 60 per cent),  
commensurate with seniority in terms of managerial grade and the 
individual’s ability to inﬂ uence corporate performance.  One senior 
executive received a grant of options in 2010 at the level of 150 per 
cent of his basic salary and another at 60 per cent of his base salary.  
Altogether,  52 employees throughout the Group received a grant 
of options in 2010 (2009:  48).  This number excludes both executive 
directors and the two business managing directors.  
The following targets applied to options granted to executives and 
other senior managers (excluding the executive directors and business 
managing directors) between 2008 and 2010:

The Chief Executive,  Finance Director and both business managing 
directors received grants of nil cost options over shares in 2010 that 
were subject to EPS and TSR performance conditions as follows:
 Performance criteria to be met for options
EPS/TSR split to be exercisable
50% EPS   – 0% and 100% vesting if EPS for the
ﬁ nancial year ending December 2012 is

The TSR condition will be measured against the companies 
comprising the FTSE All Share Index (excluding investment trusts).  
Proposed awards in 2011
No change has been made to the structure or operation of the 
scheme for grants that will be made in 2011,  except that to address 
any remaining concerns over the formula used to determine the value 
of options to be granted (i.e.  that participants other than the Chief 
Executive could potentially beneﬁ t from pay increases awarded to 
the Chief Executive),  the Committee has agreed that the maximum 
value of options to be granted to these participants would be limited 
to one times their own basic salary plus up to 50 per cent of the Chief 
Executive’s 2010 base salary (the latter revalued each year by the same 
pay increase award that each participant received,  if any,  on their own 
base salary).  Senior executives who participate in the 2010 LTIP would 
not also participate in any other discretionary share incentive scheme.
The grant of nil cost options to be made in 2011 will be subject to EPS 
and TSR performance conditions as follows:
 Performance criteria to be met for options
EPS/TSR split to be exercisable
50% EPS   – 0% and 100% vesting if annual average
EPS growth is RPI + 4% and RPI + 10%,  
respectively,  with straight line vesting in
between
50% TSR  – 3.85% and 100% vesting for median and
upper quartile performance,  respectively,  
with straight line vesting in between
 The Committee considers that the EPS targets that will apply to 
the 2011 grants are appropriate after taking into consideration the 
Company’s strategic and operating plans.  The EPS targets that were 
set in 2010,  which reﬂ ected a growth over 2009 result of 132 per cent 
at threshold level and 168 per cent at stretch,  reﬂ ected difﬁ cult 
conditions at the time,  particularly given the low base of earnings 
in 2009,  all of which was explained in the 2009 remuneration report.  
Going forward,  the Committee considers that targeting EPS growth 
over a three year performance period to exceed RPI + an average of 
four per cent to ten per cent per annum is appropriately challenging.  
2008 Long Term Incentive Plan (“2008 L TIP”)
The 2008 LTIP was adopted by shareholders at the 2008 AGM and the 
following awards were made in that year:  David Dutro 25 per cent of 
the LTIP pool,  Brian Taylorson 20 per cent of LTIP pool,  Greg McClatchy,  
Managing Director of Specialty Products and Surfactants,  20 per cent 
and Eric Haaijer,  then Managing Director of Chromium,  12 per cent,  
leaving 23 per cent of the LTIP pool unawarded.  The value of the 2008 
LTIP pool (in £’millions) is calculated by taking 2.15 per cent of the 
increase in the value of the Company (measured by share price growth 
over the three year performance period plus all dividends paid or 
declared during that period) less 9.3 per cent per annum (representing 
the cost of equity which is the minimum growth threshold).  The 
2008 LTIP awards are in the form of nil cost options over shares in the 
Company equal to the value of each participant’s share of the LTIP 
pool.  These awards were granted on 28 April 2008 when the market 
value of a share was 66.5 pence.  The awards vest after three years from 
the date of grant and are subject to the cost of equity performance 
condition described above.  Eric Haaijer’s award lapsed when he left 
the Group in March 2009.
The performance condition will be tested in April 2011 and,  if it is not 
met,  the awards will lapse.  However,  as a result of the Company’s 
recent share price performance,  these awards are expected to vest.  
For illustrative purposes only,  based on a market value of a share of 
143 pence (at 31 December 2010),  the LTIP pool would be valued 
at around £6.2 million,  of which £4 million is subject to awards,  
equivalent to options over approximately 2.8 million shares,  to be 
shared by the three award holders in the proportion stated above.  
2010 Long Term Incentive Plan (“2010 L TIP”)
The rules of the 2008 LTIP were amended last year (hence 2010 LTIP 
or  “Plan”) to enable annual grants of nil cost options,  or conditional 
share awards,  to be made by the Committee under delegated 
authority from the Board.  The operation of the Plan is similar to the 
2003 executive option scheme in that awards are made subject to 
performance conditions and they may vest,  in the case of share 
awards,  or become exercisable,  in the case of options,  after three years 
and within ten years of the date of award or grant.  The maximum value 
of any award or grant under the Plan to any individual is equivalent 
to a value determined by reference to the following formula:  one 
times the individual’s own base salary at the time of award plus up to 
50 per cent of the Chief Executive’s basic salary.  In the case of the Chief 
Executive,  the maximum value of any annual award or grant is limited 
to 1.5 times his own base salary.  The formula was implemented to 
ensure that individuals were not negatively impacted by the reduction 
in the annual bonus scheme made in 2010.  A detailed explanation was 
provided in the 2009 remuneration report.    Annual report and accounts 2010 Elementis plc   39
COMPANY OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
The 2008 UK SAYE and US Schemes replaced previous schemes,  which 
have expired,  that contained substantially the same provisions as the 
current schemes.  However,  subject to the rules of the now expired 
schemes,  certain awards continue to remain exercisable.
Total shareholder return performance
The following graph illustrates the Company’s total shareholder 
return for the ﬁ ve years ending 31 December 2010,  relative to the 
FTSE 250 Index.
As the Company’s shares are denominated and listed in pence,  the 
graph below looks at the total return,  to the end of 2010,  of £100 
invested in Elementis on 31 December 2005 compared with that of 
the total return of £100 invested in the FTSE 250 Index.  This index 
was selected for the purpose of providing a relative comparison of 
performance because the Company became a member of it in 2010.
Elementis plc FTSE 250
The TSR condition,  as for the 2010 grants,  will be measured against the 
companies comprising the FTSE All Share Index (excluding investment 
trusts).  The Index was selected since it provides a better indication of 
relative performance rather than the FTSE 250 Index which is heavily 
weighted towards cyclical sectors.
The costs of operating all of the Company’s share incentive schemes 
and the total number of options outstanding as at the year end are 
disclosed in Note 25 to the Financial Statements on pages 79 and 
80.  Elementis share plans comply with the current ABI guidelines 
on headroom which provides that overall dilution under all plans 
should not exceed ten per cent over any ten year period in relation 
to the Company’s issued share capital,  with a further limitation of 
ﬁ ve per cent in any ten year period on discretionary plans.  Based on 
the number of awards that remain outstanding as at the year end and 
having included all exercised awards and awards that have lapsed,  the 
Company has utilised 6.4 per cent of the ten per cent in ten year limit 
and 3.9 per cent of the ﬁ ve per cent in ten year limit.
Share ownership guidelines
Shareholding guidelines introduced previously required executive 
directors to build up a stake in the Company over a period of time 
that is equal in value to one times their basic annual salaries.  Brian 
Taylorson,  who has been Finance Director since 2002,  is considered to 
have met this requirement.  David Dutro,  who was appointed to the 
Board as Group Chief Executive in January 2007,  is also expected to 
build up a shareholding equal to his annual basic salary.  The 2008 LTIP 
award contained a requirement that a proportion of the awards which 
vest must be retained as shares by the executive directors in order 
to build up the required shareholding under the Share ownership 
guidelines.  
Savings-Related Share Option Schemes
Under the 2008 UK savings-related share option scheme (“UK SAYE 
Scheme”),  all eligible UK employees,  including executive directors,  can 
enter into savings contracts with a bank or building society for a period 
of three or ﬁ ve years and use the proceeds from their savings accounts 
to acquire shares in the Company on the exercise of their options.  
The option price at which options may be exercised is the average 
market price over the ﬁ ve working days preceding the invitation date 
discounted by a maximum of 20 per cent.  
Options granted to executive directors under the UK SAYE Scheme 
are not subject to performance conditions,  as it is a HM Revenue & 
Customs’  approved all-employee scheme,  which does not allow for 
the imposition of performance conditions on the exercise of options.  
A similar scheme was also adopted in 2008 for the beneﬁ t of US based 
employees,  including executive directors,  and the savings period is 
typically 24 months,  with an option price discounted by a maximum 
of 15 per cent (“US Scheme”).

as Senior Independent Director receives an additional £5,000 per annum.  The basic fee was increased to £40,000 per annum from January 2011;  
other additional fees remain unchanged.  The Chairman’s fee was also increased to £137,150 per annum from January 2011.
Notes:

re-appointment or latest date of re-election to the Board.  
2  The beneﬁ t package mainly comprises of a car allowance or company car,  life assurance and medical cover.
3  David Dutro as Group Chief Executive,  who is based and devotes most of his time in the US and receives his salary in US dollars,  received 
a salary of $669,500 per annum (2009:  $650,000 per annum).  His emoluments exclude salary supplements paid as compensation for the 
closing to future accruals of the US deﬁ ned beneﬁ t scheme – see below.  His basic salary in 2011 was increased by eight per cent.  
4  Emoluments for Brian Taylorson also exclude salary supplements paid as compensation for the limitation of pension rights to the former 
HM Revenue and Customs’  earnings cap.  These are shown in the Directors’  retirement beneﬁ ts table overleaf.  His basic salary in 2011 was 
increased by three per cent.
5  The Company has released Brian Taylorson to serve on the Board of Fiberweb plc and fees of £32,000 (2009:  £32,000) were paid to him during 
the year,  which he retained.
Retirement beneﬁ ts
David Dutro,  as a US salaried executive director,  participated in the Elementis Career Reward Retirement Plan (“ECRRP”) for US employees until 
the plan was closed to future accruals in May 2006.  The ECRRP is a cash balance retirement plan,  which falls under the category of deﬁ ned 
beneﬁ t pension plans in the US.  As the plan is closed to future accruals,  participants’  account balances are no longer credited with contributions,  
however,  interest is credited each year at the US Treasury 30 year bond rate.  David Dutro’s accrued beneﬁ ts under this plan are shown in the table 
overleaf.  The normal pensionable retirement age for David Dutro under the ECRRP is 65.
The ECRRP was replaced by a US 401(k) Plan,  which is similar to a money purchase scheme,  and a Non-Qualiﬁ ed Deferred Compensation Plan.  
Employer contributions in respect of David Dutro under these plans in 2010 were £34,988 (2009:  £49,316) in total.  The amount paid can vary 
from year to year as it is based on matching employee contributions up to about 6.0 per cent of their total remuneration each year.
Brian Taylorson,  as a UK salaried executive director,  participates in the Company’s HM Revenue & Customs’  approved funded occupational 
pension scheme,  and he is subject to the former HM Revenue & Customs’  earnings cap on the amount of salary which may be treated as 
pensionable.  
The main beneﬁ ts under this scheme to him as a UK salaried executive director,  who contributes a percentage of his salary to the scheme each 
year,  are:
�
 an accrual rate of 1/30th for each year of pensionable service;
�
 life assurance cover of four times pensionable salary;  and
�
 pensions to spouse and dependent children payable on death.
The normal pensionable retirement age for Brian Taylorson is 60.  Annual report and accounts 2010 Elementis plc   41

Transfer values for David Dutro and Brian Taylorson in the table below have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance 
with the UK Institute of Actuaries’  guidance note GN11.  The transfer value of the increase in accrued beneﬁ ts discloses the current value of the 
increase in accrued beneﬁ ts that the director has earned in the year,  whereas the increase in transfer value less directors’  contributions discloses 
the absolute change in transfer value and includes the change in value of the accrued beneﬁ ts resulting from market volatility affecting the

As at 1 March 2011 the Trustee of the Company’s Employee Share Ownership Trust (“ESOT”) held 5,578,169 (2009:  4,741,243) shares and,  as 
executive directors,  David Dutro and Brian Taylorson,  as potential beneﬁ ciaries under the ESOT,  are deemed to have an interest in any shares that 
become held in the ESOT.
As at 1 March 2011 no person who was then a director had any interest in any derivative or other ﬁ nancial instrument relating to the 
Company’s shares and,  so far as the Company is aware,  none of their connected persons had such an interest.  Between 31 December 2010 and 
1 March 2011 there was no change in the relevant interests of any such directors nor, so far as the Company is aware, in the relevant interests of 
any of their connected persons. 42 Elementis plc  Annual report and accounts 2010

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2010
The following methodology was used to re-present the 2009 results,  
originally reported in pounds sterling,  into US dollars:
a)   Income and expenses were translated at the average exchange 
rate for the relevant period;
b)   Assets and liabilities were translated at the closing exchange 
rate for each balance sheet date:  and
c)   Equity items were translated at historical exchange rates from 
1 January 2004,  the date for which the accounts were ﬁ rst 
prepared under IFRS.
The relevant exchange rates used were as follows:
  Year ended Year ended

Critical accounting policies Critical accounting policies are those 
that require signiﬁ cant judgements or estimates and potentially 
result in materially different results under different assumptions 
or conditions.  It is considered that the Group’s critical accounting 
policies are limited to those described below.  The development of the 
estimates and disclosures related to each of these matters has been 
discussed by the Audit Committee.
(a)  Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when 
the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result 
of a past event,  and it is probable that an outﬂ ow of economic 
beneﬁ ts will be required to settle the obligation.  If the effect is 
material,  provisions are determined by discounting the expected 
future cash ﬂ ows at a pre-tax rate that reﬂ ects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and,  where appropriate,  
the risks speciﬁ c to the liability.
  A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has 
approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan,  and the 
restructuring has either commenced or has been announced 
publicly.  In accordance with the Group’s environmental 
policy and applicable legal requirements,  a provision for site 
restoration in respect of contaminated land is recognised when 
the land is contaminated.  Provisions for environmental issues 
are judgemental by their nature and more difﬁ cult to estimate 
when they relate to sites no longer directly controlled by the 
Group.  Elementis has taken a consistent approach to estimating 
environmental provisions.
1 Accounting policies
Elementis plc is a company incorporated in the UK.  The Group ﬁ nancial 
statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the EU (“adopted IFRS”).  The Company has elected to 
prepare its parent company ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with 
the UK GAAP .  These are presented on pages 83 to 86.
Basis of preparation The ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared 
on the historical cost basis except that derivative ﬁ nancial instruments 
and ﬁ nancial instruments held for trading or available for sale are 
stated at their fair value.  Non-current assets held for sale are stated 
at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.  The 
preparation of ﬁ nancial statements requires the application of 
estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets 
and liabilities,  revenues and costs and related disclosures at the 
balance sheet date.  The accounting policies set out below have been 
consistently applied across Group companies to all periods presented 
in these consolidated ﬁ nancial statements.
The ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared on a going concern 
basis.  The rationale for adopting this basis is discussed in the Directors’  
report on page 27.
Transition to US dollar reporting The Company decided to change 
the Group’s reporting currency to US dollars in 2010 and these 
ﬁ nancial statements and the accompanying notes are the ﬁ rst full year 
ﬁ nancial statement to be reported in US dollars.  
The majority of the Group’s sales and earnings originate in US dollars 
or US dollar linked currencies and the change of presentation currency 
to the US dollar more closely aligns the Group’s external reporting with 
the proﬁ le of the Group,  as well as with current internal management 
reporting.
The change of the Group’s presentation currency has been accounted 
for in accordance with IAS 21,  The Effects of Changes in Foreign 
Exchange Rates.  In accordance with IAS 1,  Presentation of Financial 
Statements,  the Consolidated Balance Sheet for 2008 has also been 
disclosed along with those for 2009 and 2010 as a third statement of 
ﬁ nancial position.  Annual report and accounts 2010 Elementis plc   49
COMPANY OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
  (iii) Other intangible assets Other intangible assets are stated 
at cost or,  when arising in a business combination,  estimated fair 
value,  less accumulated amortisation.
  (iv) Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income 
statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives 
of intangible assets unless such lives are indeﬁ nite.  On this basis 
there is no amortisation of intangible assets relating to brand.  
Goodwill is systematically tested for impairment at each balance 
sheet date.  Other intangible assets are amortised from the date 
they are available for use.  The estimated useful lives are as follows:
 Patents and trademarks 10 – 20 years
 Other intangible assets  1 – 5 years
(d)   Derivative ﬁ nancial instruments The Group uses derivative 
ﬁ nancial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange 
and interest rate risks.  The Group does not hold or issue derivative 
ﬁ nancial instruments for trading purposes.  However,  derivatives 
that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for 
as trading instruments.  Due to the requirement to measure 
the effectiveness of hedging instruments,  changes in market 
conditions can result in the recognition of unrealised gains or 
losses on hedging instruments in the income statement.
  Derivative ﬁ nancial instruments are recognised initially at fair value.  
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised 
immediately in the income statement.  However,  where derivatives 
qualify for hedge accounting,  recognition of any resultant gain 
or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.  The fair 
value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price 
at the balance sheet date,  being the present value of the quoted 
forward price.  
  (i) Cash ﬂ ow hedges Where a derivative ﬁ nancial instrument 
is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash ﬂ ows of 
a recognised asset or liability,  or a highly probable forecast 
transaction,  the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative 
ﬁ nancial instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve.  
Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in 
the income statement.  
  (ii) Fair value hedges Where a derivative ﬁ nancial instrument 
is designated as a hedge of the variability in a fair value of a 
recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised ﬁ rm commitment,  
all changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognised 
immediately in the income statement.  The carrying value of 
the hedged item is adjusted by the change in fair value that 
is attributable to the risk being hedged (even if it is normally 
carried at cost or amortised cost) and any gains or losses on 
remeasurement are recognised immediately in the income 
statement (even if those gains would normally be recognised 
directly in reserves).
(b)  Pension and other post-retirement beneﬁ ts In respect of the 
Group’s deﬁ ned beneﬁ t schemes,  the Group’s net obligation 
in respect of deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension plans is calculated by 
estimating the amount of future beneﬁ t that employees have 
earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods;  
that beneﬁ t is discounted to determine its present value,  and the 
fair value of any plan assets is deducted.  The liability discount rate 
is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that 
have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Group’s 
obligations.  Pension and post-retirement liabilities are calculated 
by qualiﬁ ed actuaries using the projected unit credit method.  
The expected increase in the present value of scheme liabilities 
and the long term expected return on assets based on the fair 
value of the scheme assets at the start of the period,  are included 
in the income statement under ﬁ nance income.  Any difference 
between the expected return on assets and that achieved is 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income together 
with the difference from experience or assumption changes.  The 
Group recognises all such actuarial gains and losses in the period 
in which they occur through the statement of comprehensive 
income.  The Group also operates a small number of deﬁ ned 
contribution schemes and the contributions payable during the 
year are recognised as incurred.  Due to the size of the pension 
scheme assets and liabilities,  relatively small changes in the 
assumptions can have a signiﬁ cant impact on the expense 
recorded in the income statement and on the pension liability 
recorded in the balance sheet.
(c)  Intangible assets
  (i) Goodwill All business combinations since the transition to IFRS 
on 1 January 2004 are accounted for by applying the purchase 
method.  In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred 
since the transition date,  goodwill represents the difference 
between the cost of the consideration given and the fair value 
of net identiﬁ able assets,  liabilities and contingent liabilities 
acquired.  In respect of acquisitions prior to this date,  goodwill is 
included on the basis of its deemed cost,  which represents the 
amount recorded under previous GAAP .  Goodwill is allocated 
to cash-generating units and tested annually for impairment.  
Changes to the assumptions used in impairment testing could 
have a material impact on the ﬁ nancial position of the Group 
and of the result for the year.
  (ii) Research and development Expenditure on research is 
recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.  
Expenditure on development where research ﬁ ndings are applied 
to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially 
improved products and processes is capitalised if the product or 
process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group 
has sufﬁ cient resources to complete development.  Expenditure 
capitalised is stated as the cost of materials,  direct labour and 
an appropriate proportion of overheads less accumulated 
amortisation.  Other development expenditure is recognised in 
the income statement as an expense as incurred.   50 Elementis plc  Annual report and accounts 2010
(g)  Property,  plant and equipment Items of property,  plant and 
equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses.  Freehold land is not depreciated.  Leasehold 
property is depreciated over the period of the lease.  Freehold 
buildings,  plant and machinery,  vehicles,  ﬁ xtures,  ﬁ ttings and 
equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives on a 
straight line basis.  Depreciation methods,  useful lives and residual 
values are assessed at the reporting date.  No depreciation is 
charged on assets under construction until the asset is brought 
into use.  
 Estimates of useful lives of these assets are:
 Buildings 10 – 50 years
 Plant and machinery 2 – 20 years
 Vehicles 2 – 10 years
 Fixtures,  ﬁ ttings and equipment 3 – 20 years
  The cost of replacing part of an item of property,  plant and 
equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it 
is probable that the future economic beneﬁ ts embodied within it 
will ﬂ ow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably.  The 
costs of the day-to-day servicing of property,  plant and equipment 
are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
  Management regularly considers whether there are any 
indications of impairment to carrying values of property,  plant 
and equipment.  Impairment reviews are based on risk adjusted 
discounted cash ﬂ ow projections.  Signiﬁ cant judgement is 
applied to the assumptions underlying these projections which 
include estimated discount rates,  growth rates,  future selling 
prices and direct costs.  Changes to these assumptions could have 
a material impact on the ﬁ nancial position of the Group and of the 
result for the year.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements include 
the ﬁ nancial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the 
period.  A subsidiary is an entity that is controlled by the Company.  
Control exists when the Company has the power,  directly or indirectly,  
to govern the ﬁ nancial and operating policies of an entity to obtain 
beneﬁ ts from its activities.  The results of subsidiaries acquired or 
disposed of during a period are included in the consolidated ﬁ nancial 
statements from the date that control commences until the date that 
control ceases.
The Group has adopted IFRS 3 (revised),  Business Combinations,  
prospectively for business combinations where the acquisition 
date is on or after 1 January 2010.  This measures goodwill at the 
acquisition date as the fair value of the consideration transferred,  the 
recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree 
plus,  if the business combination is achieved in stages,  the fair value 
of the existing equity interest in the acquiree,  less the fair value of the 
identiﬁ able assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  For acquisitions 
made by the Group since its initial adoption of IFRS in 2005 and 
31 December 2009 goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the 
acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identiﬁ able 
assets,  liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree.  Transaction 
costs,  other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity 
securities,  that the Group incurred in connection with business 
combinations were capitalised as part of the cost of the acquisition.
1 Accounting policies (continued)
(e)   Exceptional items The Group presents certain items separately 
as  “exceptional” .  These are items which in management’s 
judgement,  need to be disclosed by virtue of their size and 
incidence in order for the user to obtain a proper understanding 
of the ﬁ nancial information.  The determination of which items are 
separately disclosed as exceptional items requires a signiﬁ cant 
degree of judgement.
(f)  Income tax Income tax on the proﬁ t or loss for the year comprises 
current and deferred tax.  Income tax is recognised in the income 
statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised 
directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.  Current tax 
is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year,  
using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance 
sheet date,  and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of 
previous years.  Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for ﬁ nancial 
reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.  
The following temporary differences are not provided for:  the 
initial recognition of goodwill;  the initial recognition of assets or 
liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable proﬁ t other 
than in a business combination;  and differences relating to 
investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably 
not reverse in the foreseeable future.  The amount of deferred 
tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or 
settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities,  using 
tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet 
date.  A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable proﬁ ts will be available against which 
the asset can be utilised.  Deferred tax assets are reduced to the 
extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax beneﬁ t will 
be realised.
  The Group is required to estimate the income tax in each of the 
jurisdictions in which it operates.  This requires an estimation of 
current tax liability together with an assessment of the temporary 
differences which arise as a consequence of different accounting 
and tax treatments.  The Group operates in a number of countries 
in the world and is subject to many tax jurisdictions and rules.  
As a consequence the Group is subject to tax audits,  which by 
their nature are often complex and can require several years to 
conclude.  Management’s judgement is required to determine 
the total provision for income tax.  Amounts are accrued based 
on management’s interpretation of country speciﬁ c tax law and 
likelihood of settlement.  However the actual tax liabilities could 
differ from the position and in such events an adjustment would 
be required in the subsequent period which could have a material 
impact.  Tax beneﬁ ts are not recognised unless it is probable that 
the tax positions are sustainable.  Once considered to be probable,  
management reviews each material tax beneﬁ t to assess whether 
a provision should be taken against full recognition of the beneﬁ t 
on the basis of potential settlement through negotiation.  This 
evaluation requires judgements to be made including the forecast 
of future taxable income.

COMPANY OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
Leased assets Leases which result in the Group receiving substantially 
all of the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset are treated as 
ﬁ nance leases.  An asset held under a ﬁ nance lease is recorded in 
the balance sheet and depreciated over the shorter of its estimated 
useful life and the lease term.  Future instalments net of ﬁ nance 
charges are included within borrowings.  Minimum lease payments 
are apportioned between the ﬁ nance charge,  which is allocated 
to each period to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on 
the remaining liability and charged to the income statement and 
reduction of the outstanding liability.  Rental costs arising from 
operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the period 
of the lease.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value.  Net realisable value is the estimated selling price,  
less estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.  Cost,  which 
is based on a weighted average,  includes expenditure incurred in 
acquiring stock and bringing it to its existing location and condition.  
In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress,  
cost includes an appropriate share of overheads attributable to 
manufacture,  based on normal operating capacity.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are 
stated at their nominal amount which is the original invoiced amount 
less provision made for bad and doubtful receivables.  Estimated 
irrecoverable amounts are based on the ageing of receivables and 
historical experience.  Individual trade receivables are written off when 
management deem them no longer to be collectable.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise 
cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of three 
months or less.  Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and 
form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included 
as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the 
statement of cash ﬂ ows.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially measured at cost (which is equal 
to the fair value at inception),  and are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.  Any difference 
between the proceeds,  net of transaction costs and the settlement 
or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the terms of the 
borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
Trade payables Trade payables are non-interest bearing borrowings 
and are initially measured at fair value and subsequently carried at 
amortised cost.
Share capital Incremental costs directly attributable to issue of 
ordinary shares and share options are recognised as a deduction from 
equity.  When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased,  the 
amount of the consideration paid,  including directly attributable 
costs,  is recognised as a deduction from equity.  Repurchased shares 
are classiﬁ ed as treasury shares and are presented as a deduction from 
total equity.  
In accordance with the transitional rules of IFRS 1,  the Company has 
not restated business combinations that took place prior to the date 
of transition to IFRS of 1 January 2004.  As a consequence the Scheme 
of Arrangement entered into in 1998 whereby the Company acquired 
Elementis Holdings Limited and applied the true and fair override 
to account for the transaction as a merger has not been restated 
under IFRS.
Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income 
and expenses arising from intragroup transactions,  are eliminated 
in preparing the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements.  Unrealised gains 
arising from transactions with associates and jointly controlled entities 
are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the entity.  
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains,  
but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Associates Associates are those entities in which the Group has 
signiﬁ cant inﬂ uence,  but not control over the ﬁ nancial and operating 
policies.  The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements include the Group’s 
share of the post-acquisition total recognised gains and losses and 
the net assets of associates on an equity accounted basis.  Where the 
Group’s share of losses exceeds its investment in an associate,  the 
Group’s carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further 
losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred 
a legal or constructive obligation.  
Foreign currency 
(a)  Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies 
are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of 
the transaction.  Monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at 
the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.  Foreign exchange 
differences arising on translation are recognised in the income 
statement.  Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated at 
exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
(b)  Financial statements of foreign operations The assets and 
liabilities of foreign operations,  including goodwill and fair value 
adjustments arising on consolidation,  are translated at exchange 
rates ruling at the balance sheet date.  The revenues and expenses 
of foreign operations are translated at the average rates of exchange 
ruling for the relevant period.  Exchange differences arising since 
1 January 2004 on translation are taken to the translation reserve.  
They are recognised in the income statement upon disposal of the 
foreign operation.  The Group hedges a portion of the translation 
exposure of its overseas net assets through pounds sterling and 
Euro borrowings.  From 1 January 2005,  the Group has elected to 
apply net investment hedge accounting for these transactions 
where possible.  Where hedging is applied,  the effective portion of 
the gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net investment 
is recognised in equity.  Any ineffective portion of the hedge is 
recognised in the income statement.   52 Elementis plc  Annual report and accounts 2010

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2010

1 Accounting policies (continued)
Impairment The carrying amount of non-current assets other than 
deferred tax is compared to the asset’s recoverable amount at each 
balance sheet date where there is an indication of impairment.  For 
goodwill,  assets that have an indeﬁ nite useful life and intangible assets 
that are not yet available for use,  the recoverable amount is estimated 
at each balance sheet date.  An impairment loss is recognised 
whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit 
exceeds its recoverable amount.  Impairment losses are recognised in 
the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are 
allocated ﬁ rst to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated 
to cash-generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of 
the other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis.  A cash generating unit 
is the smallest identiﬁ able group of assets that generates cash inﬂ ows 
that are largely independent of the cash inﬂ ows from other assets or 
groups of assets.  
The recoverable amount is the greater of their fair value less costs to 
sell and value in use.  In assessing value in use,  the estimated future 
cash ﬂ ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reﬂ ects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks speciﬁ c to the asset.  For an asset that 
does not generate largely independent cash inﬂ ows,  the recoverable 
amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset 
belongs.
Revenue Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair 
value of the consideration received or receivable,  net of returns,  
trade discounts and rebates.  Revenue is recognised in the income 
statement only where there is evidence,  usually in the form of a sales 
agreement,  that the signiﬁ cant risks and rewards of ownership have 
been transferred to the customer and where the collectability of 
revenue is reasonably assured.
Finance income and ﬁ nance costs Finance income comprises 
interest income on funds invested and changes in the fair value of 
ﬁ nancial assets at fair value taken to the income statement.  Interest 
income is recognised as it accrues,  using the effective interest method.  
Finance costs comprise interest expense on borrowings,  unwinding of 
the discount on provisions,  dividends on preference shares classiﬁ ed 
as liabilities,  foreign currency losses and changes in the fair value 
of ﬁ nancial assets at fair value taken to the income statement.  All 
borrowing costs are recognised the income statement using the 
effective interest method.
Share based payments The fair value of equity settled share 
options granted to employees is recognised as an expense with a 
corresponding increase in equity.  The fair value is measured at grant 
date and spread over the period during which the employees become 
unconditionally entitled to the options.  The fair value of the options 
granted is measured using a binomial model,  taking into account 
the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.  
The amount recognised as an employee expense is adjusted to reﬂ ect 
the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture 
is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Own shares held by Employee Share Ownership Trust (“ESOT”) 
Transactions of the Group-sponsored ESOT are included in the 
consolidated ﬁ nancial statements.  In particular,  the trust’s purchases 
of shares in the Company are charged directly to equity.
Investments Investments comprising loans and receivables are stated 
at amortised cost.
Government grants Grants against capital expenditure from 
government and other bodies are shown separately in the balance 
sheet.  Such grants are released to the proﬁ t and loss account over the 
same period for which the relevant assets are depreciated.
Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations 
A non-current asset or a group of assets containing a non-current asset 
(a disposal group),  is classiﬁ ed as held for sale if its carrying amount will 
be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing 
use,  it is available for immediate sale and is highly probable within 
one year.  On initial classiﬁ cation as held for sale,  non-current assets 
and disposal groups are measured at the lower of previous carrying 
amount and fair value less costs to sell with any adjustments taken 
to proﬁ t or loss.  The same applies to gains and losses on subsequent 
remeasurement.
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business that 
represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of 
operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale,  
that has been disposed of has been abandoned or that meets the 
criteria to be classiﬁ ed as held for sale.  Annual report and accounts 2010 Elementis plc   53
COMPANY OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
Termination beneﬁ ts Termination beneﬁ ts are recognised as an 
expense when the Group is demonstrably committed,  without 
realistic possibility of withdrawal,  to a formal detailed plan to terminate 
employment before the normal retirement date.  Termination beneﬁ ts 
for voluntary redundancies are recognised if the Group has made an 
offer encouraging voluntary redundancy,  it is probable that the offer 
will be accepted,  and the number of acceptances can be estimated 
reliably.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted New standards,  
amendments to standards and interpretations that are not yet effective 
for the year ended 31 December 2010,  and have not been applied in 
preparing these consolidated ﬁ nancial statements,  but that become 
mandatory for the Group’s 2010 ﬁ nancial statements are as follows:
IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures (revised 2009)
The revised standard introduces changes in disclosure for government 
related entities and revisions to the deﬁ nition of a related party.
Amendments to IFRIC 14 – prepayments of a Minimum Funding 
Requirement
The amendment removes unintended consequences arising from 
the treatment of prepayments when there is a minimum funding 
requirement and results in prepayments of contributions in certain 
circumstances being recognised as an asset rather than as an expense.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments:  Disclosures – Amendments to 
Disclosures
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements – Presentation of 
statement of changes in equity
This amendment introduces the requirement to present a 
reconciliation from opening to closing balances for each component 
of equity within the statement of changes to equity.
IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
Transition requirements for amendments made as a result of IAS 27 
(2008) to IAS 21,  IAS 28 and IAS 31.
IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting – Signiﬁ cant events and 
transactions
Introduces additional examples of events or transactions that require 
disclosure under IAS 34.
IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes – Fair value of award credit
The Group has not yet determined the potential impact of these 
standards and interpretations on the 2011 ﬁ nancial statements.
2 O perating segments
The Group has determined its operating segments on the basis of 
those used for management,  internal reporting purposes and the 
allocation of strategic resources.  The three reportable segments,  
Specialty Products,  Surfactants and Chromium each have distinct 
product groupings and,  with the exception of Surfactants which 
shares a common management structure and Specialty Products,  
separate management structures.  There is no material inter-segmental 
trading.  Segment results,  assets and liabilities include items directly 
attributable to a segment and those that may be reasonably allocated 
from corporate activities.  Presentation of the segmental results is on a 
basis consistent with those used for reporting Group results.  Principal 
activities of the reportable segments are as follows:
Specialty Products –  production of rheological additives,  
compounded products and colourants.
Surfactants – production of surface active ingredients.
Chromium – production of chromium chemicals.
Following the closure of the UK Chromium facility in 2009,  a review 
of the Group’s product portfolio identiﬁ ed that the management 
of the sales,  technical service and supply chain requirements of 
Pigmentary Oxide and Chrome Hydrate would be more effective 
within the Specialty Products division rather than the Chromium 
division.  In order to present segmental operating information in a 
consistent fashion with that now used for internal management 
reporting,  the previously reported segmental information for the 
year ended 31 December 2009 has been restated.
The inter-segment revenue identiﬁ ed overleaf represents the 
sale of these products from the Chromium to Specialty Products 
division.  Inter-segment pricing is set at a level that equates to the 
manufacturing cost of the product plus a commercially appropriate 
mark up.
Unallocated items and those relating to corporate functions such as 
tax and treasury are presented in the tables overleaf as central costs. 54 Elementis plc  Annual report and accounts 2010

The Group has continued its separate presentation of certain items as exceptional.  These are items which,  in management’s judgement,  need to 
be disclosed separately by virtue of their size or incidence in order for the reader to obtain a proper understanding of the ﬁ nancial information.  
A deferred tax asset of $5.8 million has been set up in the year to recognise the value of historic losses and other tax attributes that are now 
believed to be of value following an increase in the proﬁ tability of the UK based Specialties business.
Exceptional items of $76.4 million,  which were charged to the income statement in 2009,  included a charge of $33.5 million relating to European 
Union Commission ﬁ nes,  Chromium restructuring costs of $44.5 million,  exceptional hedging costs of $7.2 million and a $8.5 million credit 
relating to the valuation of the UK pension.  Full details of these can be found in the 2009 Annual Report.

jurisdiction,  transfer pricing legislation and local tax rate changes,  will affect future tax charges.
A deferred tax credit of $3.4 million has been recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the year of which $5.4 million relates 
to the initial setting up of a deferred tax asset (2009:  nil),  offset by a $2.0 million charge in respect of actuarial gains (2009:  $2.2 million charge).

The transfer between goodwill and other intangible assets is the result of the conclusion of the purchase price allocation exercise that took place 
following the Fancor acquisition on 24 December 2009.  An amount of $8.0 million previously and provisionally recognised as goodwill has been 
re-allocated to other intangible assets.
Included with additions to goodwill is an increase of $1.1 million from the Fancor acquisition and a decrease of $1.1 million relating to amounts 
received from the former owners of Deuchem relating to the settlement of some outstanding warranty issues.  The total amount of goodwill and 
intangibles relating to the Fancor acquisition is therefore $9.2 million and is analysed in Note 30.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated,  at acquisition,  to the cash generating units (“CGUs”) that are expected to beneﬁ t from 
that business combination.  The carrying value of goodwill relates to Elementis Specialty Products ($301.8 million) and Elementis Surfactants 
($3.5 million).
The Group tests annually for impairment,  or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.  The recoverable amounts 
of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.  The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the 
discount rates,  growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.  Management estimates discount rates 
using pre-tax rates that reﬂ ect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁ c to the CGUs.  The discount rate used 
in 2010 was 10.6 per cent (2009:  10.3 per cent).  The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.  Changes in selling prices and direct 
costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash ﬂ ow forecasts derived from the most recent three year plans approved by management for the next three years and 
extrapolates cash ﬂ ows for the following 17 years based on an estimated growth rate of 2.5 per cent.  The rate does not exceed the average long 
term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The brand intangible represents the value ascribed to the trading name and reputation of the recent Deuchem and Fancor acquisitions.  The 
Group considers these to have signiﬁ cant and ongoing value to the business that will be maintained and it is therefore considered appropriate 
to assign these assets an indeﬁ nite useful life.  The remaining intangible assets comprise of the value ascribed to customer lists,  patents and non-
compete clauses,  which are being amortised over periods of ﬁ ve to ten years.
Other intangible assets comprise mainly of the value ascribed to the brand and customer lists acquired as part of the Deuchem acquisition.  
The customer list is being amortised over a useful economic life of ten years.

Environmental provisions relate to manufacturing and distribution sites including certain sites no longer owned by the Group.  These provisions 
have been derived using a discounted cash ﬂ ow methodology and reﬂ ect the extent to which it is probable that expenditure will be incurred 
over the next 20 years.  
The Chromium UK closure provision contains all anticipated costs relating to closure including environmental costs.
Self insurance provisions at 31 December 2010 represent the aggregate of outstanding claims plus a projection of losses incurred but not 
reported.  The self insurance provisions are expected to be utilised within ﬁ ve years.

$32.1 million (2009:  $105.1 million).
Deferred tax assets have been recognised to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that there will be taxable proﬁ ts from 
which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.  Where this is not the case,  deferred tax assets have not been 
recognised.  No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries.  As the earnings are continually reinvested by 
the Group,  no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.  There are no signiﬁ cant temporary differences arising in 
connection with interests in subsidiaries and associates.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2010
continued
22  Financial risk management
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of ﬁ nancial instruments:
�
 credit risk,
�
 liquidity risk,
�
 market risk.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework.  The Group’s 
risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group,  to set appropriate risk limits and controls,  and to 
monitor risks and adherence to limits.  Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reﬂ ect changes in market conditions and 
the Group’s activities.
The Group’s Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group’s risk management policies and procedures and 
reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.  The Group’s Audit Committee is assisted in 
its oversight role by Internal Audit.  Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures,  the 
results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of ﬁ nancial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a ﬁ nancial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations,  
and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers.
Trade and other receivables
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is inﬂ uenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.  The demographics of the Group’s 
customer base,  including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate,  has less of an inﬂ uence on credit risk.  
No single customer accounts for a signiﬁ cant proportion of the Group’s revenue and geographically there is no concentration of credit risk.
Each new customer is analysed individually for creditworthiness before the Group’s standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are 
offered.  The Group’s review includes external ratings,  where available,  and in some cases bank references.  Purchase limits are established for 
each customer,  which represents the maximum open amount without requiring approval from the Board.  Customers that fail to meet the 
Group’s benchmark creditworthiness may transact with the Group only on a prepayment basis.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables.  
The main components of this allowance are a speciﬁ c loss component that relates to individually signiﬁ cant exposures,  and a collective loss 
component established for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identiﬁ ed.  The collective loss 
allowance is determined based on historical data of payment statistics for similar assets.
Investments
The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by only investing in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have a credit rating of at least 
A1 from Standard & Poor’s and A from Moody’s.  Given these high credit ratings,  management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet 
its obligations.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its ﬁ nancial obligations as they fall due.  The Group’s approach to managing 
liquidity is to ensure,  as far as possible,  that it will always have sufﬁ cient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due,  under both normal and stressed 
conditions,  without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.  The Group’s funding policy is to have committed 
borrowings in place to cover at least 125 per cent of the maximum forecast net borrowings for the next 12 month period.  At the year end the 
Group had $105.9 million (2009:  $127.2 million) of undrawn committed facilities,  of which $95.0 million expires after more than one year.  
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices,  such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates,  will affect the Group’s income or the 
value of its holdings of ﬁ nancial instruments.  The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within 
acceptable parameters,  whilst optimising the return on risk.
The Group uses derivatives in the ordinary course of business,  and also incurs ﬁ nancial liabilities,  in order to manage market risks.  All such 
transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the Board.
Currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales,  purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a foreign currency other than the respective 
functional currencies of Group entities,  primarily the Euro and the US dollar.  The Group hedges approximately 70 per cent of current and forecast 
trade receivables and trade payables denominated in a foreign currency.  The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk,  
most with a maturity of less than one year from the reporting date.  Annual report and accounts 2010 Elementis plc   67
COMPANY OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
Interest on borrowings is denominated in currencies that match the cash ﬂ ows generated by the underlying operations of the Group,  primarily 
US dollar,  but also Euro and pounds sterling.  This provides an economic hedge and no derivatives are entered into.  In respect of other monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies,  the Group ensures that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or 
selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary to address short term imbalances.  The Group’s investment in overseas subsidiaries is 
hedged by US dollar denominated drawdowns under the syndicated facility,  which mitigates the currency risk arising from the translation of 
subsidiary’s net assets.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s policy is to borrow at both ﬁ xed and ﬂ oating interest rates and to use interest rate swaps to generate the required interest proﬁ le.  
The policy does not require that a speciﬁ c proportion of the Group’s borrowings are at ﬁ xed rates of interest.
Other market price risk 
Equity price risk arises from available-for-sale equity securities held within the Group’s deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension obligations.  Management 
monitors the mix of debt and equity securities in its investment portfolio based on market expectations.  The primary goal of the Group’s 
investment strategy is to maximise investment returns in order to meet partially the Group’s unfunded beneﬁ t obligations;  management is 
assisted by external advisers in this regard.
The Group does not enter into commodity contracts other than to meet the Group’s expected usage and sale requirements;  such contracts are 
not settled net.
Capital management
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor,  creditor and market conﬁ dence and to sustain future 
development of the business.  The Board of directors monitors both the demographic spread of shareholders,  as well as the return on capital,  
which the Group deﬁ nes as total shareholders’  equity,  excluding minority interests,  and the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
The Board encourages employees to hold shares in the Company through the Group’s savings related share option schemes.  At present,  
employees,  including executive directors,  hold 0.2 per cent (2009:  0.3 per cent) of ordinary shares,  or four per cent (2009:  3.1 per cent assuming 
that all outstanding options vest or are exercised.  
The Board seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages 
and security afforded by a sound capital position.  The Group’s target is to achieve a return on shareholders’  equity of between 10 and 15 per cent;  
in 2010 the return was 28.8 per cent (2009:  negative 14.4 per cent).  In comparison the weighted average interest expense on interest-bearing 
borrowings (excluding liabilities with imputed interest) was 2.4 per cent (2009:  2.0 per cent).

The following summarises the signiﬁ cant methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of ﬁ nancial instruments reﬂ ected in the 
table above.
Derivatives (level1)
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is based on their listed market price,  if available.  If a listed market price is not available,  then fair 
value is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of 
the contract using a risk-free interest (based on government bonds).
Non-derivatives ﬁ nancial liabilities (level2)
Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash ﬂ ows,  discounted at the market rate of interest at the 
reporting date.
Trade and other receivables (level3)
The fair value of trade and other receivables is estimated as the present value of future cash ﬂ ows,  discounted at the market rate of interest at the 
reporting date.
Interest rates used for determining fair value
The interest rates used to discount estimated cash ﬂ ows,  where applicable,  are based on the government yield curve at the reporting date plus 
an adequate constant credit spread,  and were as follows:

Operating lease payments represent rentals payable by the Group for certain of its properties,  plant and machinery.  Leases have varying terms 
and renewal rights.
24  Retirement beneﬁ t obligations
The Group has a number of contributory and non-contributory post retirement beneﬁ t plans providing retirement beneﬁ ts for the majority of 
employees and executive directors.  The main schemes in the UK,  US and the Netherlands are of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t type,  the beneﬁ t being 
based on number of years of service and either the employee’s ﬁ nal remuneration or the employee’s average remuneration during a period of 
years before retirement.  The assets of these schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds or are unfunded but provided for on the 
Group balance sheet.  In addition the Group operates an unfunded post-retirement medical beneﬁ t (“PRMB”) scheme in the US.  The entitlement 
to these beneﬁ ts is usually based on the employee remaining in service until retirement age and completion of a minimum service period.  
A full actuarial valuation was carried out on 30 September 2008 for the UK scheme and at 31 December 2009 for the US and Netherlands 
schemes.  The UK actuarial valuation has been updated to 31 December 2010 for inclusion within this Annual Report.  The assumed life 
expectancies on retirement are:

24  Retirement beneﬁ t obligations (continued)
The main assumptions for the PRMB scheme are a discount rate of 5.75 per cent (2009:  6.25 per cent) per annum and a health care cost trend 
of 7.0 per cent (2009:  10.0 per cent) per annum for claims pre age 65 reducing to 4.5 per cent per annum by 2018 (2009:  4.5 per cent).  Actuarial 
valuations of retirement beneﬁ t plans in other jurisdictions have either not been updated for IAS 19 purposes or disclosed separately because 
of the costs involved and the considerably smaller scheme sizes and numbers of employees involved.
Following recent announcements by the Government that it intends to use CPI as the  “statutory rate”  for pension purposes,  liabilities within 
the UK pension scheme were positively impacted by $11.7 million as CPI will be the basis in the future for revaluing deferred pensions rather 
than RPI.

25  Share based payments
The Company has several share option schemes for certain directors and employees of the Group.
The Company has since 1998 operated an approved and unapproved,  discretionary executive share option scheme for executive directors 
and other senior and middle managers in the Group.  Under the current 2003 scheme,  which replaced the 1998 scheme,  the option price is the 
market price of a share on the dealing day immediately preceding the day on which the option is granted with no discount applied.  Options are 
ordinarily capable of exercise after three years,  subject to earnings per share and total shareholder return performance targets being met,  and 
within ten years of the date of the grant.
The 1998 and 2008 UK Savings-Related Share Option Schemes are schemes under which UK employees can enter into savings contracts with a 
building society or a bank for a period of three or ﬁ ve years and use the proceeds from their savings accounts to purchase shares in the Company 
on the exercise of their options.  The option price is the average market price over the ﬁ ve working days preceding the invitation date discounted 
by a maximum of 20 per cent.  The 1998 scheme expired in 2008,  although options are still outstanding under that scheme,  and was replaced by 
the 2008 scheme.
The 2000 and 2008 US Savings-Related Share Option Schemes are schemes under which US employees can enter into savings contracts with 
a bank for a period of two years and use the proceeds from their savings accounts to purchase shares in the Company on the exercise of their 
options.  The option price is the market price on the date of the grant,  discounted by 15 per cent.  The 2000 scheme expired in 2008,  and was 
replaced by the 2008 scheme.
Options were valued using the binomial option pricing model.  The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculations 
are as follows:
        2010 2009
Fair value per option (pence)        34.6 10.5
Expected volatility (per cent)        58.0 49.0
Risk free rate (per cent)        2.5 1.8
Expected dividend yield (per cent)        4.4 5.0
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the previous ﬁ ve years.  The expected 
life used in the model has been adjusted,  based on management’s best estimate,  for the effects of non-transferability,  exercise restrictions 
and behavioural considerations.  The Group recognised total expenses of $1.4 million (2009:  $0.9 million) related to equity-settled share based 
payment transactions during the year which includes awards made under the long term incentive plan (as amended in 2010) as shown in the 
table overleaf.
The table overleaf shows all outstanding options granted under the executive and savings related share option schemes.
The Company also made a grant of awards in 2008 under the long term incentive plan (“2008 LTIP”) were made to four senior executives that 
owing to the nature of the awards have not been shown in the table overleaf but are set out on page 38 of the Directors’ remuneration report.  
The 2008 LTIP awards were valued using the binomial method and an IFRS 2 expense of $0.5 million (2009:  $0.5 million) was recognised. 80 Elementis plc  Annual report and accounts 2010

The Company is a guarantor to the UK pension scheme under which it guarantees all current and future obligations of UK subsidiaries currently 
participating in the pension scheme to make payments to the scheme,  up to a speciﬁ ed maximum amount.  The maximum amount of the 
guarantee is that which is needed (at the time the guarantee is called on) to bring the scheme’s funding level up to 105 per cent of its liabilities,  
calculated in accordance with section 179 of the Pensions Act 2004.  This is also sometimes known as a Pension Protection Fund (“PPF”) 
guarantee,  as having such a guarantee in place reduces the annual PPF levy on the scheme.

30 Acquisitions
On 24 December 2009 the Group acquired substantially all of the trading assets of the Fanning Corporation and Fancor Ltd for cash 
consideration of $9.2 million.  Fancor is one of the largest North American suppliers of lanolin and lanolin derivatives and its acquisition has 
expanded the Group’s presence in the personal care market.
Because of the proximity of the acquisition date to the year end,  a provisional fair valuing exercise was performed for the 2009 Annual Report 
using book values at the acquisition date.  The difference between consideration paid and net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill.  
Following the fair valuing exercise and on the basis of the revised net asset values,  the difference has been allocated to goodwill,  brand and 
other intangibles.  On account of the strength of the brand and the Group’s intention to maintain it going forwards,  the brand is treated as having 
an indeﬁ nite useful life.  Other intangibles,  which include customer lists,  patents and non-compete clauses are being amortised over periods of 
ﬁ ve to ten years.

31  Contingent liabilities
As is the case with other chemical companies,  the Group occasionally receives notices of litigation relating to regulatory and legal matters.  
A provision is recognised when the Group believes it has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event,  and it is probable 
that an outﬂ ow of economic beneﬁ ts will be required to settle the obligation.  Where it is deemed that an obligation is merely possible and that 
the probability of a material outﬂ ow is not remote,  the Group would disclose a contingent liability.
Elementis LTP Inc.  (“LTP”) has been named as a defendant in chromium-related litigation currently pending in the State of Missouri (the  “Missouri 
Litigation”).  The Missouri Litigation developed into the following types of cases:  (1) approximately a dozen cases involving over 180 individual 
plaintiffs alleging property and/or personal injury;  (2) a class action seeking property damages for an unspeciﬁ ed number of putative class 
members;  and (3) a class action seeking medical monitoring damages for putative class members who live in a four county area.  Between 
December 2010 and January 2011,  three of the individual plaintiff cases (described in clause (1) above) involving approximately 130 individual 
plaintiffs and the medical monitoring class action (described in clause (3) above) were voluntarily dismissed.  In the remaining cases,  the 
plaintiffs allege exposure to a chromium compound as the result of processes utilised by a tannery in St.  Joseph,  Missouri that was owned by 
Prime Tanning,  Corp.  (“Prime Tanning”).  LTP has been named as the procurer of sodium dichromate for another defendant,  Wismo Chemical 
Corp.  (“Wismo”).  Wismo was located onsite at the tannery and was in the business of converting sodium dichromate (upon delivery by LTP) into 
chromium sulphate – a chemical agent that is commonly used in the tanning of hides.  Wismo,  in turn,  sold the chromium sulphate to Prime 
Tanning.  50 per cent of the shares of Wismo had been owned by LTP ,  its afﬁ liates or its predecessors,  but such shares were sold to Prime Tanning 
prior to LTP being named as a defendant in the Missouri Litigation proceedings.
Management,  after consultation with legal counsel,  has concluded that the proceedings are unlikely to be adversely determined against LTP 
and thus would not reasonably be expected to have a material impact on the Group’s ﬁ nancial position.  None of the proceedings is scheduled to 
go to trial before the beginning of 2012.  Annual report and accounts 2010 Elementis plc   83

Group Chief Executive  Finance Director 84 Elementis plc  Annual report and accounts 2010
Share based payments
The fair value of share options granted to employees is recognised 
as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity.  The fair value 
is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which 
the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.  The 
fair value of the options granted is measured using a binomial model,  
taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options 
were granted.  The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to 
reﬂ ect the actual number of share options that vest except where 
forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold 
for vesting.
Classiﬁ cation of ﬁ nancial instruments issued by the Company
Following the adoption of FRS 25,  ﬁ nancial instruments issued by the 
Company are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the 
following two conditions:
a)   they include no contractual obligations upon the Company to 
deliver cash or other ﬁ nancial assets or to exchange ﬁ nancial 
assets or ﬁ nancial liabilities with another party under conditions 
that are potentially unfavourable to the Company;  and
b)   where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s 
own equity instruments,  it is either a non-derivative that includes 
no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own 
equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the 
Company’s exchanging a ﬁ xed amount of cash or other ﬁ nancial 
assets for a ﬁ xed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that the deﬁ nition is not met,  the proceeds of issue are 
classiﬁ ed as a ﬁ nancial liability.  Where the instrument so classiﬁ ed 
takes the legal form of the Company’s own shares,  the amounts 
presented in these ﬁ nancial statements for called up share capital and 
share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Finance payments associated with ﬁ nancial liabilities are dealt with 
as part of interest payable and similar charges.  Finance payments 
associated with ﬁ nancial instruments that are classiﬁ ed as part 
of shareholders’  funds,  are dealt with as appropriations in the 
reconciliation of movements in shareholders’  funds.
2 Proﬁ t for the ﬁ nancial year attributable to shareholders
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006,  the Company 
has not presented its own proﬁ t and loss account.  A proﬁ t of 
£48.1 million (2009:  £0.6 million loss) is dealt with in the ﬁ nancial 
statements of the Company.  The proﬁ t for the year is made up of 
a £50 million credit from the partial reversal of the impairment of 
investments offset by a loss of £1.9 million.
1 Accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in 
dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the 
ﬁ nancial statements,  except as noted below.
Basis of preparation
The Company’s ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with applicable accounting standards and under the 
historical cost accounting rules.  Under section 408 of the Companies 
Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its 
proﬁ t and loss account.  As the Company’s voting rights are controlled 
within the Group headed by Elementis plc,  the Company has taken 
advantage of the exemption contained in FRS 8 and has therefore 
not disclosed transactions or balances with wholly owned entities 
which form part of the Group (or investees of the Group qualifying as 
related parties).
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of 
exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.  Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the 
contracted rate or the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet 
date and the gains and losses on translation are included in the proﬁ t 
and loss account.
Investments 
Investments in group undertakings are included in the balance sheet 
at cost,  or if lower,  directors’  valuation.
Dividends on shares presented within shareholders’  funds
Dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised 
as a liability at that date to the extent that they are appropriately 
authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.  
Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the 
notes to the ﬁ nancial statements.  
Pensions and other post-retirement beneﬁ ts
The Company participates in the Elementis Group deﬁ ned beneﬁ t 
pension scheme.  The assets of the scheme are held separately from 
those of the Company.  The Company is unable to identify its share of 
the underlying assets and liabilities in the scheme on a consistent and 
reasonable basis and as required by FRS 17,  it has treated the scheme 
as if it were a deﬁ ned contribution scheme.  As a result,  the amount 
charged to the proﬁ t and loss account represents the contributions 
payable for the year.
Taxation
Deferred taxation is recognised without discounting,  in respect of all 
timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation 
and accounting purposes that have originated but not reversed at the 
balance sheet date,  except as otherwise required by FRS 19.  Advance 
corporation tax recoverable by deduction from future corporation 
tax is carried forward within deferred taxation or as ACT recoverable 
within debtors as appropriate.

6 Retirement beneﬁ t obligations
The Company is a member of a multi-employer pension scheme providing beneﬁ ts based on ﬁ nal pensionable pay.  Because the Company is 
unable to identify its share of the scheme assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis,  as permitted by FRS 17  “Retirement beneﬁ ts” ,  
the scheme has been accounted for as if the scheme was a deﬁ ned contribution scheme.  The net deﬁ cit in the scheme at 31 December 2010 
was £18.5 million (2009: £43.1 million). 86 Elementis plc  Annual report and accounts 2010

The number of retail outlets increased to
186 from 144. The quality of new openings
remained high in sales terms, and like-for-
like improvement in established outlets 
was 4.2%. This strong underlying trading,
combined with the increase in scale of
operations, generated turnover up 25% 
to £144.1m (2001: £115.2m). 
Retail margins improved further , generating
a 29% higher trading contribution at outlet
level of £42.6m (2001: £33.1m). Central
costs were again managed tightly , and
EBITDA increased 28% to £36.4m (2001:
£28.4m). Pre-tax profits were 22% higher at
£20.0m (2001: £16.4m), on a comparable
basis before FRS10 amortisation
*
. This was
after an increase of £2.1m in interest which
was covered 3.5 times. Both EBITDA and
pre-tax profit exclude property disposal
profits of £264,000.
Cash generation continued to be significant.
Cash flow per share rose 26% to 48.7p
(2001: 38.5.p). Operational cash flow
increased 25% to £33.2m (2001: £26.7m)
with free cash flow 21% higher at £20.6m
(2001: £17.0m). Earnings per share
increased in line with sales, 24% higher 
than last year at 17.2p (2001: 13.9p). We
have adopted the new FRS19 accounting
standard, fully providing for deferred tax, with
a necessary restatement of comparatives. 
I believe this progress is an outstanding
achievement in a period that has been
challenging for leisure businesses. Once
again, SFI’ s primary objective of creating
shareholder value was delivered, with an
increase in economic value added (EVA) 
of £5.6m. One reason that explains this
performance is that SFI has positioned its
businesses in the key growth area of this
industry . In addition, it shows that SFI is
managing positively the process of industry
and consumer change, and is continuing 
to exploit the commercial opportunities that
change offers.
Dividend
Y our board is recommending an increased
final dividend up 10% to 1.87p (2001: 1.7p)
to be paid on 29 November to shareholders
registered on 27 September with an 
ex dividend date of 25 September . This
brings the total dividend for the year to
2.78p (2001: 2.525p). As in previous years,
a dividend reinvestment scheme will again
be available.
2002 achievements
Our strategy has been focussed clearly
upon achieving a scale of business that
positions SFI as a major force in the high
street bars sector of licensed retailing.
Positive progress in 2002 has substantially
achieved this objective, and extended 
SFI’ s presence nationally as a mainstream
multiple retailer . 
Management
I was delighted in April to pass executive
responsibility for SFI into the safe hands 
of Andrew Latham. He was previously
Managing Director-Retail and led day-to-day
operations with flair and enormous personal
commitment. He has managed the
complexities of rapid growth with assurance,
and has made a significant strategic
contribution. He is the architect of many of
the SFI retailing innovations, and has shaped
our operations into the complementary
brand strategy that differentiates SFI with a
strong competitive advantage in the market.
When the board invited Andrew to rejoin 
the Group in 1999, it was with succession
planning in mind. However , as a matter 
of policy he was asked to compete with
external candidates, and after an
independent executive search process,
established himself as the clear choice 
to become Chief Executive.
MAKING IT HAPPEN
SFI GROUP HAS NOW ACHIEVED 11 YEARS OF CONTINUOUS GROWTH,
WITH PRE-TAX PROFITS HAVING INCREASED IN THAT PERIOD FROM JUST
£18,745 TO OVER £20M
*
. IN ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL YEAR, THE COMPANY’S
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS ARE ALL POSITIVE. I AM PARTICULARL Y
PLEASED THAT THE STRONG GROWTH IN SALES IS REFLECTED IN SIMILAR
EARNINGS PER SHARE GROWTH OF 24%.
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT Tim Andrews is now established as Finance
Director . We welcome his depth of relevant
market knowledge and specific financial
expertise. Sound management of the
finance function is essential and the SFI
structure is well established. Tim adds the
professional quality that is essential for an
ambitious company , particularly one that
expects to move to mid-cap status.
We were sorry to lose Nick Irens recently ,
due to his leading involvement in the
successful bid for Esporta plc. Nick has
made a significant contribution to SFI as
non-executive director both in corporate
governance and in making the function of
the board more rigorous. I thank him
sincerely and we will miss his counsel.
Performance over a long period of time,
such as SFI’ s, is achieved through a talented
and committed management team, both 
in the bars and at the centre. I warmly
extend the board’ s appreciation of their
achievement and contribution.
Outlook
The new year has begun strongly , with total
sales in the first seven weeks increasing
31% and like-for-like accelerating to 5.6%
above last year . 
As the new financial year began, the World
Cup was having a marked effect on leisure
trading. SFI was one of the companies that
benefited strongly . Major matches created
remarkable trading peaks and sales shifts.
Consumers spent heavily but the timing of
major events resulted in some cutback later .
Overall, there was a material increase in
sales but not every pub or bar was able or
equipped to exploit the opportunity . Most
SFI bars benefited strongly from detailed
planning well in advance. This generated an
uplift in sales and has ensured a strong start
to the year .
The executive team under Andrew’ s
leadership has demonstrated the ability to
be at the forefront of industry development. 
I am confident of another positive outcome
for the year and continuation longer term.

BRANDS
• Slug and Lettuce EBITDA per 
site increased by 47.9% since 
the acquisition by SFI
• Parisa unit sales increased by 
17% since the acquisition by SFI
•Average weekly sales up 1% 
to £18,315
• Like-for-like sales up 3.1%

Parisa to Slug and Lettuce
Building on the success we have
achieved with the purchase of 
The Slug and Lettuce business in
November 2000, the brand has
been rapidly expanded from 32
operations to 58 by the year end.
The key to this expansion was the
acquisition of Parisa Café Bars. 
The former Parisa units were
integrated into SFI systems within 
a few days and so far 18 have been
converted into Slug and Lettuce
operations. On average this took
three days and cost only £60k.
Sales have improved by 17% in 
the converted sites. SFI GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2002

Building brands – Slug and
Lettuce
The Slug and Lettuce brand has
existed for 19 years and is very
different today from its foundation.
Since SFI purchased the business 
in 2000 we have re-engineered its
design, product offering and its
aspirational position. It is now a
national brand in the premium wine
bar/brasserie sector of the high
street bars market. 
Slug and Lettuce is an integral 
part of our complementary brand
strategy for the high street where
the brands complement rather than
compete with each other . MAKING IT HAPPEN
SFI HAS A CLEAR VISION AND UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO ACHIEVE 
A LEADERSHIP POSITION IN OUR MARKET PLACE. THE AGGRESSIVE
DEVELOPMENT OF OUR BRANDS CONTINUES TO DELIVER EXCELLENT
RESULTS. THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS IN
THE EXCEPTIONAL GROWTH OF THE COMPANY OVER THE LAST ELEVEN
YEARS. THIS GROWTH HAS BEEN ACHIEVED THROUGH A STRATEGY OF 
ORGANIC AND ACQUISITIVE GROWTH.

Litten T ree growth
The Litten T ree brand has consistently
delivered outstanding results for SFI
both in terms of growth in sales and
trading contribution. It exists in the
traditional pub/bar sector of the high
street bars market. The brand has
been rapidly expanded in the last
twelve months and the template has
been further developed. A total of
thirteen new sites have been opened
during this year , increasing the size 
of the estate by nearly one third.
Litten T ree in smaller towns
A feature of the growth of the Litten
Tree brand in the last year has been
our success at taking the brand to
smaller towns than those where 
we have previously operated. 
In these towns the Litten T ree’ s 
broad consumer appeal and
responsiveness to their demands
have resulted in excellent sustainable
long-term results. 
The Litten T ree trades in that micro
market as a big fish in a small 
pond. This strategy for the brand 
will continue. MAKING IT HAPPEN
WE RECOGNISE THAT WE OPERATE IN A FAST -PACED, EVER-CHANGING
MARKET PLACE. OUR CUSTOMERS’ TASTES ARE CHANGING AT AN
INCREASING RATE AS ARE THE LEVELS OF QUALITY , SERVICE AND VALUE

WE CONSTANTL Y WORK TO KEEP OUR BRANDS RELEVANT AND FOCUSED

Bar Med, a new brand template
The Bar Med brand as a whole
delivers quality results and exists in 
the young persons bar/venue sector
of the high street bars market. After
extensive research and review we
have evolved the template to a 
mark two version. We have created 
a modern, multi-functional bar
delivering a high-quality daytime 
food offer coupled with a mainstream
late-night venue. 
The first of these new template
Bar Med outlets opened in Lincoln
in December 2001. Subsequently 
a further three have opened
successfully in Harrogate, T orquay
and Shrewsbury . All of these first
four sites were new builds and are
trading well. We are now planning
to convert three existing outlets 
to this mark two template later 
this year . SFI GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2002

about Bar Med then please visit us

What our customers wanted, 
the new template
Research in our existing Bar Med
outlets told us that our customers
wanted a more contemporary offer ,
a venue for all occasions that was
not stereotyped; they wanted
somewhere to go that was relaxing
by day but vibrant at night; they
wanted a segmented unit layout with
contemporary design values and
they wanted a well-controlled
environment offering varied eating
options with fast, efficient service.
Further research in our new template
Bar Med outlets has indicated 
that we have delivered on these
requirements and created an offer
that is very appropriate for the core
consumer demands. MAKING IT HAPPEN
SFI HAS AN ENVIABLE TRACK RECORD FOR DELIVERING INNOVATIVE 
THINKING INTO OUR MARKET PLACE. WE HAVE LED THE MARKET WITH THE
DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHAMELEON BAR CONCEPT , AND HAVE ALSO BEEN 
AT THE FOREFRONT OF MANY OTHER SIGNIFICANT INNOVATIONS IN OUR
RETAIL SECTOR, SUCH AS DEVELOPING RETAIL LESSONS LEARNT BY HIGH
STREET RETAILERS AND APPL YING THEM TO THE LICENSED RETAIL BUSINESSES
WE OPERATE, INTRODUCING SCREEN MEDIA ADVERTISING, AND DEVELOPING
A SUPPL Y CHAIN SOLUTION BASED UPON CENTRALISED DISTRIBUTION,

MAKING IT HAPPEN
INNOVATION
•Average weekly sales for 
Havana sites £25,725
•3 further new openings planned 
for 2002
• Demon Drinks added £300,000 
incremental margin
• Further Demon Drinks products 
being launched – Demon Ice 
(a flavoured alcoholic beverage) 
launched in August 2002
The development of 
Fiesta Havana
We have developed the Fiesta
Havana brand positioning into the
young persons bar/venue sector. 
It is a stylish bar with a Latin
proposition. It is an original, trend-
setting venue and is all about
enjoying the occasionality of the
visit through a strong focus on
dancing, cocktails, food and
entertainment. 
The brand has been further
developed at the newly opened 
site in Douglas on the Isle of Man.
Further new openings under the
Fiesta Havana brand are planned 
for the first half of the next financial
year in Bristol, Fulham and Kingston. SFI GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2002
The development of 
Demon Drinks
SFI has identified a further
opportunity where innovation can
add value to our business, through
the development of own label drinks
products under the Demon Drinks
brand. We believe that the opportunity
exists to enhance margin, whilst
offering our customers a quality
product at greater value than 
other alternatives. 
The family of products under this
label now include: Demon Red, 
an energy drink, still and sparkling
water , orange juice and a cranberry
variant of the energy drink, Demon
Blue. All have successfully replaced
the volumes of the branded product
we previously offered with significantly
enhanced margin. A limited range 
of new Demon Drinks products will
be launched in the next financial year .
10/11 Looking forward
Rapid expansion over the last two years 
has left us in a strong position. New outlets,
which opened either side of the year end,
will ensure that a strong momentum of
earnings growth will continue into this year
but, as a consequence, gearing is higher
than we would like. Many shareholders are
rightly concerned that the balance sheet
needs to be strengthened. We have
acknowledged their concerns and are
taking appropriate action.
This year our focus will be on reducing
gearing substantially , while maintaining
double digit earnings growth. We will deliver
this by halving the planned new openings 
to 12, and by the disposal of non-core
operations. This strategy takes advantage
of the cash flow that we generate and
strengthens the balance sheet by 
reducing gearing.
We have already made some progress. At
the half year following the Parisa acquisition,
we reported gearing at 130%. This had
reduced to 121% at the year end on a
consistent pre FRS19 accounting basis. 
My objective is to reduce this below 100%
within 18 months.
My confidence in the future is based on the
excellent quality of SFI’ s management team,
its strength of operations and our strong
market position. We have an exceptionally
talented team and I was delighted to be
able to further strengthen it through the
recruitment of Tim Andrews as our new
Finance Director . Tim was previously the
Finance Director at late night bars operator
Po Na Na and The Slug and Lettuce Group
plc. He has wide experience and expertise
in this sector and is already making a
significant contribution.
Brand strategy
High street bars are the key growth area of
licensed retailing. It is a huge market that in
2002 is estimated to be worth £2.75bn
**
,
and embraces a wide range of varying
consumer propositions. A key factor that
differentiates SFI is our complementary
brand strategy . This ensures that in each
micro market we have a retail format
appropriate for the location and specific
target market.
Mintel have identified five sectors that
segment the high street bars market. We
compete in the three largest: traditional
bars/pubs, wine bar/brasseries and young
person’ s bars/venues. In each of these
sectors our brands are positioned at the
premium end where the overall rewards 
are highest due to the quality of sales and
margins. In each sector SFI brands have 
a clear differentiation, although in operational
terms all brands share the same core
systems and management controls.
**Source: Mintel
i) T raditional bars/pubs 
The Litten T ree competes in the largest
sector . It is a chameleon operation in that 
its trading style changes between daytime
and evening to attract different consumer
targets. It has a broad church appeal 
that attracts a wide range of age and
demographic groups, with a value-for-
money and an added value offering. Last
year we opened 13 Litten T rees bringing the
total to 57 nationally . This brand continues
to trade well with average net weekly sales
increasing to £18,451 from £17,336; like-
for-like sales were up 5.0% and like-for-like
EBITDA up by 8.7%. 
MAKING IT HAPPEN
I HAVE BEEN PRIVILEGED TO TAKE LEADERSHIP RESPONSIBILITY
FOR A COMPANY THAT HAS CONSISTENTL Y DELIVERED 
SOLID PROGRESS. THIS YEAR HAS CONTINUED THE GROUP’S
GROWTH RECORD. SINCE 1997 COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH
RATE HAS BEEN 55% IN SALES AND AT UNIT LEVEL EBITDA 
HAS INCREASED BY 61%. 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REPORT The brand continues to evolve and grow
with innovation being key to its continued
success. SFI’ s approach is to anticipate
changes in consumer demand and to
continually evolve its brands in order that
they remain at the forefront of trends in 
high street leisure retailing. We have focussed
on adding value particularly through live
entertainment. The Litten T ree has become
the place to watch sport of all types,
particularly football. In addition, food is an
important element to the brand offer and
menu innovation has resulted in encouraging
increases in average food sales per site.
As the Group progresses its expansion
nationwide, The Litten T ree continues to
have considerable success in smaller towns
in appealing to a wide audience. During the
year , we successfully developed nine sites 
in smaller towns such as Coalville, Bicester
and Long Eaton at a lower cost and
achieved our target return on capital of 
30% on fit out.
ii) Wine bars/brasseries
The Slug and Lettuce brand has been 
in existence for 19 years. Its aspirational/
premium nature makes it a leader in the
wine bar/brasserie sector . Its evolution 
has accelerated and developed since its
acquisition by SFI in 2000. The overall
format of the operations remains the same
but rigorous SFI retailing disciplines have
been embedded. EBITDA per site has
improved by 47.9% since owned by SFI.
This £2.6m of increased return illustrates 
the management’ s ability to add operational
value. Weekly average sales of original 
Slug and Lettuce sites have risen to
£18,315 (2001: £18,145). Like-for-like sales
rose by 3.1% and at EBITDA by 8.0%.
Just prior to mid-year we accelerated
expansion, primarily through acquiring a
chain of 28 restaurant bars (24 trading 
and 4 landbank), previously trading as
Parisa. This was financed without directly
increasing borrowing, but by realigning the
new openings programme instead to stay
within the Group’ s planned capital
expenditure budget. 
We assessed that the unrealised potential 
of the former Parisa sites was considerable
and repositioned our development
programme accordingly to accommodate
this advantageous property acquisition. 
18 of these have now been converted to
Slug and Lettuce. T wo sites will be converted
to Fiesta Havana and the remainder will
either be converted once licensing issues
are resolved or disposed of. Average weekly
sales before conversion of the Parisa sites
were £13,669 and currently are running 
at 17% higher .
In terms of systems and purchasing, the
whole Group was quickly integrated within
two days of us taking control. Sales and
profitability per site have exceeded the
targets laid out in the business plan. There
are now 58 Slug and Lettuce sites.
iii) Y oung person’s bars/venues
Bar Med and Fiesta Havana compete in the
sector that has entertainment and partying
as core values. Mintel categorises this as 
a young persons bar/venue.
SFI GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2002
12/13 A mark two template of Bar Med has been
introduced during the year and applied 
in four new openings. The new template 
is split in two; a contemporary bar and 
a strong venue area where the state-of-the-
art laser , light and music system enables
named djs, bands and entertainment of all
kinds to be provided. The mark 2 sites have
achieved very encouraging weekly average
sales of £21,173 that puts them in the 
top quartile of high street bars in terms of
turnover . The next stage of the repositioning
will be to trial this format amongst the
original Bar Med template.
The rationalisation of the estate will continue
and we anticipate that there will be 24 
Bar Meds going forward that meet the new
brand format. The Bar Med performance
from the existing estate achieved average
weekly sales of £21,549 (2001: £19,807),
like-for-like sales of 2.5% sales and 
13.3% EBITDA. 
Like Bar Med, the Latin Brands exist in the
entertainment-led, partying sector of the
high street bars market. There are 17 sites
in this category . During the year we added 
1 Fiesta Havana in the Isle of Man. This 
site is trading considerably above our
expectations. We will also add two sites
from the Parisa acquisition. The difficult
trading in the West End over recent months
has been well documented and Fiesta
Havana operations have been no
exception. The average weekly sales per
site were £25,725 and like-for-like sales
declined by 3.3%. In view of the exceptional
performance of the sites that we have
developed and improvements expected in
the West End, we remain confident in the
future for this brand. 
Company growth
The opportunistic purchase of 24 restaurant
bars previously trading as Parisa enabled 
us to increase the rate of growth to 46 new
outlets in the year . Five sites were opened 
in the first half and 17 opened in the second
half. 14 of these occurred in the last few
weeks of the year and as such produced
negligible profit contribution to these results. 
Disposals
In the last 20 months we have made positive
progress in exiting from the old-style,
unbranded pubs that are no longer core
and 10 disposals have been completed.
Our ongoing liability for five onerous
Entrepreneur leases has ended and the final
five outlets have terms agreed for disposal.
In December we undertook a sale and
leaseback of seven freeholds. In aggregate
the property disposals showed a net profit
of £264,000.
Gross margins
This year we increased our gross margins
by 1.4 percentage points to 77.7% 
(2001: 76.3%). 
This is contrary to industry trends, and is
principally explained by three factors. First
we have positioned all of our brands firmly
at the premium end of the sectors in which
they compete, where quality and added
value entertainment supports premium
pricing. We continue to avoid permanent
discounting but have retained a policy of
tactical price promotion to stimulate sales.
Secondly , the focus on retailing systems
and purchasing opportunities have driven
out more value, and thirdly , we have
introduced and extended our range of 
own label products. 
The range of products under our Demon
Drinks own label now include energy drink
mixers, bottled still and sparkling water and
fruit juice. These are all produced for us by
third parties. This activity would not have
been possible without us taking control of
our own supply route which we did in 2001.
The Demon Drinks products added an
incremental £300k to the margin in the
reporting year . In view of this contribution,
we are expanding this range to include 
a vodka based, premium packaged mixer
called Demon Ice.
MAKING IT HAPPEN
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REPORT
CONTINUED SFI GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2002
14/15 For your eyes only – (FYEO)
The Board is committed to exiting from 
this business and I would like to report
progress. Earlier this year we appointed 
a specialist property agent to identify
potential purchasers and negotiate a trade
sale. There have been a number of offers
but these either excluded part of the
operations or did not deliver acceptable
value. Subsequently , an extensive
marketing exercise identified that a break 
up of the operations was likely to be the
best way ahead.
The current status is that negotiations are
proceeding with a number of parties in
respect of these separate parts of the FYEO
assets. Conditional agreements have 
been made but are subject to funding and
other considerations. It is not appropriate,
therefore, to disclose details of the parties
involved or the terms of individual
transactions. I can confirm, however , that
the terms currently under discussion are 
in line with net book value. We anticipate
reporting progress in the near future.
Licensing reform implications for SFI
It is looking increasingly likely that the long
awaited reforms in relation to licensing,
which the Government have promised, will
be included in Queen’ s Speech for the next
session of Parliament in November . 
For the Group, the new Act will be mainly
advantageous but, along with most of 
the industry , we are opposed to the key
administrative changes proposed. It is likely
that responsibility for licensing administration
and new license granting will transfer from
licensing magistrates to local authorities. 
As a consequence, we believe that this 
will cause significant delay and potentially
increased costs. We have been proactive
and have been involved, through the trade
organisations, at the highest level of
Government, in trying to influence the
opinion and avoid disadvantageous drafting.
As the growth programme is a key driver 
of our development, delays that prevent us
from opening new sites could prevent our
growth objective from being met. T o avoid
this we have been ‘banking’ licences and 
in addition have set up our own in-house
licensing team. We have 33 new licences
for new premises ‘banked’. 
Estate details
At the year-end the Group had a total of
186 operations (2001: 143). These
comprised: Litten T ree 57, Bar Med 26,
Slug and Lettuce 58, Latin Brands 17 and
unbranded 28. We currently have 57 sites
with heads of terms agreed on the landbank.
Of them, 36 have planning in place and 
33 have licensing in place.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT MAKING IT HAPPEN
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
FOR THE YEAR END 31 MAY 2002
The Combined Code
The Combined Code on Corporate Governance (“The Combined Code”) seeks to promote the principles of openness, integrity and
accountability . These are principles that your Board fully supports and seeks to apply consistently in the running of your Company . Y our
Board has reviewed the provisions of The Combined Code in detail and is pleased to report that the Company was in full compliance with
the provisions of The Combined Code throughout the year .
The Board
The Board comprises two Executive Directors and four experienced independent Non-Executive Directors. The roles of Chief Executive and
Chairman have now been separated with A S Hill becoming Non-Executive Chairman and A M Latham being appointed Chief Executive 
for the Group with effect from 2 April 2002.
The Board meet at least bi-monthly to review the current state of the business and to determine its future development. It has a formal
schedule of matters specifically reserved for its decision including corporate strategy , business acquisitions and disposals, capital
expenditure authorisation, budget approval and performance review. Other matters requiring Board approval include changes in funding
arrangements, whether of debt or equity , and share option schemes.
All Directors have formal access to all information and, if required, external advice at the Company’ s expense. They also have access 
to the Company Secretary . The Chairman ensures that all Directors are properly briefed on issues arising at Board meetings.
A nomination committee comprising the Non-Executive Directors recommends to the Board the appointment of all Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors. Under the terms of the Company’ s Articles, one third of the Directors are required to submit themselves for 
re-election each year and at least every three years.
The Board has delegated, with specific laid down parameters, authority to an Executive Board, comprising the Executive Directors and
other Senior Executives. The Executive Board is chaired by A M Latham. The activities of the Executive Board include reviewing corporate
and financial risk, acquisition of development sites, the monitoring of the development of those properties and a wide range of other
operational matters.
Directors’ remuneration
The Company aims to provide Executive Directors’ remuneration packages commensurate with attracting, retaining and motivating
Directors of the necessary quality . The remuneration committee, comprising the Non-Executive Directors, meets at least twice a year and
performs the key role of setting the remuneration of Executive Directors, including levels for individual components of salary , performance
related pay , benefits, pensions provisions and contracts of service. In respect of performance related pay , the committee has endeavoured
to follow the provisions in Schedule A to The Combined Code. The Remuneration Report is set out on pages 20 to 21.
Accountability and audit
The Board ensures that an objective and professional relationship is maintained with the Company’ s external auditors through the audit
committee. The audit committee is chaired by R A Lo and comprises the Non-Executive Directors with the Finance Director and external
auditors in attendance as appropriate. The committee meets at least twice a year to fulfil its responsibility for a critical review of the annual
and interim financial statements (including the Board’ s statement on internal control in the Annual Report), prior to their submission to the 
full Board for approval. They also review the independence and objectivity of the external auditors.
Going concern basis
The Directors consider , after making appropriate enquiries, that the Company has adequate resources to continue operations for the
foreseeable future. Accordingly , the financial statements continue to be prepared on the going concern basis. SFI GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2002
18/19
Internal control
The Directors have overall responsibility for the Company’ s system of internal financial control, the effectiveness of which is reviewed on an
ongoing basis. The system is designed to provide reasonable but not absolute assurance that the assets of the Group are safeguarded,
that proper accounting records are maintained and that reliable financial information is produced. The more important elements of this
system include:
• comprehensive Corporate Governance policies with clear rules covering the delegation of authority
•preparation of annual budgets by all operating outlets. Budgets are reviewed by Executive Management and are subject to Board approval
• weekly and monthly reviews of sales, cash and profitability compared to budget and prior year with written commentary on significant 
variances
•a clearly defined framework for capital expenditure and contracts, including appropriate authorisation procedures and levels. There 
is a prescribed review process for capital expenditure proposals that identifies the commercial and strategic reasoning for the investment 
as well as its financial implications.
The Group does not have a specific internal audit department, although this situation is reviewed from time to time. Responsibility for
monitoring the integrity of financial information and the compliance with approved procedures is currently vested in head office finance staff,
who play a significant and pro-active role in this regard. The external auditors meet with the Audit Committee and report formally to them 
on internal financial controls annually .
During the year the Board commissioned an external report on the Group’ s approach to risk management. Its conclusion was that the main
risks which the business faces are understood and internal control systems are in place to ensure that they are monitored and weaknesses
reported. Areas which require more focus are a broadening of communications between Operations and House Managers and training
programmes to incorporate concentration on specific risk management issues. The Board is taking steps to ensure that these improvements
are implemented during the current year . In accordance with its existing practice, the Board will continue to conduct periodic risk reviews.
Statement of directors’ responsibilities
UK Company Law requires Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs
of the Company and the Group, and of the profit and loss account for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently
• make estimates and judgements that are reasonable and prudent
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures as disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements
•prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and
other irregularities. The Directors are responsible for ensuring that the Directors’ Report and other information included in the Annual Report
is prepared in accordance with Company Law in the United Kingdom. They are also responsible for ensuring that the Annual Report
includes information required by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority .

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MAY 2002
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable Accounting Standards and under the historical cost
convention. 
Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the company and all its subsidiary undertakings. The results of subsidiaries acquired or
disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of their acquisition or up to the date 
of their disposal. Intra-group sales, profits and balances are eliminated fully on consolidation.
Goodwill arising upon consolidation, representing the excess of the purchase price of subsidiary undertakings acquired, over the fair value
of the separable net assets acquired, is capitalised in the year of acquisition and amortised over its useful economic life. Goodwill on
acquisitions prior to 31 May 1999 has been charged directly against reserves. It will be charged or credited to the profit and loss account 
on subsequent disposal of the related business.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions since 1 June 1999, is being amortised over 20 years on a straight line basis. The Directors consider that 
this represents a prudent estimate of the goodwill’ s useful economic life.
Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of tangible fixed assets less their estimated residual values on a straight line basis 
over the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned. The principal annual rates used for this purpose are:
Freehold buildings 2%
Long leasehold properties over the higher of 2% per annum or the unexpired term of the lease
Short leasehold property over the unexpired term of the lease
Plant and equipment between 8% and 20%
Computer and till systems 20%
Motor vehicles 25%
Till and communication equipment 20%
No depreciation is charged on freehold land.
Interest on borrowing directly attributable to properties in the course of major refurbishment or initial construction is capitalised 
(see notes 5 and 11).
Operating leases
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the term of the lease, except where a rent free
period or other incentive is received. In such instances, the value of the incentive is released to profit on a straight line basis from the date
that the outlet is opened through to the date of the first rent review to open market value.
Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Turnover
Turnover represents the total amounts receivable for goods and services provided, after deducting VAT and excluding sales between 
group companies.
Deferred tax

The bank loans and overdrafts are secured by fixed and floating charges on all of the assets of the Group.
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity , retained profits and bank loans and overdrafts. In respect of bank borrowings,
interest rate risk is managed by entering into fixed rate swap agreements.
Significantly all of the Group’ s transactions are denominated in sterling which is its functional currency . Therefore there is negligible foreign
currency risk.
In November 2001 the Company entered into a new five year £135,000,000 syndicated loan facility agreement arranged by Barclays
Capital, the investment banking division of Barclays Bank plc, and underwritten by Barclays Bank plc which provides for a £110,000,000
revolving loan facility and a £25,000,000 term loan facility .
The interest rate on the above is payable at LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.75% to 1.65%, as determined by reference to the Group’ s
ratio of net borrowings to EBITDA.
At the balance sheet date the Company had £6,500,000 undrawn facilities. The undrawn facilities expire in June 2005. SFI GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2002

19. Deferred taxation
The previous policy was to provide for deferred tax only where it was considered likely that a liability would arise in the foreseeable future. 
Until 31 May 2001 no deferred tax provision had been considered necessary under the old accounting policy .
FRS19 ( Deferred T ax) has been adopted in the current year requiring the full provision for potential deferred taxation. As this is a change 
of accounting policy comparative amounts have been restated to comply with the new standard. Provisions for deferred tax have not been
calculated on a discounted basis.
The effect on the balance sheet has been to include a provision for deferred tax, thereby reducing both profit and loss reserve and net assets
by the following amounts:
Deferred 
tax provision
£’000
At 31 May 2000 7,414
Charge for year to 31 May 2001 3,532
Balance at 31 May 2001 10,946
Charge for year to 31 May 2002 3,141
Acquired on acquisition of subsidiary undertaking 654
Balance at 31 May 2002 14,741
The timing differences all arise from accelerated capital allowances.
In addition the goodwill on the acquisition of The Slug and Lettuce Group plc has been increased by £1.1m. The effect on the Profit and 
Loss account has been to increase the goodwill amortisation charge for the year to 31 May 2001 by £42,000 to £578,000. The effect on the
balance sheet at 31 May 2001 is to increase net book value of intangible assets by £1,058,000 to £14,556,000.

OF SFI GROUP PLC
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MAY 2002
We have audited the financial statements of SFI Group plc for the year ended 31 May 2002 that comprise the Profit and Loss Account, 
the Statement of T otal Recognised Gains and Losses, the Balance Sheet, the Cash Flow Statement and the related notes. These financial
statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and the accounting policies set out therein.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and United
Kingdom Accounting Standards are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities. Our responsibility is to audit the financial
statements in accordance with relevant legal, regulatory requirements, United Kingdom Auditing Standards and the Listing Rules 
of the Financial Services Authority . 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the financial statements, 
if the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit,
or if information specified by law or the Listing Rules regarding directors’ remuneration and transactions with the company and other
members of the group is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement on page 18 reflects the company’ s compliance with the seven provisions of the
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the
board’ s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’ s corporate
governance procedures or the group’ s risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements.
This other information comprises only the Chairman’ s Statement, the Chief Executive’ s Report, the Directors’ Report, the Corporate
Governance Report and the Remuneration Report. We consider the implications for our audit report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an assessment
of the significant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the company’ s and the group’ s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to 
provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether
caused by fraud or other irregularity or error . In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information
in the financial statements.
Unqualified opinion
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the company’ s and the group’ s affairs at 31 May 2002 
and of the profit of the group for the year then ended and have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

To consider and, if thought fit, pass the following resolutions as Ordinary and Special Resolutions respectively:
Ordinary resolution

(as defined for the purposes of Section 80 of the Companies Act 1985 (the Act)), up to an aggregate nominal amount of £937,392 (the authority to be 
in substitution for all existing authorities pursuant to Section 80 of the Act), provided that this authority shall expire at the conclusion of the next Annual
General Meeting of the Company after the passing of this resolution (or , if earlier , on the date that is fifteen months following the date of such passing)
save that the Company may before such expiry make an offer or agreement which would or might require relevant securities to be allotted after such
expiry and the Directors may allot relevant securities in pursuance of such an offer or agreement as if the authority conferred hereby had not expired.
Special resolutions
9. That, subject to and conditionally upon the passing of Resolution 8, the Directors be and are hereby empowered to allot equity securities (as defined 
for the purposes of Section 95 of the Act) for cash pursuant to the authority conferred by resolution 8 as if Section 89(1) of the Act did not apply to any
such allotment, this power to be in substitution for all existing powers pursuant to section 95 of the Act, provided that this power shall be limited to:
(a) the allotment of equity securities in connection with issues to holders of ordinary shares on a pro-rata basis, notwithstanding that by reason of such
exclusions of other arrangements as the Directors may deem necessary or appropriate in connection with fractional entitlements or legal or practical
problems arising under the laws or requirements of any recognised regulatory body or any stock exchange or otherwise in any overseas territory , the
equity securities to be issued are not offered to all such holders in proportion to the number of ordinary shares held by each of them; and
(b) the allotment (otherwise than pursuant to sub-paragraph (a) of this Resolution) of equity securities up to an aggregate nominal amount 
of £937,392 and shall expire at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company after the passing of this resolution (or , if earlier , 
on the date that is fifteen months following the date of such passing), save that the Company may before such expiry make an offer or agreement 
which would or might require securities to be allotted after such expiry and the Directors may allot equity securities in pursuance of such an offer 
or agreement as if the power conferred hereby had not expired.
10. That the Company itself be generally and unconditionally authorised for the purposes of Section 166 of the Act to purchase up to 7,499,143 ordinary
shares in the market, representing 10 per cent of the current issued ordinary share capital of the Company , at a price not less than the nominal value 
of the ordinary shares and not more than 5 per cent above the average of the middle market quotations of the Company’ s ordinary shares derived from
the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List for the 5 business days before the purchase is made. The authority to be given for the period ending on 
the date of the next Annual General Meeting or 15 months after the passing of the resolution (whichever is the earlier) save that the Company may before
such expiry make an offer or agreement to purchase ordinary shares after such expiry and the Company may purchase ordinary shares in pursuance 
of such an offer or agreement as if the power conferred hereby had not expired. It is intended that a resolution of the renewal of such authority would 
be proposed at each succeeding Annual General Meeting. The Directors have no present intention of making such purchases, but it is prudent to have
this authority so as to be able to act at short notice if circumstances change. The authority would, however , only be exercised if the Directors believe 
that to do so would be in the best interests of the Company generally .

Explanations regarding the Notice of Annual General Meeting
Resolution 1
The Directors of the Company are obliged to present the Report and Accounts to shareholders of the Company at the Annual General Meeting. 
This is a standard form of resolution common to all Annual General Meetings.
Resolution 2
The Company’ s Articles of Association require that the Company declares final dividends payable to shareholders for approval by ordinary resolution.
Subject to the passing of the ordinary resolution the recommended final dividend of 1.87p per ordinary 25p share will be payable on 29 November 2002 
to shareholders on the register on 27 September 2002. 
Resolutions 3, 4 and 5
The Company’ s Articles of Association require a portion of the Directors to stand down at each Annual General Meeting and, if they are eligible, they may 
offer themselves for re-election. The Articles also require Directors appointed by the Board during the year to submit themselves for re-election.
The Directors to stand down are A M Latham, F E J G Brackenbury and T K Andrews.
Resolutions 6 and 7
All public companies are required to appoint auditors at each Annual General Meeting at which Accounts are presented, to hold office until the next such
meeting. These resolutions therefore propose the re appointment of Horwath Clark Whitehill and, in accordance with usual practice, authorise the Directors,
to fix their remuneration.
Resolutions 8 and 9
These resolutions continue the Directors’ authority , under sections 80 and 95 of the Companies Act 1985 (as amended) to allot shares, including in
circumstances other than pro-rata for cash to all shareholders. The authority , which was last renewed at the 2001 Annual General Meeting, provides flexibility
in respect of the Company’ s financial arrangements. The resolution deals with the allotment of shares for cash up to a nominal value of £937,392 being 
5% of the issued share capital. This limit is within the guidelines issued by the Investment Committees of the Association of British Insurers and the National
Association of Pension Funds.
In order to satisfy the Company’ s obligations arising in connection with the acquisition of Parisa Cafe Bars announced on 16 November 2001, the Company
may be required to allot up to 3.205 million ordinary shares in the period to 23 November 2003. 
Resolution 10
The effect of this resolution is to renew the authority to the Company to purchase its own shares up to a maximum of 7,499,143 shares, representing 10% 
of the Company’ s issued share capital. The minimum price at which the shares may be purchased is 25p and the maximum is an amount equivalent to 105%
of the middle-market price derived from the London Stock Exchange Official List for the 5 days preceding the date of purchase. 
The authority will be exercised in circumstances where the Directors consider that it will be in the best interests of shareholders generally and will result in an
improvement in the earnings per share. The authority will expire at the next Annual General Meeting of the Company or , if earlier , 15 months after the date 
on which the resolution is passed. 
To date, no shares have been bought back under the powers given by this authority .  CONTENTS

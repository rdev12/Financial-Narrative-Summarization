Mothercare opened its ﬁrst store in 1961 and since its earliest 
days has been a specialist retailer of products for mothers-to-
be, babies and children up to the age of eight. Our core area of 
specialism remains the pre-birth months and babies aged up 
to two years of age. Mothercare’s product offering is wide and

furnishings for babies and young children, bedding, feeding, 
bathing, travel equipment and toys. We sell our products

Overview UK
Consumer spending remained 
challenging throughout the 
year, which resulted in the UK 
delivering an operating loss of 
£24.7 million for the ﬁnancial year 
ended 31 March 2012.
 Total UK sales were down 4.6 per cent at £560.0 million, with like-
for-like sales down 6.2 per cent. Gross margin erosion of circa 500 
basis points over the year put further pressure on UK proﬁtability. 
As a result the UK delivered an operating loss of £24.7 million for 
the year ended 31 March 2012
 The strategy for transforming the UK will, over the next three years, 
dispose of loss making stores, reduce the operating cost base by 
at least £20 million and invest in product, store environment and 
services, thereby returning the UK to proﬁtability

We ended the year with 311 stores in the 
UK having closed a net 62 stores (closed 
67 and opened ﬁve stores) during the 
year. Space in the UK was down 3.5 per 
cent, closing the year with 1,946k sq. ft. 
across the store portfolio. It is our 
intention to further reduce the store 
network to circa 200 stores, reducing 
space to circa 1,700k sq. ft. by March 2015.
Over the year store-based sales were 
down 8.7 per cent to £398.7 million. This 
was attributable to both the decline in 
like-for-like sales and the continued 
closure of stores.
Total direct sales were up 0.8 per cent 
at £130.0 million with Direct in Home 
sales of £91.7 million and Direct in Store 
sales of £38.3 million. The legacy 
platform, which contributed to the 
under performance of our sales in this 
segment, has now been replaced by 
a new platform. Our new website offers 
additional functionality making it 
easier for customers to navigate and 
complete orders more effectively, which 
is expected to restore this segment of 
our sales to growth.
Wholesale sales were up 44.9 per cent 
to £31.3 million. The mini club range, 
which is a strategic partnership with 
Boots UK, continues to perform well. 
We are exploring the opportunities for 
growing ELC’s wholesale sales and 
have conducted successful trials with 
several leading retailers over the 
Christmas period.

We have taken our ﬁrst steps towards 
a multi-channel strategy across our 
International markets. We now have 
operational internet sites for ELC in 
Russia and Australia and for 
Mothercare in Kuwait, Ireland and 
Australia. We work with our franchise 
partners to develop appropriate 
websites and believe all our major 
partners will have transactional 
websites by March 2015.
We have a small wholesale business 
for ELC that helps us extend our reach 
to markets where we do not have 
franchise stores. Over the year 
wholesale sales were down 26.6 per

the result of changing our wholesale

Overview Our mission
04  Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2012
Our aim is to be the deﬁnitive 
one-stop-shop for mothers 
across the world for product, 
value and service. 
The brand qualities that will help us deliver 
transformation and growth:
Passion p05
We are passionate about the quality 
of all our products, which is reﬂected 
in our clothing ranges where we are 
working hard to deliver value without 
compromising on quality.
Expertise p06
We have over 50 years’ experience 
of meeting the needs of mothers and 
their babies and young children, which 
is reﬂected in our new furniture and 
bedding ranges.
Innovation p07
We have taken the time to reﬂect on the 
feedback from mums, taking the best of 
available technology and developing 
components where necessary to deliver 
lighter, easier to manoeuvre and more 
ﬂexible pushchairs.

 Passion
We take pride in the uncompromising quality  
of our clothing ranges, and have taken heed  
of customer feedback with regard to our  
value proposition and fashionability.
Our Autumn/Winter 12 ranges have seen a step  
up in these important areas and we have worked 
hard to deliver on customer needs. Our clothing 
ranges aim to be relevant and age appropriate 
with a nod to fashion. We have added key 
staples for the nursery bag with good quality, 
cute slogan or animal graphic t-shirts at great 
opening prices. Our ranges now move 
through the pricing architecture with clear  
good, better and best ranges. Even  
at the top end, we have realigned 
prices to offer uncompromising 
value to our customers.

Overview Transformation and growth
 Expertise
We have re-launched our furniture and bedding 
ranges for Autumn/Winter 12 with clear ranges 
at each price point. We recognise that some 
customers may have space constraints and have 
taken these needs into account when designing 
a compact range. This attention to detail is also 
evident in the recently launched Treasured range, 
which was designed with the International 
customer in mind. The success of the range in the 
UK at the ‘best’ end of our ranging reﬂects the 
quality and exclusivity of the product.

Overview
The Movix pushchair is a great example of  
the innovation that we aim to deliver for our 
customers. The lightweight, versatile chassis  
has been designed to accommodate three 
different travel options for baby with no  
need for adjustment or additional adaptors. 
Suitable from birth, the Movix comes with  
a carrycot which is parent facing and also 
includes a three-position seat which is both 
forward and parent facing. In addition a car  
seat option is available. Extra thought  
has also gone into accessibility  
to the under-seat storage and  
folding mechanism, making life  
easier for mum.

www.mothercare.com I was delighted to be approached and appointed Chairman of 
Mothercare last year. For over 50 years, Mothercare has been one 
of the pre-eminent names on the UK high street and ELC has over 
the last 30 years represented innovation and quality as a toy brand. 
The strengths of both brands, with a network of strong and 
passionate international franchisees, are clear assets of the 
Company, complemented by its sourcing operations.
The trading results of the UK business have worsened over the past 
two years. On becoming Chairman, it became evident from an early 
stage that signiﬁcant changes within the business were required. 
I assumed the role of Executive Chairman in November 2011, with 
a view to implementing these changes following the resignation 
of Ben Gordon as Chief Executive.
The board then carried out a thorough structural and operational 
review of the whole business, with the input of expert external 
consultants. The key elements of that review – the ‘Transformation 
and Growth’ plan – are set out in this report. In essence, we have a 
plan to transform the UK business to reﬂect the needs of customers 
and the changes in their shopping habits, while accelerating the 
group’s successful expansion internationally.
  After a thorough search process, the board appointed Simon 
Calver as the new Chief Executive. Simon has the skills, experience, 
passion and leadership expertise to put the Company on a much 
stronger and more proﬁtable footing
  Having the right people in place is a critical factor to the success 
of the ‘Transformation and Growth’ of the business. I have 
reshaped the executive team, so that now we have Mike Logue as 
Managing Director UK, and Jerry Cull as Managing Director 
International, each with ownership for their respective businesses. 
Their teams will be more focused and aligned to delivering the 
results we require
  It was clear that costs in the business had to be tackled quickly 
to reﬂect the reduction in the store estate in the UK. We now have 
a clear programme in place to tackle these costs which included 
a well managed and professional consultation process at the 
Watford head ofﬁce. This resulted in some job losses both in 
Watford and our overseas ofﬁces, which were greatly regrettable
Chairman’s statement
“ We have a robust plan for 
transformation and growth with 
new, strong leadership capable 
of delivering the results.”
 Alan Parker CBE 
 Chairman
08  Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2012   We have worked with our banks, who have been supportive of 
our business strategy by agreeing to provide increased facilities 
to allow the Company to take some of the decisive steps required 
under the ‘Transformation and Growth’ plan
  We have carried out a thorough, externally facilitated board 
evaluation process to review the overall effectiveness of the board 
and its interaction with the Company’s executive management
In addition, the Company has made signiﬁcant progress over the 
last year in a number of areas:
  International retail space of Mothercare and ELC products 
increased by 23.7 per cent (over 400,000 sq. ft. of extra space)
  The UK business reduced its estate by 62 stores, demonstrating 
that the Company is in the vanguard of reshaping its business 
to reﬂect the new customer shopping trends
  A completely new website was launched in May 2012 which 
signiﬁcantly improves the online shopping experience with 
Mothercare through computers or smart phones
Since Simon’s appointment as our new Chief Executive I have 
reverted to the position of non-executive Chairman and will ensure 
that the appropriate governance and oversight of the Company will 
be maintained.
I believe we have put the Company on the right course for success, 
and that the actions that have been taken over a period of 
nearly six months will allow Simon and his team to re-establish the 
relationship with our customers as a priority, continue to address 
the structural issues in the UK business, and to restore the 
group’s proﬁtability.
I appreciate the strength of support that I have received from our 
franchise partners around the world. Without doubt, this is a vital 
attribute to the strength and future development of the group. 
I would like to say a big thank you to our franchise partners for 
their support.
Also, I would like to recognise the hard work and loyalty of the 
many thousands of team members during a difﬁcult year. Their 
commitment continues to be a remarkable feature and remains 
fundamental to our future success.
Finally, on behalf of the board, I should like to thank Ian Peacock, 
who retired after nine years as Chairman of Mothercare, for his 
leadership of the Company and contribution to the business.

Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2012  09 
Overview Group results
Worldwide network sales grew by 6.4 per cent to £1,232.4 million 
(2011: £1,158.1 million), driven by the growth of our International 
business but tempered by the continued decline seen in the UK. 
Group sales, which reﬂect UK revenues and the payments we 
receive from our International partners, were up 2.4 per cent to 
£812.7 million (2011: £793.6 million).
The decline in proﬁts in the 53 week period has however been 
disappointing with a reduction in underlying proﬁt before tax to 
£1.6 million, down from £28.5 million last year. International has 
continued to grow rapidly, but the UK has struggled in the face 
of a challenging economic backdrop and an increasingly 
competitive environment.
Underlying proﬁt before tax declined to £1.6 million (2011: £28.5 million) 
with exceptional charges and other non-underlying items of 
£104.5 million (2011: £19.7 million) resulting in reported losses before 
tax of £102.9 million (2011: proﬁt of £8.8 million).
The non-underlying charge of £104.5 million includes £104.4 million of 
exceptional items including a non-cash write down of UK goodwill 
and other intangibles already announced in the ﬁrst half, together 
with a provision for restructuring costs to deliver the ‘Transformation 
and Growth’ plan.
Whilst over 70 per cent of the exceptional charges are non-cash items, 
the decline in UK proﬁtability and the need to fund an additional 
quarterly rent payment (due to the 53rd week in this ﬁnancial year) 
have resulted in a year-end net debt position of £20.1 million (2011: net 
cash position of £15.3 million). Over the next three years we will be 
incurring cash restructuring costs of circa £35 million in total. We 
recently reﬁnanced our banking facilities to fund the ‘Transformation 
and Growth’ plan, increasing committed facilities to £90 million, 
extending the term to May 2015 and resetting bank covenants 
(see Financial Review for more details).
As we announced in April, the board has decided to suspend the 
dividend until the ‘Transformation and Growth’ plan delivers a 
marked improvement in our results. There will therefore be no ﬁnal 
dividend payment this year, which means the payout for the full year 
is 2.0p per share.
Chief Executive’s statement
“ We need to bring the customer with us... 
they need to be at the centre of every 
decision we make. As a team, this is 
our most important delivery yet.”

Total International sales were up 17.8 per cent to £672.4 million 
(2011: £570.9 million) with total reported sales up 22.4 per cent to 
£252.7 million (2011: £206.4 million). International underlying operating 
proﬁts were up 26.9 per cent to £34.9 million (2011: £27.5 million). This 
proﬁt comprised franchise proﬁts of £38.1 million and joint venture 
and associate start-up losses of £3.2 million.
We now have three joint ventures and an associate. While our new 
joint venture in the Ukraine is proﬁtable, our joint ventures in India 
and China and our Australian associate are start-up operations and 
as such have made, in total, a £3.2 million loss for the period. We see 
our equity stakes in these markets as an important investment in 
future growth opportunities.
We have laid the foundations with our franchise partners that will 
see an acceleration in revenue and proﬁt growth. We remain the 
only specialist mother and baby retailer in this position in the 
world today.
We have great franchise partners many of which I have already 
had the pleasure of meeting. They have such enthusiasm and 
passion for our brands and are excited by their potential in each 
of their countries.

Our business model
Our business is fully integrated across all our 59 countries. 
Our International markets operate on a franchise model, 
which means store operations are managed by our 
partners, while in the UK we manage our stores directly. It is 
important to know that these differences in who manages 
stores and the sale of our products, means that there is no 
difference in the lifecycle of our product ranges, which we 
manage across our global ofﬁces in the UK, India, China, 
Hong Kong and more recently Bangladesh.
The product cycle starts at the concept stage where we 
consider our existing ranges, global trends and customer 
needs. We then test these concepts through customer 
focus groups. This gives us great insight into price points 
and the best pricing architecture, thus allowing us to arrive 
at relevant ranges at the good, better, best price points. 
At the design stage, we are always considering how we 
can help our customers by meeting their needs but also by 
considering the quality that our customers have come to 
expect from Mothercare.
Once we have product ready for our stores, merchandisers 
across all our markets consider the ranges and place their 
orders. It is our job then to source efﬁciently and ensure 
product is manufactured to our high standards. We then 
distribute product to all our markets ensuring timely 
delivery while also ensuring store staff across all our 
markets are trained in how best to sell our products.

UK results
Total UK sales were down 4.6 per cent at £560.0 million (2011: 
£587.2 million) with a like-for-like sales decline of 6.2 per cent. Total 
Direct sales were up 0.8 per cent at £130.0 million (2011: £129.0 million) 
with Direct in Home down 1.7 per cent at £91.7 million and Direct in 
Store up 7.3 per cent at £38.3 million. Our wholesale channel grew by 
44.9 per cent to £31.3 million.
Trading conditions in the UK deteriorated as we moved through the 
year. Although we have gained some market share in home & travel, 
the market was particularly weak and while we have gained some 
market share, sales were impacted by the reduction in the overall 
size of the market. We have managed stock levels very tightly over 
the year through additional promotions and offers and, as a result, 
we ended the third quarter with a clean stock position and a 
reduced gross margin which was, as expected, down 500 basis 
points for the full year. The UK segment of the Mothercare group 
recorded a loss of £24.7 million (2011: proﬁt of £11.1 million) for the year.
Our brands
The Mothercare and the Early Learning Centre brands resonate 
strongly with mothers across the globe. The strength of the 
International business and franchise partners has allowed us to 
grow robustly and is a clear indication of the relevance of both 
brands in our overseas and UK markets. We now have 1,339 stores 
worldwide across 59 markets – 409 in Europe, 318 in Asia, 311 in the 
UK, 290 in the Middle East and Africa and 11 in Latin America 
following our recent launch. In the UK over 80 per cent of expectant 
mothers continue to visit our stores and our challenge is to convert 
more of these visitors to loyal, long term customers.
Mothercare was founded in 1961 and has since its earliest days 
endeavoured to offer mothers-to-be, new mothers and their babies 
and children up to the age of eight innovative and quality products 
at great value that are relevant to their lives. Our ranges include 
products for feeding, bathing, travel equipment, maternity wear and 
associated product, children’s clothing, furniture, bedding and toys. 
Whilst we remain an important source of information and support for 
mothers-to-be and new mothers, I realise that we can do a lot more. 
These improvements will become increasingly apparent to our 
customers as we move through our three-year ‘Transformation and 
Growth’ plan.
Early Learning Centre was founded in 1971 and has its roots in a mail 
order business that today includes 462 stores worldwide, the internet 
and a small but growing wholesale business. ELC aims to provide 
babies and children up to the age of eight years nurturing toys 
that encourage learning and development in a fun and 
supportive manner.
Our strategy
We have over the last few months completed a thorough review of 
our business, both UK and International. This review forms the basis 
of our ‘Transformation and Growth’ plan, which is essential to deliver 
UK proﬁtability and accelerate International growth. The group’s 
task is to deliver this over the next three years.

In the UK, we continued our store rationalisation plan and ended the 
year with 311 stores. On 1 May 2012 we launched our new website.
Our senior management team continues to be strengthened. 
Mike Logue, our UK Managing Director, has been with the business 
since August 2011 and is building a strong UK team to assist him 
in the task ahead. I joined on 30 April 2012 and Jerry Cull our 
International Managing Director, who has been with the business 
for over 30 years, continues to drive International forward.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank Alan Parker our 
Chairman, who stepped up to an executive role, for his leadership 
of the business over the last few months. Our review is now complete 
and I have a clear strategy in the ‘Transformation and Growth’ plan, 
which we will implement over the next three years. It is in essence a 
simple plan – accelerate International growth while returning the UK 
to proﬁtability through cost reduction and transformation. This will be 
our most important delivery yet. In addition, the customer will return 
to the centre of everything that we do. Our success will be driven by 
our ability to reconnect with them, converting more into shoppers 
both online and in-store.
Our strategy is based on the four cornerstones of:
  Lean retail
  Restore UK proﬁtability
  Accelerate International growth
  Multi-channel worldwide
Summary
I am excited to have joined the Mothercare group as Chief Executive 
and I am conﬁdent about the opportunities ahead. Worldwide 
network sales are up 6.4 per cent and our brands remain as relevant 
to our customers today as they ever have been. I have been fully 
involved in the formulation of the ‘Transformation and Growth’ plan 
and I know that it is both the right plan and one which the team and 
I can deliver.
We have a long way to go, and the plan to bring the UK business 
back to acceptable levels of proﬁtability will take three years. We 
need to invest in e-commerce, be ruthless with our non-store cost 
base and use our scale and growth worldwide to drive sourcing 
economies and pass these savings onto the customers to improve 
our value for money around the world. Everything we do will 
enhance customer value, experience and loyalty in each of our 
59 countries. My team and I are up for the challenge and, whilst 
there is much to do in this difﬁcult economic climate, I look forward 
to delivering the ‘Transformation and Growth’ plan. As a team, this 
will be our most important delivery yet.

Overview Chief Executive’s statement
‘Transformation and Growth’ plan: 
The four cornerstones
1. Lean retail
Lean retail means delivering 
operational efﬁciencies and 
substantial non-store cost reductions, 
tightly managing cash and working 
capital and building on the scale of 
our sourcing operations.
Reduce UK non-store costs by 
£20 million per annum (annualised)
Our infrastructure is larger than we 
require, given our new smaller UK 
operating base. We have identiﬁed 
£20 million of annualised costs that 
can be taken out of the business over 
the next three years from areas like 
distribution, head ofﬁce costs and 
payroll. Work has already begun 
in this area and we have taken action 
to reduce UK head ofﬁce payroll 
costs by 16 per cent.
In addition, we reduced UK stock 
levels by 12 per cent during FY2011/12 
and plan to continue to drive down 
our working capital requirements.
Sourcing efﬁciencies
Our buying volumes continue to grow 
despite the recent decline seen in the 
UK. International growth of circa 20 
per cent provides us with a strong 
base from which to underpin 
negotiations with our supplier base to 
reduce costs that we can pass on to 
our customers in lower prices, further 
driving growth.
Category mix
Clothing and home & travel are 
expected to grow as a percentage 
of sales as Early Learning Centre 
stores are closed in the UK which will 
help to underpin our gross margins. 
An increased focus on innovation 
should also help to drive sales of 
own-brand product and again 
increase margin. These changes 
in category mix are expected to 
lower prices whilst maintaining 
gross margins.
2. Restore UK  
proﬁtability
Restoring UK proﬁtability means 
delivering proﬁtable growth through 
targeted and speciﬁc actions aimed 
at stabilising like-for-like sales and 
reducing signiﬁcantly store 
occupancy costs.
National coverage
We have identiﬁed that circa 200 
stores in the UK is the optimum size for 
Mothercare supported by online and 
wholesale business. This will offer the 
best national coverage of mother and 
baby specialists in the UK. These 
stores will not only be a place for 
shopping, customer service and 
advice but will also offer our ‘Collect 
in Store’ service, whereby online 
orders can be collected from stores. 
The target 200 stores chain is based 
around our proﬁtable Mothercare out 
of town stores, key Mothercare in town 
stores and Early Learning Centres in 
key strategic locations. The target 200 
store portfolio is currently proﬁtable. 
The stores to be closed currently lose 
circa £13 million per annum and these 
stores will be closed by 2015.
Increase value and innovation across 
our product ranges
We have lost ground in terms of our 
value perception and we need to 
change this. We aim to have a clear 
pricing architecture with good, better 
and best ranges all offering value to 
the customer in terms of quality and 
price. An increase in own-brand and 
third-party exclusivity over the term of 
the plan will also help to improve our 
value credentials.
In addition over the next few quarters 
we will continue to launch new and 
innovative products focused on solving 
the needs of mums and babies.
Enhance customer service and 
improve in-store environment
We are investing in additional training 
for all store staff and will have started 
with specialist ﬁtters for car seats 
and bras in all our stores at all times. 
We have also begun in-store 
investment focusing on ﬁtting rooms 
and baby feeding and changing 
facilities, which are important to 
our mums.
Customer satisfaction measurement 
by store has recently been introduced 
and will further help us to track daily 
store level performance. It is essential 
that in all of our markets we set, not 
follow, the standards of service that 
mothers expect, to retain the trust of 
our customers.
14  Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2012 3. Accelerate  
International 
growth
Accelerating International growth 
means increasing sales in existing 
markets, targeting new markets and 
focusing on key growth regions – 
China, India, the Middle East and 
Latin America.
Mothercare is a brand with truly 
global reach. Our International 
business continues to go from strength 
to strength. We have great franchise 
partners and proven concepts for 
Mothercare and Early Learning Centre 
across the emerging markets, which 
will drive space and revenue growth 
of approximately 20 per cent per 
annum over the term of the plan.
We are now in four regions and each 
is delivering strong growth for us. 
Europe (which includes Eastern 
Europe) and the Middle East and 
Africa, our two largest and oldest 
regions, are expected to deliver 
growth of 10 per cent per annum. Asia-
Paciﬁc is expected to grow by 20 per 
cent per annum while our newest 
region Latin America is expected to 
grow by over 100 per cent per annum, 
albeit from a lower base. Our business 
is well balanced and each region 
beneﬁts from some high growth 
markets. In particular we believe 
Saudi Arabia, Russia, China, India and 
Latin America will drive growth over 
the term of the plan. Overall, we 
expect International retail sales to 
grow by 20 per cent per annum over 
the next three years to March 2015.
Our joint ventures in the Ukraine, 
China and India and our Australian 
associate are all on track to be 
proﬁtable by March 2014.
4. Multi-channel 
worldwide
Multi-channel worldwide means 
launching new e-commerce platforms 
in the UK and all major overseas 
markets, growing both online revenues 
and store sales and putting 
Mothercare back into the lead.
New UK platform
In line with the plan we launched our 
new UK e-commerce platform for both 
direct to home and in-store ordering 
on 1 May 2012. The new website is a 
step change from the old legacy one 
with richer product content, improved 
search capabilities and better visibility 
for search engines. However, this is just 
the start but it has enabled us to have 
and use the tools commonplace 
across the industry to drive conversion 
and sales. Mothers are becoming 
much more informed and for many of 
our categories, signiﬁcant research is 
done online before customers visit our 
stores. Having a great website will 
therefore grow both online revenues 
and in-store sales. As the number one 
baby website we have a large 
amount of trafﬁc to our site and can 
increase conversion by doing the 
basics well. Thereafter we will begin to 
build long relationships with our 
customers, growing with them as their 
family does.
We have launched a new website in 
the UK and will build the capability to 
become one of the leading online 
players in the UK over the next three 
years. We will be redeveloping and 
reconﬁguring our delivery network, 
our technology teams and our loyalty 
and retention tools but we can and 
will get there.
International websites
In addition, we will lead the move to 
multi-channel in our International 
markets with fully operational websites 
in ﬁve markets. Our existing platform 
has now been tested and is easily 
scalable across all our markets. 
We aim to have transactional websites 
across our major markets over the 
term of the plan, many of which will 
be some of the ﬁrst such sites in their 
markets in any category.
Wholesale
Mini club, our wholesale arrangement 
with Boots UK for clothing, has been 
a great success. In addition to this we 
have a small but growing wholesale 
business for ELC product both in the 
UK and Internationally. We have, over 
the last few months, successfully 
trialed with several retailers. 
Wholesale is a great format for 
growing our reach for ELC and we 
would expect this element of our 
revenues to grow over the term of 
the plan.
Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2012  15 
Overview I joined Mothercare in August last year after seeing the potential 
both the Mothercare and ELC brands had in the UK. Clearly our 
latest results highlight the task that is ahead of us. I am however 
conﬁdent we can transform the UK business.
Having spent time with our customers and store teams in over 100 
of our shops they have made it very clear to me what needs to 
improve. We have put in place a leadership team wholly focused 
on the UK and we are off and running, reducing our cost base to 
ensure we have a lean UK business that can signiﬁcantly improve 
value and service.
On 1 May 2012 we launched our new Mothercare.com website 
and we have over 600,000 customers a week visiting our site. 
Our customers are seeing market leading prices on car seats 
and pushchairs as we monitor prices online and in-store daily. It is 
fantastic to see our investment pay off as we grow market share.
In July we launch our fantastic Autumn Winter 2012 (AW12) clothing 
range which our sourcing teams around the world have worked 
tirelessly to design and produce. Prices are down double digits 
across the entire AW12 range whilst maintaining the quality all our 
customers trust us for.
As we previously announced we are closing circa 70 ELC stores and 
circa 40 Mothercare stores by March 2015. This is absolutely the right 
strategy and we will maintain national coverage of both Mothercare 
and ELC, even after these store closures. The circa 200 store portfolio 
will include 100 Early Learning Centres within our larger Mothercare 
stores and 30 stand-alone ELC stores, which will complement our 
Mothercare.com and ELC.co.uk websites. We are well positioned 
to support our customers with the right multi-channel operation.
We have a lot to achieve, however I am conﬁdent by continuing 
to listen to our customers and our teams around the UK we shall 
transform the UK back to proﬁtable growth.

  Managing Director – UK
16  Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Our International business continues to go from strength to strength. 
We are now present in four regions and all contribute to our overall 
target of growing space and sales by circa 20 per cent per annum. 
We have also started our journey towards delivering a multi-channel 
offer across our markets and have transactional websites in four of 
our markets and expect to have all our major markets covered over 
the term of the ‘Transformation and Growth’ plan.
Europe remains our largest region with 409 stores covering 
992k sq. ft. in 28 countries. We expect space growth to continue at 
10 per cent per annum with the rapid growth markets of Russia and 
Turkey compensating for our weaker Eurozone markets. Ireland and 
ELC Russia already have transactional websites and the initial 
response has been encouraging.
The Middle East and Africa is our oldest region and has 290 stores 
covering 628k sq. ft. in 14 countries. Favourable demographic and 
growing afﬂuence underpin our growth expectations of 10 per cent 
per annum. We have recently launched a transactional website in 
Kuwait, which is fully customised to ﬁt in with local customs 
and practices.
Asia Paciﬁc now has 318 stores covering 644k sq. ft. in 13 countries. 
The opportunities in India and China remain signiﬁcant and we 
expect to see space growth of 20 per cent per annum for the 
foreseeable future. Our joint ventures in India, China and Australia 
will all become proﬁtable over the term of our plan. Our 
transactional websites in Australia are also proving to be successful 
and our website in Indonesia launches in June 2012.
Latin America is our newest region and at year end we had 11 stores 
covering 19k sq. ft. across three countries. We opened our ﬁrst store in 
Venezuela in May 2012. The opportunity for growth is signiﬁcant and 
we believe we can grow to over 200k sq. ft. over the next three years.
So as you can see the opportunity for growth is encouraging. 
We have a proven business model for the emerging markets, 
which we will continue to leverage over the next few years.

The ﬁnancial year ended 31 March 2012 contained 
53 weeks compared to 52 weeks last year. The 
ﬁnancial statements and this review have therefore 
been prepared on this basis.
For information on a more comparable, 52 week basis:
  Group sales were up 0.8 per cent to £799.6 million 
(2011: £793.6 million)
  UK sales were down 6.3 per cent to £550.3 million 
(2011: £587.2 million)

Results summary
Group underlying proﬁt before tax was £1.6 million 
(2010/11: £28.5 million). Underlying proﬁt excludes 
exceptional items and other non-underlying items 
of £104.5 million, of which £77.0 million was already 
reported in the ﬁrst half. This includes the non-cash 
write down of UK goodwill and intangibles (£55.0

restructuring costs of delivering the new 
‘Transformation and Growth’ plan. After these non-
underlying items, the group recorded a pre-tax 
loss of £102.9 million (2010/11: proﬁt of £8.8 million).

UK retail sales have declined year-on-year due to 
store closures and declining like-for-like sales across 
both the store estate and Direct channels. However, 
proﬁt has beneﬁted from the property strategy, with 
lower occupancy costs and tight cost control.
International has beneﬁted from the 22.4 per cent 
growth in total International reported sales driving 
growth in royalty income and shipments, with central 
costs growing at a slower rate. International proﬁt has 
been reduced by losses in joint ventures and 
associates during the year, mostly driven by the 
impact of restructuring in Australia.
Corporate expenses represent board and company 
secretarial costs and other head ofﬁce costs including 
audit, professional fees, insurance and head 
ofﬁce property.
Share-based payments
Underlying proﬁt before tax also includes a share-
based payments charge of £0.6 million (2010/11: 
£2.2 million) in relation to the Company’s long term 
incentive schemes. There are four main types of  
long term share-based incentive scheme, being the 
Executive Incentive Plan, the Performance Share  
Plan, the Deferred Shares Plan and the Save As You 
Earn schemes. Full details can be found in note 28.
The underlying IFRS 2 charge has reduced in 2011/12, 
reﬂecting the reduction in the group’s performance 
and a number of leavers from the executive schemes.
Like-for-like sales, total International sales 
and network sales
Like-for-like sales are deﬁned as sales for stores that 
have been trading continuously from the same selling 
space for at least a year and include Direct in Home 
and Direct in Store. 
International retail sales are the estimated retail sales 
of overseas franchisees and joint ventures and 
associates to their customers (rather than Mothercare 
sales to franchisees as included in the statutory or 
reported sales numbers). Total International sales are 
International retail sales plus International wholesale 
sales. Group network sales are total International 
sales plus total UK sales. Group network sales and 
reported sales are analysed as follows:

Financing and taxation
Financing represents interest receivable on bank 
deposits, interest payable on borrowings, costs 
relating to bank facility fees and the unwinding of 
discounts on provisions.
The underlying tax charge comprises current and 
deferred tax and the effective tax rate is nil per cent 
(2010/11: 25.6 per cent). The tax charge in some areas of 
the business has been offset by allowable tax losses. 
There is no underlying tax charge in 2011/12 (2010/11: 
£7.3 million). The total tax credit was £11.1 million (2010/11: 
charge of £2.3 million). In 2012/13, the effective tax rate 
is expected to increase towards the standard rate 
of tax.
Pensions
We continue to operate deﬁned beneﬁt pension 
schemes for our staff, although the schemes are now

not unwind until 2013/14, when no deﬁcit contribution 
will be due within the ﬁnancial year. The gains on

Balance sheet and cash ﬂow
The balance sheet includes identiﬁable intangible 
assets arising on the acquisition of Early Learning 
Centre of £6.9 million and goodwill of £26.8 million. 
This relates to the International business. In 2011/12, 
the group carried out a review to determine whether 
there is any indication that the goodwill and intangible 
assets suffered any impairment loss. It has been 
determined that the UK business does not generate 
sufﬁcient cash ﬂows to support the full value of the 
goodwill and intangible assets and consequently an 
impairment loss of £55.0 million has been charged.
The group continues to generate operating cash, 
with cash generated from operations of £5.6 million. 
The inclusion in the year of a 53rd week adversely 
impacted the timing of cash ﬂows, with additional 
rental (£13.2 million) and pension deﬁcit payments 
(£3.3 million) being incurred. Close management of 
working capital, in particular stock levels, generated 
an underlying inﬂow in working capital of approximately 
£9.0 million, excluding the 53rd week rent payment.
We have made signiﬁcant investments in our joint 
ventures and associates during the year to drive 
growth in International, including £2.0 million in the 
Ukraine, £1.5 million in Australia, £1.3 million in China 
and £0.9 million in India.
20  Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2012 After investing £24.9 million of capital expenditure 
(£21.4 million net of lease incentives received), 
receiving property sale proceeds of £2.3 million and 
£4.1 million in tax receipts and paying £11.9 million of 
dividends, the net debt position at the year end is 
£20.1 million (2010/11: net cash of £15.3 million).
At the year end the group had committed secured 
bank facilities of £80 million (with an average interest 
rate of 1.4 per cent above LIBOR) which were due 
to expire in May 2014. It also had an uncommitted 
unsecured bank overdraft facility of £10 million. On 
11 April 2012, the group reﬁnanced the banking facilities 
with the support of its two existing banks, HSBC and 
Barclays, increasing the level of committed facilities 
from £80 million to £90 million (at an interest rate range 
of 3.5 per cent to 4.0 per cent above LIBOR) and 
extending the term to 31 May 2015. These facilities 
provide additional liquidity and covenant headroom 
to accommodate the new three-year strategy. The 
covenants in the new facilities are tested quarterly 
and are based around gearing, ﬁxed charge cover 
and guarantor cover. 
Going concern
Details of this can be found on page 33 within the 
corporate governance section.
Capital expenditure
Total capital expenditure in the year was £24.9 million 
(2010/11: £21.8 million), of which £3.2 million was for 
software intangibles and £21.7 million was invested 
in UK stores and web development. Landlord 
contributions of £3.5 million (2010/11: £9.6 million) were 
received, partially offsetting the outﬂow. Net capital 
expenditure after landlord contributions was 
£21.4 million (2010/11: £12.2 million). Net capital 
expenditure for 2012/13, after landlord contributions, 
is expected to be circa £15.0 million.
Earnings per share and dividend
Basic underlying earnings per share were 1.8p 
compared to 24.7p last year. The board has decided 
that given reduction in proﬁts in the 53 week period 
and the cash investment required to deliver the 
‘Transformation and Growth’ plan, the Company will 
not pay a ﬁnal dividend for 2011/12. The total dividend 
for the year is therefore 2.0p per share (2010/11: 18.3p 
per share).
Treasury policy and ﬁnancial risk management
The board approves treasury policies and senior 
management directly controls day-to-day operations 
within these policies. The major ﬁnancial risk to which 
the group is exposed relates to movements in 
foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Where 
appropriate, cost effective and practicable, the 
group uses ﬁnancial instruments and derivatives 
to manage the risks.
No speculative use of derivatives, currency or other 
instruments is permitted.
Foreign currency risk
All International sales to franchisees are invoiced in 
pounds sterling or US dollars.
International published sales represent approximately 
31 per cent of group sales. Total International sales 
represent approximately 55 per cent of group network 
sales. The group therefore has some currency 
exposure on these sales, but it is used to offset or 
hedge in part the group’s US dollar and euro 
denominated product purchases. The group policy 
is that all material exposures are hedged by using 
forward currency contracts. 
Interest rate risk
At 31 March 2012, the group had drawn down 
£20 million on its borrowing facility. At this date and 
throughout 2011/12 no interest rate hedging was 
considered necessary. Following the reﬁnancing on 
11 April 2012 it is anticipated that the group will hedge 
the ﬂoating interest rate on a proportion of the 
new borrowings.
Shareholders’ funds
Shareholders’ funds amount to £72.7 million, a decrease 
of £120.1 million in the year driven largely by the 
goodwill and other intangible impairments and 
exceptional provisions required for the UK property 
transformation and restructuring. This represents 
£0.83 per share compared to £2.18 per share at the 
previous year end. The retained earnings reserve in 
the consolidated balance sheet shows a deﬁcit of 
£26.5 million. However, the Company has taken steps 
during the period to increase the retained earnings 
reserve in the Company balance sheet to £72.3 million 
and therefore has the ability to pay dividends and 
make other similar payments when the ‘Transformation 
and Growth’ plan is delivering beneﬁts.
Accounting policies and standards
There are no new standards affecting the reported

Our success in our International markets is driven 
by the quality of our franchise partners who 
believe in our brands. Whilst we continue to target 
circa 150 store openings a year, recently opened 
stores have been larger in size and we are now 
looking to grow space at the top of our previously 
guided range of 15-20 per cent per annum. Space 
growth and the subsequent like-for-like sales 
growth remains the driving force for revenues in 
our International markets.
International proﬁts

The focus on increasing space is clearly evident 
in the growth we have seen both in revenues

International business. Proﬁt growth has been at, 
or ahead of, space and we would expect this to 
continue to be the case for the foreseeable future.

It has been our strategy to rationalise our store

witnessed in terms of shopping habits across the 
UK. Core to our strategy of transforming the UK 
and returning it to proﬁtability is the removal of 
loss making stores from our estate. This process is 
expected to eliminate losses of £13 million, through 
the closure of circa 111 stores, on an annualised 
basis by FY15. As a result, we expect to have 
circa 200 stores by March 2015.

Business review Risks
Principal risks and uncertainties
The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Company 
may include some of those set out below. These risks and 
uncertainties reﬂect and focus on some of the group’s 
challenges in delivering the ‘Transformation and Growth’ plan, 
particularly in the context of the wider economic uncertainties 
at a macro level. It should be borne in mind that this is not an 
exhaustive list and that there may be other risks that have not 
been considered or risks that the board considers now are 
insigniﬁcant or immaterial in nature, but that may arise and/or 
have a larger effect than originally expected. Against this 
background, the system of internal control is designed to 
manage rather than eliminate risks, to reduce the impact to 
the group and to ensure that adequate mitigation is in place.

In order to manage risk effectively, the executive committee 
(see page 31) has overall responsibility for ensuring that a 
rolling programme of structured risk assessments of those 
areas having a signiﬁcant effect on the future of the business 
is carried out. The programme ensures, so far as practicably 
possible, that the appropriate risk management processes are 
identiﬁed, controls established, residual risks evaluated and 
that the necessary action and risk avoidance measures taken 
or monitoring undertaken. Elements of the programme are 
reviewed by the internal audit function during the year. 
The process outlined above has been in effect during the 
period and up to the date of the approval of the accounts 
by the board.

company secretary, who has been with Mothercare 
since 2010. The steering committee reports directly to 
the plc board and is supported by a small central

In 2007/08 we set seven targets to be achieved by 
2013 (published on www.mothercareplc.com). These 
targets and our current performance are shown in

targets we set ourselves in 2007.
Highlights
In 2011/12, the Mothercare group:
  exceeded its targets in buildings emissions, 
transport emissions and waste recycling
  had average service of store-based staff of 
nearly six years at both Mothercare and ELC 
stores
  had 53 per cent of senior management positions 
(below executive committee level) ﬁlled by women
  was ranked seventh in the Reputation Institute’s 
survey
26  Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Buildings emissions – target achieved
We met our buildings emissions target in FY2011 
and have exceeded our target this year by 
nine percentage points.
This was in part due to the ongoing store closures, a 
milder winter and our Swindon warehouse being fully 
rented out. We have also seen a 17 per cent reduction 
in electricity consumption and a 30 per cent reduction 
in gas consumption at our Daventry distribution 
centre. These reductions were driven by greater use 
of thermostat control, dimmer switches and a 
reduction in weekend working. We have also seen 
a small beneﬁt from the reduction in Defra’s emission 
factors for both electricity and gas.
It is encouraging to note that our stores improved 
their energy performance per sq. ft. by 3.4 per cent 
during the year.
Transport emissions – target achieved
We exceeded our target by 5 percentage points in 
FY2011 and have seen a further improvement, partly 
due to store closures but also from more effective 
stock control, ensuring that the right products are 
at the right place at the right time. Overall we have 
achieved a 33 per cent reduction in carbon emissions 
from our transport ﬂeet since 2007/08.
Waste recycling – target achieved
We redoubled our efforts, during the year, to reduce 
waste and increase recycling at both our stores and 
our distribution centres. Our ELC warehouse at 
Daventry was able to achieve zero waste to landﬁll 
during the year.
Communities – parents and children
We believe that parenting and raising children is an 
essential foundation for the society we live in, and that 
healthy babies, parents and families beneﬁt us all. 
We are committed to helping parents through the 
work we do by providing education and information to 
parents in the community; our Born to Care Partnership 
with Save the Children and charitable donations 
made through the Mothercare Group Foundation.
Awards received 
During the year ELC was awarded the ‘best toy shop’ 
at ‘Tommy’s let’s get baby friendly Awards 2012’. 
Mothercare won ‘best maternity basics’ at the 
‘Pregnancy & birth bloom awards 2012’.
Children’s play facilities 
In recognition of the importance of play in the 
development of children, we have created a small 
soft play area in a number of our stores. The areas 
are signposted and support the ethos of Playtime 
which we continue to hold every Tuesday at 11am 
across our ELC stores and ELC inserts in larger

staff and include painting, modelling, colouring and 
singing nursery rhymes and involve parents and

Baby and Me events 
Our larger Mothercare stores hold Baby and Me 
events for expectant mums and dads who receive 
advice and guidance on different aspects of 
parenting. These events have proved to be 
extremely popular.
Charitable giving 
Mothercare’s total direct giving to charity last year 
was £32,324, with £27,324 to the Mothercare Group 
Foundation and £5,000 to Save the Children. During 
the year the Mothercare Group Foundation was able 
to make grants of £124,360.
People who work for us
Mothercare retains its caring culture, which is clear in 
the loyalty we enjoy from our staff. The average length 
of service for our store-based staff is high at 6.0 years 
for Mothercare and 5.8 years for ELC. It is also not 
unusual to come across staff members with 10, 15 and 
even 20 years of service. The longest serving employee 
at Mothercare has clocked up 41 years, while at ELC 
the number is equally impressive at 29 years.
In addition, we take equal opportunities seriously and 
aim to reward and promote talent where appropriate. 
As a result we are proud to say that 53 per cent of 
senior management positions (below executive 
committee level) are held by women.
In a year when Mothercare has undergone signiﬁcant 
change, we were ranked seventh in the survey 
conducted by the Reputation Institute. The study 
measures the reputations of over 250 companies in 
the UK and is part of a larger study of over 2,000 
companies globally. The research conducted by the 
Reputation Institute indicates that strong reputations 
are based on the concepts of admiration, trust, good 
feeling and overall esteem that stakeholders have 
towards a company.
People making our products
Responsible sourcing remains a key focus for 
Mothercare – we aim to reduce the risk of brand-
damaging allegations by monitoring our supply base, 
gaining a better understanding of the complex issues 
that affect workers and ultimately working to provide 
better workplaces for them. Our Responsible Sourcing 
Code of Conduct and Implementation Policy are 
available online at www.mothercareplc.com 
Our Responsible Sourcing Team is made up of 12 
dedicated professionals located regionally in our 
Head and Sourcing Ofﬁces. They work directly with 
our suppliers and factories to understand the issues 
in the supply chain and improve working conditions. 
Their work is complemented by the third-party 
audit information we obtain through SEDEX  
(www.sedexglobal.com). By using our own internal 
team and third-party audit information, we increase 
the visibility we have over the supply chain, which 
allows us to focus on gaining transparency and 
working with the factory to make improvements.
The more work we do in this area, the more complex 
issues we unravel, which are often industry-wide issues 
and not limited to individual factories. In order to 
tackle these sorts of issues, we continue to be 
active members of the Ethical Trading Initiative  
(www.ethicaltrade.org). This platform allows us to 
have dialogue with other retailers, non-governmental 
organisations and trade unions, and to work together 
on programmes that tackle endemic issues that 
cannot be resolved by individual retailers.
Going forward, the Mothercare Responsible Sourcing 
Programme has to adapt to a changing business 
environment. As a result of this, the team is in the midst 
of developing a ﬁve-year strategy which will cement 
current global practices and fully embed responsible 
sourcing in the day-to-day culture of the Mothercare 
business, before expanding and undertaking 
aspirational work in the later years of the strategy. 
This will allow us to maintain the high standard of our 
current work, whilst helping us to plan for the future. 
It will also provide the team with measurable goals 
to achieve and track progress.
The focus of the Responsible Sourcing Team is on the 
ﬁrst tier of our supply base where we believe we have 
the greatest inﬂuence and ability to bring about 
change. In 2011/12, 96 per cent of our supply base was 
registered on SEDEX and third-party audit information 
was provided for 88 per cent of factories. In addition 
to this our in-house team visited 80 per cent of our 
direct supply base to offer help and guidance on 
non-compliance resolution. 
The second and third tiers of our supply base 
(e.g. spinning mills, homeworkers, etc) are investigated 
on a project basis or as part of our involvement with 
ETI working groups such as the group to tackle the 
Sumangali scheme in South India, which exists in 
spinning mills over which we as an individual retailer 
have very limited inﬂuence. This approach allows us 
to target our resources effectively and develop best 
practice, which we then work to implement in a wider 
context at a later stage.
28  Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Case Study – Collaborative factory improvement 
projects in India and Bangladesh
Mothercare is participating in the Responsible and 
Accountable Garment Sector (RAGS) Challenge  
Fund, set up by the Department for International 
Development (DfID). We are working with ﬁve other 
retailers on the Beneﬁt for Business and Workers 
(BBW) project, which focuses on improving the 
management systems of ready-made garment 
manufacturers, demonstrating the business beneﬁts 
of providing better jobs and providing the tools and 
know-how to create change. 
The goal of the project is to make responsible 
business and efﬁcient production the norm in the 
Indian and Bangladesh Garment Export 
Manufacturing sectors. The objectives are to 
support factories to:
  Introduce and sustain productivity and quality 
improvements
  Have a more stable and satisﬁed workforce
  Provide better remuneration packages for workers
  Ensure that workers do not work excessive hours
  Ensure that workers are able to communicate 
their views
The project is delivered in two phases: 
  Phase One (November 2010 – February 2012)  
consists of building management skills and 
improving working conditions in 10 pilot factories  
in India and Bangladesh 
  Phase Two consists of training and implementation 
support for 100 factories commencing March 2012
Mothercare has two key factories involved in 
Phase One, both of whom have achieved very 
encouraging results, including signiﬁcant 
improvements in productivity, absenteeism and 
turnover. We are particularly pleased by the shift in 
the factory owners’ way of thinking about their 
business and their workers. Some examples of 
improvements: 
India factory 
  Productivity up by over 20 per cent in the 
Mothercare factory vs. less than 1.5 per cent over 
the whole project group in India
  Absenteeism down by over 50 per cent vs.  
less than 40 per cent for the overall India  
project group 
  Labour turnover down by over 70 per cent vs. 
40 per cent for the overall India project group 
  Average hourly rate of pay up by 8 per cent vs. 
20 per cent drop in the overall India project group 
  Average working hours down by over 6 per cent
Bangladesh factory 
  Efﬁciency up by 7 per cent 
  Absenteeism has reduced by over 75 per cent vs. 
55 per cent in the overall Bangladesh project 
group 
  Basic pay of the lowest paid worker has increased 
by over 9 per cent vs. 2.5 per cent in the overall 
Bangladesh project group
  Average working hours reduced by over 30 per 
cent vs. 17 per cent in the overall Bangladesh 
project group
The feedback from the factories involved has been 
very positive: 
“ This is the ﬁrst time  
I have come across  
an opportunity for 
supervisors to partake 
in a factory development 
project; I feel more 
important and 
recognised.”

Governance Corporate governance 
The Company believes that by seeking to achieve a high standard  
of corporate governance in all of the activities undertaken by the 
group, the group’s reputation and performance will be enhanced.  
In addition, it will also promote and beneﬁt the interests of investors, 
customers, staff and other stakeholders. To this end, and save as 
described below, the Company considers that it has complied 
throughout the 53-week period ended on 31 March 2012 with the 
relevant provisions set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code 
published by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) in 2010 having 
applied the main and supporting principles set out in Sections A to E 
of the Code. 
The board
The leadership of the Mothercare plc business is provided by the 
Mothercare plc board. It operates on a unitary basis and ordinarily 
comprises the non-executive Chairman, four independent  
non-executive directors, and two full-time executive directors, being 
the group Chief Executive and the Finance Director. During  
the past year, Ian Peacock retired as Chairman and Alan Parker  
was appointed as the new Chairman with effect from 15 August 2011. 
Following Ben Gordon’s resignation as Chief Executive, with effect 
from 17 November 2011, Alan Parker took on the role of part-time 
Executive Chairman until 30 April 2012, being the period during which 
the Company was without a Chief Executive. Alan Parker worked 
three days a week for, and did not become Chief Executive of, the 
Company. In his capacity as Executive Chairman, Alan Parker 
initiated the structural and operational review of the business, had 
the executive committee reporting to him directly, and reshaped the 
executive management team. Alan Parker relinquished his position 
as Executive Chairman on the same day that Simon Calver 
commenced as Chief Executive. It is noted that this was a technical 
breach of the UK Corporate Governance Code requirement to 
separate the responsibilities of running the Company and running 
the board, even though Alan Parker did not become Chief Executive.
A key element of the board’s responsibility is monitoring and 
reviewing the effectiveness of the Company’s system of internal 
control and the non-executive directors challenge and scrutinise its 
effectiveness and integrity. The Company has continued to maintain 
a system of internal control within an executive management structure 
with deﬁned lines of responsibility and delegation of authority within 
prescribed ﬁnancial and operational limits. The system of internal 
control is based on ﬁnancial, operational, compliance and risk 
control policies and procedures together with regular reporting of 
ﬁnancial performance and measurement of key performance 
indicators. Risk management, planning, budgeting and forecasting 
procedures are also in place together with formal capital investment 
and appraisal arrangements.
Following his appointment, the Chairman instigated a detailed 
externally facilitated evaluation of the board (using Wickland 
Westcott), and its effectiveness and operation. The review was 
positive but suggested recommendations to improve further the 
overall effectiveness of the board, its composition and its interaction 
with the executive committee, and which are now being 
implemented by the board. 
“ Having been a Chief Executive for 
many years, I recognise and ﬁrmly 
believe in the importance of good 
corporate governance and the  
beneﬁts that it brings – to the 
Company, its shareholders and its 
management. We carried out a 
thorough evaluation of the board 
a few months ago, which I will use 
to establish a clear framework of 
objectives and governance of the 
Company over the next few years.”
 Alan Parker CBE 
 Chairman
32  Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Going concern
The directors have reviewed the going concern 
principle in the light of the guidance provided by the 
FRC. The group’s business activities, and the factors 
likely to affect its future development, are set out in the 
business review. The ﬁnancial position of the group, its 
cash ﬂows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities 
are set out in the ﬁnancial review on pages 18 to 21. 
In addition, notes 21 and 22 to the ﬁnancial statements 
include the group’s objectives, policies and processes 
for managing its capital; its ﬁnancial risk management 
objectives; details of its hedging arrangements and its 
exposure to credit and liquidity risks.
The group’s objective with respect to managing 
capital is to maintain a balance sheet structure that  
is both efﬁcient in terms of providing long term returns 
to shareholders and safeguards the group’s ability  
to continue as a going concern. As appropriate,  
the group can choose to adjust its capital structure  
by varying the amount of dividends paid to 
shareholders, returns of capital to shareholders, 
issuing new shares or the level of capital expenditure. 
A review of the business performance is set out in the 
ﬁnancial review. Trading in the period has been 
impacted by the economic downturn in the UK with 
a reduction in the underlying result of the UK business 
leading to an underlying loss for the period of 
£24.7 million (2011: proﬁt of £11.1 million). The International 
business continues to expand, generating an 
underlying proﬁt for the period of £34.9 million 
(2011: £27.5 million).
As noted in the Chief Executive’s review we have 
performed a structural and operational review 
of the size and scope of our business. In the UK, 
the ‘Transformation and Growth’ plan aims to stabilise 
like-for-like sales and margin, reduce UK central costs, 
close additional stores to focus on a core portfolio 
of circa 200 stores and launch combined online and 
in-store customer options with a new website and; 
in international accelerate expansion (with more 
store openings in both new and existing countries) 
and 30 new overseas websites. The resulting strategy 
will deliver a transformation of the UK business, 
together with increased International growth in the 
next three years.
At the year end the group had committed secured 
bank facilities of £80 million (with an average interest 
rate of 1.4 per cent above LIBOR) which were due to 
expire in May 2014. It also had an uncommitted 
unsecured bank overdraft facility of £10 million. On 
11 April 2012 the group reﬁnanced the banking facilities 
with the support of its two existing banks, HSBC and 
Barclays, increasing the level of committed facilities 
from £80 million to £90 million (at an interest rate range  
of 3.5 per cent to 4.0 per cent above LIBOR) and 
extending the term to 31 May 2015 (see note 21). These 
facilities provide additional liquidity and covenant 
headroom to accommodate the new three-year 
strategy. The covenants in the new facilities are tested 
quarterly and are based around gearing, ﬁxed 
charge cover and guarantor cover. 
The committed bank facility was drawn down by  
a maximum of £40 million during the period and at  
the year end the group had a net debt balance of 
£20.1 million funded by a drawdown against the 
facility of £10 million, £10 million of committed  
overdraft and £1.9 million of uncommitted overdraft, 
net of £1.8 million of cash.
The current challenging economic conditions, 
particularly the difﬁcult consumer and retail 
environment, create uncertainty around the level  
of demand for the group’s products. However, with 
the new strategy in place, the long term contracts  
with its franchisees around the world, long standing 
relationships with many of its suppliers and other 
mitigating actions available, the directors believe that 
the group is well placed to manage its business risks 
successfully despite the uncertain economic outlook.
The group’s latest forecasts and projections, which 
incorporate the execution of the new strategy, have 
been sensitivity-tested for reasonably possible 
adverse variations in trading performance. This 
indicates the group will operate within the terms of its 
borrowing facilities and covenants for the foreseeable 
future. To the extent that future trading is worse than a 
reasonably possible downside, which the directors do 
not consider a likely scenario, then there are mitigating 
Diversity
The importance of improving the diversity 
balance (including gender) on boards of UK 
listed companies is recognised. Currently the 
Mothercare plc board (excluding the executive 
directors) comprises one woman and four men, 
and the senior executive management team 
(including the executive directors) has one woman 
and four men. The Company believes it is well 
positioned to meet the challenge of improving 
gender diversity and expects to have women 
representing 25 per cent of its board by January 
2013, and an increased percentage of women 
on the executive committee by the same time. 
As at 31 March 2012, 53 per cent of the senior 
management positions (the two grades below 
executive committee) were held by women.
Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2012  33 
Governance Corporate governance   
continued
actions available which enable the group to continue 
to operate within the terms of the borrowing facilities 
and covenants for the foreseeable future.
After considering the forecasts, sensitivities and 
mitigating actions available to management, the 
directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and the group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Accordingly, the ﬁnancial statements are 
therefore prepared on the going concern basis.
Risk management
The effective management of risks within the group is 
essential to underpin the delivery of its objectives and 
strategy. The board is responsible for ensuring that 
risks are identiﬁed and appropriately managed 
across the group and has delegated to the audit 
committee responsibility for reviewing the group’s 
internal controls, including the systems established to 
identify, assess, manage and monitor risks. The 
Company has an internal audit function, which reports 
through the group general counsel and company 
secretary to the audit committee. The activities of the 
internal audit function are supplemented by external 
resources as necessary. The external auditors also 
report to the audit committee on the efﬁciency of 
controls as part of the audit.
The principal risks and uncertainties facing the 
Company are set out on pages 24 and 25.
The programme of speciﬁc risk management activity 
of the Company’s UK operations continued during the 
year across the activities of both brands. Under this 
programme, individual stores are tested against a risk 
assessment model that emphasises health and safety, 
ﬁre safety and internal process compliance.
The board believes that the system of internal control 
described can provide only reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material mis-statement  
or loss. During the course of its review of the system  
of internal control, the board has not identiﬁed nor 
been advised of any failings or weaknesses which  
it has determined to be signiﬁcant. Therefore 
a conﬁrmation in respect of necessary actions 
has not been considered appropriate.
Bribery Act 2010
The Bribery Act 2010, which came into force on 1 July 
2011, consolidates previous legislation and introduces 
(amongst other things) a new corporate offence of 
“failure to prevent bribery”. Non-compliance with this 
Act could expose the group to unlimited ﬁnes and 
other consequences. 
Accordingly, the group has introduced additional 
measures into the business to reinforce its zero 
tolerance approach to bribery and corruption.  
The Group Global Code of Conduct (with speciﬁc 
reference to the Bribery Act) was issued to all non-
store level employees both in the UK and overseas. 
The group’s position on bribery and corruption has 
been explained to suppliers and franchisees at 
conferences, and to its joint venture partners.  
The group maintains a global “whistleblower”  
hotline accessible in many languages.
Shareholder relations
The Company maintains regular dialogue with 
institutional shareholders following presentation of the 
ﬁnancial performance of the business to the investing 
communities. Opportunities for dialogue take place 
at least six times a year. Formal meetings are held 
following the announcement of the half and full year 
results, with telephone conversations and ad hoc 
meetings following our four trading statements. 
During such meetings the board is able to put 
forward its objectives for the business and discuss 
performance against those objectives and develop 
an understanding of the views of major shareholders. 
The outcome of meetings with major shareholders is 
reported by the Chief Executive at board meetings 
on a periodic basis.
The Company seeks to reach a wider audience by 
the use of its website (www.mothercareplc.com) and, 
with a view to encouraging full participation of those 
unable to attend the AGM, provides an opportunity 
for shareholders to ask questions of their board 
through the internet at www.mothercareplc.com 
or by email to investorrelations@mothercare.com. 
The Company provides electronic voting facilities 
through www.sharevote.co.uk. Those shareholders 
who wish to use this facility should review the notes 
and procedures set out in the Notice of Meeting.
The board and directors
The board of Mothercare plc meets regularly and 
maintains overall control of the group’s affairs through 
a schedule of matters reserved for its decision. These 
include setting the group strategy, the approval of the 
annual budget and ﬁnancial statements, major 
acquisitions and disposals, authority limits for capital 
and other expenditure and material treasury matters. 
Details of the terms of reference of the board’s 
committees are also set out in the corporate 
governance section of the Company’s website 
at www.mothercareplc.com.
The non-executive directors are independent and free 
from any business or other relationship that could 
interfere with their judgement. Although Bernard 
Cragg was appointed a non-executive director of the 
Company in March 2003, and has now served over 
nine years in that role, he will retire as a non-executive 
director (and senior independent director and chair of 
34  Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2012 the audit committee) in December 2012. The board 
considers that Bernard Cragg remains independent 
until his retirement. The non-executive directors do not 
participate in any bonus, share option or pension 
scheme of the Company. 
The business commitments of each member of the 
board are set out in the biographical details on 
page 30. Notwithstanding such commitments, 
each member of the board is able to allocate 
sufﬁcient time to the Company to discharge his/her 
responsibilities effectively.
The board considers that the balance achieved 
between executive and non-executive directors 
during the period was appropriate and effective 
for the control and direction of the business. 
The board is assisted by committees that it has 
established with written terms of reference. The roles 
of the remuneration, audit and nomination committees 
are set out below. The audit, remuneration and 
nomination committees comprised the four non-
executive directors with the Chairman additionally 
serving on the remuneration and nomination 
committees. A record of the meetings held during the 
year of the board, its committees and the attendance 
by individual directors is set out at page 37.
The board has delegated day-to-day and business 
management control of the group to the executive 
committee. The executive committee ordinarily 
consists of the group Chief Executive, Finance Director, 
the managing directors of the UK and International 
businesses, other operational directors within the 
group, and the group general counsel and 
company secretary.
Throughout the period, the board has been supplied 
with information and papers submitted at each board 
meeting which ensures that the major aspects of the 
group’s affairs are reviewed regularly in accordance 
with a rolling agenda and programme of work. 
All directors, whether executive or non-executive, 
have unrestricted access to the group general counsel 
and company secretary and executives within the 
group on any matter of concern to them in respect 
of their duties. In addition, new directors are given 
appropriate training on appointment to the board. 
Appropriate time is made during the year for 
continuing training on relevant topics concerning the 
functioning of the board and the obligations of 
directors. The Company has undertaken to reimburse 
legal fees to the directors if circumstances should arise 
in which it is necessary for them to seek separate, 
independent, legal advice in furtherance of their duties. 
In accordance with the Articles of Association, one-third 
of the directors are required to offer themselves for 
re-election every year; from 2013, the board has 
resolved that all directors should offer themselves for 
re-election, notwithstanding that it is a requirement of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code for FTSE 350 
companies that the directors do so every year.
The board is of the opinion that the directors seeking 
re-election at the AGM have continued to give 
effective counsel and commitment to the Company 
and accordingly should be re-appointed. During the 
year the senior independent director did not carry out 
an annual performance review of the Chairman, who 
was appointed in August 2011, but will do so next year. 
Directors’ interests and indemnity arrangements
At no time during the year did any director hold a 
material interest in any contract of signiﬁcance with 
the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings 
other than a third-party indemnity provision between 
each director and the Company and service 
contracts between each executive director and the 
Company. The Company has purchased and 
maintained throughout the year directors’ and 
ofﬁcers’ liability insurance in respect of itself and its 
directors. The directors also have the beneﬁt of the 
indemnity provision contained in the Company’s 
Articles of Association. These provisions, which are 
qualifying third-party indemnity provisions as deﬁned 
by Section 236 of the Companies Act 2006, were in 
force throughout the year and are currently in force. 
Details of directors’ remuneration, service contracts 
and interests in the shares of the Company are set out 
in the directors’ remuneration report.
The Company also provides an indemnity for the 
beneﬁt of each person who was a director of 
Mothercare Pension Trustees Limited, which is a 
corporate trustee of the Company’s occupational 
pension schemes, in respect of liabilities that may 
attach to them in their capacity as directors of that 
corporate trustee. These provisions, which are 
qualifying pension scheme indemnity provisions as 
deﬁned in Section 235 of the Companies Act 2006, were 
in force throughout the year and are currently in force.
Directors’ conﬂicts of interest
The board has maintained procedures whereby 
potential conﬂicts of interests are reviewed regularly. 
These procedures have been designed so that the 
board may be reasonably assured that any potential 
situation where a director may have a direct or 
indirect interest which may conﬂict or may possibly 
conﬂict with the interests of the Company are 
identiﬁed and where appropriate dealt with in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and the 
Company’s Articles of Association. The board has 
not had to deal with any conﬂict during the period.

Committees
David Williams 
Chairman, remuneration committee
The remuneration committee, chaired during the 
year by David Williams, comprises the Chairman 
and the non-executive directors. It establishes the 
remuneration policy generally, approves speciﬁc 
arrangements for the Chairman and the executive 
directors and reviews and comments upon the 
proposed arrangements for senior executives so as 
to ensure consistency within the overall remuneration 
policy and group strategy. The terms of reference of 
the committee are set out on the Company’s website. 
Full disclosure of the Company’s remuneration policy 
and details of the remuneration of each director is set 
out in the remuneration report on pages 42 to 49 and 
in Appendix A on pages 50 to 52. During the period no 
director was, and procedures are in place to ensure 
that no director is, involved in deciding or determining 
his or her own remuneration.
Alan Parker 
Chairman, nomination committee
The nomination committee, chaired by Alan Parker 
following his appointment during the year, comprises 
all of the non-executive directors. The terms of 
reference of the committee are set out on the 
Company’s website. The committee makes proposals 
on the size, structure, composition (including diversity) 
and appointments to the board. It carries out the 
selection process and agrees the terms of 
appointment of non-executive directors. Ordinarily 
an external search agency is used to assist in the 
identiﬁcation of suitable candidates for board 
appointments. The nomination committee also 
reviews succession planning on an annual basis. 
The Company’s position on diversity balance is set 
out earlier in this report. 
Bernard Cragg 
Chairman, audit committee
The audit committee was chaired during the year  
by Bernard Cragg, the senior non-executive director. 
The remit of the audit committee is to review the 
scope and issues arising from the audit and matters 
relating to ﬁnancial control. It also assists the board in 
its review of corporate governance and in the 
presentation of the Company’s ﬁnancial results 
through its review of the interim and full year accounts 
before approval by the board, focusing in particular 
on compliance with accounting principles, changes in 
accounting practice and major areas of judgement. 
The full terms of reference are set out under the 
corporate governance section of the website at  
www.mothercareplc.com. 
The audit committee comprises the four non-executive 
directors. The group general counsel and company 
secretary acts as secretary to the committee. Bernard 
Cragg is a chartered accountant with considerable 
ﬁnancial and varied commercial experience.
The committee met four times during the period. 
No speciﬁc remuneration of the non-executive 
directors is ascribed to membership of the audit 
committee other than a supplement of £5,000 paid 
to Bernard Cragg in respect of his chairmanship of 
the committee. 
The main activities of the audit committee in the  
53 weeks ended 31 March 2012
During the period the audit committee has:
  reviewed the ﬁnancial statements both in the interim 
report and full year report and accounts, having in 
both cases received a report from the external 
auditors on their review and audit of the respective 
reports and accounts;
  assisted the board in its detailed review of the going 
concern principle underpinning the results of the 
group for the period in the light of the Financial 
Reporting Council’s additional guidance on going 
concern and liquidity risk; 
  considered the output of the procedures used to 
evaluate and mitigate risk within the group;
  reviewed the effectiveness of the group’s internal 
controls and disclosures made in the annual report;
  considered the management letter from the external 
auditors on their review of the effectiveness of 
internal control;
  agreed the fees and terms of appointment of the 
external auditors;
  reviewed both the committee’s and the external 
auditor’s effectiveness;
  agreed the work plan of the internal audit function 
and reviewed the resultant output from that plan; 
and
  reviewed and assessed the group’s compliance with 
corporate governance principles.
The audit committee reviews annually the 
independence of the external audit ﬁrm and the 
individuals carrying out the audit by receiving 
36  Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2012 assurances from, and assessing, the audit ﬁrm against 
best practice principles. The committee seeks to 
balance the beneﬁts of continuity of audit personnel 
and the need to assure independence through 
change of audit personnel by agreeing with the audit 
ﬁrm staff rotation policies. There are no contractual 
obligations restricting the committee’s choice of 
external auditors.
In any event, the external auditors are required to 
rotate the audit partner responsible for the audit 
every ﬁve years. The current lead audit partner has 
been in place for ﬁve years, and is being replaced 
once the accounts for the year have been ﬁnalised 
and approved. 
In addition, a policy in respect of non-audit work by 
the audit ﬁrm is in effect. The general principle is that 
the audit ﬁrm should not be requested to carry out 
non-audit services on any activity of the Company 
where they may, in the future, be required to give an 
audit opinion, and the nature of any non-audit work 
must be approved by the committee. The committee 
has assisted the board in the assessment of the 
adequacy of the resourcing plan for the internal 
audit function. In respect of the activities of the 
function, the committee has received reports upon 
the work carried out and the results of the 
investigations including management responses, 
their adequacy and timeliness.
A review was also held of the effectiveness of the 
audit committee and the external auditors during  
the year. It was considered that the work of the audit 
committee during the year was effective measured 
against its terms of reference and general audit 
committee practice. In respect of the auditor 
effectiveness review, it was considered that the 
external auditors had carried out their obligations  
in an effective and appropriate manner.
As a result of its work during the year, the committee 
has concluded that it has acted in accordance  
with its terms of reference and has ensured the 
independence of the external auditors (by enquiry  
of them, and reviewing the report issued by the 
auditors regarding their independence, and the  
non-audit services provided by the auditors and  
the safeguards relating thereto). The Company did 
not pay any non-audit fees to the auditors on a 
contingent basis (non-audit fees incurred in the year 
are set out in note 7). The Chairman of the committee 
will be available at the AGM to answer any questions 
on the work of the committee.

Governance  
The directors present their report on the affairs of  
the group, together with the ﬁnancial statements  
and auditors’ report for the 53-week period ended  
31 March 2012. The corporate governance statement 
set out on pages 32 to 37 forms part of this report. 
The Chairman’s statement on pages 8 and 9 gives 
further information on the work of the board during 
the period. The principal activity of the group is as 
a specialist multi-channel retailer, franchisor and 
wholesaler of products for mothers-to-be, babies 
and children under the Mothercare and Early 
Learning Centre brands. 
Business review
The principal companies within the Mothercare group 
for the period under review were Mothercare plc (the 
‘Company’); Mothercare UK Limited and Chelsea 
Stores Holdings Ltd (which own the Mothercare and 
Early Learning Centre brands respectively). The 
Companies Act 2006 requires the directors’ report to 
contain a review of the business and a description of 
the principal risks and uncertainties facing the group. 
A review of the business strategy and a commentary 
on the performance of the group is set out in the 
performance highlights, our group overview, 
Chairman’s statement, Chief Executive’s statement, 
the business review and ﬁnancial review. The principal 
risks facing the business are detailed in the corporate 
governance report. These disclosures form part of this 
report. The directors’ report is prepared for the 
members of the Company and should not be relied 
upon by any other party or for any other purpose. 
Where the directors’ report (including the 
performance highlights, our group overview, business 
review, ﬁnancial review, KPIs, corporate responsibility 
report, directors’ remuneration report and corporate 
governance report) contain forward-looking 
statements these are made by the directors in good 
faith based on the information available to them at 
the time of their approval of this report. These 
statements will not be updated or reported upon 
further during the year unless the Company is under  
a legal obligation to do so. Consequently, such 
statements should be treated with caution due to the 
inherent uncertainties, including both economic and 
business risk factors, underlying such forward-looking 
statements or information.
The group’s use of ﬁnancial instruments, the risk 
management objectives and exposures are set 
out in the notes to the ﬁnancial statements and 
the corporate governance report on page 32.
Going concern
The accounts have been prepared under the going 
concern principle. For full details please see the 
corporate governance report on page 33.
Dividend
The directors are not recommending the payment of 
a ﬁnal dividend. An interim dividend of 2p per share 
was paid in February 2012 (2011: 6.4p per share) 
making a total of 2p per share (2011: total of 18.3p 
per share) for the year.
The Trustees of the Mothercare Employee Trust, who 
held 440,394 shares, and Mothercare Employees’  
Share Trustee Limited which held 3,151 shares, waived 
their entitlement to receive dividends in respect of 
these shares.
Shares
As at 23 May 2012, the Company’s issued share capital 
was 88,637,086 ordinary shares of 50p each all 
carrying voting rights. Details of the change in the 
Company’s issued share capital during the year is

Acquisition of own shares
The Company was given a general approval at the 
AGM in July 2011 to purchase up to 10 per cent of its 
shares in the market. This authority expires after the 
AGM on 19 July 2012. The authority has not been used 
during the year.
Signiﬁcant agreements and change of control
The group has entered into one signiﬁcant agreement 
in the past year. This is a multi currency term and 
revolving facilities agreement dated 11 April 2012 in 
respect of a £90,000,000 credit facility with Barclays 
Bank plc and HSBC Bank plc for general business 
purposes. This supersedes the multi currency revolving 
facilities agreement entered into by the group with 
Barclays Bank plc and HSBC Bank plc on 16 May 2011.
There are a number of agreements that alter or 
terminate upon a change of control such as 
commercial contracts, bank loan agreements and 
employee share plans. The only one of these which 
is considered to be signiﬁcant in terms of likely impact 
on the business of the group as a whole is the multi 
currency term and revolving facilities agreement 
referred to above under which a change of control 
of the Company would entitle the banks to cancel the 
facility and require the repayment of all outstanding 
amounts on a minimum of 30 days’ notice 
Other than early vesting under the group’s long term 
incentive plans, the directors are not aware of any 
agreements between the Company and its directors 
or employees that provide for compensation for loss 
of ofﬁce or employment that would occur because of 
a takeover bid whether successful or not. There are no 
special contractual payments associated with a 
change of control of the Company.
Directors
With regard to the appointment and replacement of 
directors, the Company is governed by its Articles of 
Association, the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
the Companies Act and related legislation. The 
Articles may be amended by special resolution of 
the shareholders. The business of the Company is 
managed by the board who may exercise all the 
powers of the Company subject to the provision of 
the Articles of Association, the Companies Act and 
any ordinary resolution of the Company.

continued
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of 
Association, David Williams and Bernard Cragg retire 
by rotation from the board following the conclusion of 
the AGM on 19 July 2012 and stand for re-election.  
Alan Parker and Simon Calver are standing for 
election having been appointed since the last AGM. 
Biographical details of all of the directors, indicating 
their experience and qualiﬁcations, are set out on 
page 30. In light of the number of changes to the 
board over the past year, the required election of Alan 
Parker and Simon Calver at the AGM, the forthcoming 
retirement as a director of Bernard Cragg after more 
than nine years as a director, and the announced 
resignation of Neil Harrington, it has been decided  
to defer the retirement and re-election of all directors 
until the annual general meeting of the Company in 
2013 notwithstanding that it is a requirement of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code for FTSE 350 companies 
that the directors do so every year.
Details of directors’ service arrangements are set 
out in the remuneration report on page 47.
A statement of directors’ interests in the shares of 
Mothercare plc and of their remuneration is set out 
on pages 49 and 50 respectively. A statement 
of directors’ interests in contracts and indemnity 
arrangements is set out on page 35.
Employees
The Company involves all of its employees in the 
delivery of its strategy. It regularly discusses with all  
its employees its corporate objectives and business 
performance, as well as the economic environments 
in which the Company trades through its business 
sectors. This is achieved through the Company 
magazine ‘Small Talk’ (to be replaced by an 
employee communications website), regular 
brieﬁngs, bulletins, e-mail and video presentations.
The Company aspires to develop a loyal and high 
performing team through the development of its 
culture and values. As part of this development 
process it measures the capabilities of the group’s 
employees, ascertains their development needs  
and develops and implements programmes 
designed to ensure that the critical skills required  
for the development of both the individual and the 
group are attained. 
The group’s remuneration strategy is set out in the 
remuneration report which includes details of the 
various incentive schemes and share plans operated 
by the group.
The group is an equal opportunities employer and 
ensures that recruitment and promotion decisions in 
all of its companies are made solely on the basis of 
suitability for the job. Disabled people are given due 
consideration for employment opportunities and,  
if employees become disabled, every effort is made 
to retain them by providing relevant support.
During the year, it became necessary to carry out  
a consultation process affecting certain roles at the 
Company’s head ofﬁce in Watford and to make 
redundancies in some of its overseas ofﬁces. The 
Company recognises the impact of such processes  
on its employees and this process was carried out 
thoroughly and professionally, and in compliance  
with relevant laws and regulations.
Pensions
The group operates pension schemes for those of its 
employees who wish to participate. Details of the 
pension charge is set out in note 29. The board is 
mindful that further changes to elements of its pension 
provision will be inevitable given the proposed tax 
and auto-enrolment requirements introduced over the 
past year. The Company has commenced a series of 
reviews to seek a practical solution to these changes.
Payment of suppliers
Payments to merchandise suppliers are made in 
accordance with general conditions of purchase, 
which are communicated to suppliers at the 
beginning of the trading relationship. It is the group’s 
policy to make payments to non-merchandise 
suppliers, unless otherwise agreed, within the period 
set out in the supplier’s invoice or within 60 days from 
the date of invoice.
The amount owed to trade creditors at the end of the 
ﬁnancial year represented nil days (2011: nil days) of 
average daily purchases during the year for the 
Company and 53 days (2011: 62 days) for the group.
Fixed assets
Changes in tangible ﬁxed assets are shown in note 16 
to the accounts. A valuation of the group’s freehold 
and long leasehold properties, excluding rack rented 
properties, was carried out by external valuers, as at 
December 2009. The basis of the valuation is Existing 
Use Value in respect of properties primarily occupied 
by the group and on the basis of Market Value in 
respect of investment properties, both bases being in 
accordance with the Practice Statements contained in 
the RICS Appraisal and Valuation Manual. A further 
internal valuation of the freehold properties was 
carried out as at April 2012 on the same basis. This 
adjusted valuation of the freehold properties resulted 
in a surplus over their net book value of £2,201,773.

The group’s corporate social responsibility ethos and 
details of the programmes that it runs in its business 
relationships around the world are set out on pages 
26 to 29. During the year, the group re-issued its Global 
Code of Conduct to all its ofﬁce employees, both in 
the UK and overseas.
Auditors
In the case of each of the persons who were directors 
of the Company at the date when this report was 
approved:
   so far as each of the directors is aware, there is no 
relevant audit information (as deﬁned in the 
Companies Act 2006) of which the Company’s 
auditors are unaware; and
  each of the directors has taken all the steps that he/
she ought to have taken as a director to make 
himself/herself aware of any relevant audit 
information (as deﬁned) and to establish that the 
Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
This conﬁrmation is given and should be interpreted in 
accordance with the provisions of Section 418 (2) of the 
Companies Act 2006.
A resolution proposing the re-election of Deloitte LLP 
as auditors to the Company will be put to the AGM.
Charitable and political donations
The Company made no donations during the year to 
the Mothercare Group Foundation. Total cash 
charitable donations for the year ended 31 March 2012 
were £32,324 (2011: £282,161).
It is the Company’s policy not to make political 
donations.

Governance  
David Williams 
Chairman, remuneration committee
Remuneration committee chairman’s statement
During the last 12 months, we have seen a signiﬁcant 
reduction in the group’s proﬁtability, primarily as a 
result of the deterioration in the trading results of the 
UK business, and consequent impact on the share 
price. Over the same period, we have initiated 
important leadership changes, including the 
appointment of a new Chairman and Chief Executive, 
and further changes to the management team are 
planned. All of this has been against the background 
of the development of the ‘Transformation and 
Growth’ plan essential to the future of Mothercare as 
outlined elsewhere in this annual report. 
We are operating in a rapidly changing environment 
for executive pay in the UK, which is now a high proﬁle 
and sensitive matter. Reﬂecting the Company’s 
performance, during the year there were no increases 
in the salary levels of executive directors, which remain 
at 2008/09 levels. Further, no annual bonus payments 
were paid, and awards made under the Performance 
Share Plan (PSP) and Executive Incentive Plan (EIP) 
relating to the performance over the three-year 
period ending 31 March 2012 did not vest. However, 
awards made under the Executive Incentive Plan (EIP) 
for the three-year period to 26 March 2011 did vest 
reﬂecting the group’s relative performance as against 
other general retailers over that period (details are set 
out in the remuneration report).
Given the Company’s current position, it is now an 
opportune time to break with the past and to put in 
place a remuneration strategy and arrangements 
which are better aligned with the current debate 
on remuneration and, most importantly, reﬂect 
Mothercare’s plans for ‘Transformation and Growth’ 
in the future. The PSP and EIP plans which operated 
in the past, and delivered signiﬁcant reward to 
executives and shareholders (as Mothercare 
increased in value in both absolute terms and relative 
to other retailers) are no longer appropriate, not least 
because they cannot be supported by the Company’s 
current ﬁnancial position and future business strategy. 
The committee is determined that, as well as adopting 
aspects of best practice (such as deferral of bonuses), 
remuneration should also provide a strong link 
between reward and sustainable performance for 
shareholders. Set against this, Mothercare is in a 
challenging situation and undergoing signiﬁcant 
management change. Remuneration must be 
sufﬁciently attractive to allow us to recruit, retain and 
motivate a new senior management team with the 
skills and capability to navigate our current situation 
and deliver the ‘Transformation and Growth’ plan so 
we can meet our future aspirations. 
In January 2012 the remuneration committee 
appointed new consultants to help review the 
Company’s executive remuneration arrangements. 
Our intention was to bring forward a framework for 
approval at the annual general meeting. However, 
it has become clear that more time is required to 
enable a full and effective consultation with our 
shareholders on the new arrangements. This will allow 
our proposals to be properly set within the context of 
the ‘Transformation and Growth’ plan we have just 
announced, and will also give us time to reﬂect 
investor views properly in our proposals. 
The committee expects to consult further on future 
long term incentive proposals over the summer once 
the new strategy has been fully articulated and 
digested by investors. In the meantime, the committee 
will operate a short term incentive plan with ﬁnancial 
and non-ﬁnancial performance measures linked to 
the business plan. This is important to enable Simon 
Calver, our new Chief Executive, to reinforce the 
focus of his management team to deliver the 
business turnaround.
These are clearly challenging times for executive pay 
in general, and Mothercare in particular. Your board  
is putting the building blocks in place for sustained 
‘Transformation and Growth’, with new senior 
leadership at the Company being a critical 
component. We look forward to receiving your 
support for the remuneration report at the annual 
general meeting.

Chairman, remuneration committee
Remuneration report
42  Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Introduction and remuneration policy statement
Our remuneration policy is to provide competitive 
remuneration packages that will help recruit, retain 
and motivate executives of the required calibre to 
meet the group’s strategic objectives. We aim to 
ensure that the policy is appropriate to the group’s 
needs and rewards executives for achieving relevant 
performance criteria. The committee monitors 
the group’s compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code provisions and institutional 
investor guidelines for directors’ remuneration.
During the year, the committee has re-considered the 
group’s remuneration policy, and its short term and 
long term incentive plans to ensure that it has a 
structure in place which supports its three-year 
business plan. During this review, the committee 
considered the appropriateness of the existing policy 
and incentive plans from a strategic and business 
perspective and also took into account views 
expressed by shareholders, current market practice, 
regulatory changes and corporate governance 
requirements. The outcome of the review was that the 
existing incentive plans are no longer considered to 
be appropriate and that revised arrangements were 
necessary. As a consequence, the Company is actively 
consulting with shareholders, and will be proposing 
a new long term incentive plan for approval by 
shareholders in due course and will also be making 
some amendments to its short term incentive plan with 
effect from the 2012/13 ﬁnancial year.
The revised policy will support and be aligned with 
the company’s ‘Transformation and Growth’ plan 
(detailed in the Chief Executive’s statement) both 
from a structural and strategic perspective. It will also 
take into account best practice and will provide the 
Company with the ability to retain, motivate and 
attract key executives to support the Company 
through its next stage in development. 
The key design principles of the revised incentive 
arrangements will be as follows:
  Executive directors and senior employees will be 
given the opportunity to earn highly competitive 
levels of reward for exceptional delivery of the 
‘Transformation and Growth’ plan over the medium 
to long term, subject to the proviso that excessive 
or undeserved remuneration should not be paid
  The Company must have the ability to retain and 
attract talent of an appropriate calibre to execute 
the business strategy in a highly challenging 
environment, and reﬂecting the future aspirations 
of the Company
  The performance metrics should be closely aligned 
to the Company’s strategic objectives and the 
targets chosen will represent an accurate measure 
of performance against the success of meeting  
the objectives
  The structures will reﬂect best practice guidelines, 
wherever possible, and will be developed in full 
consultation with investors
Accordingly, this report will address both the policy 
and plans that have been in place during the year, 
and details of the revised policy and amended short 
term incentive plan.
The remuneration report
This report to shareholders has been prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006 (the Act), 
and the relevant regulations relating to directors’ 
remuneration, the requirements of the Listing Rules  
of the UK Listing Authority and the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. At the Annual General Meeting  
on 19 July 2012 shareholders will be asked to approve 
this report, as well as the share matching awards for 
the Chairman.
The relevant section of the Act and regulations require 
the auditors to report on certain elements of this 
report and to state whether in their opinion these 
elements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Act. The audited sections include 
directors’ share options, the PSP and EIP awards 
(including that set out in Appendix A on page 50), 
emoluments and compensation payments as set 
out in Table 1A and pension arrangements set out 
in Table 2 of Appendix A.
The remuneration committee
Composition of the remuneration committee 
The remuneration committee comprises the 
independent non-executive directors and the 
Chairman of the Mothercare plc board (who, in the 
view of the directors, was deemed to be independent 
upon appointment). David Williams is Chairman of the 
committee with Bernard Cragg, Amanda Mackenzie 
and Richard Rivers serving throughout the year. 
Ian Peacock served until his retirement in October 2011 
and Alan Parker has served since his appointment 
in August 2011.
The committee’s principal duty is the determination of 
the remuneration for the executive directors, approval 
of the pay and beneﬁts of the members of the 
executive committee and oversight of remuneration 
policy for management below executive director and 
executive committee members to ensure that such 
remuneration is consistent with delivery of the business 
strategy and value creation for shareholders.

each member’s attendance at these meetings is  
set out on page 37 of the corporate governance 
report. The committee’s detailed terms of reference 
are available on the Mothercare website at  
www.mothercareplc.com.
Advisers to the remuneration committee
The committee retained certain external organisations 
to assist them in their work during the year. The 
committee has also consulted the Chief Executive, 
human resources director and group general counsel 
and company secretary as appropriate. No executive 
was present for discussions of their own remuneration.
As at 31 March 2012, the committee’s advisers were:

44  Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Directors’ remuneration
Current
The executive directors’ ﬁxed annual remuneration 
comprises a base salary (which is normally reviewed 
in April each year) and beneﬁts; they also receive 
variable remuneration through an annual bonus 
scheme, and the group’s long term incentive plans 
(EIP and PSP). The group made no awards to the 
executive directors under any other long term 
incentive scheme during the year, although they are 
entitled to participate in the Save As You Earn share 
option scheme, which is open to all employees (but 
excluding non-executive directors). 
The remuneration of the non-executive directors 
comprises ﬁxed annual fees. Expenses incurred on 
group business are reimbursed when claimed. Non-
executive director fees are reviewed periodically and 
set at levels to reﬂect the time commitment and 
responsibilities of the non-executive directors. The fees 
of the non-executive directors are determined by the 
Chairman and executive directors on behalf of the 
board. The non-executive directors do not participate 
in the group pension, annual bonus plan or any long 
term incentive scheme. The Chairman’s remuneration 
is determined by the remuneration committee without 
the Chairman present. As an inducement for Alan 
Parker to become Chairman, the Company agreed 
to implement a share matching scheme under which 
it would match the shares purchased by him, up to a 
maximum value and subject to certain performance 
criteria being met. Details of this scheme, which is 
subject to shareholder approval, are set out later 
in this report.
Future
The executive directors’ ﬁxed annual remuneration 
will still comprise a base salary, which is normally 
reviewed in April each year, and beneﬁts. The variable 
elements of remuneration will be delivered through  
a short term incentive plan and a long term incentive 
plan. All elements of the variable remuneration will  
be assessed against both ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial 
performance criteria. Further details are set out below.
Ordinarily, the Company would report on the balance 
between the ﬁxed and performance based 
compensation awarded to its executive directors. 
However, one of the executive directors (Neil 
Harrington) has submitted his resignation and will  
not receive variable compensation in this ﬁnancial 
year; and the payment of variable compensation  
to the other executive director is subject to the 
ﬁnalisation of a new long term incentive plan in 
consultation with shareholders.
Salary
Each executive director’s salary is considered 
individually by the remuneration committee, taking 
account of individual performance and potential; 
pay positioning relative to comparable roles, 
particularly at other retailers and also companies 
of similar size in other sectors; pay elsewhere in the 
Company, and advice from the independent 
remuneration consultants. Base salary is the only 
element of remuneration used in determining 
pensionable earnings under the Mothercare 
executive pension scheme. With the exception of 
increases in salary to reﬂect increased responsibilities, 
the group maintained 2011/12 salary levels at 2008/09 
levels. Consequently, the salaries for Ben Gordon 
(prior to his departure) and Neil Harrington remained 
at £600,000 and £265,400 per annum respectively. 
Simon Calver has been appointed as Chief Executive 
with effect from 30 April 2012. His salary is £500,000 
per annum. This represents a material reduction 
to the level of the previous incumbent to reﬂect the 
Company’s ﬁnancial position. In setting Simon Calver’s 
salary the remuneration committee took a range of 
factors into account, most importantly the level of 
salary deemed necessary to attract an individual of 
a calibre with the necessary skills required to develop 
and lead the ‘Transformation and Growth’ plan in 
order for the business to meet its future aspirations. 
The Committee also took into consideration 
competitive levels of salary in the retail sector, 
taking into account Mothercare’s current market 
capitalisation. No change to Neil Harrington’s salary 
is proposed for the year 2012/13.
Short term incentive plan (STIP)
Current: Annual bonus
The annual cash bonus scheme for executive directors 
is based on the achievement of group ﬁnancial 
targets and the delivery of stretching personal targets 
tied to key business objectives. Financial and personal 
targets are set annually by the remuneration 
committee. For the year 2011/12 the committee decided 
that the annual bonus PBT measure should include 
measures of operating cash ﬂow, working capital 
and other key performance indicators. Consequently, 
it was decided that 75 per cent of the bonus 
opportunity would be linked to group PBT and the 
remaining 25 per cent to these other performance 
measures. The individual performance multipliers 
would apply to both elements. Any bonus awarded 
would be paid entirely in cash. As the targets were not 
met, no bonus was paid for the year.
Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2012  45 
Governance Ben Gordon resigned during the year and did not 
receive a bonus, although the maximum bonus 
opportunity at the start of the year was 135 per cent 
of salary; Neil Harrington’s bonus opportunity is a 
maximum of 115 per cent of salary; he received no 
performance related bonus for the year ended 
31 March 2012 (2011: £nil). 
Future: STIP
With effect from 2012/13, a number of amendments will 
be made to the STIP. The key amendments and 
rationale are as follows:
  The maximum bonus potential for the Chief Executive 
will be reduced to 125 per cent of salary and for the 
Finance Director will be 100 per cent of salary
  The performance metrics will be aligned to the 
Company’s ‘Transformation and Growth’ plan and 
its key focus areas over the next 12 months. Both 
ﬁnancial and strategic measures – based on a 
balanced scorecard approach – will be used with 
a weighting of 75 per cent ﬁnancial and 25 per cent 
strategic measures. Strategic measures will include 
customer satisfaction surveys
  Payment under the STIP will be subject to an 
overriding ﬁnancial measure based on the 
Company’s net quarterly cash/debt position which 
will ensure that STIP payments are not made where 
the ﬁnancial position of the Company does not 
support it and when they are unjustiﬁed
  For the executive directors and other members of 
the executive committee, 30 per cent of any STIP 
payment earned will be deferred into shares in the 
Company for a three-year period. By paying a 
signiﬁcant portion of any STIP in shares, executives’ 
focus on long term value creation and the degree 
of alignment with shareholders will be increased
  During the deferral period, in line with best practice, 
the shares are subject to claw back in exceptional 
circumstances, such as ﬁnancial misstatement
 Proﬁt share scheme
In addition to the annual bonus scheme, the group 
has operated a proﬁt share scheme. All group 
employees (other than participants in the annual 
bonus scheme or the new proposed STIP) with at  
least six months’ service are eligible to participate 
in this scheme.
Long term incentive plan
Current: 
(a) The Performance Share Plan (PSP)
The group’s performance share plan was approved 
by shareholders in 2006. Under the PSP, conditional 
awards of shares of up to 100 per cent of salary 
(in exceptional circumstances, 200 per cent of salary) 
are made to selected executives, as determined by 
the remuneration committee each year. Conditional 
awards were made to the wider executive team 
through awards made in May and November. Details 
of executive directors’ historical awards are set out in 
Appendix A on page 50.
Vesting of shares to an individual is conditional upon 
the achievement of the cumulative three-year growth 
in group PBT. 20 per cent of an award vests if 
Mothercare’s three-year PBT growth is 5 per cent p.a. 
and 100 per cent of an award will vest if Mothercare’s 
three-year PBT per share growth is at least 15 per cent 
each year, with straight-line vesting in between. 
Dividends accrue and are paid on shares that vest. 
If the performance threshold of 5 per cent p.a. PBT per 
share growth is not met the award lapses. PBT per 
share was chosen as the remuneration committee 
believed that PBT was a good measure of 
Mothercare’s ﬁnancial performance; it is highly visible 
internally, and is regularly monitored and reported. 
For the three-year performance period to 26 March 
2011, Mothercare’s proﬁt before tax decreased. 
Accordingly, the awards granted in 2008 did not vest. 
This was also the case for awards granted in 2009 
which did not vest by reference to the three-year 
performance ended 31 March 2012.
In September 2008, the remuneration committee and 
the board approved an extension of the PSP to key 
executives in the overseas markets in which it 
operates, principally China, Hong Kong and India. 
The nature of the securities laws in certain countries 
makes it impractical for individuals to receive shares 
in the Company upon vesting of conditional awards 
as envisaged by the PSP scheme. Consequently the 
scheme approved for overseas participants grants 
conditional awards over ‘notional shares’ in the 
Company. These notional shares are hedged within 
the employee trust such that individual participants 
may receive a cash award equivalent to the growth in 
value of the notional shares under the award. In all 
other respects (including maximum award limits, 
performance conditions etc) the overseas scheme is 
equivalent to that operated for UK-based executives.
(b) The Executive Incentive Plan (EIP) 
The group’s executive incentive plan was approved 
by shareholders in 2006. Under the EIP, selected senior 
executives are eligible to receive a percentage of 
‘surplus value created’ over a three-year performance 
period. ‘Surplus value created’ is deﬁned as group 
TSR outperformance of the FTSE All-Share General 
Retailers Index (Index) multiplied by the average 
market capitalisation of the group over the 
Remuneration report 
continued
46  Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2012 three-month period immediately prior to the start of 
the ﬁnancial year in which the grant date falls. The 
committee believed this relative TSR performance 
condition provided alignment with shareholders’ long 
term interests, as well as supporting the motivation 
and retention of the management team. However, as 
noted elsewhere in this report, the committee has  
re-considered the suitability of the EIP scheme and will 
be proposing its replacement in due course.
At the vesting date, the committee retains discretion to 
defer up to 50 per cent of an award into shares for a 
further year. Following a minor reﬁnement approved 
by the committee to the EIP in 2009, in order to provide 
additional alignment with shareholders’ interests, 
awards from 2009 onwards will be settled wholly in 
shares (rather than up to 50 per cent as provided in 
the original scheme). The EIP was also amended to 
allow an executive to extend the period of deferral  
by awarding the deferred element as nil-cost options. 
EIP awards have been made in each year since 
inception in 2006. The award criteria made to 
executive directors is set out in EIP Table 1 in 
Appendix A (page 50). 
During the three-year performance period to  
26 March 2011, Mothercare’s total shareholder return 
outperformed the FTSE General Retailers Index by 
38.29 per cent (Mothercare +48.78 per cent, General 
Retailers +10.49 per cent). 
With regard to the EIP award that vested in March 
2011, the remuneration committee decided to exercise 
its discretion to defer the maximum 50 per cent of the 
vested amount into shares. These share awards will 
not be released until June 2012 and therefore the value 
of the deferred shares to which the executive directors 
will be entitled will not be known until that date. Details 
are set out in Appendix A on page 50. 
No EIP Awards vested in relation to the performance 
ended 27 March 2012. 
Future:
Long term incentive plan
As explained earlier in this report, the committee has 
reconsidered the applicability of the existing PSP and 
EIP, in light of the group’s performance in the past two 
years and the longer term business objectives and 
performance targets set out by the Chief Executive in 
this report. 
The outcome of the review was that the PSP and EIP 
are no longer considered to be appropriate and that 
revised arrangements were necessary in order to 
support the company in delivering its three-year 
business plan and to have regard to changing 
market  practices. The Company is currently working 
with its key shareholders to devise an appropriate 
long term incentive plan which will be implemented 
in due course. 
The Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS)
The Mothercare plc 2000 Share Option Plan
Under the rules of the Mothercare 2000 Share Option 
Plan no further options can be granted. 
Shareholding guidelines
Executive directors are expected to build up a 
shareholding equal to 100 per cent of their basic 
salaries after three years in position. Under the 
proposed terms of the short term incentive plan 
outlined above, 30 per cent of any payments would 
be deferred in shares for a three-year period and 
would count towards this shareholding obligation 
at their net of tax value.
Details of the shares held by the directors as at  
31 March 2012 are provided below. 
Service contracts
Executive directors
Executive directors’ service contracts are rolling 
contracts that require 12 months’ notice by either 
the Company or executive to terminate the 
contract. Mitigation provisions are included in 
any severance agreement.
Ben Gordon, the former Chief Executive, resigned 
from the Company on 17 November 2011 having 
commenced with the group on 2 December 2002.  
His service agreement provided for liquidated 
damages on termination by the group for basic salary 
equivalent to the unexpired portion of the notice 
period and the fair value of the beneﬁts to which he 
may be entitled, including pension credits but not 
bonus or long term incentives. Accordingly, Ben 
Gordon received a payment equal to his basic salary 
in lieu of notice for the period from 17 November 2011 
to 9 October 2012. Ben Gordon also received his 
contractual entitlement to the beneﬁts of any share 
awards under the performance share plan and 
executive incentive plan which had vested before  
11 October 2011, and these are set out in Appendix A 
on page 50.
Non-executive directors
Alan Parker is entitled to six months’ salary on 
termination of his service agreement dated 2 August 
2011 by the group. Bernard Cragg, Richard Rivers, 
David Williams and Amanda Mackenzie have service 
agreements with the group that may be terminated 
upon one month’s notice; their service agreements 
were entered into on 26 March 2003, 27 May 2008, 
2 July 2004 and 1 January 2011 respectively.
Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2012  47 
Governance As at 31 March 2012, the annual salary/fees payable 
to the Chairman (in his non-executive capacity) were 
£200,000, the senior non-executive director £60,000, 
the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee £55,000 
and the other non-executive directors £50,000.
As an inducement for Alan Parker to become 
Chairman and related to his service agreement, the 
Company agreed to implement a share matching 
scheme under which it would grant 60,000 
performance related share options if Alan Parker 
purchased and held shares in the Company in the 
vesting period to the value of £200,000. The Chairman 
purchased these shares and the Company granted 
60,000 options with a nominal exercise price which 
vest in August 2014 subject to certain performance 
criteria being met. For the grant to vest in full, the 
Company total shareholder return over the three-year 
performance period must be greater than or equal to 
the total shareholder return of the FTSE 250 (excluding 
certain mining and investment companies) plus 50 per 
cent, if the Company’s performance is below TSR 
index, the award will not vest. The Chairman must 
retain his shareholding for the performance period.
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code and the Listing Rules, the implementation of the 
share matching plans for Alan Parker are subject to 
shareholder approval and have been proposed as 
resolution 10 on the notice of meeting.
Executive Chairman
Following the resignation of Ben Gordon with effect 
from 17 November 2011, Alan Parker became Executive 
Chairman, and agreed to spend three days per week 
in this role until a new Chief Executive was appointed. 
Alan Parker did not act as a Chief Executive of the 
Company. Following Simon Calver’s appointment with 
effect from 30 April 2012, Alan Parker stood down as 
Executive Chairman on the same date. For the six 
months’ duration of his role as Executive Chairman, 
and to reﬂect the material increase in the time spent 
on behalf of the group, Alan Parker received an extra 
fee of approximately £200,000. The Company also 
agreed to an extension of the share matching 
arrangement awarded to Alan Parker on his 
appointment as Chairman. The Company agreed to 
match additional investment in the Company by Alan 
Parker on a 0.35:1 (Company/Alan Parker) basis (up to 
a maximum further investment of £400,000). The 
vesting of this additional match is subject to the same 
performance criteria as the initial share matching 
scheme and the award will not vest if the 
performance criteria are not satisﬁed. As described 
above, the implementation of this plan is subject to 
shareholders’ approval.
External appointments and other commitments of  
the directors
The other business commitments of the directors are 
set out within their biographical details on page 30. 
An executive director may take one external 
appointment as a non-executive director, subject to the 
approval of the board. The director may retain any fees 
from such a role. Neil Harrington is a non-executive 
director of McBride plc, from which he currently receives 
an annual fee of £40,000.
Pension arrangements 
Neil Harrington is a member of the Mothercare 
Executive Pension Scheme. Neil Harrington participates 
in the pension builder career average section of the 
Mothercare Executive Pension Scheme. Pension accrues 
at one forty-ﬁfth of pensionable salary (subject to a 
notional earnings cap of £185,400). The normal 
retirement age is 65 years. Contributions by Neil 
Harrington are set at 8 per cent of pensionable salary.
The committee regularly reviews the ﬁnancial impact to 
the Company of pension provision. Given the regulatory 
changes expected in October 2012 a further review of 
the effect of these changes on the Company pension 
schemes is underway. In the meantime, in order to 
control the cost of pensions, the group has agreed 
with the Trustees of the Executive Pension Scheme the 
introduction of a capped accrual section which limits 
annual accrual in excess of CPI inﬂation to £3,125 per 
annum and has agreed with the individuals affected 
to pay a salary supplement of up to £16,000 per annum 
to compensate for their reduced accrual. 
Those directors and senior executives subject to the 
earnings cap and who participated in the FURBS 
arrangements now receive a cash salary supplement 
equivalent to the former FURBS payment, for investment 
in an investment vehicle of their own choice. Further 
pension detail is given in Table 2 of Appendix A on 
page 50.
For further details of the pension provision within the 
group during the year, see the directors’ report on 
page 38.
For further details on the cost of pensions to the  
group, including the statements required by IAS 19,

Directors’ responsibilities statement
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufﬁcient to show and 
explain the Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position 
of the Company and enable them to ensure that the 
ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of the corporate and ﬁnancial 
information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
We conﬁrm that to the best of our knowledge:
    the ﬁnancial statements, prepared in accordance 
with the relevant ﬁnancial reporting framework, give 
a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial 
position and proﬁt or loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole; and
    the management report, which is incorporated into 
the directors’ report, includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and 
the position of the company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face.
By order of the Board on 23 May 2012 and signed on 
its behalf by:
Neil Harrington
Finance Director
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual 
report and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare 
ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under 
that law the directors are required to prepare the 
group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the 
parent company ﬁnancial statements in accordance 
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and 
applicable law). Under company law the directors 
must not approve the accounts unless they are 
satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Company and of the proﬁt 
or loss of the Company for that period. 
In preparing the parent company ﬁnancial 
statements, the directors are required to:
    select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
    make judgments and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
   state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards 
have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the ﬁnancial 
statements; and
   prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going 
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume 
that the Company will continue in business.
In preparing the group ﬁnancial statements, 
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that 
directors:
    properly select and apply accounting policies;
  
  present information, including accounting policies, 
in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, 
comparable and understandable information; 
    provide additional disclosures when compliance 
with the speciﬁc requirements in IFRSs are insufﬁcient 
to enable users to understand the impact of 
particular transactions, other events and conditions 
on the entity’s ﬁnancial position and ﬁnancial 
performance; and
    make an assessment of the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2012  55 
Financial statements
We have audited the group ﬁnancial statements 
of Mothercare plc for the 53 weeks ended  
31 March 2012 which comprise the consolidated 
income statement, the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income, the consolidated balance 
sheet, the consolidated cash ﬂow statement, the 
consolidated statement of changes in equity and the 
related notes 1 to 31. The ﬁnancial reporting framework 
that has been applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, 
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of 
the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to 
them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than 
the Company and the Company’s members as a 
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the 
opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities 
statement, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the group ﬁnancial statements and 
for being satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require 
us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the 
amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements 
sufﬁcient to give reasonable assurance that the 
ﬁnancial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of 
signiﬁcant accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial 
statements. In addition, we read all the ﬁnancial and 
non-ﬁnancial information in the annual report to 
identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
ﬁnancial statements. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies 
we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements
In our opinion the group ﬁnancial statements:
    give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s 
affairs as at 31 March 2012 and of its loss for the 
53 weeks then ended;
    have been properly prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
    have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the directors’ 
report for the ﬁnancial year for which the group 
ﬁnancial statements are prepared is consistent with 
the group ﬁnancial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report  
by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to 
report to you if, in our opinion:
    certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration 
speciﬁed by law are not made; or
    we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
    the directors’ statement, contained within the 
corporate governance report, in relation to going 
concern;
    the part of the corporate governance statement 
relating to the company’s compliance with the nine 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
speciﬁed for our review; and
    certain elements of the report to shareholders by the 
board on directors’ remuneration.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent company 
ﬁnancial statements of Mothercare plc for the 53 weeks 
ended 31 March 2012 and on the information in the 
directors’ remuneration report that is described as 
having been audited.

Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
1. General information
Mothercare plc is a company incorporated in Great 
Britain under the Companies Act 2006. The address 
of the registered ofﬁce is given in the shareholder 
information on page 105. The nature of the group’s 
operations and its principal activities are set out in 
note 5 and in the overview and business review on 
pages 1 and 16 to 17.
These ﬁnancial statements are presented in UK 
pounds sterling because that is the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the 
group operates.
2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies
Basis of presentation
The group’s accounting period covers the 53 weeks 
ended 31 March 2012. The comparative period covered 
the 52 weeks ended 26 March 2011. 
Basis of accounting
The group’s ﬁnancial statements have been prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) adopted for use in the European 
Union, International Financial Reporting 
Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) and with those parts 
of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS. They therefore comply with 
Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
New standards affecting presentation  
and disclosure
There are no new standards in the year affecting the 
presentation and disclosure of the ﬁnancial statements.
New standards affecting the reported results and 
ﬁnancial position
There are no new standards in the year affecting the 
reported results and ﬁnancial position.
New standards not affecting the reported results nor 
the ﬁnancial position 
The following new and revised Standards and 
Interpretations have been adopted in these ﬁnancial 
statements. Their adoption has not had any signiﬁcant 
impact on the amounts reported in these ﬁnancial 
statements, but may impact the accounting for future 
transactions and arrangements:
   IAS 24 (2009) ‘Related Party Disclosures’
 
  Improvements to IFRSs 2010
 
  Amendments to IFRIC 14 (Nov. 2009) ‘Prepayments 
of a Minimum Funding Requirement’
   IFRIC 19 ‘Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with 
Equity Instruments’
New Standards in issue but not yet effective
At the date of authorisation of these ﬁnancial 
statements, the following standards and 
interpretations, which have not been applied in 
these ﬁnancial statements, were in issue but not yet 
effective (and in some cases had not yet been 
adopted by the EU).
    Amendments to IFRS 7 ‘Disclosures – Transfers of 
Financial Assets’
    Amendments to IFRS 7 ‘Disclosures – Offsetting 
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities’
   IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’
 
  IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’
 
  IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’
   IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of interests in other entities’
 
  IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’
 
   IAS 1 (Amended) ‘Presentation of items in Other 
Comprehensive Income’
    Amendments to IAS 12 ‘Deferred Tax: Recovery of 
Underlying Assets’
   IAS 19 (Revised) ‘Employee beneﬁts’
 
  IAS 27 (Revised) ‘Separate Financial Statements’
 
   IAS 28 (Revised) ‘Investments in Associates and 
Joint Ventures’
    Amendments to IAS 32 ‘Offsetting Financial Assets 
and Financial Liabilities’ 
   Amendments to IAS 12 ‘Deferred Tax: Recovery of 
Underlying Assets’
The directors anticipate that the adoption of these 
standards and interpretations in future periods will 
have no material impact on the group’s ﬁnancial 
statements when the relevant standards come into 
effect, except as follows:
   IAS 19 (revised) will impact the measurement of the 
various components representing movements in the 
deﬁned beneﬁt pension obligation and associated 
disclosures, but not the group’s total obligation. 
Following the adoption of IAS 19 (revised) effective 
from periods starting after 1 January 2013 the net 
retirement beneﬁt obligation in the balance sheet will 
not be impacted but the net ﬁnance cost of pensions 
within the income statement will increase. This will 
reduce proﬁt for the year and accordingly increase 
other comprehensive income.
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on the 
historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of 
ﬁnancial instruments, and on the going concern basis, 
as described in the going concern statement in the  Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2012  61 
Financial statements
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the 
excess of the cost of acquisition over the group’s 
interest in the fair value of the identiﬁable assets and 
liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled 
entity at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost 
and is subsequently measured at cost less any 
accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill which is 
recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment 
at least annually. Any impairment is recognised 
immediately in proﬁt or loss and is not 
subsequently reversed.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill 
is allocated to each of the group’s cash-generating 
units expected to beneﬁt from the synergies of the 
combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill 
has been allocated are tested for impairment 
annually, or more frequently when there is an 
indication that the unit may be impaired. If the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less 
than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment 
loss is allocated ﬁrst to reduce the carrying amount 
of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the 
other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the 
carrying amount of each asset in the unit. 
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not 
reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly 
controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill 
is included in the determination of the proﬁt or loss 
on disposal.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the 
consideration received or receivable and represents 
amounts receivable for goods and services provided 
in the normal course of business, net of discounts, 
VAT and other sales related taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are 
delivered and title has passed. Sales to international 
franchise partners are recognised when the signiﬁcant 
risks and rewards of ownership have transferred 
which is on dispatch.
Royalty revenue is recognised on an accruals basis 
in accordance with the substance of the relevant 
agreement (provided that it is probable that the 
economic beneﬁts will ﬂow to the group and the 
amount of revenue can be measured reliably). 
Royalty arrangements that are based on sales and 
other measures are recognised by reference to the 
underlying arrangement.
corporate governance report on page 32. 
The principal accounting policies are set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements incorporate 
the ﬁnancial statements of the Company and entities 
controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) made 
up to 31 March 2012. Control is achieved where the 
Company has the power to govern the ﬁnancial and 
operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain 
beneﬁts from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of 
during the ﬁnancial year are included in the 
consolidated income statement from the effective 
date of acquisition or up to the effective date of 
disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the 
ﬁnancial statements of subsidiaries to bring the 
accounting policies used into line with those used 
by the group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and 
expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using 
the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is 
measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the 
date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred 
or assumed and equity instruments issued by the 
group in exchange. Acquisition related costs are 
recognised in proﬁt and loss as incurred. The 
acquiree’s identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition 
under IFRS 3 (2008) ’Business combinations’ are 
recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, 
except for non-current assets (or disposal groups) that 
are classiﬁed as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 
5 ’Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued 
Operations’, which are recognised and measured at 
fair value less costs to sell and deferred tax assets or 
liabilities or assets related to employee beneﬁt 
arrangements are recognised and measured in 
accordance with IAS 12 ‘Income taxes’ and IAS 19 
‘Employee Beneﬁts’ respectively.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an 
asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess 
of the cost of the business combination over the 
group’s interest in the net fair value of the identiﬁable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. 
If, after reassessment, the group’s interest in the net fair 
value of the acquiree’s identiﬁable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the 
business combination, the excess is recognised 
immediately in the income statement.  62  Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2012
Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
continued
2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by 
reference to the principal outstanding and at the 
effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate 
that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts 
through the expected life of the ﬁnancial asset to that 
asset’s net carrying amount.
Proﬁt from retail operations
Proﬁt from retail operations represents the proﬁt 
generated from normal retail trading, prior to any 
gains or losses on property transactions. It also 
includes the volatility arising from accounting for 
derivative ﬁnancial instruments under IAS 39, ‘Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’, as the 
group has not adopted hedge accounting.
Underlying earnings
The group believes that underlying proﬁt before tax 
and underlying earnings provides additional useful 
information for shareholders. The term underlying 
earnings is not a deﬁned term under IFRS and may 
not therefore be comparable with similarly titled proﬁt 
measurements reported by other companies. It is not 
intended to be a substitute for IFRS measures of proﬁt. 
As the group has chosen to present an alternative 
earnings per share measure, a reconciliation of this 
alternative measure to the statutory measure required 
by IFRS is given in note 11.
To meet the needs of shareholders and other external 
users of the ﬁnancial statements the presentation of 
the income statement has been formatted to show 
more clearly, through the use of columns, our 
underlying business performance which provides 
more useful information on underlying trends. 
The adjustments made to reported results are 
as follows:
Exceptional items
Due to their signiﬁcance or one-off nature, certain 
items have been classiﬁed as exceptional. The gains 
and losses on these discrete items, such as proﬁts/
losses on the disposal/termination of property 
interests, impairment charges, restructuring costs and 
other non-operating items can have a material 
impact on the absolute amount of and trend in the 
proﬁt from operations and the result for the period. 
Therefore any gains and losses on such items are 
analysed as non-underlying on the face of the income 
statement. Further details of the exceptional items are 
provided in note 6.
Non-cash foreign currency adjustments
The group has taken the decision not to adopt hedge 
accounting under IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement’. The effect of not 
applying hedge accounting under IAS 39 means that 
the reported results reﬂect the actual rate of 
exchange ruling on the date of a transaction 
regardless of the cash ﬂow paid by the group at the 
predetermined rate of exchange. In addition, any 
gain or loss accruing on open contracts at a reporting 
period end is recognised in the result for the period 
(regardless of the actual outcome of the contract on 
close-out). Whilst the impacts described above could 
be highly volatile depending on movements in 
exchange rates, this volatility will not be reﬂected in 
the cash ﬂows of the group, which will be based on 
the hedged rate. In addition, foreign currency 
monetary assets and liabilities are revalued to the 
closing balance sheet rate under IAS 21 ‘The Effects of 
Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates’. The adjustment 
made by the group therefore is to report its underlying 
performance consistently with the cash ﬂows, 
reﬂecting the hedging which is in place.
Amortisation of intangible assets
The balance sheet includes identiﬁable intangible 
assets which arose on the acquisition of the Early 
Learning Centre and Blooming Marvellous and are 
amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected 
economic lives. The average estimated useful life of the 
assets is as follows:
Trade name – 10 to 20 years 
Customer relationships – 5 to 10 years
The amortisation of these intangible assets does not 
reﬂect the underlying performance of the business.
Unwinding of discount on exceptional provisions
Where property provisions are charged to 
exceptional items, the associated unwinding of the 
discount on these provisions is classiﬁed as 
non-underlying.
Joint ventures and associates
Joint ventures and associates are accounted for using 
the equity method whereby the interest in the joint 
venture or associate is initially recorded at cost and 
adjusted thereafter for the post acquisition change in 
the group’s share of net assets less any impairment in 
the value of individual investments. The proﬁt or loss of 
the group includes the group’s share of the proﬁt or 
loss of the joint ventures and associates.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the group’s 
share of the net fair value of the identiﬁable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised at 
the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. 
The goodwill is included within the carrying amount 
of the investment and is assessed for impairment as 
part of that investment.  Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2012  63 
Financial statements
Where a group entity transacts with an associate or 
joint venture of the group, proﬁts and losses are 
eliminated to the extent of the group’s interest in the 
relevant associate or joint venture.

Leases are classiﬁed as ﬁnance leases whenever the 
terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are 
classiﬁed as operating leases.
The group as lessor
Rental income from operating leases is recognised 
on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant 
lease. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and 
arranging an operating lease are added to the 
carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised 
on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases. 
The group as lessee
Assets held under ﬁnance leases are recognised as 
assets of the group at their fair value or, if lower, at 
the present value of the minimum lease payments, 
each determined at the inception of the lease. The 
corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the 
balance sheet as a ﬁnance lease obligation. Lease 
payments are apportioned between ﬁnance charges 
and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve 
a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance 
of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly 
against income, unless they are directly attributable 
to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged 
to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the 
relevant lease.
Beneﬁts received and receivable as an incentive to 
enter into an operating lease are also spread on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies
The individual ﬁnancial statements of each group 
company are presented in the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which it operates (its 
functional currency). For the purpose of the 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements, the results and 
ﬁnancial position of each group company are 
expressed in pounds sterling, which is the functional 
currency of the Company, and the presentation 
currency for the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
In preparing the ﬁnancial statements of the individual 
companies, transactions in currencies other than the 
functional currency are recorded at the rates of 
exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. 
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and 
liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies 
are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance 
sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried 
at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies 
are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when 
the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that 
are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign 
currency are not retranslated. 
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of 
monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary 
items, are included in the income statement. Exchange 
differences arising on non-monetary items carried 
at fair value are included in the proﬁt or loss for 
the period except for differences arising on the 
retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of 
which gains and losses are recognised directly in 
equity. For such non-monetary items, any exchange 
component of that gain or loss is also recognised 
directly in equity.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign 
exchange risks, the group enters into forward 
contracts (see below for details of the group’s 
accounting policies in respect of such derivative 
ﬁnancial instruments).
For the purpose of presenting consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements, the assets and liabilities of the group’s 
foreign operations are translated at exchange rates 
prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and 
expense items are translated at the average 
exchange rates for the period unless exchange 
rates ﬂuctuate signiﬁcantly during that period, in 
which case the exchange rates at the date of 
transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, 
if any, are classiﬁed within other comprehensive 
income, accumulated in equity in the group’s 
translation reserve. Such translation differences are 
recognised as income or as expenses in the period 
in which the operation is disposed of.
Retirement beneﬁt costs
Payments to deﬁned contribution retirement beneﬁt 
schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
For deﬁned beneﬁt schemes, the cost of providing 
beneﬁts is determined using the Projected Unit Credit 
Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at 
each balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses 
are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. 
They are recognised outside of the income statement 
and presented in other comprehensive income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the 
extent that the beneﬁts are already vested, and 
otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the 
average period until the beneﬁts become vested. 64  Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2012
Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
continued
2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
The retirement beneﬁt obligation recognised in the 
balance sheet represents the present value of the 
deﬁned beneﬁt obligation as adjusted for 
unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by 
the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting 
from this calculation is limited to past service cost, 
plus the present value of available refunds and 
reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
In consultation with the independent actuaries to 
the schemes, the valuation of the retirement beneﬁt 
obligations has been updated to reﬂect current 
market discount rates, and also considering whether 
there have been any other events that would 
signiﬁcantly affect the pension liabilities. The impact 
of these changes in assumptions and events has 
been estimated in arriving at the valuation of the 
retirement beneﬁt obligations.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax 
currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable proﬁt 
for the ﬁnancial year. Taxable proﬁt differs from net 
proﬁt as reported in the income statement because it 
excludes items of income or expense that are taxable 
or deductible in other ﬁnancial years and it further 
excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. 
The group’s liability for current tax is calculated using 
tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or 
recoverable on differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities in the ﬁnancial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in 
the computation of taxable proﬁt, and is accounted 
for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred 
tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
taxable proﬁts will be available against which 
deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the 
temporary difference arises from initial recognition 
of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than 
in a business combination) of other assets and 
liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the 
tax proﬁt nor the accounting proﬁt.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable 
temporary differences arising on investments in 
subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint 
ventures, except where the group is able to control 
the reversal of the temporary difference and it is 
probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is 
reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to 
the extent that it is no longer probable that sufﬁcient 
taxable proﬁts will be available to allow all or part of 
the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply in the period when the liability is 
settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged 
or credited in the income statement, except when it 
relates to items charged or credited directly to other 
comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax 
is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when 
there is a legally enforceable right to set off current 
tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they 
relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation 
authority and the group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any recognised 
impairment losses.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or 
valuation of assets, other than land and assets in 
course of construction, over their estimated useful 
lives, using the straight-line method, on the 
following bases:
Freehold buildings – 50 years
Fixed equipment in freehold buildings – 20 years
Leasehold improvements – the lease term
Fixtures, ﬁttings and equipment – 3 to 20 years
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement 
of an asset is determined as the difference between 
the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset and is recognised in income.
Intangible assets – software
Where computer software is not an integral part of a 
related item of computer hardware, the software is 
classiﬁed as an intangible asset. The capitalised costs 
of software for internal use include external direct 
costs of materials and services consumed in 
developing or obtaining the software and payroll and 
payroll-related costs for employees who are directly 
associated with and who devote substantial time to 
the project. Capitalisation of these costs ceases no 
later than the point at which the software is 
substantially complete and ready for its intended 
internal use. These costs are amortised on a straight-
line basis over their expected useful lives, which is 
normally ﬁve years. Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2012  65 
Financial statements
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets 
excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the group reviews the 
carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets 
to determine whether there is any indication that those 
assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such 
indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset 
is estimated in order to determine the extent of the 
impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not 
generate cash ﬂows that are independent from other 
assets, the group estimates the recoverable amount 
of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
An intangible asset with an indeﬁnite useful life is 
tested for impairment at least annually and whenever 
there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less 
costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, 
the estimated future cash ﬂows are discounted to their 
present value using a pre tax discount rate that 
reﬂects current market assessments of the time value 
of money and the risks speciﬁc to the asset for which 
the estimates of future cash ﬂows have not 
been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-
generating unit) is estimated to be less than its 
carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or 
cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable 
amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an 
expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the 
carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) 
is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable 
amount, but so that the increased carrying amount 
does not exceed the carrying amount that would 
have been determined had no impairment loss been 
recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in 
prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is 
recognised as income immediately.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, 
where applicable, direct labour costs and those 
overheads that have been incurred in bringing the 
inventories to their present location and condition. 
Cost is calculated using the weighted average cost 
formula. Net realisable value represents the estimated 
selling price less all estimated costs of completion 
and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling 
and distribution.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the 
group’s balance sheet when the group becomes a 
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition 
at fair value, and are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. 
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable 
amounts are recognised in the income statement 
when there is objective evidence that the asset is 
impaired. The allowance recognised is measured as 
the difference between the asset’s carrying amount 
and the present value of estimated future cash ﬂows 
discounted at the effective interest rate computed at 
initial recognition.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand 
and demand deposits, and other short term highly 
liquid investments that are readily convertible to 
a known amount of cash and are subject to an 
insigniﬁcant risk of change in value.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are 
classiﬁed according to the substance of the 
contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual 
interest in the assets of the group after deducting all 
of its liabilities.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are 
initially measured at fair value, net of direct issue 
costs. Finance charges, including premiums payable 
on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, 
are accounted for on an accruals basis to the income 
statement using the effective rate interest method and 
are added to the carrying amount of the instrument 
to the extent that they are not settled in the period in 
which they arise.
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, 
and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, 
using the effective interest rate method.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are 
recorded as the proceeds are received, net of direct 
issue costs.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
The group uses forward foreign currency contracts to 
mitigate the transactional impact of foreign currencies 
on the group’s performance. The group’s ﬁnancial risk 
management policy prohibits the use of derivative 
ﬁnancial instruments for speculative or trading 
purposes and the group does not therefore hold 
or issue any such instruments for such purposes.  66  Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2012
Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
continued
2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments that are economic 
hedges that do not meet the strict IAS 39 ‘Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ hedge 
accounting rules are accounted for as ﬁnancial assets 
or liabilities at fair value through proﬁt or loss and 
hedge accounting is not applied. Forward foreign 
currency contracts are recognised initially at fair 
value, which is updated at each balance sheet date. 
Changes in the fair values are recognised in the 
income statement.
Embedded derivatives
Derivatives embedded in other ﬁnancial instruments 
or other host contracts are treated as separate 
derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not 
closely related to those of the host contracts and the 
host contracts are not measured at fair value through 
proﬁt or loss.
Market risk
The group is exposed to market risk, primarily related 
to foreign exchange and interest rates. The group’s 
objective is to reduce, where it deems appropriate 
to do so, ﬂuctuations in earnings and cash ﬂows 
associated with changes in interest rates, foreign 
currency rates and of the currency exposure of certain 
net investments in foreign subsidiaries. It is the group’s 
policy and practice to use derivative ﬁnancial 
instruments to manage exposures of ﬂuctuations on 
exchange rates. The group only sells existing assets 
or enters into transactions and future transactions 
(in the case of anticipatory hedges) that it conﬁdently 
expects it will have in the future, based on past 
experience. The group expects that any loss in value 
for these instruments generally would be offset by 
increases in the value of the underlying transactions.
Foreign exchange rate risk
Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value of 
future cash ﬂows of a ﬁnancial instrument will ﬂuctuate 
because of the changes in foreign exchange rates. The 
group uses UK pounds sterling as its reporting currency. 
As a result, the group is exposed to foreign exchange 
rate risk on ﬁnancial assets and liabilities that are 
denominated in a currency other than UK sterling, 
primarily in US dollars and Hong Kong dollars.
Consequently, it enters into various contracts that 
reﬂect the changes in the value of foreign exchange 
rates to preserve the value of assets, commitments 
and anticipated transactions. The group also uses 
forward contracts and options, primarily in US dollars.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the group has a 
present obligation as a result of a past event, and 
it is probable that the group will be required to settle 
that obligation. Provisions are measured at the 
directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required 
to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, 
and are discounted to present value where the effect 
is material.
Share-based payments
The group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 
‘Share-based Payments’.
The group issues cash-settled and equity-settled 
share-based payments to certain employees. 
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured 
at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value 
determined at the grant date of the equity-settled 
share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line 
basis over the vesting period, based on the group’s 
estimate of shares that will eventually vest and 
adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting 
conditions, updated at each balance sheet date.
Fair value is measured by use of the valuation 
technique considered to be most appropriate for 
each class of award, including Black-Scholes 
calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. 
The expected life used in the formula is adjusted, 
based on management’s best estimate, for the 
effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions 
and behavioural considerations.
For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability 
equal to the portion of the goods or services received 
is recognised at the current fair value determined at 
each balance sheet date, with any changes in fair 
value recognised in proﬁt or loss for the year.
The group also provides employees with the ability to 
purchase the group’s ordinary shares at 80% of the 
current market value within an approved Save As You 
Earn scheme. The group records an expense based 
on its estimate of the 20% discount related to shares 
expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period.
Onerous leases
Present obligations arising out of onerous contracts are 
recognised and measured as provisions. An onerous 
contract is considered to exist where the group has a 
contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting 
the obligations under the contract exceed the 
economic beneﬁts expected to be received under it.
3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty
In the process of applying the group’s accounting 
policies, which are described in note 2, management 
has made the following judgements that have the 
most signiﬁcant effect on the amounts recognised in 
the ﬁnancial statements. Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2012  67 
Financial statements
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other 
key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance 
sheet date that have a signiﬁcant risk of causing a 
material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities within the next ﬁnancial year, are 
discussed below.
Retirement beneﬁts
Retirement beneﬁts are accounted for under IAS 19 
‘Employee Beneﬁts’. For deﬁned beneﬁt plans, 
obligations are measured at discounted present 
value whilst plan assets are recorded at fair value. 
Because of changing market and economic 
conditions, the expenses and liabilities actually arising 
under the plans in the future may differ materially from 
the estimates made on the basis of these actuarial 
assumptions. The plan assets are partially comprised 
of equity and ﬁxed-income instruments. Therefore, 
declining returns on equity markets and markets for 
ﬁxed-income instruments could necessitate additional 
contributions to the plans in order to cover future 
pension obligations. Also, higher or lower withdrawal 
rates or longer or shorter life of participants may have 
an impact on the amount of pension income or 
expense recorded in the future. 
The interest rate used to discount post-employment 
beneﬁt obligations to present value is derived from 
the yields of senior, high-quality corporate bonds at 
the balance sheet date. These generally include 
AA-rated securities. The discount rate is based on the 
yield of a portfolio of bonds whose weighted residual 
maturities approximately correspond to the duration 
necessary to cover the entire beneﬁt obligation. 
Pension and other post-retirement beneﬁts are 
inherently long term and future experience may differ 
from the actuarial assumptions used to determine the 
net charge for ‘pension and other post-retirement 
charges’. Note 29 to the consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements describes the principal discount rate, 
earnings increase and pension retirement beneﬁt 
obligation assumptions that have been used to 
determine the pension and post-retirement charges in 
accordance with IAS 19. The calculation of any charge 
relating to retirement beneﬁts is clearly dependent on 
the assumptions used, which reﬂects the exercise of 
judgement. The assumptions adopted are based on 
prior experience, market conditions and the advice of 
plan actuaries.
At 31 March 2012, the group’s pension liability was 
£52.7 million (2011: £37.6 million). Further details of the 
accounting policy on retirement beneﬁts are provided 
in note 2.
Impairment of stores’ property, plant and equipment
Stores’ property, plant and equipment (see note 16) 
are reviewed for impairment on a periodic basis, and 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the related carrying amounts may not be 
recoverable. Such circumstances or events could 
include: a pattern of losses involving the ﬁxed asset; 
a decline in the market value for a particular store 
asset; and an adverse change in the business or 
market in which the store asset is involved. 
Determining whether an impairment has occurred 
typically requires various estimates and assumptions, 
including determining what cash ﬂow is directly 
related to the potentially impaired asset, the useful life 
over which cash ﬂows will occur, their amount and the 
asset’s residual value, if any. Estimates of future cash 
ﬂows and the selection of appropriate discount rates 
relating to particular assets or groups of assets involve 
the exercise of a signiﬁcant amount of judgement.
Further details of the accounting policy on the 
impairment of stores’ property, plant and equipment 
are provided in note 2.
Impairment of goodwill
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an 
estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating 
units to which goodwill has been allocated. The value 
in use calculation requires the group to estimate 
future  cash ﬂows expected to arise from the cash-
generating unit a suitable long term growth rate and 
a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present 
value. The carrying amount of goodwill at the balance 
sheet date was £26.8 million (2011: £68.6 million).
Property provisions
Descriptions of the provisions held at the balance 
sheet date are given at note 24. These provisions 
are estimates and the actual costs and timing of 
future cash ﬂows are dependent on future events. 
Any differences between expectations and the actual 
future liability are accounted for in the period when 
such determination is made.
Onerous leases
Provisions has been made in respect of leasehold 
properties for vacant, partly let and loss making 
trading stores and costs relating to Early Learning 
Centre’s supply chain warehouse, for the shorter of the 
remaining period of the lease and the period until, in 
the directors’ opinion, they will be able to exit the lease 
commitment. The amount provided is based on the 
future rental obligations together with other ﬁxed 
outgoings, net of any sub-lease income and in the 
case of trading stores the expected future shortfall 
in contribution to cover the ﬁxed outgoings. 68  Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2012
Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
continued
3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued
In determining the provision, the cash ﬂows have been discounted on a pre tax basis using a risk free rate of return. Signiﬁcant 
assumptions are used in making these calculations and changes in assumptions and future events could cause the value of 
these provisions to change.
Allowances against the carrying value of inventory
The group reviews the market value of and demand for its inventories on a periodic basis to ensure that recorded inventory is 
stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. In assessing the ultimate realisation of inventories, the group is required to 
make judgements as to future demand requirements and to compare these with current inventory levels. Factors that could 
impact estimated demand and selling prices are timing and success of product ranges (see note 18).
Allowances against the carrying value of trade receivables
Using information available at the balance sheet date, the group reviews its trade receivable balances and makes 
judgements based on an assessment of past experience, debt ageing and known customer circumstance in order to 
determine the appropriate level of allowance required to account for potential irrecoverable trade receivables (see note 19).

IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identiﬁed on the basis of internal reports about components of the group that 
are regularly reported to the group’s board in order to allocate resources to the segments and assess their performance. 
The group’s reporting segments under IFRS 8 are UK and International.
UK comprises the group’s UK store and wholesale operations, catalogue and online sales. The International business comprises 
the group’s franchise and wholesale revenues outside the UK. The unallocated corporate expenses represent board and 
company secretarial costs and other head ofﬁce costs including audit, professional fees, insurance and head ofﬁce property.

During the 53 weeks ended 31 March 2012 the warehouse previously supplying the Early Learning Centre online business was 
closed and the business transferred into the warehouse supporting the Mothercare online business. This rationalisation of 
warehouses led to a one-off integration cost of £2.0 million (2011: £nil).
Restructuring costs in administration expenses
During the 53 weeks ended 31 March 2012 a charge of £7.1 million (2011: £3.6 million) was recognised relating to a substantial 
head ofﬁce restructuring and group reorganisation. Included within this expense are redundancy payments including some 
senior executives, curtailment gain on the deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme and professional and advisory fees in connection 
with the new strategic plan.
Store property, plant and equipment impairment included in administration expenses
During the 53 weeks ended 31 March 2012 the group has made provision of £3.8 million (2011: £nil) for store impairment where 
the carrying value of property plant and equipment is higher than the net realisable value and value in use.
Share-based payment credit included in administrative expenses
During the 53 weeks ended 31 March 2012 a credit of £0.8 million was recognised in respect of leavers from the executive 
incentive share schemes.
Onerous lease provision
A provision of £11.5 million has been made for onerous leases relating to vacant, sublet and trading properties having taken 
into consideration the results for the year, the Christmas trading activity and the continued pressure on the UK store portfolio. 
Onerous lease provisions have been recognised where there is an expected shortfall in the store contribution to cover the 
ﬁxed rental obligations. A discount rate of 2.3% has been used in calculating the provision, being the risk free rate.
(Loss)/proﬁt on disposal/termination of property interests
During the 53 weeks ended 31 March 2012 a net charge of £22.6 million (52 weeks ended 2011: a net credit of £0.2 million) 
has been recognised in loss/proﬁt from operations relating to losses on disposal/termination of property interests relating 
to the store reduction programme announced in May 2011. In April 2012 the group announced further store closures and 
these related costs will be provided for in the next ﬁnancial year. 
Goodwill and intangible assets impairment
The group has carried out a review to determine whether there is any indication that the goodwill and intangible assets have 
suffered any impairment loss. It has been determined that the UK business does not generate sufﬁcient cash ﬂows to support 
the value of the goodwill and intangible assets allocated to the UK segment and consequently an impairment loss of 
£55.0 million has been charged.
Impairment of investment in associate
The group has carried out a review of its investment in associate and written the investment down to recoverable amount 
at 31 March 2012 (£2.8 million charge).
Share of restructuring cost in associate
During the year the Australian associate undertook a signiﬁcant integration and rebranding of three separate mother 
and baby chains into a single cohesive Mothercare brand. Mothercare’s share of these costs of £0.4 million (2011: £nil) is 
included and has been treated as exceptional. 72  Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2012

Mothercare Australia Limited Australia 23.0 23.0
At 31 March 2012 the group undertook an impairment review of the investment carrying value. A discounted cash ﬂow forecast 
was used based on two years of forecasts extended out a further two years using planned growth rates. A pre tax discount 
rate of 9.83% was used. The impairment review indicated that the cost of investment was worth more than the recoverable 
amount at 31 March 2012 and therefore the group has made an impairment provision of £2.8 million. The reporting date of 
Mothercare Australia Limited is 30 June 2012. The group has equity accounted for Mothercare Australia Limited for 12 months 
ended 31 December 2011 as the data for the ﬁnal three months to 31 March 2012 has not been made available yet and is price

Goodwill, trade name and customer relationships relate to the acquisition of the Early Learning Centre on 19 June 2007, 
Gurgle Limited on 8 September 2009 and Blooming Marvellous on 7 July 2010. Trade name and customer relationships 
are amortised over a useful life of 10-20 and 5-10 years respectively.
Impairment of goodwill
The group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
Goodwill acquired through the business combination has been allocated to the two groups of cash-generating units (CGUs) 
that are expected to beneﬁt from that business combination, being UK (£nil, 2011: £41.8 million) and International (£26.8 million, 
2011: £26.8 million), which are also reporting segments. These represent the lowest level within the group at which goodwill is 
monitored for internal management purposes.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations with a discounted cash ﬂow model 
being used to calculate this amount. The key assumptions for the value in use calculation are those regarding the discount 
rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices. Management has used a pre tax discount rate of 9.83% 
(2011: 10.4%) which reﬂects the time value of money and risks related to the CGUs. The cash ﬂow projections are based on 
ﬁnancial budgets and forecasts approved by the board covering a three-year period. Cash ﬂows beyond the three-year 
period assume a 2% growth rate (2011: 2%), which does not exceed the long term growth rate for the market in which the 
group operates. The value in use calculations use this growth rate to perpetuity.
The group has conducted sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of the International CGU. With reasonable possible 
changes in key assumptions, there is no indication that the carrying amount of goodwill would be reduced to a lower amount.
At 26 March 2011 goodwill of £41.8 million was allocated to the UK business segment and £26.8 million to the International 
business. The UK segment has experienced a fall in demand during the year. The group has therefore revised its cash ﬂow 
forecast for the UK business segment and goodwill and intangibles has seen a reduction to its recoverable amount through 
recognition of an impairment loss against goodwill (£41.8 million), trade name (£12.0 million) and customer relationships 
(£1.2 million). Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2012  79 
Financial statements
Forecasts show that, in overall terms, the goodwill and intangibles acquired with the Early Learning Centre has signiﬁcantly 
more value than that recorded in the books as the group has more than doubled the number of stores within International and 
the UK segments combined since acquisition. However at the time of acquisition Early Learning Centre was predominantly a 
UK business, resulting in the majority of goodwill being allocated to the UK. Whilst the International business for Early Learning 
Centre has subsequently grown very rapidly it is not possible to offset the surplus in International goodwill against the deﬁcit in 
UK goodwill. 
Software
Software additions include £1.5 million (2011: £1.6 million) of internally generated intangible assets.
At 31 March 2012, the group had entered into contractual commitments for the acquisition of software amounting to 
£0.3 million (2011: £0.3 million).

At the balance sheet date the group has unused tax losses of £2.8 million (2011: £nil) available for offset against future proﬁts. 
A deferred tax asset has been recognised of £0.7 million in respect of £2.8 million (2011: £nil) of such losses. There are no 
unrecognised tax losses.
At the reporting date, deferred tax liabilities of £0.8 million (2011 : £0.4 million) relating to withholding taxes have not been 
provided in respect of the aggregate amount of unremitted earnings of £5.9 million (2011 : £3.4 million) in respect of 
subsidiaries. No liability has been recognised because the group, being in a position to control the timing of the distribution of 
intra group dividends, has no intention to distribute intra group dividends in the foreseeable future that would trigger 
withholding tax. There are no unremitted earnings in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures. 
At 31 March 2012, the group has unused capital losses of £662.5 million (2011: £665.2 million) available for offset against future 
capital gains. No asset has been recognised in respect of the capital losses as it is not considered probable that there will 
be future taxable capital gains. The capital losses may be carried forward indeﬁnitely. Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2012  81

The group’s exposure to credit risk inherent in its trade receivables is discussed in note 22. The group has no signiﬁcant 
concentration of credit risk. The group operates effective credit control procedures in order to minimise exposure to overdue 
debts and where possible also carries insurance against the cost of bad debts. The insurance counterparties involved in 
transactions are limited to high quality ﬁnancial institutions. Before accepting any new credit customer, the group obtains 
a credit check from an external agency to assess the credit quality of the potential customer and then sets credit limits on 
a customer by customer basis.
The historical level of customer default is minimal and as a result the ‘credit quality’ of year end trade receivables is 
considered to be high. 82  Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2012

Trade accounts receivable net carrying amount 48.6 51.0
Provisions for doubtful trade accounts receivable are established based upon the difference between the receivable value 
and the estimated net collectible amount. The group establishes its provision for doubtful trade accounts receivable based 
on its historical loss experiences and an analysis of the counterparty’s current ﬁnancial position. 
The average credit period taken on sales of goods is disclosed in note 22. No interest is charged on trade receivables, 
however, the right to charge interest on outstanding balances is retained. 
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
20. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held by the group and short term bank deposits with an original maturity of three 
months or less. The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.
21. Borrowing facilities
The group had outstanding borrowings at 31 March 2012 of £21.9 million (2011: £nil).
Overdraft
The group has an unsecured overdraft facility of £10.0 million which bears interest at 1.0% above bank base rates. £1.9 million 
of this facility (net of cash in transit) was drawn down at 31 March 2012.
Committed borrowing facilities 
The group also had £80 million of committed secured borrowing facilities available at 31 March 2012 with an average interest 
rate of 1.43% above LIBOR in respect of which all conditions precedent have been met. The ﬁnal maturity date of this facility 
was 31 October 2013. £20 million of this facility was drawn down at 31 March 2012.  Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2012  83 
Financial statements
The group has subsequently agreed a reﬁnancing of its banking facilities as of 11 April 2012 with its two existing banks, 
increasing the level of committed facilities from £80 million to £90 million and extending the term to 31 May 2015 at an interest 
rate range of 3.5 to 4% above LIBOR. These facilities further strengthen the group’s ﬁnancial position and provide additional 
liquidity and covenant headroom to accommodate the new three-year strategy. Further information is included within the 
corporate governance statement.

22. Risks arising from ﬁnancial instruments
A. Terms, conditions and risk management policies
The board approves treasury policies and senior management directly controls day-to-day operations within these policies. 
The major ﬁnancial risks to which the group is exposed relate to movements in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. 
Where appropriate, cost effective and practicable the group uses ﬁnancial instruments and derivatives to manage these 
risks. No speculative use of derivatives, currency or other instruments is permitted. The group’s ﬁnancial risk management 
policy is described in note 2. 
The following table provides an overview of the notional value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments outstanding at year end by 
maturity proﬁle:

The group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising 
the returns to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the group consists 
of net debt, which includes borrowings disclosed in note 21 after deducting cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable 
to equity holders of the parent comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the statement of 
changes in equity. 84  Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2012

22. Risks arising from ﬁnancial instruments continued
B. Foreign currency risk management
The group incurs foreign currency risk on sales and purchases whenever they are denominated in a currency other than the 
functional currency. This risk is managed through holding derivative ﬁnancial instruments.
The group uses forward foreign currency contracts to reduce its cash ﬂow exposure to exchange rate movements, primarily on 
the US dollar. The group has not hedge accounted for its forward foreign currency contracts under the requirements of IAS 39. 
Therefore, derivative ﬁnancial instruments have been recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the 
balance sheet date and changes in their fair values have been recognised in the income statement. These arrangements are 
designed to address signiﬁcant foreign exchange exposures on forecast future purchases of goods for the following year and 
are renewed on a revolving basis as required.
Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts have been recognised separately as derivative ﬁnancial instruments 
when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not stated at 
its fair value with changes in its fair value recognised in the income statement.
International sales represent 31% (2011: 26%) of group sales. Of these sales, 23% (2011: 19%) were invoiced in foreign currency. 
The group purchases product in foreign currencies, representing approximately 46% (2011: 42%) of total purchases.
The carrying amount of the group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting 
date is as follows:

At notional value 120.2 139.2
At fair value (1.2) (2.7)
At 31 March 2012, the average hedged rate for outstanding forward foreign currency contracts is 1.58 for US dollars. There 
were no forward contracts in place for any other currencies at the year end. These contracts mature between April 2012 and 
May 2013. The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is measured using quoted foreign exchange rates and yield 
curves from quoted rates matching the maturities of the contracts, and they therefore are categorised within level 2 of the fair 
value hierarchy set out in IFRS 7.
The fair value of embedded derivatives is a liability of £0.1 million (2011: £nil million). Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2012  85

Currency sensitivity analysis
The group’s foreign currency ﬁnancial assets and liabilities are denominated mainly in US dollars. The following table details 
the impact of a 10% increase in the value of pounds sterling against the US dollar. A negative number indicates a net 
decrease in the carrying value of assets and liabilities and a corresponding loss in non-underlying proﬁt where pounds 
sterling strengthens against the US dollar.

C. Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty may default on their obligation to the group in relation to lending, hedging, 
settlement and other ﬁnancial activities. The group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The group 
has a credit policy in place and the exposure to counterparty credit risk is monitored. The group mitigates its exposure to 
counterparty credit risk through minimum counterparty credit guidelines, diversiﬁcation of counterparties, working within 
agreed counterparty limits and trade insurance and bank guarantees where appropriate.
The carrying amount of the ﬁnancial assets represents the maximum credit exposure of the group. The carrying amount is 
presented net of impairment losses recognised. The maximum exposure to credit risk comprises trade receivables as shown 
in note 19 and cash and cash equivalents of £1.8 million.
The average credit period on trade receivables was 21 days (2011: 23 days) based on total group revenue. The average credit 
period on International trade receivables was 67 days (2011: 82 days).
D. Liquidity risk
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the board of directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity 
risk management framework for the management of the group’s short, medium and long term funding and liquidity 
management requirements. The group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and 
reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash ﬂows and matching the maturity proﬁles 
of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities. Included in note 21 is a description of additional undrawn facilities that the group has at its 
disposal to further reduce liquidity risk.
E. Interest rate risk
The principal interest rate risk of the group arises in respect of its sterling borrowings. The group’s borrowing facilities at 1.43% 
over LIBOR expose the group to cash ﬂow interest rate risk. The interest exposure is monitored by management but due to 
low interest rate levels during the period no interest rate hedging has been undertaken.
Going forward under the new banking arrangements the group intends to use derivative contracts to manage its interest 
rate risk. 86  Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2012

Property provisions principally represent the costs of store disposals or closures relating to the optimisation of the UK portfolio 
which involves the closure of Mothercare and Early Learning Centre stores and provisions for onerous lease costs. Provisions 
for onerous leases have been made for vacant, partly let and trading stores for the shorter of the remaining period of the 
lease and the period until, the group will be able to exit the lease commitment. For trading stores the amount provided is 
based on the shortfall in contribution required to cover future rental obligations together with other ﬁxed outgoings. 
The majority of this provision is expected to be utilised over the next three ﬁnancial years.
Other provisions principally represent provisions for uninsured losses, hence the timing of the utilisation of these provisions 
is uncertain.

28. Share-based payments
An expense is recognised for share-based payments based on the fair value of the awards (at the date of grant for those 
awards due to be equity settled and at year end for those due to be cash settled), the estimated number of shares that will 
vest and the vesting period of each award.
The underlying charge for share-based payments is £0.6 million (2011: £2.2 million), including national insurance, of which 
£0.5 million (2011: £2.6 million) was equity-settled. The exceptional credit for share-based payments of £0.8 million (2011: £nil) 
arises in respect of leavers from the executive incentive share schemes. At 31 March 2012 the liability in the balance sheet is 
£0.1 million related to the expected national insurance charge when share-based payment schemes vest (2011: £0.9 million).
These charges relate to the following schemes: 
A. Executive Share Option Scheme 
B. Save As You Earn Schemes 
C. Executive Incentive Plan 
D. Performance Share Plan 
E. Deferred Shares Scheme 
F. Share Matching Scheme

28. Share-based payments continued
For each scheme, expected volatility was determined with reference to the 90-day volatility of the group’s share price over 
the previous three years. The expected life used in each model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, 
for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. The dates of exercise are not 
disclosed, as it is not deemed practicable to do so.
A. Executive Share Option Scheme
Share options may be granted to executives and senior managers at a price equal to the average quoted market price of the 
group’s shares on the date of grant. The options vest after three years, conditional on the group’s share price exceeding 3% 
per annum compound growth over the vesting period. If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the 
date of grant, they expire. Furthermore, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the group before the options vest.

from 284p to 335p.
B. Save As You Earn schemes
The employee Save As You Earn schemes are open to all employees and provide for a purchase price equal to the daily 
average market price on the date of grant, less 20%.
The shares can be purchased during a two week period each year and are placed in the employee Save As You Earn trust 
for a three-year period.

Fair value of option 56.4p 172.9p 41.1p
The resulting fair value is expensed over the service period of three years on the assumption that 20% of options will lapse 
over the service period as employees leave the group.
C. Executive Incentive Plan
The Executive Incentive Plan is a conditional award based on surplus value created over a three-year performance period. 
The surplus value is calculated as the difference between the total shareholder return of Mothercare and that of the FTSE 
All-Share General Retailers Index, multiplied by Mothercare’s market capitalisation. The 2009, 2010 and 2011 schemes are a 
wholly equity settled scheme where some of the shares can be delivered on vesting and the remainder deferred.
The fair value of the Executive Incentive plan award is calculated using a binomial model with the following assumptions at 
grant date: 
Grant date May 2011 June 2010 May 2009
Market capitalisation at award date £449.0m £562.7m £338.4m

The fair value of the plan award is calculated based on Mothercare’s estimate of future proﬁt per share growth. At the current 
time the group’s forecasts suggest that the performance share plan is not expected to pay out and consequently the fair 
value is nil.

29 . Retirement beneﬁt schemes
Deﬁned contribution schemes
The group operates deﬁned contribution retirement beneﬁt schemes for all qualifying employees of Early Learning Centre 
Limited and Mothercare UK Limited.
The total cost charged to income of £0.6 million (2011: £0.6 million) represents contributions due and paid to these schemes by 
the group at rates speciﬁed in the rules of the plan.
Deﬁned beneﬁt schemes
The group has operated two deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes for employees of Mothercare UK Limited during the period.
On 28 March 2004, the ﬁnal salary schemes were closed to new entrants and a ‘career average’ scheme was introduced to 
replace it. Existing members were asked to either increase their contributions from an average of 4.8% to an average of 6.8% 
or accrue future beneﬁts on a ‘career average’ basis.
In 2009 the ‘career average’ schemes were closed to new entrants.
The pension scheme assets are held in a separate trustee administered fund to meet long term pension liabilities to past and 
present employees. The trustees of the fund are required to act in the best interest of the fund’s beneﬁciaries.
For the protection of members’ interests, the group has appointed three trustees, two of whom are independent of the group. 
To maintain this independence, the trustees and not the group are responsible for appointing their own successors.
The most recent full actuarial valuations were carried out as at 31 March 2008. Actuarial valuations of the Mothercare Staff 
and Executive Pension Schemes were undertaken as at 31 March 2011. Discussions are underway between the Company 
and the trustees with the aim of signing off the actuarial valuations and recovery plans by 30 June 2012. The most recent full 
actuarial valuations were updated as at 31 March 2012 for the purpose of these disclosures with the advice of professionally 
qualiﬁed actuaries. The present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation, the related current service cost and the past service 
cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.
The IAS 19 valuation conducted for the period ended 31 March 2012 disclosed a net deﬁned pension deﬁcit of £52.7 million 
(2011: £37.6 million).
The major assumptions used in the updated actuarial valuations were:
31 March 
2012
26 March 
2011
Discount rate 4.9% 5.5%
Inﬂation rate – RPI 3.3% 3.5%
Inﬂation rate – CPI 2.3% 2.8%
Future pension increases 3.2% 3.4%
Expected rate of salary increases 3.3% 3.5%
Expected return on schemes’ assets 6.0% 7.0%
Analysed between:
Equities 7.3% 8.3%
Bonds 4.7% 5.1%
Property 5.3% 6.3%
Alternative assets 6.3% 7.3%
Other assets 4.7% 5.1%
The overall expected rate of return on assets is calculated as the weighted average of the expected returns from each of the 
asset classes. The returns quoted above are net of investment management expenses but before adjustment to allow for the 
expected administrative and other expenses of running the schemes. 94  Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2012

Independent auditor’s report on the  
Company ﬁnancial statements
We have audited the parent company ﬁnancial 
statements of Mothercare plc for the 53 weeks ended 
31 March 2012 which comprise the parent company 
balance sheet, and the related notes 1 to 8. The 
ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been applied 
in their preparation is applicable law and United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, 
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of 
the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to 
them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than 
the Company and the Company’s members as a 
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the 
opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities 
statement, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the parent company ﬁnancial 
statements and for being satisﬁed that they give a 
true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the parent company ﬁnancial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the 
amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements 
sufﬁcient to give reasonable assurance that the 
ﬁnancial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This 
includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the parent company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of 
signiﬁcant accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial 
statements. In addition, we read all the ﬁnancial and 
non-ﬁnancial information in the annual report to 
identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
ﬁnancial statements. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies 
we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements
In our opinion the parent company ﬁnancial 
statements:
   give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2012;
   have been properly prepared in accordance with 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice; and
   have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
   the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006; and
   the information given in the directors’ report for the 
ﬁnancial year for which the ﬁnancial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the parent company 
ﬁnancial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by 
exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following 
matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to 
report to you if, in our opinion:
   adequate accounting records have not been kept 
by the parent company , or returns adequate for our 
audit have not been received from branches not 
visited by us; or
   the parent company ﬁnancial statements and the 
part of the directors’ remuneration report to be 
audited are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns; or
   certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration 
speciﬁed by law are not made; or
   we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the group ﬁnancial 
statements of Mothercare plc for the 53 weeks ended 
31 March 2012.

Shareholder analysis
A summary of holdings as at 30 March 2012 is 
as follows:
Mothercare ordinary shares
Number of 
shares million
Number of 
shareholders
Banks, insurance 
companies and 
pension funds 417,546 7
Nominee companies 73,342,826 721
Other corporate holders 10,252,241 121
Individuals 4,624,149 23,249
88,636,762 24,098
As can be seen from the above analysis, many shares 
are registered in the name of a nominee company 
as the legal owner. The underlying holder of shares 
through a nominee account is the beneﬁcial owner 
of these shares, being entitled to the capital value 
and the income arising from them. An analysis of 
these nominee holdings shows that the largest 
underlying holders are pension funds, with unit 
trusts and insurance companies the other major 
types of shareholder.
Individual shareholders owning 500 or more 
Mothercare shares are entitled to a 10% discount in 
deﬁned denominations on up to £500 of merchandise 
in Mothercare and Early Learning Centre stores in the 
UK. If an individual shareholding of 500 or more 
shares is not on the share register but is held through 
a nominee or trustee, the book of vouchers can 
nevertheless be obtained. Eligible shareholders can 
request a voucher booklet by sending their name, 
address and shareholder account number by email 
to investorrelations@mothercare.com or by writing to 
the registered ofﬁce.

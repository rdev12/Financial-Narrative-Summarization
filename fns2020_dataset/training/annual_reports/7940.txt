Introduction
I am pleased to report that Imprint
delivered a strong set of results for the
year ended 31 December 2006. This
strong performance was driven by
sector leading revenue growth both
from our organic and acquired
businesses, a doubling in net fee
income from our Asian operations and
a triple digit increase in pre-tax profits.
2006 was a year when our Group
delivered on its considerable potential.
Following the acquisition of three
businesses in 2005, the focus in 2006
was on delivering organic growth from
all of our businesses, particularly
through gains in market share and
a significant expansion in Asia.
During the year we continued to invest
in the Group’ s global operations, both in
the front and back offices, as we strive
to increase and maximise potential
earnings over the course of the cycle.
Over the last 12 months we have
increased our fee generating headcount
by 21%, up from 310 at 31 December
2005 to 375 at 31 December 2006.
Including directors and support staff,
the Group employed 480 staff at
31 December 2006, operating from
14 offices in eight countries.
As is the case with most successful
businesses whose primary assets are its
people, Imprint’ s achievements in 2006
are entirely the result of the dedication,
efforts and loyalty of the Group’ s
employees, and I should like to take this
opportunity to thank them all.
Financial highlights
Adjusted earnings per share (being
diluted earnings per share adjusted for
goodwill amortisation and exceptional
items) were 65% higher than 2005 at
22.3 pence. Diluted earnings per share
were 17.0 pence, up 136%.
Turnover increased by almost 50% to
£80.1 million through a combination of
strong organic growth and the full year
impact of the acquisitions of ECHM
and Morgan McKinley in 2005, which
together trade a significant volume of
temporary placements. Net fee income
(gross profit) increased by 41.0% to
£44.9 million, which included growth in
the non-acquired business of 32.6%,
from £13.0 million to £17.3 million.
Across the Group’ s primary markets of
the United Kingdom and Europe, net
fee income in the second half of 2006
increased by 24.3%, from £16.1 million
to £20.1 million, with both our organic
businesses and the businesses we
acquired in 2005 gaining market share.
I am pleased to report a full year
operating margin (being the conversion
rate of net fee income into operating
profit
1
) of 25.8% (2005 – 22.2%) and an
operating profit
1
of £11.6 million, up
64.1% (2005 – £7.1 million), which have
been achieved alongside continued
investment in our fee generating
capabilities. The growth in the margin
has been achieved thanks to positive
returns on investments made in
previous years and the financial benefits
which have been derived from all of our
businesses working closer together in
the sourcing of client and candidate
opportunities and the sharing of
overheads and group services.
Profit before tax increased by 109% to
£9.1 million (2005 – £4.4 million) after a
£1.8 million charge for goodwill
amortisation, a £0.3 million charge for
share-based payments and £0.4 million
of exceptional costs resulting from a
decision we took late last year to
relocate the London-based operations
of ECHM, Morgan McKinley and our
group shared service functions into the
same premises. This decision will
facilitate even closer cooperation
between our contingent recruitment
businesses (which share a similar
candidate pool) and our back office
functions, will reduce overheads and
will result in approximately 70% of our
London-based staff being located in the
same building.
The Group’ s balance sheet at 31
December 2006 was strong, with net
current assets of £15.2 million (2005 –
£9.4 million), cash of £4.3 million (2005
– £3.2 million), and banking facilities
available to the Group of £7.5 million.
The Board declared an interim dividend
of 1.3 pence per share and is proposing
to pay a final dividend of 2.6 pence per
share (2005 – maiden dividend of 2.0
pence), taking the total dividend for the
year to 3.9 pence per share. The final
dividend will be paid on 18 May 2007 to
those shareholders on the register at
20 April 2007.
Acquisition
On 19 July 2006, Imprint acquired the
Ingram Consultancy, one of the United
Arab Emirates’ leading recruitment
businesses. This acquisition has
provided Imprint with a strategic entry
point into the high growth Dubai and
Gulf Cooperative Community markets
and has further broadened the scope of
the services we offer to our commercial
and financial services clients.
Initial consideration paid was £900,000
in cash and by the issue of 115,924 new
ordinary Imprint shares. Further
potential consideration of up to £3.8
million is payable in a combination of
cash and new ordinary shares,
contingent upon the financial
performance of the acquired business
in the year ended 31 December 2006
and the years ending 31 December 2007
and 2008. No consideration is due for
performance in the year ended
31 December 2006.
The Ingram Consultancy trades as two
businesses, iQ selection, which provides
contingent recruitment services in the
region, and an executive search
business which has recently been
rebranded as WoodHamill Ingram to
reflect the international talent search
capabilities which the Group can now
provide in this geographical region.
Current trading and outlook
All of the markets and regions in which
the Group operates continue to be
buoyant and the short term outlook for
the Group is therefore encouraging.
Imprint is well placed to continue to
grow earnings and continue its
expansion in 2007 by further increasing
headcount and by enlarging the scope
of its service offerings, thereby
diversifying its revenue streams. The
Board is actively investigating new
office openings and continues to review
selective acquisitions that meet the
Group’ s strict cultural, operational and
valuation criteria.
I look forward to 2007, as Imprint seeks
further to increase market share in its
established markets, while also growing
in new sectors and geographies.

Imprint Plc | Chief executive’ s review
Introduction
2006 has been a successful year for
Imprint, as we capitalised on favourable
market conditions across the Group’ s
markets and delivered a healthy return
on investments made in prior years (in
businesses, offices and headcount). Our
focus was to drive gains in market share
through organic growth in each of our
operations, both in the United Kingdom
and overseas and thereby to achieve
sector leading revenue growth. At the
same time we have continued to invest
for the future, through increased
headcount, new office space, improved
systems and a determined expansion
strategy in Asia.
We have successfully continued to
diversify our revenue streams, both
geographically and through the types of
recruitment service we provide, whilst
still maintaining our client focus on
blue chip organisations. This approach
has remained consistent throughout
our trading history and provides us with
greater resilience as well as substantial
opportunities for further sustainable
growth. We continue to pride ourselves
on the provision of the highest levels of
client service and we are fortunate to
have a dedicated and talented workforce
to drive this growth going forward.
Employee and office information
Largely through investment in new staff
and new disciplines as well as the
acquisition of the Ingram Consultancy,
the Group has increased its headcount
by 24%. At the end of the year, the
Group employed 375 (2005 – 310) fee
generating staff and 105 (2005 – 77)
directors and support staff, operating
from 14 (2005 – 13) offices in 8
(2005 – 7) countries.
Business review
Having achieved our primary
integration objectives in 2005, the
operational focus for 2006 was to
deliver sector leading growth across
each of our markets, whilst at the same
time selectively investing in headcount
in new and established business areas.
Our belief is that the retention of strong
individual brand identities operating
within a multi-functional international
recruitment group offers the best
opportunities for long-term growth,
providing career development
opportunities for our staff, cross-brand
participation in client management and
candidate sharing and efficient
common back office support.
Whilst we will continue to invest where
appropriate in our back office systems
in order to achieve greater efficiencies,
the integration of our shared service
functions is now complete. For
example, our decision to establish a
dedicated training and development
function has resulted in a significant
increase in the amount of time
provided to equip our people with the
skills they need to service our clients
fully and to reach their individual
potential. It has also had the knock on
effect of helping to keep our staff
retention levels amongst the highest
in the industry.
We are very pleased with the
performance of the three acquisitions
completed in 2005. In total, net fee
income from Accreate, ECHM and
Morgan McKinley rose 26.0% in the
second half of 2006 compared to the
comparative period, which is ahead
of average industry growth in these
regions over this period and
demonstrates an increase in market
share for these businesses.
United Kingdom and Europe
In total, turnover in the UK and Europe
was £74.6 million (2005 – £52.2 million),
an increase of 43.0%, and net fee
income was £39.5 million (2005 – £29.3
million), an increase of 34.6%.
Operating profit before exceptional
costs, share-based payments and
amortisation of goodwill increased by
55.8% to £10.5 million (2005 – £6.8
million) and was £8.1 million after these
costs (2005 – £4.0 million).
Morgan McKinley enjoyed a highly
successful year, benefiting from its
position as a leading supplier of back
office recruitment services to financial
services institutions in a year where
hiring in this sector in the United
Kingdom reached a record high.
Morgan McKinley’ s business is
principally driven by numerous
preferred supplier agreements (“PSA ”)
which provide the framework to enable
it to deliver multiple recruitment
product offerings to its clients. These
underpin its position as a leading
recruitment company within its market
and provide a major barrier to entry to
Morgan McKinley’ s potential
competitors. During the course of the
year, Morgan McKinley increased the
number of its PSAs by approximately
15% and transacted a significantly
higher number of ‘volume’ recruitment
projects than in 2005.
Furthermore, Morgan McKinley
developed its service offerings within its
markets, launching new specialisms in
HR, commodities and insurance, all of
which were profitable in their first year
and all of which will help complement
Morgan McKinley’ s traditional
stronghold in investment banking
through diversification into new
revenue streams.
Operationally, Morgan McKinley had a
strong year. As well as a 27% growth in
permanent placement revenue, the
number of temporary workers and
contractors at clients at the year end
was 28% higher than at the end of 2005.
Margins on temporary placements
increased slightly from 2005.
Our ECHM business, which specialises
in financial recruitment into blue chip
corporates and the global accounting
practices across the United Kingdom
and in the Netherlands, also had a
successful year. In London and
Amsterdam, like for like net fee income
increased by 32% and operating margin
increased from 15% to 20%. ECHM’ s
professional services businesses, which
recruit finance professionals typically
into tax, audit and corporate finance
roles within accountancy practices, is
now the market leader in the south east
of England. In this region, ECHM by the
year end had also doubled the number
of temporary placements out with
clients compared with the end of 2005. 6 | Group report and accounts 2006
Imprint Plc | Chief executive’ s review
ECHM’ s Dutch operations performed
ahead of expectations, increasing net
fee income by 110% on 2005. We are
optimistic about our future growth
potential in this region, so we took the
decision late in 2006 to move into larger
offices in order to provide sufficient
accommodation for our headcount
growth plans and to accommodate the
roll out of the Morgan McKinley brand
in this region during 2007. This move
was completed in February 2007.
Accreate, which we acquired in
September 2005, continued to thrive in
the buoyant Dublin economy with its
primary focus being on financial
recruitment in the corporate and
financial services sectors. Annualised
net fee income increased by 59%. At the
end of 2006, Accreate launched two new
product lines, HR and Legal. Although
in their infancy, both of these service
offerings should enable Accreate to
continue its growth momentum and
their introduction is consistent with the
Group’ s wider strategy of diversifying its
revenue streams from strong existing
client relationships and recognised
brand expertise.
Imprint Search & Selection and
WoodHamill, our retained executive
search businesses, together produced
solid growth during the year of 20%. We
invested in additional headcount across
a number of functional specialisms
which were launched in 2005 –
examples included our HR, T echnology
and Wealth Management practices.
Both of our organic brands have
continued to develop the range of
executive recruitment solutions they
can provide to their strong multi-
national client bases, predominantly
serviced from London but utilising local
search capabilities from Imprint’ s wider
office network to provide a full service
offering. In 2006, approximately 17% of
Imprint Search & Selection’ s net fee
income originated from continental
Europe, demonstrating its non-UK
capabilities.
As has been well documented
elsewhere, this recent period of the
recruitment cycle has witnessed a
general shortage of appropriately skilled
professionals available to fill new roles
within the sectors in which Imprint
operates. As a Group we have had to
adapt our working methodologies to
source the best talent for our clients.
Key to this has been the emphasis we
have placed on the sharing of candidate
information, both within the United
Kingdom and overseas. We now have a
dedicated research team which is based
out of London but which is responsible
for both sourcing and placing
candidates on an international basis.
Where appropriate (typically in the
newly qualified accountants market) we
have also actively raised our brand
awareness in countries where we do not
have an office presence, for example in
Australia and South Africa.
Asia Pacific and the Middle East
Our operations across Asia and the
Middle East have grown strongly during
the period, with net fee income of £5.4
million being 115% higher than 2005
(£2.5 million). This growth was largely
organic, with the acquisition of the
Ingram Consultancy in Dubai adding
£0.68 million to revenue. The region’ s
operating profit was £1.1 million, up
from £0.3 million in 2005, which
represents a conversion rate of 19.6%
(2005 – 12.3%).
We continue to invest across this region,
and during the first half of the year we
increased our capacity in T okyo through
additional office space as well as moving
into permanent premises in Singapore
at the start of the year. By the end of the
year, we employed 66 fee generating
staff across our four offices in this region
(2005 – 33 staff in three offices).
Market conditions were buoyant across
the Asian region throughout the course
of the year with all three of our offices
experiencing similar pressures on
skilled candidate supply for the number
of new jobs coming onto the market.
We expect this trend to continue during
2007, with financial institutions in
particular expecting to run multiple
hire recruitment campaigns for mid to
junior level finance and operations
roles, which will involve overseas
sourcing as well as local hiring as the
talent pools increase and improve.
Strategy
Our strategy remains unchanged. We
continue to build and develop a multi-
tiered, international recruitment
business that provides a diverse range
of functional offerings to blue-chip
clients, ensuring that the Group’ s
potential earnings are maximised over
the business cycle. Where appropriate,
we will continue to invest in each of our
businesses’ operating functions if we
believe this will deliver earnings growth
in the short and long term, whilst also
aiming to continue to deliver top
quartile operating profit conversion.
There remains a wide range of
opportunities to grow the Imprint
group in new markets and to take
further market share in the regions in
which we currently operate. We are
currently investigating the feasibility of
opening a limited number of new
offices in the Asia region during the
course of 2007 and early in 2008. We are
continuing to review acquisition
opportunities that meet our strict
cultural and valuation criteria and
operationally allow us access either to
new recruitment sectors or to new
geographical markets.
The Group intends to remain focused
on its core competency of providing
high quality business recruitment
solutions in the professional services,
commerce and financial services
sectors. We will therefore continue to
operate our recruitment, training and
development programmes so as to
enable us to continue to attract and
retain the best talent available and
maintain an above-average staff
retention rate. I look forward to the year
ahead with confidence as we build on
previous achievements, expand our
global capabilities and target higher
returns to all stakeholders.

Accounting convention and policies
The financial statements for 2006 have
been prepared for the last time under
United Kingdom Accounting Standards.
The interim results and the financial
statements for 2007 will be prepared
under International Financial Reporting
Standards, the impact of which is
discussed below.
The accounting policies are the same as
those in place for the year ended 31
December 2005, with the exception of
share-based payments to employees
which are now accounted for under FRS
20 (IFRS 2). Applying Black-Scholes
valuation models to the Group’ s share
option and equity incentive plans has
provided a fair value charge which in
accordance with FRS 20 has been added
to administrative expenses in each
financial year as highlighted on the
profit and loss account. There is no
effect on equity shareholders’ funds at
any balance sheet date and prior year
comparatives have been restated for
this change in accounting policy.
The directors have reconsidered the
presentation of the shares to be issued
in respect of deferred consideration in
light of the presentation requirements
of FRS 25. These shares were previously
included as part of Shareholders’ equity
but now form part of provision for
liabilities and charges. The effect on the
financial statements for the year ended
31 December 2005, in both the
consolidated and Company balance
sheets, is to decrease Shareholders’
equity by £1,721,000 and increase
provisions for liabilities and charges
by the same amount. There has been
no effect on the profit for the year
ended 31 December 2005 as a result
of this adjustment.
Results
2006 was a very successful year with all
regions and brands (both ongoing and
acquired) delivering strong growth.
Turnover for the year, which was £80.1
million (46.2% higher than 2005), was
wholly derived from recruitment
activities, including search and
selection, contingency recruitment,
temporary placements and contract
fees, as well as ancillary services such as
recharged advertising costs. It includes
the remuneration cost of contract
candidates and the total cost of
advertising recharged to clients.
Turnover from temporary placements
and contract fees was £43.5 million
(2005 – £28.1 million) and represented
54.4% (2005 – 51.2%) of Group turnover.
Turnover from permanent placements
(retained and contingent) was £36.6
million (2005 – £26.5 million) and
represented 45.6% (2005 – 48.8%) of
Group turnover. Turnover grew by 8.6%
(2005 – 50%) in the second half of the
year, which generated 52% of the
annual total (2005 – 60%).
Gross profit (net fee income) for the
year increased by 41% to £44.9 million
(2005 – £31.8 million). This represents a
gross margin of 56.0% (2005 – 58.1%),
the variance from the previous year
predominantly being explained by the
inclusion of Morgan McKinley, which
has a significant temporary placements
business, in the Group results for a full
12 months. Gross profit from temporary
placements and contract fees was £8.9
million (2005 – £5.6 million) and
represented 19.8% (2005 – 17.5%) of
Group gross profit. On temporary
placements, the gross margin was
20.4% (2005 – 19.9%).
Operating profit
2
for the year increased
by 64.1% to £11.6 million (2005 – £7.1
million), representing an operating
margin (being the conversion rate of
net fee income into operating profit
2
) of
25.8% (2005 – 22.2%). £4.2 million (2005
– £3.0 million) was generated from the
Group’ s organic businesses, at a margin
of 24.1% (2005 – 23.3%) and the balance
was generated from acquisitions in 2005
and 2006, at a margin of 27.0%. The
operating profit from the organic
businesses was achieved after
significant further investment in
headcount across a variety of our
operating functions throughout 2006.
The Group has recognised a £1.8
million charge for amortisation on the
gross cost of goodwill of £36.8 million
which arose on the acquisitions of
ECHM, Morgan McKinley, Accreate and
the Ingram Consultancy. The Group has
also provided for £0.4 million of
exceptional costs resulting from a
decision taken late in 2006 to collocate
ECHM, Morgan McKinley and the
Group’ s common back office functions
in the same London office (the costs
equate to an onerous lease provision on
ECHM’ s current London premises
which the Group now plans to sub-let).
After these items, operating profit
for the year was £9.1 million
(2005 – £4.4 million).
Net interest payable during the year was
£40,000 (2005 – £85,000 net interest
receivable). This was comprised of
non-utilisation fees, interest and
amortisation of the arrangement fee on
the Group’ s £7.5 million revolving credit
facility, offset by interest receivable on
rental deposits and bank interest, as
well as interest receivable and payable
on the Group’ s loan note deposits and
matching liabilities.
T ax on profits amounted to £2.4 million
(2005 – £1.8 million), representing an
effective tax rate of 22.1% (2005 – 31.8%)
on profit before amortisation of
goodwill (which is not deductible). The
effective rate was significantly lower in
2006 mainly due to statutory relief
available in the United Kingdom on the
exercise of share options by employees
and an increased proportion of profits
arising in foreign operations with lower
tax rates. The rate has also benefited
slightly from the utilisation and
recognition of tax losses from previous
years (not all of which had been
recognised in the deferred tax balance
at 31 December 2005).
In 2006, basic earnings per share were
18.2p (2005 – 7.9p) and were 23.8p
(2005 – 14.8p) after adjusting for
amortisation of goodwill and
exceptional costs. Adjusted diluted
earnings per share (after tax but before
amortisation of goodwill and
exceptional costs) were 22.3p (2005 –
13.5p). The weighted average number of
shares for the year increased to 36.79
million (2005 – 32.38 million), following
the issue of 1.07 million shares at
various stages during the year related to
the acquisitions of Accreate and the
Ingram Consultancy and the exercise of
share options as described in note 17 to
the financial statements. The Company
ended the year with 37.30 million
shares in issue.
As outlined in the Chairman’ s
Statement, Imprint has announced
its intention to declare a final dividend
of 2.6p per share in respect of 2006
(2005 – maiden dividend of 2.0p). This
dividend will be paid on 18 May 2007 to
those shareholders on the register at 20
April 2007.

Financial position and cash flow
The financial position of the business
remains tightly controlled. The Group’ s
balance sheet has strengthened during
the year. At 31 December 2006 net
assets amounted to £48.6 million (2005
– £42.6 million), including cash and
short-term deposits of £4.3 million
(2005 – £3.2 million). The increase in
net assets predominantly relates to the
profit of £6.7 million and the issue of
shares with a value of £1.0 million,
offset by dividends paid to shareholders
amounting to £1.2 million. The Group
also has a £7.5 million revolving credit
facility which can be used for working
capital requirements or for acquisitions.
In line with increased trading volumes,
the Group’ s working capital expanded
during the year. Trade debtors at 31
December 2006 amounted to £13.4
million (2005 – £9.9 million), which was
48 days sales (2005 – 45 days). Accrued
income (uninvoiced revenue)
amounted to £4.6 million (2005 –
£3.8 million).
Cash generated in 2006 was
£1.1 million (2005 – £0.7 million),
including generation of £7.7 million
(2005 – £4.3 million) from operating
activities and a net £0.1 million (2005 –
£26.9 million) from share issues. £2.2
million of funds generated were spent
on acquisitions (2005 – £30.1 million)
and £0.9 million (2005 – £0.5 million)
on capital expenditure. T ax paid was
£2.3m (2005 – £nil) and dividends were
paid to shareholders amounting to £1.2
million (2005 – £nil). Cash surpluses
are invested where practical in short-
term deposits.
The main functional currencies of the
Group are Sterling, Euro, US Dollar,
Hong Kong Dollar, Japanese Yen and
Singapore Dollar. The Group does not
have material transactional currency
exposures nor is there a material
exposure to foreign-denominated
monetary assets and liabilities. The
Group is exposed to foreign currency
translation differences in accounting for
its overseas operations although our
policy is not to hedge this exposure.
International Financial Reporting
Standards (“IFRS”)
The Group is required to prepare its
reported financial statements under
IFRS for the year ending 31 December
2007. Consequently, Imprint will adopt
IFRS in its consolidated financial
statements from 1 January 2007, with
the first reported results under IFRS
being our interim statement later
this year.
During 2006 we reviewed the impact of
adopting IFRS both on the Group’ s
financial statements and the
methodologies used for recording
financial and related information.
The following areas that will have a
material impact on the Group’ s
financial statements have been
identified. This summary is not
intended to be comprehensive.
• Goodwill amortisation – under UK
GAAP , the Group’ s policy is to
amortise capitalised goodwill
resulting from any post-balance
sheet acquisitions on a straight-line
basis over its estimated useful
economic life. On transition to IFRS,
IFRS 1 “First-time Adoption of
International Financial Reporting
Standards” requires the Group to
review the carrying value of
capitalised goodwill for potential
impairment. Furthermore, in
accordance with IFRS 3 “Business
Combinations” , amortisation of
goodwill will no longer be charged
in the Group’ s consolidated profit
and loss account. Under IFRS,
instead of an annual charge to
the profit and loss account, an
impairment review will be carried
out at each balance sheet date, and
this is required irrespective of there
being an indicator of impairment
in existence. If impairment is
identified, a charge will result in
the profit and loss account.
• Intangible assets arising on
acquisitions – with the adoption of
IFRS 3 and IAS 38 “Intangible Assets” ,
separately identifiable intangible
assets acquired as part of
acquisitions from 1 January 2006
will be recognised at their fair value,
separately from goodwill.
• Fixed assets – under IFRS the
Group’ s computer software will need
to be reclassified from tangible fixed
assets to intangible fixed assets.

Directors Imprint Plc | Remuneration committee’ s report
Group report and accounts 2006 | 13
The Committee consists of John
Gordon (Chairman) and Pierce Casey.
Neither member of the Committee has
any conflict of interests arising from
cross-directorships.
Objectives and remuneration policy
The main aim of the Committee is
to attract, retain and motivate high
calibre individuals with a competitive
package of remuneration comprising
basic salary, incentives and rewards
which are linked to the overall
performance of the Group but also
recognise individual performance and
responsibility. In addition to individual
performance, reference is made to pay
levels in companies of similar size and
to suggestions of appropriate external
remuneration consultants.
The Board believes that the total
remuneration package aligns the
executive directors’ interests with
those of the shareholders and gives
these individuals keen incentives to
perform at the highest levels.
This report should be read in
conjunction with note 4 to the financial
statements and the disclosures made in
the Report of the Directors from pages
16 to 18 regarding information specified
by law on directors’ remuneration and
transactions with the Group, which
give full details of all elements in the
remuneration package of each director
and details of directors’ share interests
and share options.

Imprint Plc | Corporate governance report
The directors recognise the value of the
Principles of Good Governance and
Code of Best Practice (the “Combined
Code”) and, although as an AIM listed
company it is not required to comply
with the Combined Code, Imprint is
taking appropriate measures to ensure
that the Group adopts those principles
of the Combined Code that it considers
appropriate for a group of its size.
This statement describes the principles
identified in the Combined Code which
are being applied.
Board composition
The Board of Directors currently
comprises four executive and two non-
executive directors, with the roles of
Chairman and Chief Executive
separated. The Board meets at least
eight times per annum and additionally
where necessary . The Board has
responsibility for the overseeing of all
day to day matters of the Company but
it has specific responsibility for
reviewing trading performance,
resources (including key
appointments), standards of conduct,
ensuring adequate funding, setting and
monitoring strategy, examining major
acquisition possibilities and reporting
to shareholders. The non-executive
directors have a responsibility to ensure
that the strategies proposed by the
executive directors are fully considered
and to bring their judgement to bear in
this role. T o enable the Board to
discharge its duties, all directors receive
appropriate and timely information
from the management of the Group.
However, all directors are free to and
regularly make further inquiries where
they feel it necessary . The directors are
able to take independent professional
advice as required.
Audit committee
The Audit Committee comprises John
Gordon (Chairman) and Pierce Casey,
both of whom are non-executive
directors, and meets formally not less
than twice a year. The Committee
determines the terms of engagement of
the Company’ s auditors, in consultation
with the auditors, reviews the scope of
the Company’ s audit and reviews
reports from management and the
Company’ s auditors relating to interim
and annual financial statements and
accounting controls throughout the
Company and its subsidiaries. The
Committee has unlimited access to
the Company’ s auditors.
Remuneration committee
The Remuneration Committee
comprises John Gordon (Chairman)
and Pierce Casey and meets formally
not less than twice a year. The
Remuneration Committee has written
terms of reference and determines on
behalf of the Board the remuneration
and benefits of the executive directors
of the Company and ratifies proposals
made by executive directors in respect
of the remuneration and benefits of
selected senior managers in the Group.
In formulating its remuneration policy,
the Remuneration Committee gives full
consideration to matters set out in
Schedule A to the Combined Code.
The non-executive directors do not
have service contracts, but letters of
appointment with the Company . The
Board as a whole determines the level
of fees of non-executive directors, after
taking into account fees payable by
comparable companies and/or outside
advice. Details of fees paid to non-
executive directors are set out in note 4
to the financial statements. The Board
considers that John Gordon is an
independent director as that expression
is used in the Combined Code.
Internal financial control
The directors are responsible for the
Group’s system of internal financial
control. Although no system of
internal financial control can provide
absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss, the Group’s
system is designed to provide the
directors with reasonable assurance
that problems are identified on a
timely basis and dealt with
appropriately. Key procedures that
have been established and are
designed to provide effective internal
financial control are described below:
Financial reporting
The budget is approved each year by
the Board in the light of the Group’ s
strategic plan. Key risk areas are
identified. Performance is monitored
and relevant action taken throughout
the year through the regular reporting
to the Board of any variances from the
budget and updated forecasts for the
year together with information on the
key risk areas.
Control of operations
Control of operations is primarily
affected by day to day supervision. The
integrity and competence of personnel
is ensured through high recruitment
standards and appropriate training and
professional development. High quality
personnel are seen as an essential part
of the budgetary process and
authorisation levels. For expenditure
beyond specified levels, detailed
written proposals have to be submitted
to the Board. The Group has a team to
deal with acquisition opportunities and
carry out, in conjunction with the
Group’ s external advisers, all necessary
due diligence work.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the directors
have a reasonable expectation that
the Group has adequate resources to
continue in operational existence for
the foreseeable future. For this reason,
they continue to adopt the going
concern basis in preparing the
financial statements.
Relations with shareholders
Communication with shareholders is
given high priority . The Chairman’ s
Statement, Chief Executive’ s Review
and Financial Review on pages 2 to 11
include a detailed review of the
business and future prospects. There is
regular dialogue with shareholders
including presentations after the
Group’ s preliminary announcement of
the year-end and half-year results.
Copies of the Annual Reports, Interim
Reports and Analysts’ Presentations are
available on the Group’ s website
www.imprintplc.com.
The Board welcomes shareholder
participation at the Annual General
Meeting and aims to ensure that the
Chairman of the Audit and
Remuneration Committees is available
to answer questions. Details of
resolutions to be proposed at the
Annual General Meeting on 19 April
2007 can be found in the Notice of the
Meeting on page 49.

Results and dividends
The results of the Group for the year
are set out on page 21 and show a

£6.7 million (2005 – £2.6 million). The
directors propose a dividend of 2.6p

2.0p). This dividend will be paid on 18
May 2007 to those shareholders on
the register at 20 April 2007.
Principal activities, review of
business and future developments
The Group’s principal activity is the
provision of a diverse range of
international recruitment services
across various functional specialisms
to blue-chip clients, from contingency
to search, support to board level,
across multiple industries and
locations. The Group comprises six
trading brands: Accreate, ECHM, iQ
selection, Imprint Search & Selection,
Morgan McKinley and WoodHamill.
Acquisition of the Ingram Consultancy
On 19 July 2006, Imprint acquired
the Ingram Consultancy, one of the
United Arab Emirates’ leading
recruitment businesses, for initial
consideration of £1.2 million and a
further potential £3.8 million,
contingent upon the profits of the
business in the year ended 31
December 2006 and the years ending
31 December 2007 and 2008. This
acquisition has provided Imprint with
a strategic entry point into the high
growth Dubai and Gulf Cooperative
Community markets and has further
broadened the scope of the services
we offer to our commercial and
financial services clients.
This acquisition was funded by cash
of £900,000 and the issue of 0.12
million new ordinary shares to the
consultancy’s vendor. The contingent
consideration is payable in a
combination of cash and new
ordinary shares.
The Ingram Consultancy trades
as two businesses, iQ selection,
which provides contingent
recruitment services in the region,
and an executive search business
which has recently been rebranded
as WoodHamill Ingram to reflect
the international talent search
capabilities which the Group can now
provide in this geographical region.
The directors are pleased with the
results for the year. A review of the
Group’s performance during the
year is contained in the Chairman’s
Statement, Chief Executive’s Review
and Financial Review on pages 2
to 11. The Group’s financial risk
management objectives and policies
are discussed in the Financial Review
on pages 10 and 11, and in note 22 to
the financial statements.
The year to 31 December 2007 has
started well and the Board remains
optimistic about the prospects for
the full year.
Charitable and political
contributions
Charitable donations totalling
£800 were paid during the year
(2005 – £3,500). There were no
political donations.
Policy on the payment of creditors
The Group’s payment terms and
conditions with individual suppliers
vary according to the commercial
relationship and the terms of the
agreements reached. It is the policy
of the Group that payments to
suppliers are made in accordance
with the terms agreed. The average
number of days’ purchases included
within trade creditors at the year-end
was 41 (2005 – 44).
Employment policy
The Group continues to give full
and fair consideration to applications
for employment made by disabled
persons, having regard to their
respective aptitudes and abilities.
The Group has a policy of employee
involvement by making information
available to employees on matters of
concern to them. Many employees are
stakeholders in the business through
participation in share option schemes.
Principal risks and uncertainties
Like all staffing businesses, the Group
remains sensitive to the welfare of
the broader economy. Any sustained
downturn will inevitably affect
business performance. Visibility on
future revenues is limited. In addition,
competition for business is always
intense and margins and pricing
could come under pressure if there
is a slowing in demand.
The risks relating to financial
instruments are considered in detail
in note 22.

confirms that:
• To the best of each director’s
knowledge and belief, there is no
information relevant to the
preparation of their report of
which the company’s auditors are
unaware; and
• Each director has taken all the
steps a director might reasonably
be expected to have taken to be
aware of relevant audit
information and to establish that
the company’s auditors are aware
of that information.
Auditors
A resolution to re-appoint Ernst
& Young LLP as auditors will be
put to members at the Annual
General Meeting.

Statement of directors’
responsibilities
The directors are responsible for
preparing the Annual Report and the
financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to
prepare financial statements for each
financial year. Under that law the
directors have elected to prepare the
financial statements in accordance with
United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom
Accounting Standards and applicable
law). The financial statements are
required by law to give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the
company and of the group and of the
profit or loss of the group for that
period. In preparing these financial
statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies
and then apply them consistently;
• make judgments and estimates that
are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable UK
Accounting Standards have been
followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained
in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on
the going concern basis unless it is
inappropriate to presume that the
company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for
keeping proper accounting records

Imprint Plc | Independent auditors’ report
We have audited the group and parent
company financial statements (the
“financial statements”) of Imprint Plc
for the year ended 31 December 2006
which comprise Consolidated Profit
and Loss Account, the Consolidated
and Company Balance Sheets, the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows,
the Consolidated Statement of T otal
Recognised Gains and Losses, the
Consolidated Reconciliation of
Movements in Shareholders’ Funds
and the related notes 1 to 23. These
financial statements have been
prepared under the accounting policies
set out therein.
This report is made solely to the
company’ s members, as a body, in
accordance with Section 235 of the
Companies Act 1985. Our audit work
has been undertaken so that we might
state to the company’ s members those
matters we are required to state to
them in an auditors’ report and for no
other purpose. T o the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or
assume responsibility to anyone other
than the company and the company’ s
members as a body, for our audit work,
for this report, or for the opinions we
have formed.
Respective responsibilities of
directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for
preparing the Annual Report and the
financial statements in accordance
with applicable United Kingdom law
and Accounting Standards (United
Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice) are set out in the
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the
financial statements in accordance
with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to
whether the financial statements give
a true and fair view and are properly
prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985. We also report
to you whether in our opinion the
information given in the directors’
report is consistent with the
financial statements.
In addition we report to you if, in our
opinion, the company has not kept
proper accounting records, if we have
not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit,
or if information specified by law
regarding directors’ remuneration and
other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information
contained in the Annual Report,
and consider whether it is consistent
with the audited financial statements.
This other information comprises
only Highlights, Chairman’ s Statement,
the Chief Executive’ s Review, the
Company Overviews, the Financial
Review, the Directors’ Profiles, the
Remuneration Committee’ s Report,
the Corporate Governance Report,
the Directors’ Report and Notice of
Annual General Meeting. We consider
the implications for our report if
we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the financial
statements. Our responsibilities do not
extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance
with International Standards on
Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the
Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis,
of evidence relevant to the amounts
and disclosures in the financial
statements. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates
and judgments made by the directors
in the preparation of the financial
statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to
the group’ s and company’ s
circumstances, consistently applied
and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit
so as to obtain all the information and
explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with
sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements
are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our
opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of
information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true
and fair view, in accordance with
United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice, of the state of
the group’ s and the parent
company’ s affairs as at 31 December
2006 and of the group’ s profit for the
year then ended;
• the financial statements have been
properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985; and
• the information given in the
directors’ report is consistent with
the financial statements.

1. The maintenance and integrity of the Imprint Plc website is the responsibility of the directors; the work carried
out by the auditors does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no
responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially presented
on the website.

1. Accounting policies
Accounting convention
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable
United Kingdom accounting standards.
The accounting policies are the same as those set out in the financial statements of the Group for the year ended
31 December 2005, with the exception of share-based payments to employees which are now accounted for under
FRS 20 (IFRS 2), as described further in note 17. Applying Black-Scholes valuation models to the Group’ s share
option plans provides a fair value charge which in accordance with FRS 20 has been added to administrative
expenses in each accounting period as highlighted on the profit and loss account. There is no effect on equity
shareholders’ funds at any balance sheet date.
The directors have reconsidered the presentation of the shares to be issued in respect of deferred consideration in
light of the presentation requirements of FRS 25. These shares were previously included as part of Shareholders’
equity but now form part of provision for liabilities and charges. The effect on the financial statements for the year
ended 31 December 2005, in both the consolidated and Company balance sheets, is to decrease Shareholders’
equity by £1,721,000 and increase provisions for liabilities and charges by the same amount. There has been no
effect on the profit for the year ended 31 December 2005 as a result of this adjustment.
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Imprint Plc and its subsidiary
undertakings drawn up to 31 December each year. No profit and loss account is presented for the Company as
permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
Goodwill
Positive goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised, classified as an asset on the balance sheet and amortised
on a straight line basis over its useful economic life up to a presumed maximum of 20 years. It is reviewed for
impairment at the end of the first full financial year following the acquisition and in other periods if events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Fixed asset investments
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost. The carrying value is reviewed for impairment periodically for
events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual
value, of each asset evenly over its expected useful life, as follows:
Furniture, fixtures and fittings, and office equipment – 25% per annum
Computer equipment – 25% – 50% per annum
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment periodically for events or changes in
circumstances that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Turnover
Turnover is stated net of value added tax and represents amounts derived from the provision of services to third
parties in respect of the Group’ s continuing activity as stated in the directors’ report, consisting of:
• turnover from permanent placements, which is recognised at the date an offer is accepted by a candidate and
a start date is determined, and
• turnover from temporary placements, which represents amounts billed for the services of temporary staff.
Turnover not invoiced at the balance sheet date is included within accrued income.

1. Accounting policies (continued)
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed at the
balance sheet date, in respect of transactions or events that have occurred at that date that will result in an
obligation to pay more, or right to pay less, tax, with the following exceptions:
• provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of subsidiaries only
to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable; and
• deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not
that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences
can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the years in which
timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currencies
Company
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance
sheet date. All differences are taken to the profit and loss account with the exception of differences on foreign
currency borrowings, to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against foreign equity
investments, which are taken directly to reserves together with the exchange difference on the carrying amount of
the related investments. T ax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on those borrowings are also
dealt with in reserves.
Group
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the
balance sheet date. Income and expenses are translated at weighted average exchange rates for the year. The
resulting exchange differences are taken directly to reserves.
All other translation differences are taken to the profit and loss account with the exception of differences on
foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against group equity
investments in foreign enterprises, which are taken directly to reserves together with the exchange difference on
the net investment in these enterprises. T ax charges and credits to exchange differences on those borrowings are
also dealt with in reserves.
Leasing
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to income on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Pensions
The Group has stakeholder pension schemes available for employees and also makes defined contributions
directly to employees’ personal pension plans. Contributions are charged to the profit and loss account as they
become payable.
Classification of shares as debt or equity
An equity instrument is a contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of any entity after deducting all
its liabilities. Accordingly, a financial instrument is treated as equity if:
(i) there is no contractual obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or
liabilities on terms that may be unfavourable: and
(ii)the instrument is a non-derivative that contains no contractual obligations to deliver a variable number of
shares or is a derivative that will be settled only by the Group exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other assets for
a fixed number of the Group’ s own equity instruments. 28 | Group report and accounts 2006
1. Accounting policies (continued)
Share-based payments
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees, for awards granted after 7 November 2002, is measured by
reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted. The fair value is determined by an external valuer
using an appropriate pricing model, further details of which are given in note 17.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the
period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant
employees become fully entitled to the award (‘the vesting date'). The cumulative expense recognised for equity-
settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has
expired and the Group's best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The income
statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the
beginning and end of that period.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings
per share.

Related to the acquisition of Accreate Limited, the Company issued 208,842 ordinary shares with an aggregate
nominal value of £2,088 to the vendors of Accreate for a total non-cash consideration of £621,375 (e900,000).
Related to the acquisition of Ingram Consultancy Limited, on 19 July 2006, the Company issued 115,924 ordinary
shares with an aggregate nominal value of £1,159 to the vendor of Ingram Consultancy Limited for a total non-
cash consideration of £300,000.
During the year the Company also issued 747,100 ordinary shares with an aggregate nominal value of £7,471 to
holders of options over the Company’ s ordinary shares (who were entitled under the rules of the Company’ s share
option schemes to exercise their options) for a total cash consideration of £77,546.
Employee share option schemes
The Company operates three share option schemes, under which options to subscribe for the Company’ s ordinary
shares of 1p each have been awarded to certain employees (“Optionholders”). These are an Employee
Management Incentive Scheme (“EMI”), an Inland Revenue approved scheme (“ Approved”), and an unapproved
scheme (“Unapproved”).
Under the EMI scheme, the vesting period ranges from 3 to 5 years and the vesting of certain grants to
Optionholders are also subject to the achievement of specific performance criteria over this period. Under the
approved and unapproved schemes, the vesting period is 3 years.
Under all three schemes, Options are forfeited if they remain unexercised after a period of more than 10 years
from the date of grant. Options are also forfeited if the Optionholder ceases to hold office with a Group member
before the options vest, with certain exceptions (“good leaver” provisions). Options vest and become exercisable
in the event of a takeover or reconstruction of the Group. All options are non-transferable and there are no cash
settlement alternatives.

For the share options outstanding under all three schemes at 31 December 2006, the weighted average remaining
contractual life is 7.88 years (2005 – 7.73 years).
Other equity incentives
In addition to the share option schemes, the Group has a complementary incentivisation plan for a limited
number of key employees (the ‘‘Plan’’). The Plan enables relevant personnel to participate in any increase in
shareholder value over a specified period, thereby aligning their interests with those of shareholders.
Under the arrangements, the Company has set up an offshore employee benefit trust (the “Imprint Plc Employee
Benefit Trust” or “EBT”) for the benefit of present and future employees of the Company. The Company has
granted options over new ordinary shares to the EBT , for onward grant to employees, which become exercisable
upon a predetermined event, such exercise price to be met from the sale of the ordinary shares under option.
The independent trustees of the EBT have discretion over how any funds held by the EBT are used, although
consideration is given by the trustees to the wishes of the beneficiaries, and to suggestions made by the Company
as to allocation of the EBT funds. The Company cannot benefit from any funds held in the EBT .
During the year the trustees awarded equity interests over ordinary Imprint shares already under option (“Equity
Interests”) following awards of options by the Company to the EBT . These interests vest on the earlier of:
• the occurrence of an offer for the issued ordinary share capital of the Company which is made on a condition
such that if satisfied, the person or persons making the offer will have control of the Company;
• the making of a resolution for the voluntary winding up of the Company; or
• the making of a winding up order of the Company by the Court.

None of the Equity Interests had vested at 31 December 2006 or 31 December 2005. The range of exercise prices for
Equity Interests outstanding at the end of the year was 284 pence to 300 pence (2005 – 284 pence to 287 pence).
Fair value of equity instruments
The fair value of equity-settled share options granted and the Equity Interests are estimated as at the date of grant
using a Black-Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options or interests
were granted. There are no market conditions which need to be taken into account in measuring the fair value of
share options or Equity Interests. Furthermore, all options and interests are granted with an exercise price equal to
the market value of the shares under option at the date of grant. The following table lists the inputs to the model
used for the year ended 31 December 2006 and the year ended 31 December 2005.
2006 2005
Dividend yield (%) 2.0 2.0
Expected share price volatility (%) 30.4 30.4
Risk-free interest rate (%) 4.31 4.32
Liquidity discount (%) 2.0 – 15.0 2.0 – 15.0
Expected life (years):

– Unapproved share options 3.5 – 6.5 3.5 – 6.5
– Equity Interests within the Plan 5.0 5.0
The expected lives are based on the Group’ s best estimate and are not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns
that might occur. The expected volatility has been calculated by reference to the historical volatility of Imprint Plc
shares since its incorporation in 2001 and by comparison to the volatility of similar listed entities for which share
price information is available.
The expense recognised in the profit and loss account for share-based payments and the corresponding
movement within reserves during the period to 31 December 2006 is £280,000 (2005 – £175,000). 42 | Group report and accounts 2006

There are no related party transactions requiring disclosure in 2006.
During the year ended 31 December 2005 the Group paid £10,000 to Adelaide Capital Corporation Limited, a
company based in Ireland of which Pierce Casey is a director, for advisory services related to the acquisition of
Accreate Limited. These services were paid for by the Company. There were no balances outstanding in respect
of this transaction at the year end.
22. Financial instruments
Treasury policies and nature of financial instruments held
The Group operates treasury policies, which include the ongoing assessment of interest rate management. Cash
surpluses are invested in short-term deposits. The Group’ s liquidity objective is to maintain a balance between
continuity of funding and flexibility. The Board approves all decisions on treasury policy.
The Group’ s principal financial instruments comprise cash, short-term deposits, loan note deposits, loan notes
payable, contingent consideration and a revolving credit facility (not utilised at 31 December 2006 nor 31
December 2005). The main purpose of these instruments is to finance the Group’ s operations and acquisitions.
The Group has other financial instruments, such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its
operations. The Group does not trade financial instruments, nor hedge its financial exposures.
Cash and deposits
The cash and short-term deposits balance at 31 December 2006 was £4,307,000 (2005 – £3,169,000), which
comprised current account balances of £3,820,000 (2005 – £2,631,000) and deposit account balances of £487,000
(2005 – £538,000). These balances include amounts held in foreign currencies as listed in the table below. No
interest is earned on the current accounts. Interest is earned on both the deposit and call accounts at floating
interest rates. Surplus funds are held where practical in the call account to maximise interest income.
Rent deposits of £836,000 (2005 – £663,000) are owed to the Group, of which £546,000 earns interest at a floating
rate. There are no material differences between the book value and fair value of these instruments.

Revolving credit facility
The Company has a revolving credit facility available for use of up to £7.5m (2005 – £5.5m). Interest is currently
payable on advances made under the revolving credit facility at the rate of 1 per cent over LIBOR. The facility
expires on 30 April 2009. The Company has given security, covenants and warranties usual for a facility of this
nature, including a first and only debenture from each Group company and a composite guarantee by each Group
company in favour of the Group’ s bankers.
Loan notes
The loan note deposits are held in collateralised accounts guaranteed by the Group’ s bankers for the purposes of
settling the Group’ s outstanding loan note liabilities. Loan notes amounting to £854,000, previously deposited to
these collateralised accounts in relation to the acquisitions of ECHM and Morgan McKinley, were redeemed
during the course of the year. These were funded by equal and matching payments from the loan note deposit
accounts. At 31 December 2006 £453,000 (2005 – £1,307,000) was still held on deposit to fund the loan note
liabilities at that date. The Group earns and pays interest on the loan note deposits and loan notes at floating

Contingent consideration
At 31 December 2005 the Group had recognised contingent consideration relating to its acquisition of Accreate
Limited (refer note 23) amounting to £3,442,000 (e5,000,000). This balance represents further potential cash and
share consideration contingent upon the profits of Accreate in the years ending 31 December 2005, 31 December
2006 and 31 December 2007, up to a maximum in each year ofe1,600,000 (e1,800,000 in the first year). Any
additional consideration is payable within 90 days of each year end and is payable as to 50 per cent in cash and 50
per cent by the issue of new ordinary shares valued at the average closing mid market price for the seven trading
days prior to the date of payment (subject to a floor of £2.00 per share).
Of this balance, £1,239,000 (e1,800,000) was paid in March 2006 (50% in cash, 50% through the issue of new
ordinary shares), representing the maximum consideration payable in respect of profits achieved by Accreate for
the year ended 31 December 2005.
At 31 December 2006 the remaining maximum cash element of the contingent consideration, £1,077,000
(e1,600,000) and the maximum share element, £1,077,000 (e1,600,000) are disclosed within provisions for
liabilities and charges. Both elements are valued at their undiscounted amounts and in the directors’ opinion
there is no material difference between the book value and fair value of these instruments.
Foreign currencies
The main functional currencies of the Group are Sterling, Euro, US Dollar, Hong Kong Dollar, Japanese Yen,
Singapore Dollar and United Arab Emirates Dirham. The Group does not have material transactional currency
exposures nor is there a material exposure to foreign-denominated monetary assets and liabilities, because
exchange risks associated with revenues earned in foreign currencies are largely offset by operating costs arising in
the same currency. The Group is exposed to foreign currency translation differences in accounting for its overseas
operations although the Group’ s policy is not to hedge this exposure.

23. Acquisitions

Notice is hereby given that the Annual General Meeting of Imprint Plc (the “Company”) will be held at 2 Sheraton
Street, London W1F 8BH on 19 April 2007 at 10.00am for the purpose of considering and, if thought fit, passing the
following resolutions which will be proposed, in the case of resolutions 1 to 5 as ordinary resolutions and, in the
case of resolution 6, as a special resolution:
Ordinary resolutions
1. T o receive and adopt the financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2006 and the
reports of the directors and auditors thereon.
2. T o approve a final dividend in respect of 2006.
3. T o re-appoint Ernst and Young LLP as auditors to the Company.
4. T o authorise the directors to fix the auditors’ remuneration.

thereto, to generally and unconditionally authorise the directors pursuant to and in accordance with section 80
of the Companies Act 1985 (as amended) (the “Act”) to exercise all the powers of the Company to allot relevant
securities (as defined in section 80(2) of the Act) up to an aggregate nominal amount of £124,390 for a period
expiring (unless previously renewed, revoked or varied by the Company in general meeting) on the earlier of
the date falling 15 months after the passing of this resolution and the conclusion of the annual general meeting
of the Company to be held in 2008 provided that the Company may make an offer or agreement before the
expiry of such authority which would or might require relevant securities to be allotted after the expiry of such
authority and the directors may allot relevant securities in pursuance of that offer or agreement as if the power
conferred hereby had not expired.
Special resolution
6. In substitution for and to the exclusion of the authority conferred upon the directors by special resolution
passed on 10 May 2006 but without prejudice to the allotment of any equity securities already made pursuant
thereto, to empower the directors in accordance with section 95 of the Act to allot equity securities of the
Company (within the meaning of section 94(2) of the Act) pursuant to the authority referred to in, and
conferred by, resolution 5 above as if section 89(1) of the Act did not apply to the allotment, provided that

or other arrangements in connection with the offer as they deem necessary or expedient to deal with
equity securities representing fractional entitlements and legal or practical problems under the laws of,
or the requirements of, any recognised regulatory body or any stock exchange in any territory; and
(ii)(otherwise than pursuant to sub-paragraph (b)(i) above) up to an aggregate nominal amount of £18,658.

Notice of annual
general meeting 50 | Group report and accounts 2006
Notes:
1. The directors believe that passing resolutions 5 and 6 is in the best interests of the Company and its
shareholders and will give the directors flexibility in administering the business of the Company in the year
ahead. Accordingly, while the directors have no present intention of exercising such authorities they
unanimously recommend that shareholders vote in favour of them. Resolutions 5 and 6 and the limits on the
authorities contained therein are consistent with the current recommendations of the Investment Committees
of the Association of British Insurers and the National Association of Pension Funds generally adhered to by
public companies and are intended to ensure that the interests of existing shareholders are protected.
2. A corporation which is a member of the Company may, by resolution of its directors, authorise such person
as it thinks fit to act as its representative at the meeting.
3. A member of the Company who is entitled to attend and vote at the meeting may appoint one or more
proxies to attend and, on a poll, vote instead of him. Such proxy need not be a member of the Company.
4. The register of interests of the directors of the Company and their families, copies of the contracts of service
and letters of engagement of such directors and the existing Memorandum and Articles of Association of the
Company will be available for inspection at the registered office of the Company during normal business hours
(Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays excepted) from the date of this notice until the close of the meeting.
5. T o be valid the enclosed form of proxy, together with the power of attorney or other authority (if any) under
which it is signed or a notarially certified copy of such power of attorney or authority must be completed,
signed and received at the Proxy Processing Centre, T elford Road, Bicester OX26 4LD as soon as possible and in
any event by 3.00pm on 17 April 2007 (the “Specified Time’’). Appointment of a proxy will not preclude a
member from attending the meeting and voting in person should that member subsequently so decide.
6. In accordance with Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 (the “Regulations”), the
Company gives notice that only those members entered on the relevant register of members (the “Register”)
for certificated or uncertificated shares of the Company (as the case may be) at the Specified Time will be
entitled to attend and vote at the meeting in respect of the number of shares registered in their name at that
time. Changes to entries on the Register after the Specified Time will be disregarded in determining the rights
of any person to attend or vote at the meeting. Should the meeting be adjourned to a time not more than 48
hours after the Specified Time, that time will also apply for the purposes of determining the entitlement of
members to attend and vote (and for the purposes of determining the number of votes they may cast) at the
adjourned meeting. Should the meeting be adjourned for a longer period, then to be so entitled, members
must be entered on the Register at the time which is 48 hours before the time fixed for the adjourned meeting
or, if the Company gives notice of the adjourned meeting, at the time specified in such notice.
7. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment
service may do so for the meeting and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the procedures described in the
CREST Reference Manual (the “Manual”). CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members, and
those CREST members who have appointed voting service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or
voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate
CREST message (a “CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with
CRESTCo’ s specifications regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to
the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy and must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be
received by the Company’ s agent (IDRA10) by the Specified Time. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be
taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host)
from which the Company’ s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed
by CREST . After this time any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be
communicated to the appointee through other means.
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that
CRESTCo does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system
timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the
responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member
or sponsored member or has appointed voting service provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting
service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means
of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their
CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the Manual
concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation
35(5)(a) of the Regulations.

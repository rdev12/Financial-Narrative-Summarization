Following a fundamental review in 2011, 
led by new CEO Duncan Painter, we have 
realigned and optimised our portfolio of 
leading products and renewed focus was 
put into those products that could deliver 
long-term organic growth, particularly 
internationally. At the same time, we 
further professionalised our operations, 
re-established customers at the heart of 
our business and created world-class sales 
and marketing teams by investing in people 
and training, and systems. 
In 2012, the Group was restructured 
into agile operating companies with 
embedded expertise and new senior 
management teams, each empowered to 
make fast decisions that are right for their 
customers and respective businesses. 
A £37m transformation programme 
enabled us to invest in strong product 
and content creation, overhaul our 
technology and introduce new systems, 
including world class sales and marketing 
platforms. Once completed, the business 
had a platform from which to grow 
in key territories around the world. 
Since 2012, we have made six bolt-on 
acquisitions to either help us enter 
new industry sectors or geographies or 
provide us with new product capabilities 
to enhance our offering to our customers: 
CWIEME (2012), Educar (2013), 
Stylesight (2013), Mindset (2013), 
Money20/20 (2014) and RetailNet 
Group (2015). Additionally, we disposed 
of the following non-core assets: CAP 
Motor Research (2012), AME Info 
(2013), Infrastructure Journal (2013) 
and Media Business Insight (2015). 
In December 2015, we rebranded the 
Group as Ascential, signalling both the 
end to the turnaround phase and a 
clear future strategy and purpose. 
On 12 February 2016, Ascential plc 
listed on the main market of the London 
Stock Exchange. This marked a return 
to the market almost eight years to 
the month since delisting in 2008. 
Looking ahead, the Group aims to be 
the leading provider of exhibitions, 
festivals and digital information services, 
providing access to its products and 
services both online and offline wherever 
and whenever our customers want. 
In 2008, Ascential (then Emap) was acquired by funds advised by 
Apax Partners and Guardian Media Group following the  
sale of its consumer media and radio assets to Bauer Media.  
The Company was delisted from the London Stock Exchange  
on 20 March 2008.

STRATEGIC REPORT | GOVERNANCE | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
ASCENTIAL PLC — A REPORT OF THE YEAR 2015
Focused 
portfolio of  
market-leading 
products
23 of our 32 products occupy number one positions in their 
markets. These generated 84% of revenues and 93% of Adjusted 
EBITDA in 2015.
Self-reinforcing 
business 
models
Network effects in our leading products enable products to benefit 
from their market-leading positions by driving the best 
propositions, leading to more customers and enabling us to 
sub-segment and extend their propositions, thereby further 
enhancing the products’ market-leading positions.
At the heart of 
customer needs
A key pillar of our operations is a ‘customer first’ strategy.  
This puts customer needs at the heart of Group strategy with 
constant research and analytics to ensure product development 
meets or exceeds their expectations.
Disciplined 
operational 
approach and 
portfolio 
management
Relentless focus on sales and ‘retention first’ approach to 
customers underpins our growth. Significant investment has  
been put into sales training and customer management.  
The Group focuses on key growth products, with active 
management of its portfolio.
Strong track 
record of 
growth
On a constant currency basis, excluding the impact of 
acquisitions and disposals, Group revenues grew in 2013,  
2014 and 2015 by 7%, 7% and 6% respectively.
Clear organic 
growth strategy
The Group has multiple levers for growth underpinned by its 
‘retention first’ approach and through increasing the number of 
customers that buy our products and by seeking to upsell and 
cross-sell new products that we develop to our customer base. 
The Group has increased customer numbers in the Exhibitions & 
Festivals segment from 14,500 in 2012 to 17,500 in 2015,  
and across its subscription products from 8,500 in 2012 to  
9,200 in 2015. 
Strong margins 
and good cash 
generation
Through careful cost control and concentration of our cost base 
towards key products in each segment, the Group’s Adjusted 
EBITDA margin has grown from 27.3% in 2014 to 28.5% in 
2015. Our negative working capital profile, combined with 
modest capital expenditure requirements result in a high 
conversion of adjusted EBITDA to cash. In 2015, free cash  
flow conversion was 88%.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Following my appointment as Chairman in January 2016  
and our IPO in February 2016, I am very pleased to present 
my first report.
Group performance
The 2015 financial year was another 
successful one for Ascential, with revenue 
growing 6% on an Organic basis, Adjusted 
EBITDA up 14% to £90.9m, margins 
expanding from 27.3% to 28.5% and free 
cash flow conversion at 88%, up from 
80% in 2014. We are a retention-centric 
company and our priority is to grow 
the number of customers who choose 
to do business with us. The continued 
growth in customer numbers and the 
improved retention rates across the 
board are testament to these priorities. 
Strategic progress
During the year we continued to actively 
manage our portfolio of products. Several 
new products were launched driven by 
customer demand and feedback, including 
Lions Innovation, and other product lines 
were extended to new geographies. 
We made one small acquisition in June 
2015 when we welcomed RetailNet 
Group (“RNG”) to the Group. RNG is 
a US-based provider of retail analytics 
and executive education and is a great 
complement to our Planet Retail business. 
We also sold the Media Business 
Insight business in January 2015. 
We wish the business and its staff 
well under their new ownership.
Our admission to the London Stock 
Exchange on 12 February 2016 was a 
major milestone for the Company. The 
primary net proceeds raised from the IPO 
were used to reduce our net external debt 
to a level more appropriate for a publicly 
listed company. Time dedicated to our 
successful IPO, whilst also maintaining 
a relentless focus on delivering strong 
financial and operational results for 2015, 
is a real testament to the strength and 
depth of Ascential’s management team.

STRATEGIC REPORT | GOVERNANCE | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
ASCENTIAL PLC — A REPORT OF THE YEAR 2015
Our Board
Our Board is committed to the highest 
standards of corporate governance. 
The IPO presented an ideal opportunity 
to formally re-assess the skills and 
talents required for our Board as 
we embark on the next stage of our 
development as a public company.
Firstly, I am delighted that my predecessor 
Tom Hall (Apax), and David Pemsel 
(Guardian Media Group (“GMG”)), have 
each agreed to remain on the Board 
as Non-Executive Directors. We are 
grateful that we will continue to benefit 
from their experience and constructive 
engagement. I would also like to thank 
former Board members Frank Ehmer 
of Apax and Alan Hudson of GMG for 
their contribution over the past years 
of private company ownership.
The Company welcomed three 
independent Non-Executive Directors in 
January 2016 – Paul Harrison (who chairs 
the Audit Committee), Judy Vezmar (who 
chairs the Remuneration Committee) 
and Gillian Kent. I am confident that their 
broad range of both executive and non-
executive experience will prove invaluable 
and am delighted that we have been able 
to attract such talented candidates.
In addition to the Executive Directors, 
Duncan Painter, Chief Executive, 
and Mandy Gradden, Chief Financial 
Officer, we currently have six Non-
Executive Directors. Excluding me, 
three are considered independent 
under the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. We expect to make one more 
independent Non-Executive Director 
appointment in May. Assuming our 
expectations are realised, we will then 
be fully compliant with the Code. 
Dividend
Ascential plc was incorporated in January 
2016 and, as indicated at the time of 
the IPO, expects to pay its first dividend 
in respect of the 2016 financial results 
with one-third paid in November 2016 
and two-thirds paid in May 2017.
Outlook
The new financial year has started well. 
Since the year end, Spring Fair, Bett UK 
and Pure Spring have taken place and 
performed in line with our expectations. 
Preparations for Money20/20 Europe in 
April also continue to progress well. While 
still early in 2016, we are encouraged 
by the current level of forward bookings 
and are confident of another good 
year of growth for the Group.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to 
take this opportunity to thank all the 
employees and customers of Ascential 
for what has been a very successful year.

and Pure Spring have taken place and 
performed in line with our expectations. 
Preparations for Money20/20 Europe in 
April also continue to progress well. While 
still early in 2016, we are encouraged 
by the current level of forward bookings 
and are confident of another good 
year of growth for the Group.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to 
take this opportunity to thank all the 
employees and customers of Ascential 
for what has been a very successful year.

I am delighted to present the Group’s results for 2015. 
The year was a strong one and culminated in the 
successful IPO of the Group shortly after the year end.
Track record of growth, high margins and 
good cash generation
We delivered a strong operating 
performance in 2015 with a 6% Organic 
growth in revenue to £319.1m and a 
14% Organic growth in Adjusted EBITDA 
to £90.9m, with an expansion in margin 
from 27.3% in 2014 to 28.5% in 2015. 
We continued to generate good cash 
flow with free cash flow of £79.9m 
(2014: £68.3m) representing free cash 
conversion of 88% (2014: 80%).
Focused portfolio of 
market-leading products
We operate a focused portfolio of just 32 
product lines, 23 of which hold the 
number one position in their respective 
markets. We believe that our focus of 
management time on market-leading 
products is a key driver of our growth. We 
also focus most of our resources and time 
on our top products. All five of 2014’s top 
products performed well in 2015 but 
Groundsure grew faster than our leading 
education technology event, Bett, and 
entered the top five product list in 2015. 
The top products in 2015 were:
• In Information Services: WGSN 
and Groundsure
• In Exhibitions & Festivals: Cannes 
Lions, Spring and Autumn Fair and 
Money20/20.
Our top five products represented 53% of 
the Group’s 2015 revenue (2014: 49%) 
and 64% of its Adjusted EBITDA (2014: 
58%). Further details on the performance 
of each of the top products are given in the 
segmental analysis on pages 24–27.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW

STRATEGIC REPORT | GOVERNANCE | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
ASCENTIAL PLC — A REPORT OF THE YEAR 2015
Clear organic growth strategy
We have continued to deploy multiple 
initiatives for growth across our products 
with a clear aim of increasing both volumes 
of customers
1
 (up 3% in 2015) and average 
revenue per customer (up 5% in 2015).
The growth initiatives we deployed in 
2015 included the launch of new digital 
products (such as Retail Week Prospect), 
the embedding of auto-renewal across our 
subscriptions customers, geo-cloning of 
exhibitions (such as CWIEME Istanbul) 
and show extensions (such as Lions 
Innovation). These are each described in 
more detail on pages 1 and 26.
Diversified and recurring 
revenue streams
Revenue by type
The Group benefits from diverse revenue 
streams the majority of which have 
recurring characteristics. The most 
significant change over the last year has 
been an increase in events as a proportion 
of Group revenue, to 55% (2014: 53%), 
despite considerable currency headwinds 
for our largest event, Cannes Lions. Print 
advertising, by contrast, has reduced to 
just 4% (2014: 6%) of Group revenue. 
Revenue by geography
Continuing the theme of prior years, our 
share of revenue from overseas markets 
increased again in 2015 and now just 48% 
of revenues come from customers based 
in the UK (2014: 52%). The performance 
of Money20/20, WGSN and Cannes 
Lions has increased the revenues from 
the Americas to 21%, with Asia Pacific, 
Middle East and Africa, and other Europe 
contributing 9%, 6% and 15% respectively.
1 Customer volumes and average revenue per customer 
are measured for Exhibitions & Festivals and the 
subscription products within Information Services.
Disciplined operational approach
The foundation of our growth is, and will 
continue to be, our focus on customer 
retention – there is no better way to judge 
the quality of our products than to 
measure how many customers choose to 
renew their contracts with us each year, 
and we spend considerable time reviewing 
those customers who do churn. Retention 
rates have grown considerably across our 
top products and this key measure is also 
supplemented through the year by Net 
Promoter Scores and product usage 
statistics, both of which are growing well 
across the board.
We continued to adjust and optimise our 
portfolio of products. During 2015 we 
acquired RetailNet Group, a forecasting 
and analytics business in the retail space 
for a consideration of £5.1m (net of cash 
acquired). This acquisition strengthens our 
Planet Retail offering by adding dedicated 
US coverage, expansion of the combined 
products to provide further forecasting 
capabilities and new US clients. We 
also disposed of Media Business Insight 
(consisting of Screen International, 
Broadcast, shots and BRAD) to funds 
advised by Mobeus Equity Partners.
Outlook
The new financial year has started well. 
Since the year end, Spring Fair, Bett UK 
and Pure Spring have taken place and 
performed in line with our expectations. 
Preparations for Money20/20 Europe in 
April also continue to progress well. While 
still early in 2016, we are encouraged 
by the current level of forward bookings 
and are confident of another good 
year of growth for the Group.
Strategic priorities for 2016
Our strategy and priorities for 2016 are 
unchanged. Our growth plans will continue 
to be focused on customer retention and 
our top five product expansion plans. 
We are 100% focused on enabling further 
success for our customers so that we 
may continue ours. We will continue 
to find new ways to satisfy, retain and 
grow our customers through investment 
in product features and extensions, new 
product development, and initiatives such 
as auto-renewal, onsite rebooking and 
location-based pricing. We are excited 
about the opportunities for 2016.

We will continue to focus on  
our key products, creating more  
essential events and information 
services for our customers, thereby 
further expanding the number of 
companies that do business with us. 
STRATEGY SUMMARY
We intend to extend the market-leading 
positions of the Group’s products and 
deepen our coverage of customer needs 
through targeted product development.
Progress

• Launch of Retail Week Prospect
• Launch of new award categories at 
Cannes Lions
• Launch of Lions Health (2014) and 
Lions Innovation (2015)

• Upcoming launches to expand current 
portfolio include an improved WGSN 
Instock (March 2016) and Money20/20 
Europe (April 2016)
Extend product coverage
We will seek customer growth by increasing product 
penetration in our current markets, selling existing 
products to new customer types, extend sales and 
marketing of our products into new geographies 
and adjacent markets, and exploring new channels 
to market. We intend to increase average revenue 
per customer, by upselling products to our existing 
customers, cross-selling under-penetrated products 
into existing customer bases, and selectively 
optimising pricing and developing new products.
Progress
• On a constant currency basis, excluding 
the impact of acquisitions and disposals, 
Group revenues grew in 2013, 2014 and 
2015 by 7%, 7% and 6% respectively
• Selectively optimised pricing in 
Exhibitions & Festivals helped drive 
growth by aligning prices with customer 
value and return on investment
• New delegate propositions, including 
VIP packages, and new forms of 
sponsorship at Cannes Lions were 
introduced
• WGSN announced a JV with CTIC  
and entered into additional 
reseller agreements
Drive organic growth
To ensure our customers are connected and informed, 
we seek, where appropriate, to reinforce our digital 
products with face to face offerings, and vice versa. 
Our belief is that by building products and developing 
channels that deliver our content and expertise across 
both platforms, we will stay at the heart of customers’ 
needs and in turn ensure Ascential is a successful 
business for the long term.

Adjusted operating profit excludes the amortisation of acquired intangibles, impairment, exceptional items and share-based payments. 
Adjusted Profit before tax excludes these items, together with any gains or losses on disposal of businesses, and one-off items within 
net finance costs. The Adjusted taxation charge excludes the tax effect of the above items. Adjusted EBITDA is Adjusted operating 
profit before expensing depreciation. The commentary on Cash Flow sets out how Adjusted operating profit and the adjusted 
measure of cash generation Free Cash Flow reconcile to IFRS reported Net Cash Flow.

Revenue
Reported revenues in 2015 grew to £319.1m (2014: £312.7m), an increase of £6.4m. However, direct comparability was affected by 
the disposal of the MBI business in January 2015 (contributing £0.7m of revenue in 2015 and £11.1m in 2014), the acquisition of 
RetailNet Group in June 2015 (contributing £1.8m of revenue in 2015) and by movements in exchange rates between the two years 
(amounting to the £2.9m adverse impact as mentioned below).
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA (which excludes exceptional items and share-based payments) increased to £90.9m (2014: £85.3m) an increase of 
£5.6m on a reported basis and an expansion in Adjusted EBITDA margin of 1.2 percentage points to 28.5%.
The £5.6m growth in Adjusted EBITDA was impacted by the disposal of MBI (£2.6m reduction), the acquisition of RNG (£0.4m 
addition) and foreign currency translation (£3.3m adverse). Group Organic growth of £11.1m includes £5.4m from Exhibitions & 
Festivals and £5.6m from Information Services. On an Organic basis, Group Adjusted EBITDA grew at 14.0%, with Exhibitions & 
Festivals growing at 10.5% and Information Services growing at 15.4%.
Foreign currency translation impact
The Group’s reported performance is sensitive to movements in both the euro and US dollar against pounds sterling.
In 2015 the Group received approximately 20% (2014: 21%) of its revenue, incurred 9% (2014: 10%) of its costs and generated 49% 
(2014: 50%) of its Adjusted EBITDA in euros. Each 1% movement in the euro to pounds sterling exchange rate has a circa £0.6m 
(2014: £0.6m) impact on revenue and a circa £0.4m (2014: £0.4m) impact on Adjusted EBITDA.
In 2015 the Group received approximately 20% (2014: 19%) of its revenue, incurred 17% (2014: 16%) of its costs and generated 
30% (2014: 26%) of its Adjusted EBITDA in US dollars. Each 1% movement in the US dollar to pounds sterling exchange rate has a 
circa £0.7m (2014: £0.6m) impact on revenue and a circa £0.3m (2014: £0.2m) impact on Adjusted EBITDA.
The weighted average and closing exchange rates for euros and US dollars were as follows:

Euro 1.40 1.22 1.36 1.28
US dollar 1.53 1.64 1.48 1.56
When comparing 2014 and 2015, changes in currency exchange rates had an adverse impact of £2.9m (0.9%) on Group revenue and 
£3.3m (3.7%) adverse impact on Group Adjusted EBITDA. On a segmental basis, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange 
rates was as follows:
• Exhibitions & Festivals: £5.7m (3.8%) adverse impact on revenue and £3.8m (6.8%) adverse impact on Adjusted EBITDA.
• Information Services: £2.8m (1.6%) favourable impact on revenue and £0.4m (0.9%) favourable impact on Adjusted EBITDA.

ASCENTIAL PLC — A REPORT OF THE YEAR 2015
Amortisation and impairment
Amortisation of intangible assets acquired through business combinations was £29.5m in 2015 (2014: £25.8m) with the increase of 
£3.7m primarily due to a full year’s amortisation charge in respect of Money20/20 acquired in August 2014. The Group undertakes a 
periodic review of the carrying value of its intangible assets and as a result of this review there was no impairment recognised in the 
year relating to intangible assets acquired through business combinations (2014: £nil) or to software or tangible fixed assets (2014: 
£0.8m).
Share-based payments
The Group had established a Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) to provide certain senior management with equity participation in the 
future prospects and performance of the Group. Shares were acquired at market value by participants and therefore no share-based 
payments charge was incurred. However, for legal and administrative reasons certain participants outside the UK and the US received 
their LTIP in cash-settled phantom awards giving rise to a share-based payments charge of £0.5m.
Exceptional items
The following table sets out the exceptional items incurred by the Group that have been excluded from the Adjusted EBITDA.  
The Group considers that separately identifying such items improves comparability of the financial results.
(£ million) 2015 2014

Professional fees on capital restructuring 0.3 3.6
Financing and restructuring – 1.2
Other exceptional items – 1.0
Total exceptional items 11.0 18.0
The acquisition-related contingent employment costs relate to the acquisition of Money20/20 in August 2014. Under the sale and 
purchase agreement, an element of the deferred consideration is contingent on both (i) the results of the business in 2015-17 and (ii) 
the continued employment of certain of the vendors. In accordance with IFRS, this element of the deferred consideration is treated as 
an expense recognised over the service lives of those vendors. In 2015 this expense amounted to £5.5m for the full 12 months 
(2014: £1.8m for a four month period) and further expense of £3.0m and £1.4m is expected in 2016 and 2017 respectively.
Exceptional costs relating to the IPO of £1.7m were incurred in 2015, with the remainder of the IPO-related cost of approximately 
£15m expected to be incurred in 2016 either as further exceptional items or as an offset against the share premium account.
Exceptional costs of £1.7m were also incurred in 2015 as a result of the creation of the Plexus operating company from the 
combination of EMAP, MEED, 4C Group and Planet Retail. The Group incurred exceptional costs related to acquisition and disposal 
activity of £0.9m (2014: £2.8m) in 2015, with a further charge of £0.9m (2014: £7.3m) related to post-acquisition integration costs.

These principally relate to the acquisition of RetailNet Group. 18 ASCENTIAL PLC — A REPORT OF THE YEAR 2015
Net finance costs
The Group’s net finance expense for the year was £28.8m (2014: £28.0m).
The net interest expense on the Group’s net borrowings was £28.2m (2014: £32.6m) with the reduction driven by the reduced rate 
of interest payable following the Group’s April 2015 refinancing. However, the refinancing also resulted in £4.3m (2014: £nil) of break 
fees and write-off of loan arrangement fees in addition to the regular amortisation of such fees of £2.4m (2014: £3.0m). Other 
finance charges, which includes the fair value unwind of deferred consideration, were £2.3m (2014: £1.2m), driven by the addition of 
Money20/20 in August 2014. Fair value gains on derivative financial instruments were £4.2m (2014: £5.9m), mainly on instruments 
that do not form part of the Group’s financing structure following the IPO. Finally, net foreign exchange gains on cash and borrowings 
recognised in the income statement were £4.2m (2014: £2.9m). 
Taxation
The Group’s reported tax charge for 2015 amounted to a credit of £7.7m (2014: £25.2m credit) being a current tax charge of £5.0m 
(2014: £6.2m) and a deferred tax credit of £12.7m (2014: £31.4m). The large deferred tax credit mainly relates to the recognition of 
the tax value of losses incurred by the Group in previous years in both the UK and the US.
The Group’s Adjusted tax charge (after adjusting for the tax effect of adjusting items such as the amortisation of acquired intangibles) 
amounted to a charge of £6.7m (an effective tax rate on Adjusted profit before tax of 14%).

STRATEGIC REPORT | GOVERNANCE | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
ASCENTIAL PLC — A REPORT OF THE YEAR 2015
The Group generated operating cash flow of £92.0m (2014: £80.8m) an increase of 14%, primarily due to the strong operational 
performance of the business and a return to a small working capital inflow in the year of £1.1m (compared to the £4.5m outflow in 
2014 caused by the timing of the Money20/20 acquisition and event).
Capex remained broadly flat at £10.9m (2014: £11.3m) reflecting the well-invested nature of the business following the  
Group’s Transformation Programme of 2012/13. Cash tax was a small cash outflow of £1.2m (2014: £1.2m) and benefited from  
the utilisation of historic tax losses in the UK and US. The Group therefore generated free cash flow of £79.9m (2014: £68.3m)  
an increase of 17%, which was used to fund interest payments, acquisition costs and exceptional items with the balance reducing  
net indebtedness.
Capital structure
In the first half of the year Group undertook a refinancing of its borrowings to improve terms and extend maturities. The refinancing 
was completed in April 2015 and the new facilities comprised US$323m and €300m term loan maturing in April 2022 and a £75m 
revolving credit facility maturing in April 2021.
Subsequently, on 12 February 2016, and in order to achieve an opening leverage ratio of c.2.5x, the Group refinanced again and 
entered into new post-IPO term loan facilities of £66m, €171m and $96m as well as a revolving credit facility of £95m. Together  
with the net proceeds of the IPO of £183m, and existing cash resources, the Group used these new term loan facilities to repay all 
amounts under the Group’s existing senior facilities and to cancel certain related hedging arrangements. The new post-IPO bank 
facilities mature in February 2021 and have an initial rate of interest of 2.25% over LIBOR. The facilities include a net leverage ratio 
covenant of 4.5x which is measured at December 2016 and then semi-annually thereafter. The covenant ratio falls to 4.0x in 
December 2017.
Acquisitions and disposals
In June 2015 the Group acquired RetailNet Group, a US-based provider of forecasting and analytics, consulting and executive 
education services to the retail sector for total consideration of £5.7m of which £3.1m was paid in the year and £2.6m is deferred and 
payable in 2018. The Group incurred £0.5m of professional fees on the acquisition which it recorded as an exceptional cost and the 
business contributed £1.8m of revenue and £0.4m of Adjusted EBITDA to the Group’s 2015 results.
The Group sold MBI in January 2015 for £11.0m generating a profit on disposal of £4.8m. MBI therefore contributed only £0.7m of 
revenue and £0.1m of Adjusted EBITDA to the Group’s 2015 result.
Finally, in 2015 the Group paid £17.1m of deferred consideration relating to Money20/20 and Educar.
Dividends
Ascential plc was incorporated in January 2016 and, as indicated at the time of the IPO, expects to pay its first dividend in respect of 
the 2016 financial results with one-third paid in November 2016 and two-thirds paid in May 2017. The Board is targeting a pay-out 
ratio of 30% of Adjusted profit after tax.

Customer demand for the Group’s products is affected by economic 
and geopolitical conditions. Uncertainty about future developments 
may suppress customer demand. Economic changes may reduce 
demand over an extended period, with time lags dependent on 
customer budgeting and procurement cycles. Political and regulatory 
changes (such as those that may arise from the forthcoming 
referendum on the UK’s membership of the EU) may disrupt patterns 
of trade, reduce demand, impose operating inefficiencies, additional 
costs and compliance burdens, and may also significantly affect the 
Group’s tax position. 
The Group’s products hold market-leading position in their respective 
markets and many are closely integrated into customers’ operational 
processes. We believe this makes the Group’s revenues more resilient 
than otherwise in the face of reduced demand.
The Group regularly reviews political and economic conditions and 
outlook in the main market sectors and geographies it operates in to 
assess whether it needs to change either product offerings or cost 
structures.
2
 Currency fluctuations
The Group receives revenues and incurs costs in currencies other than 
pounds sterling. Material movements in exchange rates relative to 
pounds sterling could adversely affect the Group’s reported results and 
financial position.
The Group’s approach to management of foreign exchange risk is set 
out in note 2 to the financial statements.
3
 Customer end-market development
The Group’s customers operate in a variety of end-markets, each with 
their own competitive pressures affecting customer preferences and 
spend. Changes in these end-markets could increase competition, 
reduce customer spend, make the Group’s products less relevant to 
customer needs, or otherwise affect the Group’s competitiveness and/
or profitability.
The Group’s strategic focus on customer retention ensures we stay 
close to customer sentiment and have early indications of whether there 
is a change in the perceived value of our products. Customer satisfaction 
is measured regularly, and detailed usage is tracked to ensure continued 
relevance of product offerings.
The Group continues to invest in new product development, and 
enhancements to existing products, to respond to changing needs and 
ensure continuing value to the customer.
4
 Reputation and performance of top brands
The Group’s products enjoy a high degree of brand recognition based 
on their relevance to customer needs and reputation for quality and 
service. This underpins their ability to attract or retain customers.
A significant decline in the performance or prospects of the Group’s 
top products, which the Group generates a high proportion of 
revenues and EBITDA from its top products, and so a significant 
decline in the reputation, relevance or performance of the Group’s top 
products could materially and adversely affect the Group’s business.
The Group’s senior management team devote substantial senior 
management team time to its major products, to ensure they are well 
run and delivering excellent customer experience. Each business is 
operated with a sharp focus on ensuring operational excellence across 
all brands.
The Group also allocates capital to products with the highest potential 
to grow both scale and returns, whilst carefully reviewing extensions 
into adjacent market spaces to ensure these do not dilute the brand 
value of the core offering.
5
 Acquisitions
Growth through acquisitions entails various risks, including the ability 
to identify acquisition candidates, to achieve the expected benefits, to 
integrate acquired businesses with our existing portfolio, and to retain 
staff and preserve sources of competitive advantage.
The Group takes a disciplined approach to portfolio management 
decisions, with clear acquisition criteria, careful due diligence and 
pre-completion planning for integration.
The Group’s policy in relation to risk 
management is to ensure risks are 
assessed and their potential impacts 
addressed in a cost-effective way. It 
does not focus upon risk avoidance but 
on the identification and management of 
an acceptable level of risk.
The Group’s risk management framework promotes 
and supports the establishment, communication and 
embedding of risk management processes throughout the 
business. It also ensures that there is a clear view of risks 
by taking both a ‘top down’ view of key risks which may 
impact delivery of business strategy; and a ‘bottom up’ 
view of risks that may have a business level implication as 
identified by individual businesses and Group functions.

 Geographic expansion
An element of the Group’s growth strategy is expanding into higher 
growth geographic markets. This expansion presents management, 
logistical and compliance challenges. Inadequate plans or poor 
execution in addressing these challenges may damage the Group’s 
growth prospects and reputation.
The Group’s plans for expansion into new markets are developed as 
part of the annual strategic planning cycle. Implementation of these 
plans involves careful selection of local partners, support from 
professional advisers, and regular monitoring by senior management.
7
 Technological change
The Group’s products depend on custom-designed IT platforms. These 
platforms require continual development to ensure the services remain 
competitive, by enhancing existing offerings and building new 
solutions to meet customer requirements. The Group also develops IT 
systems to support its own internal operations.
Such technological development carries the risks of poor quality 
implementation, delivery delays, and failure to deliver the expected 
benefits such as desired customer solutions, business improvements or 
cost efficiencies. In addition customer-facing platforms may be 
rendered obsolete by newer technologies offering faster, more flexible 
or more relevant solutions to customer needs.
The Group reviews all major technology development proposals at a 
senior level, and manages subsequent delivery through robust project 
management.
There are rigorous policies and processes in respect of maintenance 
and updates of hardware and software infrastructure to ensure 
systems are robust and up to date.
The Group maintains an awareness of emerging technology 
developments through a variety of sources including relationships with 
existing vendors and independent partners, market research, and 
involvement with peer networks.
8
 Technology security
The Group relies on electronic platforms and distribution systems to 
provide customer service. The Group also relies on IT systems to 
manage the Group’s business data, communications, and business 
processes. These systems are also heavily dependent on the internet, 
both as a means of distribution and for hosting services.
These systems could suffer damage or interruption from a variety of 
causes, including fire, natural disasters, power outages, systems 
failures, security breaches, cyber-attacks and viruses. Such incidents 
could disrupt the Group’s business, requiring management time and 
incurring additional cost to resolve the issue. This could also result in 
transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and 
customers.
In addition, breaches of data security systems or other unauthorised 
access to the Group’s data could damage its reputation and lead to a 
risk of loss of customers, liability for damages, litigation, and more 
onerous compliance requirements from government regulators.
The Group’s IT function maintains and tests network security, network 
resilience and business continuity plans, and monitors emerging threats 
to ensure our preparations and responses are current. We also make 
use of industry-leading software and services in support of these 
activities.
The Group runs quarterly meetings with representation from all major 
products and central group functions to review technology security 
issues and risks, and to ensure appropriate responses are put in place.
Each operating company develops its own clearly defined security 
objectives in collaboration with the central Group IT function, which 
are reviewed and updated on a regular basis by the senior 
management of that business.
9
 Loss of event venue or inability to travel
The Group’s events are held at specific locations on particular dates 
each year. These specific locations may be unavailable for use through 
damage, or may become available only on uneconomic terms.
In addition, various factors may disrupt travel or pose a safety risk, 
preventing both customers and our own staff from reaching the event 
location, or leading to customers being unwilling to travel. Examples of 
such factors include natural disasters, risk of disease, civil disorder, 
political instability, and terrorism.
The Group maintains close relationships with major venue providers, 
and also maintains contingency plans to move events if necessary.
Business continuity plans are also in place to minimise disruption and 
financial impact. Our contractual terms provide some protection 
against the risk of late cancellation, and we maintain insurance cover in 
respect of certain event cancellation risks.
10
 Taxation
The Group has operations in 14 countries and multiple states in the 
United States and sells its products and services into more than 150 
countries, and so is subject to many different forms of taxation in  
many different jurisdictions.
Tax law and administration is complex, and tax authorities may 
challenge the Group’s application of tax law, potentially leading to 
lengthy and costly disputes and material tax charges.
The Group maintains an experienced tax function, supported by 
external professional advisers, to ensure that the Group maintains  
a constructive relationship with tax authorities, and keeps up to  
date with changes in tax legislation and in the development of the 
Group’s operations. 20 ASCENTIAL PLC — A REPORT OF THE YEAR 2015

and Adjusted EBITDA of 13% and 11% to £150.4m  
(2014: £138.8m) and £56.9m (2014: £55.3m) respectively. 
The segment has considerable foreign

in euro and Money20/20 in US dollars, 
while the majority of the segment’s cost 
base is denominated in pounds sterling.

customers a simple way to continue to 
enjoy our products while delivering 
standard price increases and freeing up 
the account managers in our sales teams 
from routine renewal administration.

customers in China who buy WGSN 
products and to co-develop a new 
colour product.
• Corporate subscription model:

individuals to corporate subscriptions 
(now 31% (2014: 20%) of subscribers  
in our subscription-led products) 
delivering benefits in terms of improved 
renewal rates, reduced cost to serve  
and improved product mix in favour  
of digital.
• Transition to digital: As part of our 
migration to a digital-only business  
we turned off the ability for new 
subscribers to purchase a print based 
version of our product in Nursing 
Times and Retail Week. Print 
advertising revenue for our continuing 
products reduced from £15.1m to 
£11.6m, a reduction of 23%.  
 
Print advertising now represents 4%  
(2014: 6%) of Group revenues and is 
planned to continue to reduce at 
similar rates over the next few years.
We continued to actively manage the 
portfolio with the sale of MBI in January 
2015 and the acquisition of RetailNet 
Group in June 2015. We also brought 
the leadership of EMAP, 4C and Planet 
Retail together under the Plexus brand 
as we pursued our strategy to accelerate 
the migration of print customers to 
digital and/or events revenue streams.
The Information Services segment delivered good growth 
in profitability in 2015, increasing its Adjusted EBITDA by 
15% on an Organic basis to £42.8m (2014: £38.9m).

WGSN
WGSN is the global leading product for 
market intelligence, insight and trend 
forecasts to the fashion industry and 
to businesses in design-led consumer 
markets. It is the Group’s largest product 
by revenue and represents 36% of the 
revenues of the Information Services 
segment. WGSN grew revenues by 3% 
on an Organic basis to £60.5m. However, 
having completed its integration with 
Stylesight in 2014, WGSN returned 
to strong billings growth in 2015 
achieving 6% for the year as a whole.
WGSN continued to develop its suite 
of new and existing digital products,
with the imminent launch of the single 
integrated platform which makes all of 
WGSN’s various products visible to 
customers through a single platform to be 
followed by a major refresh of its range 
management product – WGSN INstock.
WGSN also expanded its geographical 
reach through agreeing a joint venture 
with CTIC in China. CTIC was established 
by the Chinese government to develop 
and promote the Chinese domestic and 
international fashion industry. This JV will 
become effective in 2016 and will seek 
to extend the customer base of WGSN in 
China. In addition WGSN has also entered 
in a further JV with CTIC to develop 
a new colour management product.
Groundsure
Groundsure is a market-leading provider 
of environmental risk data to solicitors, 
conveyancers, architects, lenders and 
other participants in the UK residential 
and commercial property industry. It 
has a highly developed ecommerce 
ordering platform, detailed archive and 
well established reseller relationships. 
The business continued to benefit from 
a strengthening UK property market. In 
its key residential market, Groundsure 
was able to grow revenues during 2015 
significantly ahead of the underlying 
growth rate for UK housing transactions. 
Revenues for 2015 were £14.2m 
(2014: £12.6m), up 13% year-on-year. 26 ASCENTIAL PLC — A REPORT OF THE YEAR 2015
As well as delivering good growth, 
the segment also expanded margins 
to 25% (2014: 22%) driven mainly by 
the successful integration of WGSN 
and Stylesight in 2014. The year was 
more mixed in terms of revenue which 
grew by 0.5% on an Organic basis to 
£168.7m (2014 £173.9m). Groundsure 
had strong revenue growth but this was 
offset by weakness in our Middle East 
business MEED and the continuing 
decline in print advertising revenues. 
Growth excluding the planned decline 
in print advertising was 3.5%.
SEGMENTAL REVIEW – INFORMATION SERVICES
We made good progress against our key 
growth initiatives in Information Services:
• Renewal rates: Increased billings for our 
subscription products by a blended 6% 
and increased renewal rates from 87% 
to 90%.
• Product development: Launched four 
new, high-value, digital products to sell 
to our existing subscriber base (WGSN 
StyleTrial, Retail Week Prospect, Planet 
Retail Shopology and Nursing Times 
Learning).
• Auto-renewal: Rolled out auto-renewal 
contract terms across all our 
subscription products giving our 
customers a simple way to continue to 
enjoy our products while delivering 
standard price increases and freeing up 
the account managers in our sales teams 
from routine renewal administration.
• Geographic expansion: Entered into an 
agreement to launch three joint 
ventures with our Chinese partner 
CTIC to expand the number of 
customers in China who buy WGSN 
products and to co-develop a new 
colour product.
• Corporate subscription model: 
Accelerated the shift in subscribers  
to our subscription-led products from 
individuals to corporate subscriptions 
(now 31% (2014: 20%) of subscribers  
in our subscription-led products) 
delivering benefits in terms of improved

Understanding and responding to customer needs, 
developing and delivering compelling products and services, 
maintaining a focused and disciplined operational approach 
and combining all of these to sustain a dynamic, growing 
business are at the core of our strategy. 
This all comes from the hard work, expertise, and 
enthusiasm of our people, day in day out, across the world.
The Group is committed to supporting  
the development of employees through 
formal skills training programmes, and 
people are also encouraged to personally 
develop skills and learning from their 
Group colleagues, both at the annual 
company conference, through our 
leadership Alumni Programme, our  
Sales Leaders Forums, and in their day  
to day working lives. Ascential employees 
never stand still: we know there is always 
more to learn, more to do and more to 
offer. Ascential people are naturally 
innovative and inquisitive, seeking to 
better understand the industries they 
serve and discover new, effective ways  
to serve customers’ needs and grow  
their businesses.
Elite
The Elite programme enables us 
to recognise and reward our very 
top performers. Their outstanding 
contribution and exceptional 
achievements are celebrated at regular 
events, quarterly celebrations and 
with once in a lifetime holidays. 
PEOPLE REVIEW
Elite winners stand out amongst their

outstanding performance, which in turn 
helps deliver our growth ambitions and 
create a sustainable, growing product

Elite is open to all employees, regardless 
of where they work across the Group.
Diversity
We are committed to providing

and prospective employees without 
unlawful or unfair discrimination. Full 
support is given to the employment 
and advancement of disabled people.
Gender equality 
Ascential regularly carries out 
benchmarking within the industry and 
across locations where we work to ensure 
wages are appropriate, fair and equal for 
men and women.
In a company that employs almost 60% 
women, we have adopted a leading 
approach to gender diversity and are 
proud our Board currently consists of 
37.5% women, exceeding the 
recommendations of the Davies Report.
Ascential Holdings Limited employee 
numbers by gender as at 31 December 
2015 were 939 female and 655 male 
employees. Directors and Key 
Management were one male and one 
female, these being the CEO and  
CFO respectively.
We are a growing international company, 
employing highly skilled, motivated 
people in all our local offices around 
the world. During 2015 we welcomed 
RetailNet Group, and moved the 
headquarters of WGSN to New York. 
As a result, the US is now home to one of 
our principal offices and is set to become 
one of our major operating territories. 
To harness the skills and energy of a 
diverse, widespread group of people we 
believe it is vital to be clear about the 
values we all hold to, to help our people 
develop personally and professionally, 
to reward and celebrate excellence, 
and to treat everyone with respect and 
fairness regardless of background.

Travel
Ascential aims to proactively reduce 
its carbon footprint. Although some 
business plane travel is unavoidable 
for an international business, Ascential 
continues to encourage the use 
of webinars and video conference 
facilities as much as possible to 
remove any unnecessary travel.
Giving back
A core strength of Ascential employees 
is their commitment and passion for the 
communities we live in and serve. They 
want to make a real difference to the 
world around us, not just for customers 
through our great products, but for 
those less able to help themselves.
In 2012, the Group became a Patron 
of The Prince’s Trust and employees 
have continued to give their time to 
help disadvantaged young people get a 
better start in life. In 2015, the Prince’s 
Trust ‘Million Makers’ team were given 
£1,500 seed funding to support their 
SUSTAINABILITY
fundraising efforts. The team worked 
tirelessly running internal events for 
staff and organising casino tables at 
several Ascential awards events and a 
glittering Gala Dinner. Through their 
enormous commitment the team 
raised nearly £90,000. The team was 
also recognised by The Prince’s Trust 
at their annual awards ceremony, 
when the Ascential team won the 
2015 Above and Beyond Award.
2015 was the Group’s second year 
supporting Great Ormond Street Hospital 
for Sick Children in London. Internal 
Ambassadors and employees worked 
within their business units to raise almost 
£42,000 – taking our two year total to 
more than £130,000 – which paid for 
specialist staff and equipment at the 
world-famous, pioneering hospital.
The business gives employees time to 
volunteer for an organisation or charity 
that helps those less fortunate and also 
matches certain fundraising by staff.
 
We are a destination employer 
and believe it is vital to create an 
environment where people can be 
their best and to grow their skills and 
experiences across our businesses 
and territories we operate in.
In October 2015, our largest shareholder, 
Apax, was awarded the British Venture 
Capital Association’s Responsible 
Investment Award for both its responsible 
investment framework and also 
engagement with portfolio companies 
on responsible investment. Ascential 
was mentioned as an example under 
social impact and governance impact.
Increasing energy efficiency 
and recycling
Across the Group and around the 
world, we work with our landlords and 
employees to actively minimise waste 
and maximise both efficiency and 
recycling in all its forms. As an example, 
we target the installation of energy 
efficient low temperature hot water 
systems, low energy lighting and low 
power technology in our major offices.
Reducing print in line with 
customer need
For magazine print, Plexus purchased 882 
tonnes of paper in 2015, a reduction of 
almost 50% over 2014. This was driven by 
the sale of MBI, the reduction in certain 
magazine frequencies and the continuing 
increase in digital-only subscribers as 
customers move away from print. Our 
contracted print suppliers all hold PEFC, 
FSC chain of Custody and are 14001 
accredited, ensuring that the paper stock 
for our products is sustainably sourced.
Ascential’s environmental and social policies are guided by 
our values. We believe that when the business operates  
to the highest environmental, social and governance 
standards we perform more efficiently, attract and retain 
staff and make a difference to the communities we serve. 30 ASCENTIAL PLC — A REPORT OF THE YEAR 2015

REPORT OF KPMG LLP TO THE DIRECTORS OF ASCENTIAL HOLDINGS LIMITED
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015
Independent auditor’s report to Ascential Holdings Limited (formerly Eden Acquisition 5 Limited)
We have audited the non-statutory financial statements of Ascential Holdings Limited (“the Company”) for the period 1 January 2015 
to 31 December 2015 set out on pages 39 to 71. These non-statutory financial statements have been prepared for the reasons set out 
in Note 1 to the non-statutory financial statements and on the basis of the financial reporting framework of International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the EU.
This report is made to the Company solely in response to a request from the Company for an opinion from independent auditors 
on the truth and fairness of the non-statutory financial statements, as required under the Shareholders’ agreement dated 
16 December 2014 (and subsequently amended on 17 March and 5 May 2015). Our audit work has been undertaken so that we 
might state to the Company those matters we have been engaged to state to the Company in this report and for no other purpose. 
Our report was designed to meet the agreed requirements of the Company determined by the Company’s needs at the time.  
Our report should not therefore be regarded as suitable to be used or relied on by any party wishing to acquire rights against us 
other than the Company for any purpose or in any context. Any party other than the Company who obtains access to our report  
or a copy and chooses to rely on our report (or any part of it) will do so at its own risk. To the fullest extent permitted by law,  
KPMG LLP will accept no responsibility or liability in respect of our audit work, this report, or the opinions we have formed,  
to any other party.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 37, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the non-statutory financial statements, which are intended by them to give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is 
to audit, and express an opinion on, the non-statutory financial statements in accordance with the terms of our engagement letter 
dated 10 March 2015 and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the non-statutory financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the non-statutory financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the non-statutory financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; 
and the overall presentation of the non-statutory financial statements.
In addition we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report and Non-statutory financial statements  
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited non-statutory financial statements and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of  
performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the  
implications for our report.
Opinion on non-statutory financial statements
In our opinion the non-statutory financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2015 and of its profit for the year then 
ended; and
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU.

NOTES TO THE NON-STATUTORY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015
1. Principal accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The non-statutory financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) 
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee’s 
interpretations as adopted by the European Union (“EU”) applicable at 31 December 2015 and in accordance with the accounting 
policies as stated within this Note 1 to the non-statutory financial statements.
Investors in Ascential plc and holders of Ascential plc’s shares may have limited or no recourse against the independent auditors of 
Ascential Holdings Limited.
Investors in Ascential plc and holders of Ascential plc’s shares should understand that, consistent with guidance issued by the 
ICAEW (the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales), the independent auditors’ report relating to financial 
information of Ascential Holdings Limited (“the Company”) included elsewhere in this publication states that: 
The report has been prepared for the Company solely in response to a request from the Company for an opinion from independent 
auditors on the truth and fairness of the non-statutory financial statements; that the audit work has been undertaken so that the 
independent auditors might state to the Company those matters which the independent auditors have been engaged to state to the 
Company in the report and for no other purpose; that the report was designed to meet the agreed requirements of the Company 
determined by the Company’s needs at the time; that the report should not therefore be regarded as suitable to be used or relied on 
by any party wishing to acquire rights against the independent auditors other than the Company for any purpose or in any context; 
that any party other than the Company who obtains access to the report or a copy and chooses to rely on the report (or any part of it) 
will do so at its own risk; and that to the fullest extent permitted by law, the independent auditors will accept no responsibility or 
liability in respect of their audit work, the report, or the opinions they have formed, to any other party. 
In the context of this publication, the independent auditors have reconfirmed to us that they do not intend their duty of care in 
respect of their audit to extend to any party, such as investors in Ascential plc and holders of Ascential plc’s shares, other than to 
the Company.
Basis of measurement
The consolidated non-statutory financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis with the exception of financial 
instruments which are stated in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. Accounting policies 
have been applied consistently to both years presented. Where applicable certain comparative amounts have been reclassified to 
conform to the current year’s presentation. 
Going concern basis of accounting
On 8 February 2016 Ascential plc became the ultimate parent undertaking of the Group. Ascential plc was admitted to trade on 
the main market for the listing securities on the London Stock Exchange on 12 February 2016 and the associated Offer for Shares 
raised gross proceeds of £200 million. Further details are in Note 33.
Note 33 also details the new term loan facilities that were entered into on 12 February 2016 and made available to Ascential plc 
and certain of its subsidiaries. The Group’s forecasts, impact assessment of various downside scenarios, and senior debt and 
interest repayments falling due, show that the Group is expected to be able to operate within the level of its current facilities  
and meet its covenant requirements for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these non-statutory  
financial statements.
After reviewing the above, taking into account current and future developments and principal risks and uncertainties, and  
making appropriate enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue  
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly they are satisfied that the non-statutory financial information 
should be prepared on a going concern basis.
Functional and presentation currency
The consolidated non-statutory financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is Ascential Holdings Limited’s 
functional currency. All non-statutory financial statements presented in pounds sterling has been rounded to the nearest hundred 
thousand, except where otherwise indicated. 42 ASCENTIAL HOLDINGS LIMITED – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015

1. Principal accounting policies continued
Critical accounting assumptions and judgements
The preparation of non-statutory financial statements under IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting assumptions, and 
requires management to exercise its judgement and to make estimates in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. 
The areas requiring a higher degree of judgement, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated 
non-statutory financial statements are discussed below.
(a) Use of estimates
The preparation of non-statutory financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the non-statutory financial statements and the reported amounts 
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of 
the amount, events or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates, particularly for acquisition-related 
contingent consideration and acquisition-related contingent employment cost where the amounts payable are contingent on the 
future results of the acquired business.
(b) Business combinations
Accounting for a business on acquisition requires an assessment of the existence and fair value of separable intangible assets  
at the date of acquisition. These fair values are based on assumptions regarding the expected future cash flows attributable to  
the separable intangible assets at the point of acquisition. If subsequent actual and forecast performance indicates these cash 
flows are adverse to the estimates used, an impairment may be triggered at that point, or a reduction in useful economic life  
may be required. 
(c) Intangible assets
The Group uses forecast cash flow information and estimates of future growth to both value acquired intangible assets and 
goodwill and to assess whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired, and to determine the useful economic lives of its 
intangible assets. If the results of operations in a future period are adverse to the estimates used for impairment testing, an 
impairment may be triggered at that point, or a reduction in useful economic life may be required. 
(d) Income taxes
In recognising income tax assets and liabilities estimates have to be made of the likely outcome of decisions by tax authorities on 
transactions and events whose treatment for tax purposes is uncertain. In recognising deferred tax assets in respect of unused tax 
losses, judgement is required to establish the expected availability of losses and the likely timing and level of future taxable profits. 
Principal accounting policies
The following summarises the principal accounting policies adopted by the Directors, which have been adopted consistently:
(a) Basis of consolidation
The Group non-statutory financial statements consolidate the accounts of Ascential Holdings Limited and its subsidiary 
undertakings for the year ended 31 December 2015. A subsidiary is an entity (including special purpose entities) over which the 
Group has the power to direct the relevant activities, exposure to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and 
there is a link between power and returns. The results of each subsidiary are included from the date that control transferred to the 
Group and are Adjusted to align accounting policies with the Group’s accounting policies. Subsidiaries are no longer consolidated 
from the date that control ceases. All intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in full.
(b) Foreign currency translation
The functional currency of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures is the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which they operate. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency rate applicable at the date 
of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency 
rate of exchange in force at the reporting date. 
All differences are taken to the consolidated profit and loss statement except for those on foreign currency borrowings that 
provide a hedge against an investment in a foreign entity. These are taken directly to equity until the disposal of the investment, at 
which time they are recognised in the consolidated profit and loss statement. Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange 
differences on those borrowings are also dealt with in equity. Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rate in force at the date of the initial transaction.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015
STRATEGIC REPORT | GOVERNANCE | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
45 ASCENTIAL HOLDINGS LIMITED – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015
1. Principal accounting policies continued
As at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries are translated into pounds sterling at the rate of 
exchange applicable at the reporting date and their consolidated profit and loss statements are translated at the average exchange 
rates for the period. The exchange differences arising from the retranslation of foreign operations are taken directly to a separate 
component of equity. On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that operation  
is recognised in the consolidated profit and loss statement as part of the gain or loss on sale. Goodwill and fair value adjustments 
arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the  
closing rate.
(c) Investments in associates and joint ventures
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence but not control, generally 
accompanying a shareholding of between 20% to 50% of the voting rights. A joint venture is an entity over which the Group 
exercises joint control, usually through a contractual arrangement. The Group’s investments in associates and joint ventures are 
recognised using the equity method of accounting.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and thereafter are carried in the consolidated statement 
of financial position at cost less any impairment in value. The consolidated profit and loss statement reflects the Group’s share of 
an associate or joint venture’s profit after tax. Where the Group’s share of losses in an associate or joint venture exceeds its 
investment, the Group ceases to recognise further losses unless an obligation exists for the Group to fund the losses. Where a 
change in net assets has been recognised directly in the associate or joint venture’s equity, the Group recognises its share of those 
changes in the statement of changes in equity when applicable.
Adjustments are made to align the accounting policies of the associate or joint venture with the Group’s and to eliminate the 
Group’s share of unrealised gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures.
(d) Investments
Investments are held at cost less provision for impairment. Initial recognition of investments is at the fair value of the assets given, 
equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed.
(e) Business combinations and intangible assets
Acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The cost of an acquisition is the cash paid together with 
the fair value of other assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed. 
Any contingent consideration is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the 
contingent consideration, which is deemed to be an asset or liability, is recognised either in the profit and loss account or in other 
comprehensive income, in accordance with IAS 39. Any amounts payable by the Group directly contingent on the continuing 
employment of the vendors are treated as remuneration and recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account. Deferred 
and contingent consideration amounts payable after more than 12 months have been discounted to present value. 
Costs directly attributable to acquisitions are expensed as exceptional items. The acquired identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling 
interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of net assets assumed is recorded as goodwill.
Goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment either annually or more 
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible decline in the carrying value. Impairment is determined by 
comparing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units (“CGU”) which are expected to 
benefit from the acquisition in which the goodwill arose, to the carrying value of the CGU. The recoverable amount is the greater 
of an asset’s value-in-use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value-in-use is calculated by discounting the future cash flows 
expected to be derived from the asset or group of assets in a cash-generating unit at the Group’s cost of capital, adjusted for risk 
in a specific market if relevant. The discount and growth rates used in the value-in-use calculations are disclosed in Note 11 of the 
non-statutory financial statements. Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, the goodwill is considered impaired 
and is written down through the consolidated profit and loss statement to its recoverable amount. The carrying amount of goodwill 
allocated to a cash-generating unit is taken into account when determining the gain or loss on the disposal of the unit or operation 
within it. 44 ASCENTIAL HOLDINGS LIMITED – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015

1. Principal accounting policies continued
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised at fair value at the date of acquisition. Intangible  
assets purchased separately are capitalised at cost. After initial recognition, all intangible fixed assets are measured at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Intangible fixed assets which have been assigned a finite life are 
amortised and tested for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may have declined. This 
is done on a similar basis to the testing of goodwill, either for individual assets or at the level of a cash-generating unit. Useful lives 
are examined every year and adjustments are made, where applicable, on a prospective basis. Amortisation is charged on assets 
with finite lives on a systematic basis over the asset’s useful life, which in all cases is a maximum period of 30 years. 
Where an intangible asset has been assigned an indefinite useful life, it is not amortised and is reviewed for impairment either 
annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible decline in the carrying value.
Purchases of software or direct costs relating to internal development of software are capitalised and amortised over their 
anticipated useful lives. Capitalisation of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the software is substantially complete 
and ready for its intended use. The useful life of software ranges from three to seven years. 
Website development costs relating to websites which are revenue generating are capitalised and amortised over three to five 
years. Development costs relating to websites which are not revenue generating are taken immediately to the consolidated profit 
and loss statement.
(f) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. Depreciation is 
calculated in such a way as to write off the cost of an asset, less its residual value, on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful 
life as follows:
• short leasehold property – over the period of the lease; and
• office equipment – two to five years.
Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date. The carrying values of property, plant and 
equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate these values may not be recoverable. If 
there is an indication that impairment does exist the carrying values are compared to the estimated recoverable amounts of the 
assets concerned. The recoverable amount is the greater of an asset’s value-in-use and its fair value less the cost of selling it. 
Value-in-use is calculated by discounting the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset. Where the carrying value of 
an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. 
Impairment losses are recognised in the consolidated profit and loss statement.
An item of property, plant or equipment is written off either on disposal or when there is no expected future economic benefit from 
its continued use. Any gain or loss on de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds 
and the carrying value of the asset) is included in the consolidated profit and loss statement in the year the item is derecognised.
(g) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost represents purchase cost, including attributable 
overheads, and is determined using a first-in, first-out basis. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course of business, less estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale. 
Costs relating to future exhibitions, festivals and congresses are deferred within inventories at the lower of cost or net realisable 
value. These costs are charged to the consolidated profit and loss statement when the exhibition takes place.
(h) Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less provision for impairment. 
Specific provisions are made and charged to the consolidated profit and loss statement when there is objective evidence that the 
Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms. Collective provisions are made based on 
estimated losses inherent within receivables, based on the overall level of receivables past due. These provisions are developed 
over time based on the review of aged debt, the type of debt and experience.

47 ASCENTIAL HOLDINGS LIMITED – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015
1. Principal accounting policies continued
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognised in the 
consolidated profit and loss statement. When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account for 
trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the consolidated profit and loss statement.
(i) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash, short-term deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments with an original 
maturity of three months or less. For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are as 
defined, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
(j) Assets held for sale
Where the Group expects to recover the carrying amount of a group of assets through a sale transaction rather than through 
continuing use, and a sale is considered to be highly probable at the reporting date, the assets are classified as held for sale and 
measured at the lower of cost and fair value less costs to sell. No depreciation or amortisation is charged in respect of non-current 
assets classified as held for sale.
(k) Borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised 
cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the consolidated 
profit and loss statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method, with the exception of debt 
repurchases which are recognised in the consolidated profit and loss statement in the year of the repurchase.
(l) Derivatives and other financial instruments 
Derivatives, including currency options and swaps, forward exchange contracts, and interest rate swaps and caps, are initially 
recognised and subsequently measured at fair value at each reporting date. Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting 
are classified as a separate asset or liability. The fair value is determined by using market data and the use of established estimation 
techniques such as discounted cash flow and option valuation models. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss 
depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged as 
described below. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are 
recognised in the consolidated profit and loss statement as they arise. 
A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 
12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets 
or current liabilities. Further details of derivative financial instruments are disclosed in Note 20.
(m) Hedging Activities 
The Group’s operations and funding give rise to foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk. The Group may structure its 
borrowings or utilise derivative financial instruments to manage the economic impact of these risks. The Group does not use 
derivative contracts for speculative purposes.
The Group may also formally designate certain derivatives or borrowings as hedging instruments and will at the point of inception 
document the relationship between the hedge instrument and hedged item, together with the risk management objective and 
strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction. In addition, at inception and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether 
the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the  
hedged item. 
Hedge instruments are accounted for as either: 
• hedges of a change of fair value of recognised assets and liabilities or firm commitments (fair value hedges); 
• hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction 
(cash flow hedge); or
• hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge). 
(i) Fair value hedges
Changes in the fair value of fair value hedge instruments are recorded in profit or loss immediately, together with any changes in 
the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk, with these changes in fair value being 
recognised in the line of the consolidated profit and loss statement relating to the hedged item.  46 ASCENTIAL HOLDINGS LIMITED – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015
1. Principal accounting policies continued
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised at fair value at the date of acquisition. Intangible  
assets purchased separately are capitalised at cost. After initial recognition, all intangible fixed assets are measured at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Intangible fixed assets which have been assigned a finite life are 
amortised and tested for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may have declined. This 
is done on a similar basis to the testing of goodwill, either for individual assets or at the level of a cash-generating unit. Useful lives 
are examined every year and adjustments are made, where applicable, on a prospective basis. Amortisation is charged on assets 
with finite lives on a systematic basis over the asset’s useful life, which in all cases is a maximum period of 30 years. 
Where an intangible asset has been assigned an indefinite useful life, it is not amortised and is reviewed for impairment either 
annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible decline in the carrying value.
Purchases of software or direct costs relating to internal development of software are capitalised and amortised over their 
anticipated useful lives. Capitalisation of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the software is substantially complete 
and ready for its intended use. The useful life of software ranges from three to seven years. 
Website development costs relating to websites which are revenue generating are capitalised and amortised over three to five 
years. Development costs relating to websites which are not revenue generating are taken immediately to the consolidated profit 
and loss statement.
(f) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. Depreciation is 
calculated in such a way as to write off the cost of an asset, less its residual value, on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful 
life as follows:
• short leasehold property – over the period of the lease; and
• office equipment – two to five years.
Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date. The carrying values of property, plant and 
equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate these values may not be recoverable. If 
there is an indication that impairment does exist the carrying values are compared to the estimated recoverable amounts of the 
assets concerned. The recoverable amount is the greater of an asset’s value-in-use and its fair value less the cost of selling it. 
Value-in-use is calculated by discounting the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset. Where the carrying value of 
an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. 
Impairment losses are recognised in the consolidated profit and loss statement.
An item of property, plant or equipment is written off either on disposal or when there is no expected future economic benefit from 
its continued use. Any gain or loss on de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds 
and the carrying value of the asset) is included in the consolidated profit and loss statement in the year the item is derecognised.
(g) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost represents purchase cost, including attributable 
overheads, and is determined using a first-in, first-out basis. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course of business, less estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale. 
Costs relating to future exhibitions, festivals and congresses are deferred within inventories at the lower of cost or net realisable 
value. These costs are charged to the consolidated profit and loss statement when the exhibition takes place.
(h) Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less provision for impairment. 
Specific provisions are made and charged to the consolidated profit and loss statement when there is objective evidence that the 
Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms. Collective provisions are made based on 
estimated losses inherent within receivables, based on the overall level of receivables past due. These provisions are developed 
over time based on the review of aged debt, the type of debt and experience.

(m) Hedging Activities 
The Group’s operations and funding give rise to foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk. The Group may structure its 
borrowings or utilise derivative financial instruments to manage the economic impact of these risks. The Group does not use

(cash flow hedge); or
• hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge). 
(i) Fair value hedges
Changes in the fair value of fair value hedge instruments are recorded in profit or loss immediately, together with any changes in 
the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk, with these changes in fair value being 
recognised in the line of the consolidated profit and loss statement relating to the hedged item.  48 ASCENTIAL HOLDINGS LIMITED – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015
1. Principal accounting policies continued
(ii) Cash flow hedge 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income. The gains  
or losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognised immediately in the consolidated profit and loss statement. The 
cumulative amount recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item 
is recognised in profit or loss in the same line of the consolidated profit and loss statement as the recognised hedged item. 
However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, 
the cumulative amount recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred from equity and included in the initial 
measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.
(iii) Hedges of net investment in foreign operations 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of hedges of net investment in foreign operations is recognised in other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve. The gains or losses relating to the ineffective 
portion are recognised immediately in the consolidated profit and loss statement. Gains and losses on the hedging instrument 
accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve are reclassified to profit or loss when the hedged item is disposed of. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedge instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies 
for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gains or losses on the hedging instrument recognised in equity are retained in 
equity until the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain 
or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the consolidated profit and loss statement in the period.
(n) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, when it is 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and when a reliable estimate can be made of the 
amount of the obligation. Where the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised 
only when it is virtually certain. The expense relating to any provision is presented in the consolidated profit and loss statement net 
of any reimbursement. If the time value of money has a material effect on quantifying the provision, the provision is determined by 
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the 
passage of time is recognised as a finance charge.
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the 
restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating losses are not provided for.
(o) Leases
Assets held by the Group under leases which transfer to the Group substantially all of the risks and rewards of the ownership are 
classified as finance leases. On initial recognition, the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and 
the present value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with 
the accounting policy applicable to that asset. 
Assets held under other leases are classified as operating leases and are not recognised in the Group’s consolidated statement of 
financial position. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the consolidated profit and loss statement on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term. The benefit of any lease incentives is recognised as a reduction in rental expense on a 
straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
(p) Revenue
Revenue for goods sold is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to a third party. 
Revenue for services provided is recognised at the point when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and 
when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured. 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, net of discounts, customs duties and sales taxes. Revenue is 
only recognised for barter transactions which are considered dissimilar to each other in nature, and a corresponding amount is 
included in operating costs.

The following recognition criteria also apply in specific cases:
Exhibition, festival, congress and conference and awards show income is recognised when the event takes place. Data and online 
subscription revenues are recognised in the consolidated profit and loss statement evenly over the life of the subscription. 
Magazine subscriptions and advertising revenues are recognised according to the dispatch date of the publication. A provision is 
deducted from circulation revenue for expected returns, and is adjusted for actual returns when this is known. Pre-paid 
subscription and event revenues are shown as deferred income and released to the consolidated profit and loss statement in 
accordance with the revenue recognition criteria above. 
(q) Employee benefits
(i) Short-term employee benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is 
provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under cash bonus schemes if the Group has a present legal 
or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be 
estimated reliably.
(ii) Termination benefits
Termination benefits are recognised as an expense when the Group is demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility of 
withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide termination 
benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits for voluntary redundancies are 
recognised as an expense if the Group has made an offer of voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted, 
and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably. If benefits are payable more than 12 months after the reporting date, 
then they are discounted to their present value. 
(iii) Share-based payments
Equity-settled awards are valued at the grant date, and the difference between the grant date fair value and the consideration paid 
by the employee is charged as an expense in the consolidated profit and loss statement spread over the vesting period. The credit 
side of the entry is recorded in equity. Cash-settled awards are revalued at each reporting date with the fair value of the award 
charged to the profit and loss account over the vesting period and the credit side of the entry recognised as a liability.
(r) Pension and other post-employment benefits
The Group operates defined contribution pension scheme in certain countries. Contributions payable are charged to the 
consolidated profit and loss statement and included in staff costs as an operating expense as incurred. 
(s) Adjusted EBITDA and exceptional items
The consolidated non-statutory financial statements include Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of profitability in order to provide  
a better understanding of the trading performance of the Group. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure, defined as the Group’s 
operating profit before expensing depreciation of tangible fixed assets and amortisation of software, exceptional 
items, amortisation of acquired intangible assets, impairment of tangible fixed assets and software intangibles and share-based 
payments. 
The Group defines exceptional items as costs incurred by the Group in acquisitions & disposals, integration, non-recurring business 
restructuring and capital restructuring. These are disclosed separately to provide additional useful information to the users of the 
non-statutory financial statements. 
(t) Finance costs and income
Finance costs are recognised on an effective yield basis. Finance income is recognised on the accruals basis.
(u) Income tax
The Group is primarily subject to corporation tax in the UK, the US, Brazil and China, and judgement and estimates of future 
profitability are required to determine the Group’s deferred tax position. If the final tax outcome is different to that assumed, 
resulting changes will be reflected in the consolidated profit and loss statement, unless the tax relates to an item charged to  
equity, in which case the changes in tax estimates on those items will be reflected in equity.
Income tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current tax and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the  
consolidated profit and loss statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it  
is recognised in equity. 48 ASCENTIAL HOLDINGS LIMITED – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015

Income tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current tax and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the  
consolidated profit and loss statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it  
is recognised in equity. 50 ASCENTIAL HOLDINGS LIMITED – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015
1. Principal accounting policies continued
Current tax is tax payable based on taxable profits for the period, using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
at the reporting date along with any adjustment relating to tax payable in previous years. Taxable profit differs from net profit in 
the consolidated profit and loss statement in that income or expense items that are taxable or deductible in other years are 
excluded, as are items that are never taxable or deductible. Current tax assets relate to payments on account not yet allocated 
against current tax liabilities or to refunds due from tax authorities on overpayments in respect of prior years.
Using the liability method, deferred tax is provided on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes, except for the following temporary differences:
• goodwill that is not deductible for tax purposes; and
• the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and which will affect neither 
accounting nor taxable profit.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that sufficient future taxable profits will be available to allow all 
or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year in which the asset is realised 
or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. The deferred 
tax assets and liabilities are only offset where they relate to the same taxing authority and the Group has a legal right to offset.
Standards issued but not yet effective
The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the Group’s consolidated 
non-statutory financial statements are disclosed below. The Group intends to adopt these standards, if applicable, when they 
become effective. An initial assessment of the impact of IFRS 15 indicates the impact of adopting this standard will have limited 
effect. The Group has commenced an assessment of the impact of IFRS16 which was issued on 13 January 2016. None of the 
other standards are expected to materially impact the consolidated non-statutory financial statements upon adoption.

This note presents information about the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, the Group’s 
exposure to the risks arising from financial instruments, and the Group’s management of capital.
Market risk
(i) Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with 
respect to the US dollar and the euro. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and 
liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
Foreign currency movements impact on the Group’s profit and loss account together with its cash flow profile and leverage ratio 
position. The impact depends on whether there is a surplus or deficit in each currency from operating activities together with the 
interest and finance charge in those currencies. The Group’s policy has been to protect its cash flow and leverage ratio position by 
maintaining a proportion of currency debt in proportion to its currency earnings to obtain natural offsets. 
The Group’s net investment hedge in overseas subsidiaries may be hedged where the currency exposure is considered to  
be material. In 2015 the Group designated its US dollar borrowings as a net investment hedge against its US dollar  
denominated assets.

2. Financial risk management continued
(ii) Cash flow and interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises from medium and long-term borrowings to the extent that the underlying debt instruments are not at fixed 
rates of interest. The Group has entered into interest rate caps to protect a portion of its bank borrowings from fully floating to 
capped rates to mitigate this risk.
Credit risk
Credit risk is managed on a Group basis. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and 
deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and 
committed transactions. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of the financial assets in the 
consolidated statement of financial position as disclosed in Note 20 (a).
(i) Treasury-related credit risk
Counterparty risk arises from the investment of surplus funds and from the use of derivative instruments. The level of risk  
is evaluated by reference to corporate credit ratings as ascertained by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s. The Group’s policy is  
to limit the exposure to organisations that have a credit rating of at least BBB+/Baa1, with different limits depending on  
credit quality. As at the dates provided below the following limits were in place for investments held with banks and  
financial institutions:
2015 2014
(£ million)
Counterparty Credit limit Utilised Credit limit Utilised
Institutions rated AA/Aa2 or better 40.0 9.3 40.0 –
Institutions rated A/A2 or better but less than AA 50.0 7.1 50.0 6.6
Institutions rated BB+/Baa1 or better but less than A 30.0 26.6 40.0 13.2
Total 120.0 43.0 130.0 19.8
In accordance with the Group’s treasury policies and exposure management practices, counterparty credit exposure limits are 
continually monitored and no individual exposure is considered significant in the ordinary course of treasury management activity. 
Management does not expect any significant losses from non-performance by these counterparties. 
(ii) Trading risk
Risk arises principally from payment default by customers. The general policy of the Group is not to risk assess all new customers 
and so retail credit risk information has not been included in these consolidated non-statutory financial statements. Management 
does not, however, expect any significant losses in respect of receivables that have not been provided for as shown in Note 15.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach to 
managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity in the form of sufficient cash or funding 
from adequate credit facilities to meet such liabilities under both normal and stressed conditions.
The Group’s major banking facilities as at 31 December 2015 are detailed below:
Facility Drawn
Final maturity LC’m £’m LC’m £’m Interest Margin
Facility B1 €298.5 219.3 €298.5 219.3 April 2022 EURIBOR, 1% floor 5.00%
Facility B2 $321.4 216.9 $321.4 216.9 April 2022 LIBOR, 1% floor 5.00%
Revolving Credit Facility £75.0 75.0 – – April 2021 4.50%
Total facilities 511.2 436.2
As part of its previous financing arrangements, the Group was required to adhere to minimum maintenance covenants. The Group 
operated within these covenant limits during this period. Following the subsequent refinancing in April 2015, the Group had to 
adhere to a springing leverage covenant which applies to its Revolving Credit Facilities.  50 ASCENTIAL HOLDINGS LIMITED – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015
1. Principal accounting policies continued
Current tax is tax payable based on taxable profits for the period, using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
at the reporting date along with any adjustment relating to tax payable in previous years. Taxable profit differs from net profit in 
the consolidated profit and loss statement in that income or expense items that are taxable or deductible in other years are 
excluded, as are items that are never taxable or deductible. Current tax assets relate to payments on account not yet allocated 
against current tax liabilities or to refunds due from tax authorities on overpayments in respect of prior years.
Using the liability method, deferred tax is provided on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes, except for the following temporary differences:
• goodwill that is not deductible for tax purposes; and
• the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and which will affect neither 
accounting nor taxable profit.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that sufficient future taxable profits will be available to allow all 
or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year in which the asset is realised 
or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. The deferred 
tax assets and liabilities are only offset where they relate to the same taxing authority and the Group has a legal right to offset.
Standards issued but not yet effective
The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the Group’s consolidated 
non-statutory financial statements are disclosed below. The Group intends to adopt these standards, if applicable, when they 
become effective. An initial assessment of the impact of IFRS 15 indicates the impact of adopting this standard will have limited 
effect. The Group has commenced an assessment of the impact of IFRS16 which was issued on 13 January 2016. None of the 
other standards are expected to materially impact the consolidated non-statutory financial statements upon adoption.
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (Amendment)
• IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements (Amendment)
• IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised losses (Amendment)
• IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
• IFRS 16 Leases
• IAS 16 Property Plant and Equipment (Amendment)

Capital risk management
The Treasurer of the Group is responsible for managing compliance with bank covenants. Reports on both actual and projected 
bank covenant ratios (when applicable) are provided to the Board on a regular basis. 
Sensitivity analysis
(i) Foreign exchange risk
The Group receives approximately 20% of its revenues and incurs approximately 9% of its costs in euros. The Group is therefore 
sensitive to movements in the euro against the pound sterling. Each 1% movement in the euro to pound sterling exchange rate 
has a circa £0.6 million impact on annual revenue and a circa £0.4 million impact on annual Adjusted EBITDA. Offsetting this will 
be reductions to the euro interest and euro tax liabilities. This analysis assumes all other variables, including interest rates, 
remain constant.
The Group receives approximately 20% of its revenues and incurs approximately 17% of its costs in US dollars or currencies 
pegged to US dollars. The Group is therefore sensitive to movements in the US dollars against the pounds sterling. Each 1% 
movement in the US dollars to pounds sterling exchange rate has a circa £0.7 million impact on annual revenue and a circa £0.3 
million impact on annual Adjusted EBITDA. Offsetting this will be reductions to the US dollars interest and US dollars tax liabilities. 
This analysis assumes all other variables, including interest rates, remain constant.
(ii) Interest rate risk
If interest rates had been 50 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit for the year 
ended 31 December 2015 would have decreased or increased by £0.4 million (2014: £1.0 million). 
3. Revenue
The revenue analysis in the table below is based on the location of customers or, in the case of Exhibitions & Festivals, the location 
of business operations. All revenue in the year to 31 December 2015 is from continuing operations.

Rendering of services includes barter revenue arising from the exchange of goods or services of £1.6 million for year ended 
31 December 2015 (2014: £1.3 million).
The Group does not have any customers from whom revenue exceeds 10% of total revenue.

4. Operating segments
The Group has voluntarily complied with IFRS 8 Operating Segments. The Group has two reportable segments. In addition,  
there is a Group corporate function providing finance, management and IT services to the Group’s reportable segments. The 
reportable segments offer different products and services, and are managed separately because they require different capabilities, 
technology and marketing strategies. For each of the reportable segments, the Board (the chief operating decision maker) reviews 
internal management reports on a monthly basis. The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group’s 
reportable segments:
• Exhibitions & Festivals: organiser of market-leading tradeshows, congresses and festivals.
• Information Services: produces intelligence, analysis and forecasting tools, subscription content including real-time online 
resources, live events and awards, across a number of industry sectors including fashion, retail, property, construction 
and politics.
Information regarding the results of each reportable segment is included below. Reportable segment profits are measured at an 
Adjusted operating profit level, representing reportable segment Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in Note 1 (s), less depreciation costs 
and amortisation in respect of software intangibles, without allocation of central Group costs. This is the measure included in the 
internal management reports that are reviewed by the Board. Reportable segment Adjusted EBITDA and reportable segment 
Adjusted operating profit are used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in 
evaluating the results of certain reportable segments relative to other comparable entities.

Exceptional items are not a defined term under IFRS, so may not be comparable to similar terminology used in other financial 
statements. The Board believes that reporting results in this way provides additional useful information to the users of the 
non-statutory financial statements.
The acquisition-related contingent employment costs relate to the acquisition of Money20/20 in 2014. Under the sale and 
purchase agreement an element of the deferred consideration is contingent on both (i) the results of the business in 2015-17 and 
(ii) the continued employment of certain of the vendors. In accordance with IFRS, this element of the deferred consideration is 
treated as an expense and expensed over the service lives of those vendors. In 2015 this expense amounted to £5.5 million for 
the full 12 months (2014: £1.8 million for a four-month period). 
Exceptional costs relating to the IPO of £1.7 million were expensed in 2015, with the remainder of the IPO-related cost expected 
to be expensed in 2016 either as a further exceptional item or as an offset against the share premium reserve.

2015 the total Group charge amounted to £2.1 million (2014: £2.1 million). At 31 December 2015 there are £0.3 million 
contributions outstanding (2014: £0.3 million) at the year end. 54 ASCENTIAL HOLDINGS LIMITED – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015

Exceptional items are not a defined term under IFRS, so may not be comparable to similar terminology used in other financial 
statements. The Board believes that reporting results in this way provides additional useful information to the users of the 
non-statutory financial statements.
The acquisition-related contingent employment costs relate to the acquisition of Money20/20 in 2014. Under the sale and 
purchase agreement an element of the deferred consideration is contingent on both (i) the results of the business in 2015-17 and 
(ii) the continued employment of certain of the vendors. In accordance with IFRS, this element of the deferred consideration is 
treated as an expense and expensed over the service lives of those vendors. In 2015 this expense amounted to £5.5 million for 
the full 12 months (2014: £1.8 million for a four-month period). 
Exceptional costs relating to the IPO of £1.7 million were expensed in 2015, with the remainder of the IPO-related cost expected 
to be expensed in 2016 either as a further exceptional item or as an offset against the share premium reserve.

scheme are held by independent custodians and are kept entirely separate from the assets of the Group. The pension charge 
represents contributions due from the UK employer and other smaller overseas employers. During the year ended 31 December 
2015 the total Group charge amounted to £2.1 million (2014: £2.1 million). At 31 December 2015 there are £0.3 million 
contributions outstanding (2014: £0.3 million) at the year end. 56 ASCENTIAL HOLDINGS LIMITED – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015

If new information obtained within one year from the acquisition date, about facts and circumstances that existed at the 
acquisition date, identifies adjustments to the above amounts or any additional provisions that existed at the acquisition date, then 
the acquisition accounting will be revised. 
(b) Acquisition-related costs
The Group incurred acquisition-related costs of £0.5 million related to external legal fees and due diligence costs. These costs 
have been included within exceptional items in the consolidated profit and loss statement.

From the date of acquisition, RNG contributed £1.8 million revenue and a profit before tax from continuing operations of £0.4 
million to the Group in the year ended 31 December 2015. If the combination had taken place at the beginning of 2015, revenue 
from continuing operations would have been £3.5 million and the profit before tax from continuing operations for the Group 
would have been £0.6 million. In determining these amounts, management has assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose 
on the date of the acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition occurred on 1 January 2015.
2014 – acquisition of Money20/20, LLC
On 29 August 2014, the Group acquired 100% of the shares in Money20/20, LLC (“Money20/20”), an unlisted company based in 
the US whose primary activity is the organisation of global events on payments and financial services innovation.

• £16.7 million paid in 2015;
• deferred consideration contingent on the revenues of the 2015, 2016 and 2017 financial years payable in 2016–2018 and 
estimated to total £14.1 million which has been discounted to present value of £11.5 million using the Group’s Exhibitions 
& Festivals segment using a risk free discount rate; and 
• cash acquired of £1.4 million.
There is no maximum or minimum limit on the contingent consideration payable.

On 1 April 2015 the UK corporation tax rate reduced from 21% to 20%, resulting in a statutory UK corporation tax rate for the 
year of 20.25%. The Group’s effective tax rate is lower than the UK’s statutory tax rate in the main due to the recognition of 
previously unrecognised tax US losses as a result of increasing certainty over future taxable profits against which these tax assets 
can be recovered. 
Factors that may affect future tax charges:
The 2015 Autumn Statement announcement included a proposal to reduce the main rate of UK corporation tax from 20% to 19% 
and 18% from 1 April 2017 and 1 April 2020 respectively. As these reductions were substantively enacted, by the consolidated 
statement of financial position date, the deferred tax assets and liabilities have been measured at the reduced rates applicable 
when the assets and liabilities are forecast to reverse. The rate of writing down allowances on the main pool of plant and 
machinery and on the special rate pool remain unchanged at 18% and 8% respectively. 58 ASCENTIAL HOLDINGS LIMITED – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015

The Group tests goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications  
of impairment. The CGUs used in testing for impairment are in line with the segment note disclosure (Note 4). When testing  
for impairment, recoverable amounts for all of the Group’s CGUs are measured at their value-in-use by discounting the future 
expected cash flows from the assets in the CGUs. These calculations use cash flow projections based on Board approved  
budgets and plans.

11. Intangible fixed assets continued
Brand value and customer relationships include £70.8 million (2014: £70.8 million) with an indefinite life which is not being 
amortised. These intangible assets are included within the Exhibitions & Festivals segment.  This relates to Cannes Lions and  
was identified on acquisition by the Group in 2008. This brand has an indefinite life due to the strength of its recognition and 
revenue stream and is tested annually for impairment. It was tested for impairment as part of the Exhibitions & Festivals  
segment CGU using the value-in-use inputs disclosed below.
The key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations are as follows: 
Exhibitions & 
Festivals

Services
Year ended 31 December 2015
Long-term growth rate 2.5% 2.5%
Pre-tax discount rate 9.2% 9.8%
Year ended 31 December 2014
Long-term growth rate 2.5% 2.5%
Pre-tax discount rate 10.0% 10.3%
The measurement of value-in-use is sensitive to changes in these key assumptions and in the assumptions about economic  
growth and market penetration that underpin the cash flow projections. 
The Directors have sensitised the key assumptions, including the discount rate, and under both base case and sensitised case no 
indicators of impairment exist. The Directors believe that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which the 
recoverable amount is based would not cause the carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.

following the commitment of the Group’s management to dispose of the businesses in December 2014. A purchase had been 
agreed with the prospective buyer, and the sale was completed in January 2015, refer to Note 8. The assets of the disposal group 
were valued at the lower of their book value and fair value less costs to sell. The goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and 
equipment associated with businesses were reclassified as assets held for sale, as disclosed in Note 11 and Note 12 respectively. 
17. Financial assets
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, financial derivative assets and trade and other receivables.  
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables (see Note 15). The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative 
financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit  
rating agencies. The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a number of counterparties 
and customers.

undertaking at 31 December 2015 £16.5 million (2014: £13.5 million) are not included.
The fair value of each category of the Group’s financial instruments approximates their carrying value in the Group’s consolidated 
statement of financial position.
Derivative financial instruments
Where financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair values, their measurement is classified into the following hierarchy:
• Level 1—quoted prices in active markets from identical assets or liabilities;
• Level 2—inputs other than quoted market prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices);
• Level 3—inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The Group had cross-currency swaps (level 2) at 31 December 2015 of £2.1 million (2014: £nil) of which £1.7 million is included 
within non-current liabilities, and interest rate caps (level 2) at 31 December 2015 of £1.0 million (2014: £nil) of which £0.6 million 
is included within non-current assets. The Group had interest rate swaps (level 2) at 31 December 2015 of £nil (2014: £2.8 million 
liability all of which were included in current liabilities as at 31 December 2014).
These derivative instruments were not traded in an active market and the fair value is determined by using third party valuations 
based on forward yield curves. This technique maximises the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as 
possible on entity specific estimates. All significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable. 
The cross-currency swaps were used to maintain an appropriate currency mix of the Group’s borrowings reflecting the Group’s 
mix of underlying cash flows.
The interest rate caps and swaps were used to cap or fix respectively an element of the Group’s external borrowings which all bear 
interest at floating rate. As at 31 December 2015, the total notional amount of outstanding interest rate swaps was £nil (2014: 
£230.6 million) that swapped floating interest rates into fixed interest rates. As at 31 December 2015, the total notional amount of 
outstanding interest rate caps to which the Group is committed is £231.2 million (2014: £nil). The fair value of the interest rate 
caps and swaps as at 31 December 2015 is a £1.0 million asset (2014: £2.8 million liability). The borrowing facilities B1 and B2 
were subject to a 1% interest floor.

The fair value of each category of the Group’s financial instruments approximates their carrying value in the Group’s consolidated 
statement of financial position.
Derivative financial instruments
Where financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair values, their measurement is classified into the following hierarchy:
• Level 1—quoted prices in active markets from identical assets or liabilities;
• Level 2—inputs other than quoted market prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices);
• Level 3—inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The Group had cross-currency swaps (level 2) at 31 December 2015 of £2.1 million (2014: £nil) of which £1.7 million is included 
within non-current liabilities, and interest rate caps (level 2) at 31 December 2015 of £1.0 million (2014: £nil) of which £0.6 million 
is included within non-current assets. The Group had interest rate swaps (level 2) at 31 December 2015 of £nil (2014: £2.8 million 
liability all of which were included in current liabilities as at 31 December 2014).
These derivative instruments were not traded in an active market and the fair value is determined by using third party valuations 
based on forward yield curves. This technique maximises the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as 
possible on entity specific estimates. All significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable. 
The cross-currency swaps were used to maintain an appropriate currency mix of the Group’s borrowings reflecting the Group’s 
mix of underlying cash flows.
The interest rate caps and swaps were used to cap or fix respectively an element of the Group’s external borrowings which all bear 
interest at floating rate. As at 31 December 2015, the total notional amount of outstanding interest rate swaps was £nil (2014: 
£230.6 million) that swapped floating interest rates into fixed interest rates. As at 31 December 2015, the total notional amount of 
outstanding interest rate caps to which the Group is committed is £231.2 million (2014: £nil). The fair value of the interest rate 
caps and swaps as at 31 December 2015 is a £1.0 million asset (2014: £2.8 million liability). The borrowing facilities B1 and B2 
were subject to a 1% interest floor.

The financial and derivative liabilities are shown in the time period in which they are due to be repaid. The interest payments on 
borrowings due in less than one month, represents the actual interest due, while the interest due greater than one month is an 
estimate based on current interest rates and exchange rates. Cash flows in respect of borrowings represent contractual payments 
under the Group’s lending facilities in place as of December 2015.  Borrowings as disclosed in Note 21 are stated net of 
unamortised arrangement fees of £10.5 million as at 31 December 2015 (2014: £3.9 million) and net of Senior Debt repurchased 
held at the consolidated statement of financial position date of £nil (2014: £nil).
21. Borrowings 
The maturity profile of the Group’s borrowings, all of which are secured loans, was as follows:
(£ million) 2015 2014
Current – within one year 2.4 15.1
Non-current:
– In the second year 2.4 10.4

Non-current  423.2 410.2
Total borrowings 425.6 425.3
The Group’s borrowings at 31 December 2015 were in US dollars: $321 million and euros: €299 million (2014: pounds sterling: 
£198 million, US dollars: $155 million and euros: €169 million) and are shown net of unamortised issue costs. The carrying 
amounts of borrowings approximate their fair value. The carrying value of the Group’s borrowing facilities at 31 December 2015 is 
detailed in Note 2.  66 ASCENTIAL HOLDINGS LIMITED – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015
21. Borrowings continued
Each 1% movement in the euro to pounds sterling exchange rate has a circa £2.2 million impact on the carrying value of  
borrowings. Each 1% movement in the US dollar to pounds sterling exchange rate has a circa £2.2 million impact on the carrying  
value of borrowings, offset by a circa £1.1 million impact on the carrying value of derivative financial instruments in respect of 
cross-currency swaps.
In April 2014, the Group completed a currency redenomination of some of its senior term debt. In total, £60.0 million of pounds 
sterling debt was redenominated into €72.2 million of euro debt.   
In January 2015, the Group raised an additional £15.0 million of short-term debt consisting of a £6.0 million pounds sterling term 
loan and a £9.0 million multi-currency revolving credit.  The term on each of these facilities was 6 months.  The facility was repaid 
and cancelled in April 2015.
In April 2015, the Group completed a refinancing of its borrowings to improve terms and extend maturities. The existing senior, 
mezzanine and facilities and short-term debt facilities referred to above were repaid in full and new facilities put in place 
comprising a $323 million and a €300 million term loan maturing in April 2022 and a £75 million revolving credit facility maturing 
in April 2021.
The effective annual interest rate at 31 December 2015 was 6.0% (2014: 6.29%).

25. Deferred tax continued
At 31 December 2015, the Group has net deferred tax liabilities provided across the categories set out above totalling £0.5 million 
(2014: £14.2 million liability), of which £2.3 million is payable to the Group (2014: £0.6 million) within one year and £1.8 million 
(2014: £25.5 million) payable by the Group after more than one year. The reduction in the net liability position in the year arises 
from the increased level of recognition of tax assets in respect of tax losses as well as the continued amortisation of intangible 
assets and the associated deferred tax liability. 
The Group has trading tax losses in the US totalling £94.7 million carried forward at 31 December 2015 (2014: £105.0 million). It 
has been agreed with the US tax authorities that these losses are available for offset against taxable profits. However, it is 
expected that these losses will be subject to change of ownership restrictions following the listing of Ascential plc as described in 
Note 33. A deferred tax asset of £11.5 million (2014: £9.6 million) has been recognised which represents the expected 
recoverable value of losses taking into account the expected impact of these restrictions. The restriction of losses is dependent on 
the valuation of the US business which will need to be agreed with the US tax authorities and, as such, is uncertain.  The deferred 
tax asset recognised is based on management’s best estimate of the valuation.
The Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset on US capital losses at 31 December 2015 totalling £164.9 million (2014: 
£178.4 million) which have varying expiry dates from 2016 to 2025.
The Group has trading and non-trading tax losses in the UK totalling £68.3 million carried forward at 31 December 2015 (2014: 
£82.7 million) which are likely to be fully utilised. Therefore a deferred tax asset of £13.1 million (2014: £16.3 million) has been 
recognised in respect of the full amount of these losses.
The Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset on UK capital losses at 31 December 2015 totalling £146.3 million (2014: 
£146.0 million) which can be carried forward indefinitely.
No deferred tax liability is recognised on the unremitted earnings for overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures as any remittances 
would not give rise to tax payable in the foreseeable future.

The Group leases various offices under non-cancellable operating lease agreements. The leases have various terms, escalation 
clauses and renewal rights. The Group also leases other equipment under non-cancellable operating lease agreements. The Group 
does not have any finance leases.
30. Commitments and contingencies
Contracted commitments for capital expenditure relating to the Group’s business applications at 31 December 2015 totalled £0.5 
million (2014: £1.8 million). The Group has commitments under a non-cancellable contract as part of the Group’s outsourcing of 
part of its accounting functions whereby it is committed to six months of contractual payments with an annual charge of £1.1 
million (2014: £1.1 million). 
31. Related party transactions
At 31 December 2015 the Group owed £16.5 million to Hazel Acquisition 1 Limited (2014: £13.5 million) in relation to utilisation 
of tax losses, and was owed £nil by Eden 2 & Cie S.C.A. (2014: £68,656). The Group paid £nil to Eden 2 & Cie S.C.A. in relation to 
the issue of shares in that company to senior managers of the Group (2014: £12,682). The Group also incurred £250,877 of costs 
which Apax had incurred and recharged to Apax Europe VII GP Co. Limited, which were subsequently recharged to the Group 
(2014: £78,883). There were also £nil (2014: £27,653) costs from GMG which were recharged to the Group. 
In addition, GMG acts as the UK representative for and is a sponsorship customer of Cannes Lions. In the year ending 
31 December 2015, the Group received £94,577 (2014: £104,757) of revenue from GMG and billed a further £24,484 relating to 
2016 sponsorship. There were no other related party transactions throughout the year.
32. Remuneration of Directors and key management personnel 
The remuneration of Directors was as follows:
(£ million) 2015 2014
Emoluments for services to the Group 1.0 0.2
Retirement benefits were not accrued for any Director at 31 December 2015 (2014: one under a money purchase scheme).
None of the Directors received remuneration for their services from Ascential Holdings Limited (2014: none). Duncan Painter and 
Mandy Gradden were remunerated by other members of the Group. Frank Ehmer and Tom Hall have an indirect interest in the 
value of the Group through their interests in funds advised by Apax Partners.  68 ASCENTIAL HOLDINGS LIMITED – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015
25. Deferred tax continued
At 31 December 2015, the Group has net deferred tax liabilities provided across the categories set out above totalling £0.5 million 
(2014: £14.2 million liability), of which £2.3 million is payable to the Group (2014: £0.6 million) within one year and £1.8 million 
(2014: £25.5 million) payable by the Group after more than one year. The reduction in the net liability position in the year arises 
from the increased level of recognition of tax assets in respect of tax losses as well as the continued amortisation of intangible 
assets and the associated deferred tax liability. 
The Group has trading tax losses in the US totalling £94.7 million carried forward at 31 December 2015 (2014: £105.0 million). It 
has been agreed with the US tax authorities that these losses are available for offset against taxable profits. However, it is 
expected that these losses will be subject to change of ownership restrictions following the listing of Ascential plc as described in 
Note 33. A deferred tax asset of £11.5 million (2014: £9.6 million) has been recognised which represents the expected 
recoverable value of losses taking into account the expected impact of these restrictions. The restriction of losses is dependent on 
the valuation of the US business which will need to be agreed with the US tax authorities and, as such, is uncertain.  The deferred 
tax asset recognised is based on management’s best estimate of the valuation.
The Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset on US capital losses at 31 December 2015 totalling £164.9 million (2014: 
£178.4 million) which have varying expiry dates from 2016 to 2025.
The Group has trading and non-trading tax losses in the UK totalling £68.3 million carried forward at 31 December 2015 (2014:

“I am pleased to report that 2006 has been another successful year for Charter. The Company has achieved excellent results with
operating profits having increased by 41 per cent to £143.2 million, pre tax profits by 40 per cent to £144.6 million and adjusted
earnings per share by 56 per cent to 67.2 pence per share.
The results achieved in 2006 show that both of Charter’s businesses, ESAB and Howden, have successfully built upon the
restructuring efforts of recent years and made the most of opportunities presented by strong markets. In doing so, both
businesses have achieved significant volume growth and improvements in operating margins. In 2006, ESAB’s and Howden’s
operating margins were 11.9 per cent (2005: 10.3 per cent) and 11.5 per cent (2005: 9.7 per cent) respectively.
The trading in ESAB and Howden in the first two months of 2007 has been encouraging and continues to benefit from
favourable market conditions. Demand for ESAB’s products generally remains strong in the key markets in which it operates,
and particularly so in emerging markets. For Howden, order intake in the first two months of the year has been strong,
especially from the power market in North America.
For these reasons, and in the light of the excellent results achieved in 2006, the Board views the trading prospects of the
Company and its businesses for 2007 with increasing confidence.”

Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to report that 2006 has been another successful
year for Charter. The Company has achieved excellent results
with operating profits having increased by 41 per cent to
£143.2 million, pre tax profits by 40 per cent to £144.6 million
and adjusted earnings per share by 56 per cent to 67.2 pence
per share.
In 2006, ESAB’s and Howden’s operating margins were
11.9 per cent (2005: 10.3 per cent) and 11.5 per cent (2005:
9.7 per cent) respectively.
As shown in the table opposite, in 2006 Charter generated sales
of £1,257.9 million (2005: £1,065.7 million), an increase of 18 per
cent, and operating profit of £143.2 million (2005: £101.7 million),
an increase of 41 per cent. Profit before tax was £144.6 million
(2005: £103.5 million), an increase of 40 per cent, and profit
attributable to equity shareholders was £122.0 million (2005: £74.0
million), an increase of 65 per cent. Adjusted earnings per share
were 67.2 pence (2005: 43.0 pence), an increase of 56 per cent.
Tax
The tax charge fell, despite increased profits, to £16.9 million
(2005: £20.0 million) due to a reduction in the adjusted effective
tax rate for the year to 19.6 per cent (2005: 21.4 per cent),
mainly as a consequence of increased profits generated in low
tax jurisdictions, and an exceptional tax credit of £10.5 million
(2005: nil) arising from the recognition of deferred tax assets
in North America.
Cash flow
During the year, cash generated from operations was £106.8
million (2005: £84.5 million), an increase of 26 per cent. Capital
expenditure was £26.9 million (2005: £22.2 million), an increase
of 21 per cent, whereas the depreciation charge amounted to
only £13.5 million (2005: £14.7 million). Net debt, which stood
at £6.5 million at the end of 2005, was eliminated and at
31 December 2006 there was net cash of £43.1 million.

Board
On 1 July 2006 Michael Foster, who had previously been
Commercial Director, succeeded me as Chief Executive and
I assumed a transitional role as part-time Executive Chairman.
James Deeley joined the Board of the Company as Legal
Director and Company Secretary on 10 July 2006.
Retirement benefit obligations
As at 31 December 2006, net retirement benefit obligations,
as provided for in the consolidated balance sheet, amounted
to £108.6 million (2005: £127.1 million) and gross defined
benefit liabilities are £663.2 million (2005: £690.5 million),
the great majority of which are in respect of past employees.
The liabilities in respect of retirement benefits are subject
to movements in long term interest rates and changes in life
expectancy. The net retirement benefit obligations are also
subject to movements in the value of assets held by the schemes,
which are principally shares and bonds. Future cash contributions
to the schemes will also depend on other factors, such as the
outcome of negotiations with the pension trustees and changes
in legislation.
In respect of 2006, an amount of £3.2 million (2005: £7.6 million)
was charged against operating profit in relation to defined benefit
schemes and overseas medical costs. The cash contribution
into the schemes during the year was £17.5 million (2005:
£18.4 million).
Contingent liabilities
As previously disclosed, the Company and certain of its subsidiary
undertakings are named as defendants in a number of lawsuits
in the United States. These claims continue to be vigorously
defended and further details are set out in Note 26 to the
consolidated financial statements.
Equity shareholders’ funds
Shareholders will be aware that at 31 December 2004 equity
shareholders’ funds were only £11.5 million and indeed were in
deficit a few years earlier. During the past two years, the balance
sheet has been strengthened in part through the rights issue
in 2004 which raised £44.6 million and in part through retained
earnings, such that, by 31 December 2006, equity shareholders’
funds had grown to £250.7 million.
Despite the substantial improvement in equity shareholders’
funds that has been achieved over the past two years, the Board
believes that the scale and geographic spread of the Company’s
business activities necessitate a further strengthening of equity
shareholders’ funds through the retention of profit.
Dividend
In light of the above, the Board has decided not to recommend
a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2006 but
intends to review dividend policy later in the year and envisages
that the Company will declare a final dividend in respect of the
financial year ending 31 December 2007, provided that the
general economic environment and the trading and financial
condition of the Company and its businesses are broadly
in line with the Board’s current expectations.
Prospects
The trading in ESAB and Howden in the first two months of 2007
has been encouraging and continues to benefit from favourable
market conditions. Demand for ESAB’s products generally
remains strong in the key markets in which it operates, and
particularly so in emerging markets. For Howden, order intake
in the first two months of the year has been strong, especially
from the power market in North America.
For these reasons, and in the light of the excellent results achieved
in 2006, the Board views the trading prospects of the Company
and its businesses for 2007 with increasing confidence.

Chief Executive’s statement
ESAB and Howden are both market
leaders in their chosen fields, whose
technological strengths and
heritage are recognised by their
customers. Both businesses benefit
from their brand strengths which
have enabled them to deliver
customer benefitswhicharereflected
in the margin improvements that
they have achieved.
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to be able to present to you another excellent set
of results in my first report as Chief Executive. Building upon the
restructuring efforts of recent years, both of Charter’s businesses,
ESAB and Howden, have made the most of opportunities
presented by strong markets. In 2006, volume growth has been
significant in both businesses, and further progress has been made
in improving margins.
Business development
Both businesses are committed to further improvement and have
significant development opportunities. ESAB has achieved volume
growth in 2006 and, in many consumables markets, capacity
utilisation is already close to being maximised. To respond to this,
and in recognition of the development of the customer base in
emerging markets (especially China, the remainder of Asia and
Eastern Europe, including Russia), ESAB has committed to expand
its consumable production capacity by some 20 per cent between
June 2006 and June 2007. The opening of the consumables
factory near Shanghai, new flux capacity in Eastern Europe and
other measures currently underway mean that the achievement
of this objective is now in sight. Continued market strength,
and the growth of new industrial markets, indicate that further
increases in capacity will be required. Financial performance
is being increasingly underpinned by operational improvements,
as progress is made in lean manufacturing, supply chain
development and investment in lower cost economies. In North
America, the business weathered a strike at its main production
facility in Hanover, Pennsylvania. Following the strike, productivity
has improved and production levels are recovering.
As for Howden, the order book grew strongly during the first half
of 2006. Whilst the value of outstanding orders accounted for
by customers in China has reduced as power plant production
slows to return to the trend rate of growth of the Chinese
economy as a whole, new opportunities in Europe and North
America have enabled the order book to remain strong in the
second half of the year. Order intake in the first two months
of 2007 has been strong. As with most capital goods businesses,
the aftermarket represents a major opportunity. After a year of
consolidation in which low margin service work was eliminated,
aftermarket growth is expected to continue with strong margins,
with the Chinese aftermarket representing a significant

ESAB achieved sales of £828.4 million (2005: £720.1 million), an
increase of 15 per cent, operating profits of £98.9 million (2005:
£74.4 million), an increase of 33 per cent, and operating margins
of 11.9 per cent (2005: 10.3 per cent), an increase of 16 per cent.
Howden sales totalled £429.5 million (2005: £345.1 million), an
increase of 24 per cent, operating profits were £49.3 million, before
taking into account profit on the sale of property of £4.8 million,

opportunity. Howden is also in the process of introducing new
products into China. Geographically, we see opportunities from
the expansion of Howden’s business in South America and are
taking steps to ensure we are active in the potentially significant
Indian and Russian markets. We are pleased to have acquired
the outstanding shares in Howden Compressors, which will
enable us to re-focus this business and in turn this will support
our efforts to expand in the important petrochemical market.
Operating efficiencies have improved as volume growth has
been supported almost entirely by increased sub-contracting
activity rather than in-house manufacture. Continuous product
development and improvements in execution and application
engineering continue to enable Howden to stand out as the
leading business in its field.
The last few years have resulted in the creation of a culture
in Charter where performance is kept continuously in focus.
In relation to ESAB and Howden, the principal key performance
indicators monitored by the Board relate to growth in revenue
and operating profit and changes in operating margin. At the

Charter level, the Board focuses on growth in earnings per share
and cash generation.
The table sets out the financial key performance indicators in use
during the year and the outcomes for 2006 against those for 2005.
In relation to each indicator, the outcome for the year is considered
against the outcome for the previous year and budget, taking into
account internal and external factors and any unusual or non-
recurring items, which might otherwise have a distorting effect
on the outcome.
It is recognised that financial performance is not sufficient on
its own and non-financial key performance indicators are being
progressively rolled out. These include health and safety and
environmental measures which are monitored and measured
with robust plans in place to continuously improve performance.
These matters, together with risk management and business
continuity planning, receive regular focus both from management
and the Board. In addition to the economic risks and competitive
pressures which Charter’s businesses continuously face and
manage, Charter has faced significant litigation which continues
to be addressed as referred to in the Chairman’s statement and
more fully described elsewhere.
Charter will remain focussed on its two core businesses,
both of which are capable of further significant development.
The welding and cutting markets should grow in line with global
economic activity and increasing steel consumption. This remains
a fragmented industry and it is likely that further consolidation
will take place in the coming years. Charter intends that ESAB
will remain at the forefront of the industry and will play a part
in this trend provided always that any acquisitions provide the
opportunity to increase shareholder value. The continued and
growing needs of the power market and ongoing pressures
for environmental improvement will continue to provide Howden
with the scope for further development.
Robust industrial markets and the need to improve power
infrastructure mean that both businesses continue to benefit from
good market conditions, and are well placed to make further progress
as their plans for development are progressively implemented.

  What does the ESAB brand stand for?
The ESAB brand, with its Swedish engineering heritage,
is synonymous with good designs, reliability and over
100 years of experience since Oscar Kjellberg first invented
the coated welding electrode back in 1904. Since then, ESAB
has become a world leader in welding and cutting with sales,
technical support and know-how available across the world,
providing customers with complete confidence.
Today, ESAB produces consumables and equipment for
virtually every welding and cutting process and application.
ESAB's subsidiaries and distributors work in partnership
to find the optimum solution for customers’ businesses
wherever in the world that may be and however large
or small the requirement. 10 Charter plc Annual Report 2006
Major global end-user segments are:
• shipbuilding and offshore industries, which are amongst
the largest and most demanding users of both welding and
cutting products;
• construction, where welding plays an important role in the
fabrication of buildings, bridges, railways, and everything
needed to support expanding infrastructure. This is particularly
growing in the world’s emerging markets;
• transport (including automotive and mobile machinery), which
requires technically demanding welding solutions within highly
automated production environments. This sector also includes
‘off-road’ vehicles such as excavators, dumpers, and
agricultural equipment, which also require high levels of
welding;
• oil and gas and process industries, which include refineries,
petrochemicals, pulp and paper and food. These use many
types of material, including stainless steels and alloy materials
that require technically demanding welding solutions;
• the energy sector, which uses considerable quantities
of welding consumables in the construction of nuclear and
other energy generating plants. Wind towers are a rapidly
growing sub-segment of the electricity generating industry,
the construction of which uses relatively high levels of welding
consumables; and
• pipelines and pipe mills. This industry segment is related to
the oil and gas industry, but is focussed on the production and
installation of oil and gas pipeline networks across countries
and continents, for example from Siberia to Europe.
Overview of performance
ESAB recorded another excellent performance in 2006 with sales
of £828.4 million (2005: £720.1 million), an increase of 15.0 per
cent, and operating profit of £98.9 million (2005: £74.4 million),
an increase of 32.9 per cent. Operating margin improved to
11.9 per cent (2005: 10.3 per cent).
The sales growth of 15.0 per cent reflected continued strong
demand for ESAB products. Volumes were up in most product
areas, particularly welding consumables and standard equipment,
continuing the trend seen in the first half of the year with increased
demand from shipbuilding, oil and gas and other industries.
Currency movements accounted for less than 1 per cent of this
increase. Sales growth was underpinned by a robust performance
in Europe, with faster growth occurring in certain emerging
markets. The substantial increase in operating profit and margin
achieved by ESAB in 2006 reflected the strong underlying
demand for ESAB products and ongoing operational efficiency
gains, including recent capacity additions in lower cost locations
around the world.
Industries and segmentation
The global welding and cutting market revenues are estimated
to amount to in excess of US $15.5 billion per annum. The more
mature markets of Europe and North America account for just
under half of the global market, but this is matched by the share
of the more rapidly growing emerging markets within China and
the rest of the world.
The welding and cutting of steel and other metals takes place
to some extent in most industries. The most familiar applications
for ESAB’s products are in the production of capital goods and
infrastructure assets such as ships, trains and bridges. Process
industries such as food, drink, paper, plastics and energy make
extensive use of plant and machinery, the manufacture of which
can involve a significant amount of welding. Although steel
remains the most widely used metal, advanced alloys are being
increasingly used in the shipbuilding, automotive and certain
other industries.

Industry overview
Demand
Demand for welding and cutting products is determined
largely by worldwide consumption of steel and, to a lesser
but growing extent, of other metals, such as aluminium, which
is increasingly used in shipbuilding, transport and the fabrication
of capital equipment.
The International Iron and Steel Institute estimates world output
of crude steel in 2006 at 1,239.5 million metric tonnes (‘mmt’),
an increase of 8.8 per cent compared with 2005. China
produced 418.8 mmt (2005: 353.4 mmt), an increase of 18.5 per
cent, and accounted for 33.8 per cent of global steel production
(2005: 31.0 per cent). The rest of the world increased production
by 4.4 per cent with North America and the European Union
registering increases of 3.0 per cent and 5.9 per cent respectively.
ESAB estimates that worldwide consumption of weld metal
amounted to in excess of 4 mmt in 2006, of which some 70 per
cent was consumed in Asia. Worldwide growth is expected to
continue for the foreseeable future, led by increased consumption
in Asia and particularly China.
The welding market continues to experience ‘process conversion’
whereby end users migrate from the use of welding electrodes
and simple power sources to higher productivity welding
processes, which use continuous consumables such as solid
or flux cored welding wires, and require more advanced power
sources. Whilst this conversion process has reached close to
maturity in markets such as Europe, North America and Japan,
it will continue for the foreseeable future at varying rates within
the world’s emerging markets, particularly in China and
elsewhere in Asia.

Competitive environment
ESAB operates in a competitive environment, consisting of
a relatively small number of companies that operate on a
multinational basis, and a much larger number of smaller
companies which operate in regional or product niches.
ESAB estimates that it has an 11 per cent share of worldwide
sales of the welding and cutting industry. Globally, ESAB is one of
the two leading suppliers of welding consumables and, excluding
North America (where it ranks behind the two market leaders),
it is the clear industry leader.
ESAB aims to maintain and strengthen its competitive position
by being able to provide comprehensive, technically advanced
and cost effective solutions to customers’ welding and cutting
demands. ESAB’s brand and its Swedish engineering heritage
are important factors underpinning ESAB’s relationships with
existing and new customers. Given the relatively high costs
of transporting welding and cutting materials, the location of
welding consumables and equipment factories close to end-
users is also an important factor in maintaining competitiveness. 12 Charter plc Annual Report 2006
Human resources
ESAB has been strengthening its management team and key
technical roles in the last 12 months by identifying opportunities
to bring on board talented individuals and to enable the company
to achieve its long term goals.
ESAB has worked with Henley Management College to develop
a leadership development programme designed to provide
ESAB’s high potential employees with the opportunity to develop
their careers and to resource growth ambitions from within.
In total 31 staff from around the organisation have now been
enrolled in the programme since its launch in 2005.
ESAB recruits specialist technical staff and engineers from
around the world. For ESAB’s new R&D centre in Chennai,
India, a team of 22 researchers, engineers, and technicians
were hired to work on ESAB’s global technology initiatives.
Throughout the period ESAB recruited a number of production
personnel to meet the increase in production levels. ESAB
provides its production employees with a high level of job specific
training, for example through apprenticeship schemes.
Intellectual property
A key component of ESAB’s supply chain is its technology.
For example, the formulation of the electrode coating or cored
wire filling produces the unique welding properties of each
individual product. ESAB’s international development team has
a market leading competence and significant experience in these
areas. Similarly, manufacturing process knowledge is critical
to achieving optimal product characteristics as well as maximising
production efficiency, by which the customer benefits through
superior products and lower manufacturing costs.
ESAB is strongly focused on providing customers with complete
process solutions, and has built a number of process centres
throughout the world where experienced welding engineers
combine their knowledge with ESAB’s broad range of welding
and cutting products to develop the optimal solution for
each customer.
ESAB supply chain
Manufacturing locations
Europe remains ESAB’s most important region in terms
of production capacity, as well as sales. In recent years some
of the welding consumables production lines, and the
manufacturing of certain standard equipment ranges, have been
relocated within Europe from higher cost Western European
locations to Central and Eastern Europe, which are conveniently
situated in relation to end users and where production costs are
lower. In North America, some production has also been relocated
from the USA to Mexico. ESAB is increasing its welding and
cutting manufacturing capacity in Asia, with new factories having
been opened in China in 2005 and 2006, and with further
increases in capacity planned in future years.
All of ESAB’s automated welding installations are manufactured
at Laxå in Sweden. Cutting machines are manufactured at
Karben in Germany, Florence in the USA and at the recently
opened cutting factory in Shanghai, China.
Raw materials
The principal raw materials used in the manufacture of welding
consumables are various grades of steel and, to a lesser extent,
aluminium alloys, chemicals and minerals, most of which are
normally available on the open market. However, certain of
ESAB’s more specialised welding wires require bespoke orders
from the steel mill.
In the case of welding equipment, automation and cutting,
the most significant items purchased are electronic components,
copper and aluminium alloys.
Whilst energy costs are less significant than raw material costs
in ESAB’s own manufacturing process, they are significant costs
in the production of steel, aluminium and copper, and therefore
indirectly impact upon the cost of goods sold.
  Russia and the CIS – continued growth
ESAB has been supplying equipment for welding automation
and specialised consumables into Russia for many decades.
At the end of the 1990s, it established a sales company in
Moscow and acquired its first Russian electrode production
unit, a joint venture based in St Petersburg. Subsequently,
ESAB established a widespread distribution network, which
has helped to more than double sales revenues since the turn
of the millennium.
ESAB is now one of the biggest foreign participants in the
Russian welding equipment and consumables market, and
is the only global welding company with a manufacturing base
in Russia. ESAB has strong distribution coverage, customer
relations management and sales and marketing programmes.
New sales offices were established in the Ukraine and
Kazakhstan in 2006.
Future plans to increase market share in Russia include
continuing to develop electrode manufacturing capacity,
opening a new flux plant in St Petersburg in 2007
and continuing to expand the distribution network.

  QSet
ESAB launched a new technology that is revolutionising the
way welding parameters are optimised for short-arc welding.
When changing to weld different objects, often with different
angles, thicknesses of material or different shielding gases,
traditional MIG/MAG welding equipment normally requires
significant welder intervention to select a suitable program
including welding currents and wire feed speeds. ESAB’s
response is the intelligent QSet system, which after the
press of a single button and a short test weld, automatically
optimises the welding parameters. All the operator has to
do the next time is select a wire feed speed and QSet will
do the rest.
To the customer, QSet offers significant set up savings,
improved and repeatable weld quality and reduced post
weld cleaning, all of which help to ensure maximum levels
of productivity. 14 Charter plc Annual Report 2006
Business and financial review – ESAB (continued)
Revenue and cost analysis
During 2006, ESAB’s sales were £828.4 million (2005: £720.1
million), an increase of 15.0 per cent.
Of this amount, welding sales, which comprise predominantly
welding consumables and welding equipment, were £698.6
million (2005: £607.8 million), an increase of 14.9 per cent, and
represented 84.3 per cent (2005: 84.4 per cent) of ESAB’s total
sales. Cutting and automation sales were £129.8 million (2005:
£112.3 million), an increase of 15.6 per cent, and represented
15.7 per cent (2005: 15.6 per cent) of ESAB’s total sales.
The selling prices of ESAB’s products remained generally stable
throughout the year. ESAB increased its operating margins due
to the strong underlying demand for its products. This demand
led to higher utilisation rates at its factories and better overhead
recovery rates. Margins also benefited from ongoing operational
efficiency gains, including recent capacity additions in lower cost
locations around the world.
In respect of raw materials, prices for wire rod were flat in the
first half of the year and showed a slight increase in the second
half. ESAB was able to mitigate increases in the market price
of stainless products through fixed price contracts. Energy and
transport costs rose during the year due to oil price movements.
Regional overview of performance
In 2006, Europe and North America together accounted for
73.5 per cent of its total sales (2005: 75.3 per cent). During 2006,
ESAB once again experienced sales growth in all five regions.
Regional markets
Europe
Europe (including Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent
States (‘CIS’)) remains ESAB’s most important region, representing
48.2 per cent of its total sales during the year.
In Europe, ESAB experienced sales growth in 2006 of 15.5 per
cent, with particularly strong growth in the Nordic and Germanic
regions, and also in France. Russia and other emerging European
markets also performed extremely well, and ESAB continues to
expand its sales presence and strengthen its manufacturing and
logistics operations in these markets. The shipbuilding, offshore,
energy and industrial segments continue to grow strongly,
whilst in emerging European markets, continued investment
in infrastructure meant that construction and related industries
also performed well.
Increased volumes were seen across most types of welding
consumables. The ESAB Marathon Pac
TM
system and
the AristoRod
TM
copper free wires showed particularly
strong growth.
Sales offices have been established in the Ukraine, Kazakhstan
and the Baltics (Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia). In addition,
a Romanian office will be opened in early 2007.
A number of new product launches during 2006 in MIG and
TIG welding machines and a new marketing initiative focussed
on Germany and Poland contributed significantly to the growth
in standard equipment sales.
Demand for fully automated welding processes remained
robust, whilst the cutting business generally performed well,
and experienced particularly good growth in medium range
machines and the aftermarket.
  Why do customers buy ESAB products?
A recent customer survey identified the following reasons:
• ESAB is able to solve customers’ welding problems.
• ESAB provides innovative and dependable solutions.
• ESAB’s Swedish engineering heritage.
• The reliability of ESAB’s products provides customers
with peace of mind.
• ESAB provides excellent technical support to customers
worldwide.
• ESAB’s ISO 14001 accreditation underlines its
environmental responsibility.

North America
ESAB Group Inc. has a leading presence in the North American
welding and cutting industry. In 2006, sales in North America
were £210.2 million (2005: £197.1 million), an increase
of 6.6 per cent.
Sales of welding consumables and equipment generally performed
ahead of 2005. Most industries that are significant users of welding
products have been strong, the principal exception being
the domestic automotive industry that is experiencing well
documented trading difficulties.
This result was achieved notwithstanding a strike over working
practices at the plant in Hanover, Pennsylvania, resolved
in November 2006, which disrupted production. The facility
continued to operate throughout the strike period and production
levels are recovering. Significant management attention is being
paid to customer service to avoid any significant long term impact
on market share.
The equipment and cutting businesses continued to grow
at generally the same rate as seen in 2005.
South America
During the year sales grew by some 17.6 per cent, reflecting
increased volumes and also an appreciation of the Brazilian
Real against Sterling, partly offset by weakening selling prices
in some product areas.
The appreciation of the Brazilian Real against the US Dollar and
other key currencies reduced the international competitiveness
of the Brazilian economy and led to a general softening of
demand and price erosion in certain product areas. In the light
of these developments, ESAB has increased production of
certain items at its Argentinean facilities, which saw improved
results as a consequence.
Despite economic factors, certain market sectors, including sugar
and alcohol and the Brazilian automotive industry, remained
relatively strong. However, shipbuilding, the offshore energy
industry and agricultural equipment weakened during the year.
Production capacity for welding wire is being further increased
in Argentina with new equipment set to be commissioned
in spring 2007.
Sales of Eutectic products, which are made under licence by ESAB
in Brazil, increased markedly in some part due to a large contract
signed with one of the largest iron ore producers in the region.
China
2006 saw significant progress in ESAB’s strategy of establishing
a meaningful manufacturing and sales presence in the country.
Sales for the year were £20.9 million, up 40.2 per cent from 2005.
In July, ESAB’s newest consumables factory was officially
opened in Zhangjiagang in Jiangsu province. Capacity at the
Zhangjiagang facility has been commissioned since July in line
with the plan. Sales to local customers have commenced as well
as sales to the wider Asian region. Product from the new factory
is also being exported to meet high levels of demand in Europe
and elsewhere.
Further expansion of ESAB’s capacity to manufacture welding
consumables is being planned to meet the continuing growth
in the Chinese manufacturing and construction industries and
global demand.
ESAB’s cutting operation in China has provided significantly
increased sales in 2006, and the volume of cutting machines
shipped in 2006 also increased significantly compared to the
previous year. At the end of the year orders on hand were
at record levels.
Rest of world
Asia (excluding China)
In 2006, ESAB performed well, mainly due to volume driven sales
growth from key shipbuilding and oil and gas customers. ESAB’s
future growth will target the most dynamic industries such as the
automotive, shipbuilding and energy sectors. Particularly strong
performance was seen in Singapore, Malaysia and Australia.
  Providing fresh water in the Middle East
As the world’s population grows, so does the demand for fresh
water. As a result those areas, like the Middle East, that do
not have enough sources of fresh water depend on industrial
desalination of seawater. In building desalination plants,
specialist welding consumables and welding procedures have
to be selected to ensure metal joints are corrosion resistant
to the salt water used in the desalination process. ESAB has
developed a full range of welding products to meet the
demands of this growing market. 16 Charter plc Annual Report 2006
Middle East and Africa
In the Middle East, ESAB’s revenue has seen continued strong
growth in 2006, led principally by increasing sales to the UAE
and Qatar, reflecting the strength of the energy and construction
sectors in those areas.
ESAB delivered a substantial quantity of stainless materials for
large liquefied natural gas projects in Qatar and is supplying both
welding consumables and equipment to a high profile offshore
contract in Dubai. Considerable efforts and resources were
focussed on expanding the ESAB business in Saudi Arabia
with substantial success in 2006.
Sales to certain countries were affected by political uncertainties
in the region.
Associated undertakings
ESAB’s share of the post tax profits of associates was £4.3 million
(2005: £3.4 million), an increase of 26.5 per cent.
India
ESAB owns 38 per cent of ESAB India Limited which reported
improved revenues and profits in favourable market conditions.
A new equipment assembly factory is being built by ESAB India
in Irungattukottai, Chennai, which should be fully operational
in 2007.
South Korea
ESAB owns 50 per cent of ESAB SeAH Corporation, which
made an increased contribution to the results for the year.
2006 technical developments and new products
Welding
Consumables product development for cored wires, solid wires,
fluxes and stick electrodes resulted in new product offerings and
a large number of upgrades. The cored wire product range has
been expanded with a number of products for use particularly
in the repair of concast rollers in steel mills and a broadened
range of robotic quality wires with superior operability. The flux
development programme produced new products for pipe mills
and for high speed welding.
In relation to welding equipment, ESAB introduced a number
of new products related to the tungsten inert gas (‘TIG’) welding
process, including a number of power sources supplying up
to 300 amperes and a new range of TIG torches which provide
better arc performance, easier operation and better ergonomics
for the welder. ESAB also launched specialised equipment
for welding the frames for wind tower manholes at far greater
weld deposit rates than possible before.
During the year, ESAB opened a research and development
facility in Chennai, India for consumables and process centre
activities and for welding equipment and cutting systems.
Cutting and automation
In 2006, the key cutting developments focussed on improving
value and productivity for the end user. These included reducing
the M³ Plasma cutting and marking machines’ start up time and
Production Profiling Software for planning, tracking, reporting
and monitoring which allows the user to control numerous
control functions in real time.
ESAB is already a leader in welding equipment for integration
with robots and other welding automation systems. ESAB’s new
design of automated welding packages for robotic applications
brings productivity benefits to customers from the higher volume
production of manual inverter based welding power sources.
Business and financial review – ESAB (continued)
  ESAB opens new research and development centre
In October 2006, ESAB officially opened its new research
and development centre in Chennai, India. This state-of-the-
art facility supports ESAB’s worldwide research and innovation
programmes. Researchers and engineers work with their
global partners in areas like welding equipment, cutting
systems, welding processes and consumables to further
enhance ESAB’s technology. Charter plc Annual Report 2006 17
Future developments and longer term growth prospects
Market expansion
To support longer term growth, ESAB is developing its presence
in certain key markets, in particular China, Central and Eastern
Europe, South America and South East Asia, where it sees
excellent prospects for the full range of its welding, cutting
and automation products. The completion of a programme of
projects in these areas, which will increase ESAB’s total capacity
for the manufacture of welding consumables by around 20 per
cent between June 2006 and June 2007, is in sight. Beyond that,
further expansion in capacity, particularly in China, is anticipated
which will be utilised to meet demand for ESAB’s products in
Europe and North America as well as throughout Asia. In other
developing markets, such as certain former CIS countries and
the Middle East, ESAB’s presence is being enhanced through
the opening of new sales offices and distribution centres.
Global demand is strong and ESAB’s factories are operating
at high levels of capacity utilisation. To meet this demand,
the capacity of existing facilities has been raised through the
introduction of additional shifts and increased manning levels,
and through targeted investment programmes. The growing
demand will increasingly be supplied with product manufactured
in ESAB’s factories in lower cost locations.
New products and applications
A key element in ESAB’s growth plans is the continuous
development of new welding products which reflect trends
in the global industry, and in particular customers seeking higher
productivity from a generally less skilled workforce. This often
involves the welding of increasingly sophisticated materials
which require suitably stronger welding materials of the
same composition.
A number of new welding consumable products have recently
entered the customer testing phase, including new submerged
arc welding fluxes for high speed welding and new cored
wires and hand welding electrodes for the offshore and
shipyard sectors. ESAB is also developing new products
for applications including nuclear power, offshore wind-farms
and desalination plants.
Co-operation continues with various institutes, universities and
steel producers in the search for weld metals to match properties
of new materials, with fields of research ranging from high
strength steels to advanced corrosion resistant alloys and
high temperature grades.
Lean manufacturing
Following the success of the pilot programmes in 2005,
ESAB accelerated the drive to become a Lean-manufacturing
organisation. During the first half of the year, model lines were set
up at Vamberk, Czech Republic and Laxå, Sweden. The new
consumables plant in China is being started up as a Lean facility.
The programme is being rolled out to all ESAB factories globally.
In 2007, additional manufacturing sites, along with some support
functions, will be added to the programme. 18 Charter plc Annual Report 2006
Business and financial review – Howden
Howden is an international applications engineer with a world-leading
position in the design, supply and servicing of air and gas handling
equipment.

Business and financial review – Howden (continued)
Overview of performance
Howden achieved another set of excellent results in 2006 with
sales of £429.5 million (2005: £345.1 million), an increase of
24.5 per cent, and operating profit for the period, before taking
into account a profit of £4.8 million on the sale of property, of
£49.3 million (2005: £33.5 million), an increase of 47.2 per cent.
Net operating margin (before property profit) increased substantially
to 11.5 per cent (2005: 9.7 per cent).
The sales increase reflected higher volumes for new equipment
and stable selling prices, partially offset by lower aftermarket
sales. Of the 24.5 per cent increase in sales, the net impact
of foreign currency movements was negligible.
The closing order book grew to £361 million (2005: £304 million),
with the increase occurring in the first half of the year. Although
China still represents the largest and most important market
to the Howden business, its relative importance reduced during
the year such that, as at 31 December 2006, the Chinese market
accounted for 27 per cent of the order book, compared with
43 per cent at 31 December 2005, with the proportion of the
order book accounted for by customers in Europe and North
America increasing.
The substantial increase in operating profit achieved by Howden
in 2006 reflects the continued strong underlying demand
for Howden products, in particular, from the electricity supply
industry and the oil and gas sectors. Howden continued to
benefit from ongoing operational benefits due to higher volumes
and greater factory efficiency as well as other benefits from
the restructuring programmes completed in recent years.
The increased use of sub-contractors also contributed
to improved operating margins.
Howden recorded slightly lower aftermarket sales of £110.2 million
(2005: £122.0 million), due to low margin service work being
eliminated in Europe, a number of projects being completed
in Australia and the depreciation of the South African currency.
Despite this, profit and margin both increased as the business
refocussed on higher margin work.
Industries and segmentation
As at the end of 2006, the total market for Howden products was
estimated at £1.7 billion, of which the power, petrochemical and
oil and gas industries are the largest components. Other users of
Howden products include the mining and iron and steel industries.
The products supplied by Howden to its principal global end-user
market segments include:
• power generation – fans and rotary heat exchangers for
boilers, flue gas desulphurisation (‘FGD’) plant and denitrification
processes; cooling fans for dry cooling systems;
• petrochemical plant and oil and gas – fans and compressors
for refineries, ethanol and methanol production, and other
processes. Compressors and specialised fans for offshore
platforms; cooling fans for gas pipelines and underground
storage compression stations;
• iron and steel – heavy duty fans for iron ore beneficiation plant
(sintering and pelletising), and for basic oxygen and electric
arc furnace steelmaking;
• mining – high integrity fans for coal, gold and other underground
mining; and
• industrial processes – fans and compressors for a wide range
of industrial processes including pulp and paper, cement
manufacture, smelting and sulphuric acid.
Industry overview
Demand
Demand for new Howden equipment is strongly influenced by
the construction of new coal fired power stations, environmental
legislation (in particular as it relates to emissions from coal fired
power stations and other heavy industrial plant), the production
of petrochemicals and oil and gas, the consumption of steel
and demand for deep mined commodities such as gold and
diamonds. As with many capital goods industries, the aftermarket
represents an important part of the total market.
  Sinter waste gas fans
Iron ore sintering provides one of the more arduous applications
for a centrifugal fan. This process is used in steel-making to
agglomerate particles of iron ore into larger lumps which are
suitable for use in a blast furnace. The Howden waste gas fan
draws hot dust-laden air through the sinter bed and a key factor
in successful plant operation is to maximise the life of the fan.
Howden’s success in this application is due in part to its
replaceable blade liner design. Once erosion occurs on a
Howden fan, the client can replace the liner, and very quickly
get the fan back in service. This eliminates the need to weld a
hard-facing directly onto the blade surface, which can distort
the blade and significantly increase power consumption on
a fan which can be rated in excess of 6,000kW.
Howden’s deep understanding of the mechanical, aerodynamic,
and acoustic behaviour of the rotor contributes to its leadership
in this field. With analysis methods to determine stresses in
the rotor, to predict the dynamics of the support system and
to model the flow through the impeller, Howden sinter waste
gas fans provide a cost-effective solution to the plant
operator’s needs.
Working in collaboration with Siemens, which supplies the
variable speed drives for the fans, Howden has established a
leading market position in China, currently the largest market
in the world for steel plants. Charter plc Annual Report 2006 21

Aftermarket Power Petrochemical, oil and gas
Deep mining Steel Other
Since the turn of the century, there has been a spike in construction
of coal-fired plants in China, which is now seen to be easing back
towards the rate of growth of the Chinese economy as a whole.
However, in other emerging economies, such as Central and
Eastern Europe, and in more mature economies, such as
Western Europe and North America, there is increasing new build,
accompanied by the refurbishment and upgrading of existing
plant and the return of mothballed plant to service. With the
continued high price of natural gas and concerns over its future
supply, as well as the ongoing public debate over nuclear power,
coal is increasingly seen as an attractive primary energy source.
Governmental regulations stimulate demand for a number of
Howden products, particularly in the environmental protection
sector, where Howden supplies equipment for use in processes
which reduce atmospheric pollution generated by industrial plant.
The existing governmental programme to reduce the quantity
of sulphur dioxide being emitted from power stations in China
is expected to continue. The USA and, to a lesser extent, Europe
will continue to develop as a market for this technology.
Increased demand for Howden products is expected from the
petrochemical and oil and gas industries. The oil price, whilst
below the levels seen in most of 2006, remains high by historic
standards, supported by forecasts of increasing demand from
China and other developing economies. This continues
to stimulate upstream and downstream plant construction,
particularly in the refining sector.
Competitive environment
Howden has strong positions in the specialised markets that
it supplies.
Howden has an estimated market share of some 50 per cent
of the combined worldwide markets for heavy-duty fans and heat
exchangers, and as such it is the clear world-leader in this field.
Howden is one of the five leading worldwide manufacturers
of screw compressors for use in the petrochemical industry.
Together these manufacturers are believed to represent around
85 per cent of the market.
Howden’s share of the aftermarket varies between regions.
The share is particularly high in some locations, such as Africa,
where Howden originally supplied a high proportion of the original
equipment, and Australia, where recent new build activity has
been low. The aftermarket in China is still in its infancy following
the rapid new build programme in the last few years.
Howden supply chain
Manufacturing locations
Howden has manufacturing facilities in each of its principal markets
of Europe, China and North America. Equipment is generally
produced in the same region as the customer is located, although
Howden does export product between regions, particularly from
its manufacturing facilities in Europe. Sales in regions outside
Howden’s principal markets, such as Asia (excluding China),
South America and the Middle East are relatively small but
growing, and are generally supplied from Howden facilities
in Europe.
Human resources
A key component in Howden’s supply chain is the quality and
quantity of its engineers. During 2006, Howden increased the
total number of engineers it employs by over 100. At the end
of 2006, Howden employed just under 250 engineers in China,
30 more than last year.
Raw materials
The principal raw material used in the manufacturing process is
steel, the prices of which remained relatively stable during the year.
Sub-contractors
Howden has achieved growth in its production capacity through
increased investment in new plant and increased use of sub-
contractors, such that the number of man-hours subcontracted
is estimated to have increased by around 50 per cent in 2006,
whilst the number of man-hours in-house remained relatively
constant. This has allowed Howden to meet peaks in demands
without significantly extending its own cost base. Howden
has primarily sub-contracted manufacturing to China, Thailand,
Hungary and Poland.
The total market for Howden products in 2006 is estimated as
£1,700 million. The growth seen from the turn of the century up
to 2006, driven by the construction of new power generating
capacity in China, is expected to be followed by a period of
consolidation, during which a gentle decline in the power market
will be matched by growth in sales to the petrochemical, oil
and gas industries. The aftermarket is expected to show further
steady growth.

Business and financial review – Howden (continued)
Intellectual property
Technology and the Howden brand are key parts of Howden’s
supply chain. According to recent customer research, Howden
has maintained its position of technology leadership in its principal
product areas. The research also emphasised the strength
of Howden’s brand which is seen as representing engineering
excellence, customer service, global reach, technology
leadership and quality.
Revenue and cost analysis
During 2006, Howden’s sales were £429.5 million (2005:
£345.1 million), an increase of 24.5 per cent.
The largest product area continued to be heavy-duty fans,
followed by heat exchangers and compressors.
Aftermarket sales were £110.2 million (2005: £122.0 million),
representing 25.7 per cent (2005: 35.4 per cent) of total sales.
Sales prices for new equipment were maintained during the
year, with the improved operating margins being largely due
to increased volumes resulting in improved factory loading and
efficiency. In 2006, both the margin and the profit on aftermarket
sales increased compared with 2005.
Regional overview of performance
Howden’s revenue by destination is summarised in the table
overleaf. In 2006, Howden achieved significant growth in China,
North America and South America.
Regional markets
China
Sales in China amounted to £148.9 million (2005: £97.1 million),
an increase of just over 50 per cent. This was primarily as
a result of demand from the power supply industry for new
generating capacity.
It is estimated that total generating capacity rose by slightly over
100GW during the year to 622GW. Of this increase, coal-fired
capacity, where Howden has a strong market position, accounted
for over 90GW, emphasising the continued importance of coal
in the generation of electricity. In relation to environmental control,
including FGD, a large portion of the current retrofit programme
has been completed, and the future market will be more
focussed on FGD for new power plant.
In other sectors, Howden has won a number of orders for main
ventilation fans for use in underground coal mining and in the
expanding petrochemical industry. Howden has continued
to supply highly sophisticated fans used in the production of
sintered iron ore, from both its Chinese and British companies.
Howden is expanding its manufacturing capabilities for various
highly engineered products associated with the oil and gas
and petrochemical sectors. These will be fully operational
in mid 2007.

  Air preheater upgrade
The air preheater on a fossil-fuel fired boiler captures waste heat
from the exhaust gas and uses it to pre-heat the combustion
air, increasing the plant efficiency and typically reducing
fuel consumption and CO
2
emission by 10 per cent. Rotary
heat exchangers, of which Howden is one of the world’s major
suppliers, are used for this purpose in well over 90 per cent
of the world’s utility power plants.
Many of the air preheaters in use today were installed over
25 years ago and since then their performance has declined
and technology has advanced. Many have benefited from
being upgraded to the latest Howden technology, for example
fitting more efficient heat transfer surfaces and improving
the sealing systems.
On a typical upgrade on a coal fired power station the boiler
efficiency is increased, the auxiliary fan power is reduced and
the cost of a retrofit flue gas desulphurisation plant is lowered
significantly. Most recently Howden has carried out such
modifications in Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Spain and China. 24 Charter plc Annual Report 2006
Business and financial review – Howden (continued)
Europe
Sales to customers in Europe increased by 3.9 per cent to
£100.5 million. Reported growth was reduced as, during the
period, Howden exited from low margin aftermarket work.
Activity levels at Howden’s facilities in Europe were high as
product was exported, particularly to China and North America.
The European power market has been showing continuing signs
of strengthening, with project activity evident throughout the
region, but with an emphasis on Germany. Howden Ventilatoren,
based in Germany, which supplies ventilation equipment for
road, rail and wind tunnels in addition to serving the local power
generation market, had an excellent year. Other industrial markets
continue to be active and Howden, with its wide European
presence, is well placed to participate.
North America
Howden Buffalo Inc is headquartered in Camden, South Carolina
and has four other main facilities, one of which is located in
Mexico City. Sales to customers in North America increased
to £87.6 million, with the power market particularly strong. Most
other markets for new build also remained strong throughout
the year, particularly cement, petrochemical and coal mining.
The aftermarket was flat compared with 2005, due to the deferral
of power station outages following the relatively mild winter.
The growth in the order book during the period reflected the
continued strength of the market for new build and pollution
control in the power industry and across a number of other sectors.
South America
Sales increased from £8.9 million in 2005 to £12.6 million in 2006
due to additional projects within the iron and steel industry and,
in particular, Companhia Vale do Rio Doce in Brazil.
Howden’s principal market in the region is Brazil, the world’s
biggest exporter of iron ore, which is significantly expanding its
capacity to produce iron ore pellets used throughout the world
as a blast furnace feedstock. Other opportunities are seen in the
oil and gas and biofuels industries.
Rest of world
Africa
In Howden Africa Holdings Limited (‘HAHL’), in which Howden
has a holding of some 55 per cent, sales declined by 6 per cent
to £40.7 million in the year, as increased equipment and
aftermarket sales to the power sector were more than offset
by falls in the value of the South African Rand.
In May 2006, HAHL announced a proposed internal business
and financial re-organisation of the companies within the HAHL
group, including a cash payment to shareholders of ZAR 2.41
per share. This was paid in July 2006 and Howden’s share
amounted to ZAR 87.7 million (equivalent to £6.9 million).
In February 2007, HAHL reached an agreement to dispose of its
42 per cent holding in Pump Brands Pty Limited for an expected
consideration of £2.4 million.
HAHL’s future contribution to the Company’s results is subject
to further depreciation of the South African Rand and political
and economic uncertainty in South Africa.
Asia Pacific (excluding China)
Howden’s sales in Asia Pacific (excluding China) are predominantly
to the mining, industrial and power supply industries in Australia,
and have benefited from favourable commodity prices and
buoyant conditions in the mining sector.
Associated undertakings
In 2006, Howden’s share of the post tax profits of its associated
undertakings amounted to £1.5 million (2005: £1.1 million).
Howden has, for some time, held a 49 per cent interest
in Howden Compressors Limited, a Scottish based and
incorporated company, which designs and manufactures high
quality compressors for use in the refrigeration and oil and gas
sectors worldwide. On 22 December 2006, Howden acquired
from Carrier Corporation the remaining 51 per cent shareholding
in Howden Compressors Limited, and its affiliated US sales
company, at a cost of £12.9 million (including £2.5 million
in respect of Carrier Corporation’s share of the estimated cash
in these companies at completion).
As noted above, agreement has recently been reached to dispose
of HAHL’s holding in Pump Brands Pty Limited. Charter plc Annual Report 2006 25
Future developments and longer term growth prospects
Market expansion
In China, Howden is taking steps to grow the range of products
it supplies to the petrochemical, oil and gas, mining and other
industries through the introduction of an increased range of locally
manufactured Howden products. The rate of growth of electricity
generating capacity in China is likely to slow from the exceptional
levels seen in recent years, but it is still anticipated that appreciable
new capacity will be added before the end of the decade.
Demand for new power plants in Europe and North America
increased during 2006 and this trend is likely to continue in
the future. The majority of the order book increase came from
new equipment sales in these markets as demand for power
increased and much of the existing plant, which was built
during the boom period of the 1960s and 1970s, is reaching
the end of its useful working life. In addition, ever more stringent
environmental protection legislation requires that power generating
companies invest in plant that has efficient atmospheric
pollution systems.
In Russia, high prices for oil and gas are stimulating investment in
the Russian petrochemicals sector. This is expected to be followed
by growth in other sectors; for example in the power generation
industry where significant increases in capital expenditure
are forecast. Howden is strengthening its presence in Russia
by establishing a sales office in Moscow that will coordinate
activities throughout the region.
A local representative office is also in the process of being
established in India where there are considered to be significant
future sales opportunities, particularly from the anticipated
growth in demand for power. The International Energy Agency
has forecast that growth in demand in India over the next
25 years will be over 5 per cent per year, slightly ahead of the
forecast growth for China.
South America continues to show potential for growth.
Howden South America, based in Brazil, is currently growing
its share of the industrial fan markets primarily in the steel,
oil and gas, petrochemicals and biofuels sectors throughout
the South American region and, in conjunction with other
Howden companies, is expanding its product range
to include compressors.
Aftermarket
Howden is focusing on strengthening its aftermarket presence,
particularly in the servicing of, and supply of spare parts for,
its substantial installed base. As part of this strategy, it has
withdrawn from certain low margin business.
Howden is well positioned to benefit from the large potential
aftermarket in China, where it has now established a dedicated
aftermarket presence. The new equipment installed over the
past ten years is beginning to require servicing, spare parts
and refurbishment.
New products and applications
Howden is currently carrying out development work on the
thermal performance, enamelling and on-line cleaning of rotary
heat exchangers, and on variable pitch axial fans, all of which
are applicable both to the new equipment and aftermarket sectors
of the power generation and environmental control sectors.
During 2006 Howden supplied and successfully commissioned
a submerged helium blower for the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor
Project helium test facility in South Africa, which is another step
forward in the development of this emerging nuclear technology.
Development of the Sirocco fan range has been completed.
This is a new range of pre-engineered centrifugal fans suitable
for use in many different industries. This project significantly
reduces the time required to supply a fan, enabling Howden
to offer shorter delivery times.
New processes emerging in response to carbon abatement
programmes, such as hydrogen fuel cells and carbon capture
and storage, will provide growth opportunities for a number of
Howden products. A number of clean coal and carbon capture
and storage projects are in various stages of engineering, which
Howden will continue to support.
Howden’s development of new products and applications
will be weighted by value towards the power generation
and petrochemical markets, where increasing plant capacity
and efficiencies impose new demands on equipment suppliers.

During 2006, the total of man-hours utilised by Howden
increased from approximately 2.9 million to 3.6 million. Nearly
all this increase was in the number of sub-contracted man-
hours. Howden’s use of sub-contractors, especially in the
manufacture of non-critical components, has enabled it to
meet the peaks in demand without investing in significant new
capacity. It also enables better control of working capital and
ultimately a lower price to customers. Howden continues to
manufacture performance critical components, or where it is
necessary to protect its technology or maintain its markets.
Principal sub-contractors are located in China, Thailand,
Hungary and Poland. 26 Charter plc Annual Report 2006

Business and financial review – Financial review (continued)
During the year, the Company issued a total of 1,434,950
new ordinary shares. Of these:
– 1,120,579 new ordinary shares were issued to the
Chairman, David Gawler, as more fully described below
under ‘Long term incentive plan’.
– 314,371 new ordinary shares were issued for cash
of £0.6 million on the exercise of options under various

Cash, borrowings and interest
As at 31 December 2006, cash balances were £62.3 million
(2005: £75.7 million) partly held in the UK, with the balance held
overseas for local working capital purposes or pending dividend
payments. Of the cash held overseas, £4.5 million (2005:
£7.5 million) is retained as cash collateral in connection with
certain local trading practices or banking facilities. The credit
status of institutions where cash is held is kept under review
with credit limits being set and monitored accordingly.
As at 31 December 2006, gross borrowings were £19.2 million
(2005: £82.2 million).
In certain instances, borrowings are denominated in the
currencies of the Company’s net investments overseas which
provides a hedge against currency fluctuations. Gains and losses
arising from borrowings or forward exchange contracts which are
used to hedge foreign currency exposures are recognised as
required under IFRS in the consolidated statement of changes
in equity until the items being hedged have impacted on the
income statement.
Charter’s central treasury department is responsible for ensuring
the availability of suitable and sufficient borrowing and other
financing facilities. In addition, it is responsible for managing the
interest rate risks, liquidity risks and balance sheet foreign
exchange translation risks. Foreign exchange transaction
exposures are generally managed by operating subsidiaries
within strict guidelines and controls established by the
management of their parent companies and overseen by the
central treasury department. It is the Company’s policy not to
hedge profit and loss account translation exposures.
In March 2006, the Company agreed a new five year committed
£50 million revolving credit facility with HSBC expiring on
31 March 2011, which replaced an earlier facility which was
due to expire on 31 March 2007.
In August 2006, the Company retired the US $120 million
(£65.0 million) loan notes which would otherwise have fallen due
for repayment in October 2007 and October 2009. The costs of
the early repayment, being the make-whole amount payable to
the note holders of £2.1 million, was included in the financing
charge for the year.
In the year to 31 December 2006, net financing charges payable

Closing net cash/(debt) 43.1 (6.5)
During the year, the net debt of £6.5 million at 31 December
2005 was eliminated and at the year end there was net cash of
£43.1 million. Cash flow from operations generated £106.8 million
(2005: £84.5 million), an increase of 26.4 per cent. Capital
expenditure was £24.5 million (2005: £20.0 million), an increase
of 22.5 per cent, compared with the depreciation charge
of £13.5 million (2005: £14.7 million). The amount spent on
acquisitions primarily related to the purchase of the outstanding
shares in Howden Compressors Limited.
During 2006, the net movement in working capital absorbed
£48.6 million. Inventories and receivables grew by a broadly
similar amount to the increase in revenue, whilst payables grew
slightly less quickly. The increase in general provisions reflected
an increase in the provision for warranty costs and legal and
environmental liabilities. This was partly offset by an increase
in respect of recoveries from insurers which are included
in receivables. Contingent liabilities
Details of contingent liabilities are set out in Note 26 to the
consolidated financial statements.
Long term incentive plan
Mr Gawler had a long term incentive plan which had previously
been approved by shareholders and which vested on 30 June
2006. Mr Gawler received the maximum gross amount payable
under this award of £8,987,040 as the average share price for
the 20 dealing days following the announcement of the annual
results for the year ended 31 December 2005, which took place
on 16 March 2006, was above 395 pence throughout the period.
The Board resolved that this amount would be settled by the
issue of shares in the Company, and accordingly 1,120,579 new
ordinary shares in the Company were issued to Mr Gawler on
3 July 2006. These shares were subsequently sold on his behalf
at a price of 802 pence each.
Risks and uncertainties
Charter, both directly and through ESAB and Howden, is
exposed to a wide variety of markets and geographies and seeks
to manage the risks and uncertainties which arise from this.
In certain instances and where it is cost-effective to do so,
exposures can be transferred to third parties, for example
through insurance or through currency hedging.
The principal risks and uncertainties faced by Charter, and
the ways in which they are being managed, are set out below.
Economic recession
Economic recession in a particular region may be created
by internal factors, such as declining consumer expenditure,
or external factors, such as changes in exchange rates.
Both ESAB and Howden have improved their operating
efficiencies, which should assist in protecting their profitability
even if an economic recession were to lead to falling sales
volumes and product prices. In response to the recent high
demand for its products globally, Howden has increased its
capacity principally through the extensive use of sub-contractors.
In the event that market conditions change, Howden should be
able to reduce this capacity without incurring significant costs.
Actions of competitors
ESAB and Howden both operate in competitive markets and are
exposed to market behaviour such as aggressive pricing by a low
cost manufacturer looking to enter a new market.
As set out in the business and financial review, both businesses
have established strong market positions through technological
leadership, strong brands and through providing cost effective
solutions to their customers’ needs. These positions are being
maintained through measures such as continued expenditure
on research and development, the lean manufacturing initiative
and customer service.
Competitor action may result initially in reductions in profit,
although these are more likely to be specific to particular product
areas or geographies. The businesses’ strong market positions
should assist them in maintaining their longer term performance.
Charter plc Annual Report 2006 29
Foreign exchange: transaction risk
Transaction risk arises from product being manufactured in one
currency zone and sold in another.
In ESAB, manufacturing tends to be relatively close to the end-
user, which naturally reduces currency exposures. The principal
exposures which arise do so on account of manufacturing of
product in Central Europe and Sweden which is exported to the
euro-zone. ESAB’s policy is not to hedge currency exposures
unless they relate to a significant specific contract, as customer
prices, particularly for consumables, are generally able to be
changed at relatively short notice to reflect cost changes.
In relation to Howden, exposure is principally in relation to the
US Dollar and pegged currencies such as the Chinese Yuan.
Howden substantially covers forward its committed trading
exposures.
The exposure of Charter’s balance sheet to movements in
exchange rates is reduced by certain borrowings being
denominated in foreign currencies.
Foreign exchange: translation risk
Translation risk arises from the profits and net assets of non-UK
businesses being translated into a Sterling value which depends
upon the exchange rate.
Apart from Howden’s operations in Scotland and Northern
Ireland, ESAB’s head office and its own headquarters, Charter
has minimal operations in the UK. The largest single profit
translation exposure is in relation to the US Dollar. It is Charter’s
policy not to hedge profit translation exposures; this may give
rise to fluctuations in Charter’s reported profit.
The Company has significant investments in overseas
operations; as a result, movements in exchange rates can
significantly affect the consolidated balance sheet. In certain
circumstances, currency borrowings, forward foreign exchange
contracts or other derivatives may be used to hedge balance
sheet exposures. Gains and losses arising on such hedges are
recognised as required under IFRS in the consolidated statement
of changes in equity until the items being hedged have impacted
on the income statement.
Litigation
Charter, ESAB and Howden are subject to litigation in the
ordinary course of their business.
Certain comments on current litigation are set out in the
Chairman’s statement and further details are contained in
Note 26.
Pension risk
There are various post retirement benefit schemes in place
within Charter, ESAB and Howden.
As at 31 December 2006, the net retirement benefit obligations,
as provided for in its consolidated balance sheet, amounted
to £108.6 million. This sum represents 43.3 per cent of equity
shareholders’ funds as at that date.
The assets held by the various schemes are invested by the
trustees primarily in equities and bonds. A level of contributions
payable by the Company, ESAB and Howden into the schemes
has been agreed with respective trustees. 30 Charter plc Annual Report 2006
Business and financial review – Financial review (continued)
The liabilities in respect of retirement benefits are subject
to movements in long term interest rates and changes in life
expectancy. The net retirement benefit obligation is also subject
to movements in the value of assets held by the schemes,
which are principally shares and bonds. Future cash contributions
to the schemes will also depend on other factors, such as the
outcome of negotiations with the pension trustees and changes
in legislation.
Raw material prices
Most products manufactured by ESAB and Howden contain
steel or other metals whose prices are determined on world
markets and can fluctuate significantly.
This risk is addressed by the use of long-term contracts with
suppliers where available and appropriate and, subject to market
conditions and other factors, the passing through to customers
of increases in underlying costs.
Internal controls
Charter has in place a system of internal controls covering its
own activities and those of ESAB and Howden. These controls
are essential for the effective management of such geographically
diverse businesses.
The Company’s Audit Committee has been delegated formal
responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the system of
internal control. A failure of the system of internal controls could
have a material impact on the Company. Charter plc Annual Report 2006 31
Corporate social responsibility report
Policy and procedures
In 2006, formal policies and procedures manuals were issued
to all subsidiaries of the Company (except those situated in North
America). Amongst other matters, the manuals determine the
policies and procedures that Charter’s subsidiaries must follow
to operate in an environmentally and socially responsible manner.
The most relevant sections from a CSR perspective are those on:
• Code of conduct
• Whistleblowing
• Employment
• Health and safety
• Environmental
• Risk management
• Business continuity planning and disaster recovery.
A manual for Charter’s subsidiaries in North America is being
developed to reflect these companies’ distinct management
structure and certain regional differences. This manual will be
issued and implemented during 2007.
Charter’s subsidiaries must comply with the policies and
procedures contained in these manuals unless they conflict
with applicable local legislation.
Management responsibilities
Employees must comply with and act in accordance with the
provisions of the Code of conduct and the Whistleblowing policy.
The Chief Executive is responsible for ensuring that the sections
of the manual covering employment, heath and safety and
environmental matters are regularly updated.
During 2006, the new position of Head of Risk Management was
established at the Company. This corporate officer is responsible
for ensuring that sections of the manual relating to risk
management and business continuity planning are updated
and has been delegated responsibility for preparing monthly
performance reports on health and safety, and quarterly reports
on environmental matters, for submission to the Executive
Committee and the Board.
Operational responsibility for managing these matters lies with
the senior management of each operating unit. The Head of Risk
Management has a co-ordinating role in areas of CSR to improve
the sharing of best practice, collection of data and consistency
of reporting. CSR is considered to be an important driver of long
term sustainable business success and is being integrated within
the overall risk management practices of Charter. Risks and
issues relating to CSR are updated by subsidiary companies
as part of their regular reviews, and progress on mitigating
actions is monitored regularly. There is a formal management
review of major risks by the Executive Committee on a quarterly
basis and by the Board every six months.
In 2006, the focus has been on strengthening human resources,
incorporating health and safety as an integral part of the
deployment of lean manufacturing, further improving product
safety labelling for welding consumables, increasing the frequency
and consistency in reporting key health, safety and environmental
matters, and progressing business continuity plans. These will
continue to be the main areas of focus in 2007 and are considered
to be an important part of reviewing management performance.
The intention is to be in a position to provide more quantitative
data in the next Annual Report.
Key areas of CSR focus
Health and safety
The importance of health and safety has been emphasised
by ensuring that performance and progress on improvement
actions are considered as a formal agenda item at meetings
of senior management and at Board meetings. Any injury that
results in lost time is reported to senior management and to the
Head of Risk Management. In addition, since the last quarter of
2006, the Head of Risk Management prepares a monthly report
on overall health and safety performance for senior management
and the Board. By the end of 2007 annual data will be available
to report externally.
Charter has made significant
progress in 2006 in formalising
its approach to Corporate Social
Responsibility (‘CSR’) by
strengthening management
resources and improving
transparency, with increased
focus on the frequency and
content of internal reporting. 32 Charter plc Annual Report 2006

Each operating unit has its own environmental, health and safety
committee, and health and safety resources are also deployed
at major manufacturing sites. As part of Charter’s formal health
and safety plans, these resources are to be strengthened during
2007 through additional training and external recruitment where
necessary. Safety is considered to be a key part of the Lean-
manufacturing initiative and improvements in safety are already
being made as this initiative is rolled out across the Company’s
operating units.
The overall policy of Charter is to protect the health and safety
of all employees, contractors and third parties. In 2007,
leadership training in this area will be underpinned by management
systems built on OHSAS 18001. ESAB is planning to achieve
group certification in 2007. The majority of Howden manufacturing
sites will also be certified by the end of 2007.
It is with regret that we have to report the death of an employee
on 24 February 2006 at Howden Hua in the People’s Republic
of China, as a result of a crush injury suffered whilst moving steel
plates with an overhead crane. Howden Hua was fined Chinese
Yuan 30,000 by the Chinese authorities following their investigation
into the accident. Improvements in crane safety have since
been implemented in all Howden facilities worldwide.
There have been no other reports of fines or penalties as a result
of health and safety incidents or inspections by authorities.
Environmental
ESAB has a long history of evaluating and addressing
environmental impacts, being one of the first companies in its
sector to produce a Sustainable Development Report in 1997.
The Lean-manufacturing initiatives underway will aid in ensuring
the efficient use of raw materials and energy, the promotion of
recycling and a reduction in waste products.
ESAB is the only welding company to have achieved global
certification to ISO 14001, which was awarded on 22 January
2006. The commitment to environmental improvement
continues, with a focus in the last quarter of 2006 and first
quarter of 2007 on completing energy audits of all of its major
manufacturing sites to identify areas for further improvement.
At ESAB’s consumables manufacturing facility in Perstorp, Sweden,
there has been a continuous focus on reducing the metal scrap
from the manufacture of electrodes. In the 5 years between 2002
and 2006, through a combination of process changes and
increased internal recycling, scrap has come down from 533 tonnes
to 319 tonnes, equivalent to a reduction from 28kgs to 17kgs per
tonne of product shipped. All metal scrap is sent for recycling.
At ESAB’s main equipment manufacturing site in Laxå, Sweden,
waste going to landfill has been reduced from 825 tonnes in
1996 to just 48 tonnes in 2006. This improvement is the result
of many different actions, primarily associated with recycling.
For example all wood waste is now separated and used for
district heating. From 2003, all the contents from waste paper
baskets were sorted, with any combustible material, such as
paper and plastics, being separated and sent for use as fuel.
In 2006 this amounted to 105 tonnes.
Howden’s main environmental impact is through the products
it supplies to its customers to enable them to achieve greater
energy efficiency in their operations. Howden supplies fans and
rotary heat exchangers that are used in coal fired power stations
to increase efficiency and reduce atmospheric pollution. Howden
is aware of the environmental impact of its own manufacturing
processes and is committed to conducting its operations in a
manner that minimises any detrimental effect on the environment
and to continuously improving overall environmental performance.
Case study: ESAB manufacturing facility at Vamberk
(Czech Republic)
Over the last 10 years ESAB’s consumable manufacturing site in
Vamberk, Czech Republic has undertaken a number of projects
to reduce energy consumption. In 1997, the changing of the motors
used on wire-drawing lines used in Magwire production and
installing frequency converters was started. This achieved a 30 per
cent reduction, in energy consumption from 0.2424MWh/tonne
of product shipped in 1996 to 0.1692 MWh/tonne in 2006.
Another initiative was in flux production where agglomerated
fluxes require a less energy intensive manufacturing process
than fused fluxes. A progressive replacement programme
has been underway since 1995, when only 88 tonnes of
agglomerated flux was produced compared with 2,266 tonnes
of fused flux. In 2006 the proportions had changed to 1,933
tonnes of agglomerated and 1,063 tonnes of fused flux.
Overall energy consumption in flux production went down
from 1.4107 MWh/tonne of flux shipped in 1995 to 0.9902
MWh/tonne in 2006.
Substantial reductions have also been achieved in energy used
for heating by replacing steam by hot water for space-heating,
improving the insulation in buildings and providing thermostatic
regulators. The results are shown below, with a reduction from
2.725 GJ/tonne of product shipped in 1996 to 0.920 GJ/tonne
in 2006.

Howden has started to collect internal usage of electricity,
water and waste generation. Two of Howden’s sites are certified
to ISO 14001, being Belfast in the UK and Nogent-sur-Oise
in France. Two further sites, in France and South Africa, are
working towards achieving certification in 2007 with the remaining
manufacturing sites targeted for completion by the end of 2008.
No reports of fines or penalties have been received for breaches
of permits or other environmental regulations.
Employment
Charter recognises and values diversity in its subsidiaries’
workforces and encourages them to attract, develop, deploy
and reward employees solely on the basis of merit.
ESAB is deploying training and development programmes
worldwide. An over-arching framework for the development,
performance management and training of ESAB staff is being
developed. A leadership development programme was started in
2005/2006 in association with Henley Management College with
15 nominees completing the course in 2006 and a second group
of 16 starting it. Delegates are drawn from all over the world and
from all disciplines. On-going training in Lean-manufacturing is
being provided by Unipart Logistics in the form of short training
courses and, more recently, in the form of a two and a half week
course for sixteen Lean ‘champions’ from ESAB factories around
the world that was held in Vamberk, Czech Republic. So far
employees from thirteen countries have received training. Further
training is planned in 2007, which will include representatives
from Howden.
Howden has an overall focus on recruiting and developing young
engineers, with new graduates being recruited in countries such
as the UK, Germany, Australia, Denmark and France where the
businesses are large enough to support regular trainees. Work
placements are also offered, with apprenticeship schemes
currently running in the UK, Germany, South Africa and Australia.
Howden’s reputation as a good employer is reflected in the fact
that the workforce is relatively stable.
The Company has in place a Whistleblowing policy which provides
an opportunity for all employees to raise any concerns independent
of their normal reporting lines. Any concerns raised are investigated
by Internal Audit and reported to the Audit Committee.
Communications with employees are a significant factor in
developing an efficient and successful business. ESAB issues
a newsletter, ‘Let’s Talk’, every two weeks, which includes
community initiatives and staff stories, as well as customer wins
and company projects. Howden produces a ‘team brief’ every
two months that is circulated to managers globally for use in local
discussions. A six-monthly newsletter entitled ‘Project 150’
is provided in the local language to Howden employees.
Employees also receive information through works councils
and other consultative bodies.
Community involvement
Charter’s subsidiaries are encouraged to support the local
communities in which they operate. As an example, ESAB Brazil
was a founding member of a project aimed at training young
destitute people. The project is carried out in partnership with
companies and institutions in the neighbourhood and so far
ESAB has contributed eight welding machines, fume extraction
equipment for the eight cabins and technical support. Two
groups, with 15 people in each group, completed the course
in 2006.
Many Charter subsidiaries actively support local charities either
through fundraising or other forms of assistance. For example,
ESAB Group Inc employees raised over US$ 125,000 in 2006
for local charities.
In 2006, a joint programme between Hunter Valley Training
Company and Howden Australia was conducted to address
the chronic skills shortages in metal trades industries within
the Hunter Valley area by injecting a new group of skilled
apprentices into the local community.
Supply chain
Charter recognises the importance of its subsidiaries working
in partnership with their suppliers and sub-contractors to meet
commitments to customers. In addition to focus on quality,
consideration is given to environmental, health and safety issues.
A ‘Sustainability Questionnaire for Suppliers’ has been developed
by ESAB which is being distributed to suppliers. The questionnaire
addresses environmental management; occupational health, safety
and labour management; and restricted chemical substances. 34 Charter plc Annual Report 2006

On 7 February 2006, the Company announced that it had settled
its legal proceedings against City Index in respect of losses incurred as
a consequence of certain unauthorised payments having been made by
a former employee. The Board is aware that, following the settlement
with the Company, City Index sought to continue to pursue claims for
contribution against certain current and former Directors of the Company
and against the Company’s Auditors. Those Directors and the Company’s
Auditors successfully applied to the High Court for an order that the
claims be struck out. City Index has appealed to the Court of Appeal
against that order.
Corporate governance
A review of the Company’s application of the principles and provisions
of the Financial Reporting Council’s Combined Code on Corporate
Governance can be found on pages 39 to 42.
Directors’ indemnities
Each of the Directors has been granted an indemnity by the Company
to the extent permitted by law in respect of certain liabilities incurred
as a result of their office. In accordance with the Company’s articles of
association each Director is indemnified against liability to third parties,
excluding criminal liability and regulatory penalties and certain other
liabilities. In addition, the Company may pay the Directors’ legal costs
as they are incurred, subject to reimbursement if the Director is
convicted, or if judgement is given against the Director in an action
brought by the Company.
Financial instruments
The financial risk management objectives and policies of the Company
including interest rate, currency and credit risk are outlined in Note 21
of the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Annual General Meeting
The Company’s AGM will take place at 12 noon on Tuesday 26 June
2007 at the offices of ABN AMRO, 250 Bishopsgate, London, EC2M 4AA.
The Notice of Meeting (the ‘Notice’) can be found on pages 92 to 94.
The special business to be considered at the meeting is as follows:
Authority to allot shares and disapplication of pre-emption rights
The Directors wish to renew for a further year the general authority
granted to them on 27 June 2006 under section 80 of the Companies
Act 1985 to allot ordinary shares. Approval of shareholders will be
sought at the AGM by the passing of an ordinary resolution whereby
the Directors will be authorised to allot authorised but unissued ordinary
shares representing one third of the issued share capital of the Company.
The wording of the proposed resolution is set out in Resolution 9 of the
Notice and the total number of shares in respect of which this authority
is sought is set out in the note to such resolution. This new authority will
expire at the 2008 AGM of the Company.
The Directors are also proposing a special resolution under section 95
of the Companies Act 1985 to renew the disapplication of statutory
pre-emption rights in respect of ordinary shares having an aggregate
nominal value of £166,688 representing 5 per cent of the ordinary shares
in issue. The wording of the proposed resolution is set out in Resolution
10 of the Notice. This authority will expire at the 2008 AGM of the Company.
The Directors have no present intention of exercising these authorities,
except for allotments of shares pursuant to the Company’s long term
incentive schemes, and would not seek to issue more than 7.5 per cent
of the Company’s ordinary share capital for cash, other than to existing
shareholders, in any rolling three-year period without prior consultation
with the investment committees of the Association of British Insurers
and the National Association of Pension Funds.
Authority to purchase own shares
The Directors wish to renew for a further year the authority to allow the
Company to purchase its own ordinary shares on a recognised investment
exchange. The authority is restricted to 16,668,885 ordinary shares,
representing 10 per cent of the current issued share capital and will expire
at the 2008 AGM of the Company or, if earlier 26 September 2008. The
resolution also sets out the maximum and minimum prices at which the
shares may be purchased. Purchases will only be made if the Directors
expect this to result in an increase in the Company’s earnings per share
and consider this to be in the best interests of shareholders generally.
Any shares purchased in this way not held in treasury will be cancelled
and the number of shares in issue will be reduced accordingly. Other
than in relation to shares bought back and held in treasury as described
above, it is not the Directors’ current intention to offer to purchase shares
in the market for any particular period. The wording of the proposed
resolution is set out in Resolution 11 of the Notice.
The Directors intend to seek renewal of this power at subsequent AGMs.
Directors’ report 38 Charter plc Annual Report 2006
Charitable and political donations
The Company intends to seek authority to make donations to EU Political
Organisations not exceeding £25,000 in total and to incur EU Political
Expenditure not exceeding £25,000 in total. The Company does make
a number of charitable donations as described below, but it does not
currently make any political donations. Whilst there is no current intention
to change this policy, the meaning and implications of the Political
Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 remain unclear, and could
extend to routine activities undertaken by the Company in the ordinary
course of business that are not ‘political’ or ‘party political’ in any usual
meaning of those terms. The wording of the proposed resolution is set
out in Resolution 12 of the Notice and further information regarding the
background to this resolution is contained in note viii to the Notice.
Electronic communications
The Directors intend to take advantage of the new provisions in the
Companies Act 2006 and the Financial Service Authority’s (‘FSA’)
Disclosure and Transparency Rules concerning electronic communications
and will propose a resolution to allow the Company to send or supply
documents or information to shareholders by making such documents
available on the Company’s website.
Full details of all resolutions can be found in the notes to the Notice
on pages 93 and 94.The Directors believe that the adoption of all the
resolutions set out in the Notice is in the best interests of the Company
and its shareholders as a whole. Accordingly, the Directors unanimously
recommend that shareholders vote in favour of the resolutions, as they
intend to do in respect of their beneficial holdings.
Employees
The Company’s policy is to encourage effective communication
and consultation between employees and management. Subsidiary
undertakings develop their own consultation and communication
procedures as part of their employment practices. Full details can
be found in the Corporate social responsibility report on pages 31 to 33.
The Company and its subsidiary undertakings give full and fair
consideration to applications for employment made by disabled people,
having regard to their aptitudes and abilities. Should employees become
disabled during employment, they would be considered for any necessary
retraining and available work within their capabilities. For the purposes
of training, career development and promotion, disabled employees
are treated in the same way as other employees.
Creditor payment policy
The creditor payment policy of the Company and its subsidiaries
provides that local practice must be observed in the countries in which
they operate – standard payment terms in each country may also be
varied by negotiation with individual suppliers. The policy is to settle
amounts due to creditors in accordance with agreed terms.
The Company had no trade creditors at the year end.
Charitable and political contributions
During the year the Company and its subsidiaries donated £58,000
(2005: £84,000) to charities of which £8,000 (2005: £6,000) was to
charities in the United Kingdom. Within the United Kingdom, donations
were made in the year to support charities working in education (£1,000),
medical research/support (£4,000) and community support (£3,000).
There were no political donations made during the year (2005: £nil).
Research and development
The Company and its subsidiaries continue to place strong emphasis on
research and development to meet the changing needs of the markets
they serve. Research and development expenditure, which excludes
engineering and production support costs, totalled £9.1 million (2005:
£7.5 million) for the year of which £6.7 million (2005: £5.3 million) has
been charged to the income statement for the year and £2.4 million
(2005: £2.2 million) has been capitalised as intangible assets.
Substantial shareholdings
Prior to 20 January 2007, the Company maintained a register of substantial
shareholdings pursuant to section 211 of the Companies Act 1985.
At 19 January 2007 the Company had been notified of the following
holdings exceeding 3 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the
Company: Barclays PLC – 7.08 per cent, Lazard Asset Management LLC
– 4.09 per cent and Legal & General Group PLC – 3.13 per cent.
On 20 January 2007, the FSA’s Disclosure and Transparency Rules came
into force and replaced the provisions of the Companies Act 1985. As at
14 March 2007, the Company had been notified of the following holdings
exceeding 3 per cent in the total voting rights attached to the issued
share capital of the Company: Barclays PLC – 3.46 per cent, Standard
Life Investments Limited – 4.75 per cent, Schroder plc – 5.49 per cent
and JP Morgan Chase & Co – 7.68 per cent. An update will be given
in the Notice.
Corporate social responsibility (‘CSR’)
The Company’s report on CSR, including its approach to environmental
issues, can be found on on pages 31 to 33.
Statement of disclosure of information to Auditors
So far as the Directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information
(that is, information needed by the Company’s Auditors in connection
with preparing their report) of which the Company’s Auditors are
unaware, and each Director has taken all reasonable steps that he ought
to have taken as a Director in order to make himself aware of any relevant
audit information and to establish that the Company’s Auditors are aware
of that information.
Auditors
A resolution (Resolution 7) to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
as Auditors to the Company and a further resolution (Resolution 8)
to authorise the Board to fix the Auditors’ remuneration will be proposed
at the AGM.

Directors’ report (continued) Corporate governance
Charter plc Annual Report 2006 39
1 Compliance with the Financial Reporting Council’s Combined
Code on Corporate Governance (the ‘Code’)
The Board monitors its compliance with the requirements of the Code
on a continuous basis. This report, in addition to the Remuneration
Report on pages 44 to 49, the Directors’ report on pages 37 and 38, and
the Audit Committee Report on page 43, describes how the Company
has applied and complied with the principles, supporting principles and
provisions contained in the Code that was published on 1 July 2003
and the subsequent amendments published in June 2006.
Throughout the year ended 31 December 2006, the Board is of the
opinion that the Company has been in compliance with the provisions
set out in Section 1 of the Code except for the following items:
• A.2.1 The posts of Chairman and Chief Executive were both held by
David Gawler for the first half of the year under review. This position was
originally approved by shareholders following his appointment in 2001.
David Gawler stepped down as Chief Executive on 30 June 2006 and
assumed the role of Executive Chairman. At that time the Board agreed
a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief
Executive and the documents summarising their different roles are
available from the Company Secretary at the Registered Office or
on the Company’s website at www.charterplc.com.
• B.1.5 The service contracts of Michael Foster and Robert Careless
contain liquidated damages clauses which are in contrast to the Code
requirements for outgoing directors to mitigate their loss. The Board
feels that these arrangements are not excessive and balance the
interests of shareholders with the need to ensure the retention of these
individuals. This policy has been revised regarding the service contracts
of new Executive Directors and therefore James Deeley’s service
contract does not contain any such provision.
• C.3.4 The Board has delegated authority to the Audit Committee to
review arrangements by which staff of the Company and its subsidiaries
may, in confidence, raise concerns about possible improprieties in
financial reporting or other matters. Arrangements were formalised
and approved by the Audit Committee and implemented in March
2006. As a result the Company has complied with this provision
of the Code since April 2006.
2 Directors
(a) The Board and Board committees
The Board conducts itself in such a way as to provide leadership to the
Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates and their respective employees
and is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance
and to the delivery of enhanced shareholder value in a manner consistent
with sound business practices and proper standards of corporate social
responsibility. In providing such leadership, the Board focuses on integrity
and personal responsibility with the overriding objective of creating
shareholder value.
The Board currently comprises four Executive Directors and five
Non-Executive Directors:
• the Executive Chairman is David Gawler. He was Chairman and
Chief Executive until he stood down as Chief Executive on 1 July 2006;
• the Chief Executive is Michael Foster. He was the Commercial Director
until he became Chief Executive on 1 July 2006; and
• the Senior Independent Director is The Hon. James Bruce who held
this position throughout the year under review.
The Board operates under a Management and Governance Framework
(the ‘Framework’) which has been approved and adopted by the Board,
and which sets out a framework for the management and governance
of the Company and its subsidiaries and its affiliates. The Framework (a)
details the specific powers that the Board has retained, (b) describes
the formal committees that the Board has established (details of which
can be found below) and the powers and terms of reference of such
committees (copies of which are available, unless otherwise indicated,
on request from the Company Secretary or on the Company’s website)
and (c) addresses certain fundamental policies that the Board has adopted
for the good governance of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates.
The Framework is kept under regular review and is modified as and when
new situations, requirements or practices arise. The Board ensures that
the membership of its committees is refreshed so that undue reliance is
not placed on individual Directors. The appointment and removal of the
Company Secretary is a matter for the Board as a whole.
The powers retained by the Board include the approval of annual
and interim results and associated announcements, the membership,
authority and terms of reference of Board committees, corporate
strategy, significant financing arrangements, matters relating to share
capital (including employee share schemes and share options), contracts
or expenditures that exceed certain monetary thresholds and the
adoption of annual budgets. A number of matters have been delegated
to the Executive Committee under the Framework which are summarised
below. Any concerns that the Non-Executive Directors may have
concerning either the administration of the Company or its subsidiaries
and affiliates, or any proposed actions, are recorded in the minutes
of the Company where an alternative resolution cannot be found.
The Company has provided its Directors with appropriate insurance
cover in respect of legal proceedings and other claims against them.
Further details can be found in the Directors’ Report on page 37.
The Board meets regularly and held 11 meetings during the course
of 2006. Details of attendance at meetings of the Board and its
Nominations, Audit and Remuneration Committees are shown in the table
below. There are 11 Board meetings scheduled to take place in 2007.
Agendas and supporting papers are distributed to Directors in advance
of each meeting so that the meeting can benefit from informed debate.
No individuals other than the committee chairman and the members
are entitled to be present at meetings of the Nominations, Audit and
Remuneration Committees, although others including the Executive
Directors, Head of Internal Audit, Head of Taxation and the external
Auditors may attend at the prior invitation of the relevant committee.

(i) Nominations Committee
The Committee currently comprises David Gawler (Chairman),
Michael Foster, John Biles, The Hon James Bruce, Grey Denham and
Andrew Osborne. With the exception of John Biles and Michael Foster,
who were appointed to the Committee on 27 June 2006 and 24 January
2007 respectively, all were members throughout the year. All of the
members of the Committee, with the exception of David Gawler and
Michael Foster, are considered independent Non-Executive Directors
pursuant to the Code and accordingly a majority of the members of the
Committee are independent. The Committee is responsible for making
recommendations to the Board concerning appointments to the Board,
including the evaluation of the skills, knowledge and experience required
and the preparation of a job description for specific appointments. During
the year the Committee led the process to appoint Michael Foster as
Chief Executive following the change in the role of David Gawler and
also recommended the appointment of James Deeley as Legal Director
and Company Secretary following a rigorous process involving external
executive recruitment consultants. Under the terms of reference of the
Committee, the Chairman is not entitled to chair the Committee on
matters regarding the appointment of a successor to the chairmanship. Corporate governance (continued)
40 Charter plc Annual Report 2006
The Board reviewed plans for orderly management succession in relation
to both Board and senior management appointments at the Company’s
annual strategy conference in September 2006. As a result of this review,
the Board believes that appropriate plans have been adopted to ensure
that the correct balance of skills and experience are maintained on the
Board and within the senior management of the Company and its
subsidiaries and affiliates. The terms and conditions of appointment
of the Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection during normal
business hours at the registered office of the Company, in addition to
being available at the AGM for 15 minutes prior to and during the meeting.
(ii) Remuneration Committee
Throughout the year the Committee comprised The Hon. James Bruce
(Chairman), John Biles, Grey Denham and Andrew Osborne, all of
whom are considered independent Non-Executive Directors pursuant
to the Code.
A detailed explanation of the role and activities of the Remuneration
Committee can be found in the Remuneration report on pages 44 to 49.
(iii) Executive Committee
The Committee comprises the four Executive Directors, being David Gawler,
Michael Foster, Robert Careless and James Deeley, and the Chief Executive
Officers of ESAB Global and Howden Global, being Jon Templeman and
Bob Cleland respectively. Jon Templeman and Bob Cleland were appointed
to the Committee on 1 March 2006 and James Deeley became a member
on his appointment to the Board of the Company on 10 July 2006.
The remaining Executive Directors were members of the Committee
throughout the year. Meetings of the Committee generally take place
twice a month.
The Board has delegated the necessary powers and authority to the
Executive Committee for the day to day management of the affairs
of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates (other than Anderson
Group Inc (see paragraph (b) below)), subject to powers that the Board
has either retained or explicitly delegated to the various other Board
committees. The Committee operates in accordance with detailed terms
of reference that form part of the Framework.
(iv) Disclosure Committee
The Committee comprises David Gawler (Chairman), Michael Foster, Robert
Careless and James Deeley. With the exception of James Deeley who was
appointed as an Executive Director on 10 July 2006, all were members
throughout the year. The Committee is primarily responsible for the creation
and maintenance of appropriate procedures, systems and controls to
ensure compliance by the Company with its obligations under the Disclosure
and Transparency Rules and the Listing Rules of the FSA. In particular, it has
responsibility for the determination, on a timely basis, of the disclosure
treatment of material information, and assisting in, and where appropriate,
carrying out the design, implementation and periodic evaluation of
disclosure controls and procedures that operate within the Company
and its subsidiaries and affiliates. The Committee also has responsibility
for the identification of inside information, for the purpose of maintaining
the Company’s insider lists as required by the FSA’s Disclosure and
Transparency Rules.
(v) Audit Committee
Details regarding the membership, role, responsibilities and work of the
Audit Committee during the year under review can be found in the Audit
Committee Report on page 43.
(b) Anderson Group Inc
The operations of ESAB and Howden in North America are managed
by Anderson Group Inc (‘AGI’), a subsidiary of the Company. AGI’s Board
is responsible for all aspects of the management of its affairs and for the
corporate governance framework of the businesses that are operated
by its subsidiaries. The Company exercises its rights as shareholder
of AGI by appointing two nominees as Non-Executive Directors to
the Board of AGI and they, on behalf of the Company, review matters
of significance relating to its ownership interest in AGI such as board
appointments, financial results, corporate strategy, major investments
and divestments and corporate governance issues.
(c) Chairman and Chief Executive
Whilst the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive were combined for
the first half of 2006, with effect from 1 July 2006 David Gawler’s role
in the Company changed to Executive Chairman when he stood down
as Chief Executive. Michael Foster was appointed as Chief Executive
with effect from that date. At that time the Board approved a clear division
of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief Executive.
The Chairman now has the primary responsibility for leading the
Board and ensuring its effectiveness, and for ensuring that good
communications are maintained with shareholders, whilst the Chief
Executive has the responsibility for running the Company’s businesses.
At its meeting on 27 June 2006 the Board approved separate
documents that set out the respective responsibilities of the Chairman
and the Chief Executive, copies of which are available from the Company
Secretary or on the Company’s website. David Gawler has no significant
commitments that require disclosure in relation to his chairmanship.
The Chairman periodically meets the Non-Executive Directors without
the other Executive Directors present and maintains contact should they
wish to raise any issues with him outside of the formal setting of the
monthly board meetings.
(d) Board balance and independence
The Board currently comprises nine directors, four of whom are
Executive and five of whom are Non-Executive. The Board believes
that this structure provides the correct balance of skills and experience
appropriate for the business and would allow for any changes to the
Board’s composition to be managed without undue disruption, whilst
ensuring that the presence of five Non-Executive Directors prevents
a concentration of power and influence in a small number of individuals.
The Board has determined that, with the exception of John Neill who is
no longer considered to be independent by virtue of his length of service
on the Board and his relationship with the Unipart Group of Companies
which is summarised further below, all of the Non-Executive Directors are
regarded as independent. The Board does not consider that there exist
any relationships or circumstances likely to affect the judgment of any
Non-Executive Director.
John Neill is Group Chief Executive of the Unipart Group of
Companies, whose subsidiary, Unipart Logistics Limited, provides
Lean-manufacturing and logistics consultancy services to ESAB
Holdings Limited in accordance with arm’s length consultancy agreements.
The Board greatly values the contribution and experience of John Neill
and recommends his re-election at the forthcoming AGM as a
Non-Executive Director.
No Executive Directors currently hold any external Non-Executive
Directorships of any FTSE 100 company
(e) Information and professional development
The Company Secretary, under the guidance of the Executive Chairman,
is responsible for ensuring good information flows within the Board and
its committees. All Directors of the Company have access to the advice
and services of the Company Secretary and may take independent
professional advice on any matter relating to the Company at the
Company’s expense. In advance of Board and committee meetings,
Directors and relevant committee members receive detailed papers
on the matters to be considered, enabling them to request further
clarification or additional information and to participate fully in
discussions. The Company Secretary is responsible for advising the
Board, through the Executive Chairman, on all governance matters
and best practice.
The Company has a comprehensive induction process for all Non-
Executive Directors when they join the Board. This includes a detailed
information pack which combines publicly available information
such as the report and accounts and product information, in addition
to organised briefings with key members of the Board and senior
management and visits to the Company’s businesses. Charter plc Annual Report 2006 41
(f) Performance evaluation
Evaluation of the Board and its principal committees is conducted
by gathering feedback from the relevant members of the Board and
committees on bespoke questionnaires, the results of which are collated
and presented to the Board by the Chairman. The Chairman is responsible
for conducting the performance evaluation of the Chief Executive, whilst
the Non-Executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent Director, are
responsible for evaluating the performance of the Chairman, also taking
into account the views of the Executive Directors. The Chief Executive
conducts individual evaluations of the Executive Directors (with the
exception of the Executive Chairman) against a number of pre-agreed
performance objectives.
The results of the evaluations were discussed by the Board and used
to consider opportunities for improvement. Minor changes to Board
and committee procedures have been identified and are in the process
of being implemented.
(g) Reappointment
Under article 91 of the articles of association of the Company, up to one-
third of the Directors are required to submit themselves for re-election
each year. At this year’s AGM, Grey Denham and Andrew Osborne retire
by rotation and will offer themselves for re-election. John Neill also offers
himself for re-election pursuant to the Code as he has served on the Board
of the Company for more than 9 years. In addition, the appointment of
James Deeley as Legal Director and Company Secretary on 10 July 2006
means that, in accordance with Article 97 of the Company’s Articles of
Association, he must offer himself for election at the AGM. The Board
considers that these Directors continue to make an effective contribution to
the business of the Company and as a result recommends their re-election.
3 Accountability and Audit
(i) Financial reporting
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The following statement sets out the responsibilities of the Directors
in relation to the consolidated financial statements and those of the
Company. The reports of the external Auditors, shown on pages 50 and
51, set out their responsibilities in relation to those financial statements.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for
each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs
of the Company and of the Group as at the end of the financial year and
of the profit or loss of the Group for the financial year. In preparing those
financial statements, the Directors are required to:
(1) select appropriate accounting policies and apply them consistently;
(2) make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
(3) state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed,
subject to any material departures being disclosed and explained;
and
(4) prepare those financial statements on the going concern basis,
unless they consider that to be inappropriate.
The applicable accounting standards referred to in (3) above are:
(a) UK GAAP for the Company; and
(b) IFRS as adopted by the European Union and implemented
in the UK for the Group.
The Directors are responsible for ensuring that the Company keeps
sufficient accounting records to disclose with reasonable accuracy the
financial position of the Company and to enable them to ensure that the
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also
responsible for taking reasonable steps to safeguard the assets of the
Company and its subsidiaries and, in that context, to have proper regard
to the establishment of appropriate systems of internal control with a
view to the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are required to prepare financial statements and to provide
the Auditors with every opportunity to take whatever steps and
undertake whatever inspections the Auditors consider to be appropriate
for the purpose of enabling them to give their audit report.
The Directors consider that they have pursued the actions necessary
to meet their responsibilities as set out in this statement.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the
web-site. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination
of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that
the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates have adequate resources
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this
reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing
the accounts.
(ii) Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for the maintenance of a system of
internal control. The Audit Committee has been formally delegated
responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control.
The processes to manage the key risks to the success of the Company
and its businesses are reviewed and improved as necessary. There
is an organisational structure with clearly defined lines of responsibility
and delegation of authority and there are also established policies and
procedures for monitoring each business. While the operational control
is largely decentralised and responsibility is delegated, the businesses
are subject to the overall internal control framework. This, by its nature,
can provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss.
Detailed policies and procedures have been established by the Board or
the Executive Committee dealing with numerous issues, including internal
controls.Examples of internal control procedures are summarised below.
Assessment of business risk
A system of risk assessment and identification and evaluation of controls
is embedded within the Company’s management processes. Strategic
risks and opportunities arising from changes in the business environment
are regularly reviewed by the Executive Committee and formally discussed
by the Board. Risks relating to key activities within the operating businesses
and at the Company’s head office are assessed on a continuous basis
and reported to the Executive Committee and the Board.
Control environment
Under the Framework described on page 39, the Board sets overall
policy and delegates the authority to implement that policy to the
Executive Committee, which is empowered to appoint nominees
to the Board of AGI and to sub-delegate authority to the operating
businesses and operating units of ESAB Global and Howden Global.
A well-defined organisational structure with clear operating procedures,
lines of responsibility and delegated authority has been established.
There are procedures for appraisal, review and authorisation of matters
of significance, including investments, capital expenditure, borrowings,
guarantees, indemnities and material contracts.
Information and communication
The Company’s operating procedures include a comprehensive system
for reporting financial and non-financial information to the Board, including:
• the preparation and review of annual budgets;
• a review of the businesses at each Board meeting, focusing on any
new risks arising (for example, those relating to proposed major
investments and key changes in the markets); and
• meetings between various Executive Directors and operational
management.
Control procedures
Detailed operational procedures are developed for each key activity that
embody key controls. The implications of changes in law and regulations
are taken into account within these procedures. Procedures are
established to safeguard the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries
and to ensure that all financial transactions are properly recorded.
Accounting policies and practices are widely disseminated throughout
the Company’s subsidiaries and its affiliates. Corporate governance (continued)
42 Charter plc Annual Report 2006
Monitoring process
There are clear procedures for monitoring the system of internal controls.
The significant components of these are:
• The Managing Director and Finance Director of each operating
company are required to review internal controls and to return a self-
certified internal control questionnaire confirming the effectiveness
of internal control systems;
• Each operating company maintains a log of business risks. Progress
on action plans to mitigate high and medium risks is monitored in
monthly management reviews that also check for newly emerging risks.
The Board reviews every six months the systems for risk management
and monitors progress against action plans;
• As part of its audit visits to operating companies the internal audit
function evaluates the effectiveness of internal controls. The Audit
Committee reviews the findings of the internal audit process;
• The Audit Committee has specific responsibility for reviewing the
effectiveness of internal controls and monitors the process of assessing
the internal controls on behalf of the Board; and
• The Audit Committee reviews the process by which risks are identified
and assessed, and the effectiveness of controls over these risks are
assessed by operating units, operational management and head office.
The Board confirms it has carried out a review of the effectiveness
of the system of internal controls described above for the financial year
and up to the date of this report in accordance with the guidance set
out in Internal Control: Revised Guidance for Directors on the Combined
Code. The review encompassed operational, financial and compliance
controls as well as risk management. The systems used included the
following elements:
• As part of their ongoing reviews of the businesses, the Executive
Directors and key management reviewed the effectiveness of strategic,
operational and compliance internal controls and risk management.
This involved considering reports on key risk areas (concentrating on
significant changes in the risk profile) and in the light of such reviews
making appropriate amendments to policies and procedures to control
risks; and
• The Board considered reports from the Audit Committee and the Executive
Directors on these areas during the year and, at the time of approving the
Annual Report and Accounts, considered a summary of the assessments
of the effectiveness of the key risks and controls identified.
4 Relations with shareholders
The Company has a policy of maintaining an active dialogue with
institutional shareholders through individual meetings. Communications
with private shareholders are conducted through the annual report,
presentations at the AGM and the Company’s website that includes
descriptions of the Company’s business operations.
The Board receives regular updates on all meetings and communications
with major shareholders and major shareholders are offered the opportunity
to meet with the Non-Executive Directors from time to time.
The Senior Independent Director is available to shareholders if they have
concerns that cannot be addressed through the regular channels such
as the Executive Chairman, Chief Executive or Finance Director.
The Board is proposing a resolution at the forthcoming AGM to allow
communication with shareholders via the publication of shareholder
communications on its website following the legislative changes introduced
by the Companies Act 2006 and the FSA’s Disclosure and Transparency
Rules. This will enable quicker and more cost effective communication
with shareholders. Charter plc Annual Report 2006 43
Audit Committee report
Role of the Committee
The primary role of the Audit Committee, which reports its findings to
the Board, is to ensure the integrity of the financial reporting and audit
processes, and the maintenance of a sound internal control and risk
management system. In pursuing these objectives, the Committee:
• monitors the integrity of the financial statements of the Company
and any formal announcements relating to the Company’s financial
performance;
• makes recommendations to the Board regarding the adoption
of annual and interim financial reports;
• reviews the Company’s internal financial controls and internal control
and risk management systems;
• monitors and reviews the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
audit function;
• makes recommendations to the Board regarding the external Auditors
and their terms of appointment;
• reviews and monitors the external Auditors’ independence and
objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit process;
• is responsible for developing and implementing a policy on the
engagement of the external Auditors to supply non-audit services; and
• makes recommendations to the Board in relation to ‘whistleblowing’
policies and procedures.
In the performance of its duties, the Committee has independent access
to the services of the internal audit function and to the external Auditors,
and may obtain outside professional advice as necessary. Both the Head
of Internal Audit and the external Auditors have direct access to
the Chairman of the Committee outside formal committee meetings.
The Committee has written terms of reference that outline its authority
and responsibilities. These are considered annually by the Audit
Committee and any proposed changes are referred to the Board for
approval. The Committee’s current terms of reference are available upon
request from the Company Secretary and on the Company’s website.
Membership
The Committee presently comprises John Biles (Chairman), the Hon.
James Bruce, Grey Denham and Andrew Osborne, all of whom are
considered independent Non-Executive Directors pursuant to the Code.
Their biographical details are set out on page 35. There were no changes
to the membership of the Committee during 2006. The Company
Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.
The Board, as part of the review of the effectiveness of the Board and its
committees, has satisfied itself that The Hon. James Bruce, John Biles
and Andrew Osborne all have recent and relevant financial experience,
as defined in the Code.
Report on the Committee’s activities in 2006
Meetings and attendance
The Committee met on four occasions in 2006 timed to coincide with
the financial and reporting cycles of the Company. Committee members’
attendance at the meetings held during the year is set out in the table
contained in the Corporate Governance report on page 39.
The Chief Executive, Finance Director, representatives of the external
Auditors, the Head of Internal Audit and senior financial executives from
head office and the operations attended meetings by invitation for
appropriate business. In addition, the members of the Committee meet
separately with the external Auditors and the Head of Internal Audit,
to discuss matters without the Executive Directors being present.
In addition, during the year the Chairman of the Audit Committee has
had additional meetings with the Company’s senior financial managers
to review a range of financial matters, and has also met with external
and internal Auditors prior to Audit Committee meetings.
Financial reporting
During 2006 the Committee reviewed a wide range of financial reporting
and related matters including the interim and annual financial statements
prior to their submission to the Board. The Committee focused in particular
on key accounting policies and practices adopted by the Company and
its subsidiaries and affiliates and significant areas of judgement that
materially impacted reported results.
External Auditors
The Audit Committee is responsible for the development, implementation
and monitoring of the Company’s policies on external audit. The Audit
Committee has reviewed those services provided by the external
Auditors throughout the year in accordance with the Company’s policy
on the provision of non-audit services by the external Auditors. This
policy notes that such services are likely to fall within the following types:
(a) financial statements and external reports, (b) acquisitions, (c)
disposals, (d) taxation and (e) other services. It identifies three categories
of non-audit services: permitted engagements that require no specific
approval; permitted engagements requiring the approval of the
Committee Chairman; and engagements that are not permitted.
In accordance with its remit, the Committee reviewed and approved
the external Auditors’ plans for the audit of the Company’s 2006 financial
statements. In approving the terms of engagement for the audit, the
Committee considered the proposed audit fee and associated expenses.
During the year the Committee performed its annual review of the
effectiveness of the Company’s external Auditors, and has recommended
to the Board that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP be reappointed as the
external Auditors of the Company. The Committee remains satisfied
as to the independence of the external Auditors following a review at its
meeting on 6 March 2007, and has received written confirmation from
the external Auditors to this effect. A new senior audit engagement
partner was appointed during the year in accordance with professional
standards on the rotation of key audit staff.
Internal audit and monitoring of control issues
At its meetings during 2006, the Committee reviewed the results of the
audits undertaken by the internal audit function and considered the
adequacy of management’s response to the matters raised, including
the implementation of recommendations made by the function. It also
reviewed and approved the internal audit plan for the coming year and
the level of resources allocated to the internal audit function. The
effectiveness of the internal audit function was reviewed based primarily
on guidelines issued by the Institute of Internal Auditors. Following the
internal promotion of the existing Head of Internal Audit, since the year
end a new Head of Internal Audit has been appointed.
The Committee reviewed the reports from the internal audit function and
the external Auditors on the Company’s systems of internal control and
reported to the Board on the results of these reviews. Further details of
the Company’s system of internal control and its policies and procedures
can be found in the Corporate Governance report on page 41.
Whistleblowing
The Company has adopted a whistleblowing policy, which has been
monitored by the Audit Committee during the course of 2006.
Issues that have, during the year, been raised through the Company’s
whistleblowing procedures have been considered by the Committee,
and any follow-up actions have been taken as and when required.

14 March 2007 Remuneration report
44 Charter plc Annual Report 2006
The Directors present the Remuneration report for the year ended
31 December 2006. The report contains all of the information that is
required by Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 and describes
how the Company has applied the principles of the Code with regard
to remuneration.
1 The Remuneration Committee (unaudited information)
The Board has delegated authority to the Committee to review the
remuneration trends across the Company and its major businesses and
to determine the remuneration and other terms and conditions of the
Chairman, the Executive Directors, the Company Secretary and the key
management of the Company, as shown on pages 34 and 36. The
Committee is also responsible for reviewing the remuneration of those
individuals identified as senior management by the Board of the Company.
Throughout 2006 the members of the Committee were as follows:
The Hon. James Bruce (Chairman), John Biles, Grey Denham and
Andrew Osborne. All members of the Committee are deemed independent
in accordance with the Code. Details of the number of meetings held
by the Committee during the year, as well as attendance details, can
be found in the table contained in the Corporate Governance report
on page 39.
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on request from
the Company Secretary and on the Company’s website. The Committee
has access to the advice of the Executive Chairman, the Chief Executive,
the Company Secretary (none of whom participated in any discussion
relating to their own remuneration) and a number of external advisors
in conducting its duties. During 2006 the Committee consulted the
following: Hewitt Associates, who provided the Company with actuarial
advice in relation to pensions; New Bridge Street Consultants LLP , who
provided independent advice to the Committee regarding Executive
Directors’ remuneration and long term incentive arrangements (but no
further services to the Company); and Slaughter and May, who provided
the Committee with general legal advice. As the Company’s solicitors,
Slaughter and May also provided other legal advice to the Company
during the year.
2 Remuneration policy (unaudited information)
The policy for Executive Directors and key management is designed
to enable the Company to attract, motivate and retain individuals by
ensuring that their rewards are both competitive and linked to individual
and business performance.
Consistent with this policy, the remuneration packages of the Executive
Directors are intended to be competitive and comprise both fixed and
performance-related elements. Performance-related elements are
designed to comprise a significant part of potential remuneration.
Executive Directors’ remuneration is reviewed each year to ensure that
it is supportive of the Company’s business objectives and the creation of
shareholder value. It is the intention of the Committee that there should
be long-term incentive plans for Executive Directors whereby they are
rewarded with interests in the Company’s shares for sustained
performance over a period of time.
The remuneration packages for other key management are designed
to operate on a basis similar to that of the Executive Directors.
3 Remuneration
(a) Executive Directors
(i) Base salary (unaudited information)
The base salaries of the Executive Directors are reviewed annually and
following exceptional one-off events where the individual responsibilities
of the Executive Director change significantly. Salaries are benchmarked
against those paid to directors in companies of a similar size and
international complexity to the Company as well as those companies
operating within comparable sectors.
The Committee agreed the following changes to the remuneration
packages and other terms and conditions of David Gawler, Michael Foster
and Robert Careless during the year:
• On standing down from his role as Chief Executive, but remaining
as part-time Executive Chairman, David Gawler’s total compensation
was reduced to a base salary of £270,000 per annum with effect from
1 July 2006;
• Michael Foster’s base salary was increased to £340,000 with effect
from 1 January 2006. On his promotion from Commercial Director
to Chief Executive, and to reflect the increased responsibilities inherent
in his new role, Michael Foster’s base salary was increased to £400,000
per annum with effect from 1 July 2006; and
• Mr Careless’ base salary was increased to £225,000 per annum with
effect from 1 January 2006. It was then increased to £250,000 per
annum with effect from 1 July 2006 to bring it into line with salaries
paid to finance directors of similar sized companies.
James Deeley was appointed as Legal Director and Company Secretary
on 10 July 2006 on a base salary of £200,000.
For 2007, salaries have been reviewed and the Executive Directors
received increases broadly in line with the average inflation across
the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates.
(ii) Bonus (unaudited information)
In respect of the year ended 31 December 2006, all Executive Directors
were contractually entitled to receive a bonus of up to 75 per cent of
base salary depending on the achievement of a number of corporate
and individual targets, including operating profit, cash flow, earnings
per share, Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) and certain other specific
operational targets. The corporate targets were achieved for the year
under review and the TSR performance of the Company during this
period placed it in the upper quartile of the FTSE Mid 250 Index
(excluding investment trusts). Accordingly, all Executive Directors were
recommended for bonuses of 75 per cent of their base salary in respect
of the year ended 31 December 2006. David Gawler was recommended
for a bonus representing 75 per cent of his base salary earned during
the first half of the year under review. Under David Gawler’s new service
agreement, which became effective on 1 July 2006, he is no longer
eligible for a bonus.
For 2007, the maximum bonus potential for the Executive Directors
will increase to 100 per cent of salary. This decision was taken by the
Committee having reviewed bonus levels in a comparator group of
companies of similar size and complexity, and across the FTSE 250
as a whole, which showed that the previous maximum of 75 per cent
was well below current market levels. The new maximum level is also
felt to be appropriate given the Company’s recent high growth relative
to the market both by market capitalisation (as demonstrated by its
TSR performance) and turnover.
As a condition of increasing the bonus potential, one-quarter of any
bonus paid to Executive Directors (i.e. a maximum of 25 per cent of
salary) will be paid in shares and compulsorily deferred for three years
under a new Deferred Bonus Plan. Therefore, the cash maximum bonus
potential will remain unchanged from 2006 at 75 per cent of salary.
Deferred share awards will normally lapse should the Executive leave
during this three-year period through voluntary resignation or dismissal
for cause. For cessation of employment for any other reason, the Deferred
Share awards will normally vest on cessation unless the Committee
determines otherwise.
The Company’s policy is that bonuses should only be payable for the
achievement of stretching performance targets, the majority of which
are linked to the financial performance of the Company. For the year
ending 31 December 2007, these targets are as follows:
1. 64 per cent of bonus: EPS performance relative to budget
2. 16 per cent of bonus: Cash flow performance relative to budget
3. 20 per cent of bonus: Personal performance.
For targets 1 and 2, 50 per cent of the maximum bonus on each part will
be payable for meeting budget, the maximum bonus will only become
payable for performance that is substantially in excess of budget and no
bonus will be payable for performance that is substantially below budget.
The Committee has reserved the overriding discretion to review aggregate
bonus levels payable to Executive Directors based on the above criteria
to ensure that they are appropriate taking into account the overall
financial performance of the Company and its performance relative to
the market. No bonuses payable to Executive Directors are pensionable. Charter plc Annual Report 2006 45
(iii) Long Term Incentives (audited information)
The Executive Directors, with the exception of the Executive Chairman,
currently participate in the Charter 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan.
In addition, Michael Foster was granted an option under a one-off
arrangement put in place specifically to facilitate and secure his
appointment as Commercial Director in 2005.
Charter (DG – 2004) Incentive Plan (the ‘2004 Plan’)
David Gawler was initially granted an award under the Charter (DG)
Incentive Plan (the ‘2001 Plan’) which was approved by shareholders
at the AGM on 25 April 2001. This plan was replaced by the 2004 Plan,
which was approved by shareholders on 25 June 2004 and was on
substantially the same terms as the original 2001 Plan, save with regard
to the vesting date, an appropriate adjustment to take account of the
rights issue on March 2004 and an entitlement for the Company at its
option to settle the award in cash or shares. The middle market price of
shares in the Company when this award was granted was 161.5 pence.
The award under the 2004 Plan vested on 30 June 2006 and was not
pensionable. In accordance with the terms of the 2004 Plan, 1,120,579
ordinary shares of 2 pence each in the Company were issued to
David Gawler, and subsequently sold on his behalf, at a price of 802 pence
each, representing a total value of £8,987,043. The amount of this award
was calculated in accordance with a formula based upon the Company’s
share price. According to the terms of the 2004 Plan, the Company had
the option to settle the award in cash or the issue or transfer of shares
in the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or a combination of all or any
of these. The Company elected to settle the award by an issue of new
ordinary shares in the Company.
Michael Foster’s Long-term Incentive Plan (the ‘MF Plan’)
No awards were made under the MF Plan in respect of the year under
review and none are intended in the future as the MF Plan was set up as
a one-off scheme. The only award was made in 2005 to Michael Foster in
the circumstances described above. Exercise of 50 per cent of the option
requires average real earnings per share growth of 3 per cent per annum
over a single three-year period whilst the balance of the option relates
to the Company’s TSR performance compared to the constituents of
the FTSE Mid 250 Index. No vesting will occur for a below median TSR
ranking, 50 per cent of the TSR part of the grant will vest for a median
ranking and 100 per cent will vest for a ranking within the upper quartile,
with pro rata vesting for intermediate performance. Benefits under the
MF Plan are not pensionable.
The Remuneration Committee may adjust the option as it considers
appropriate. Such adjustment may be to any or all of the nominal
amount and the number of shares under the option and the exercise
price. However, any such adjustment must be on the basis that, so far
as possible, there is no material change to the total exercise price of the
option. The Committee may not reduce the exercise price of an unissued
share to below its nominal value unless and to the extent permitted under
the Companies Act 1985 and the Company’s articles of association.
The vested option may be exercised in whole or in part during the period
of twelve months starting with the date of the preliminary announcement
by the Company of its results for the year ending 31 December 2007.
Charter 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)
Under the LTIP , Executive Directors and selected other senior executives
are eligible to receive awards in one of three forms: (i) conditional
allocations, where a participant receives free ordinary shares in the
Company automatically on vesting; (ii) nil (or nominal) cost options,
where a participant can decide when to exercise his award during a short
period after it has vested; or (iii) forfeitable shares in the Company, which
are similar to conditional shares except that the participant has certain
shareholder rights prior to vesting. The Remuneration Committee may
also decide to grant cash-based awards of an equivalent value to share-
based awards or to satisfy share-based awards in cash (either in whole
or in part), although it does not intend to do so except where it would
be expedient in overseas jurisdictions.
An individual may not receive awards in any financial year over shares
having a market value in excess of 100 per cent of his annual salary
except, in exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment or retention,
where an individual may receive an award over shares worth up to 200
per cent of his annual salary.
Vesting will be based on Charter’s TSR performance compared to the
constituents of the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) over a
single three-year period beginning on the date of the grant of the award.
No vesting will occur for a below median ranking. At median, 25 per cent
of the shares will vest and 100 per cent of the shares will vest at upper
quartile. Between median and upper quartile rankings, awards will vest
on a pro rata basis. In addition, awards will only vest if the Committee is
satisfied that there has been a significant improvement in the Company’s
underlying financial performance over the three-year performance period.
The Committee may vary the performance conditions applicable to these
awards to take account of events that the Committee considers to be
exceptional, including technical events such as changes in accounting
standards, provided that, in the reasonable opinion of the Committee,
the varied conditions are at least as challenging as the original condition
would have been but for the event in question. An award will normally
only vest on or after the third anniversary of the date of grant provided
the individual remains an employee of the Company and the performance
conditions and any other objective conditions have been satisfied.
On the vesting of an award the individual acquires fully paid ordinary
shares in the Company.
During the year the Committee made five awards pursuant to the LTIP .
On 24 March 2006, Michael Foster and Robert Careless were made
conditional awards of shares and, on 10 July 2006, James Deeley was
made a conditional award of shares. Details of these awards can be
found on page 49.
(iv) Pensions (audited information)
David Gawler is not a member of the Company’s pension scheme.
Prior to stepping down as Chief Executive on 30 June 2006, a contribution
of £63,000 (equivalent to 25 per cent of his salary of £500,000 per annum
during the six-month period to 30 June 2006) was paid to him in lieu
of a pension and is included in his emoluments shown on page 48.
Under David Gawler’s new service contract in respect of his position
as Executive Chairman, which became effective on 1 July 2006,
he is not entitled to a pension or a cash payment in lieu of pension
or life assurance.
Michael Foster and Robert Careless are both members of the Company’s
HMRC approved pension scheme, providing benefits of one-thirtieth
of base salary and one-forty-fifth of base salary respectively for each year
of service as an Executive Director. They are both subject to a cap on
pensionable earnings of £105,600 per annum and are entitled to receive,
in lieu of pension, an additional 25 per cent of non-pensionable salary
to the extent that their salary exceeds this cap. These payments are
included in their emoluments shown on page 48.
Following his appointment as Legal Director and Company Secretary
on 10 July 2006, James Deeley became a member of the Company’s
HMRC approved pension scheme and is provided with benefits
of one-forty-fifth of his base salary for each year of pensionable service.
He is subject to a cap on pensionable earnings of £105,600 and is
entitled to participate in the Company’s defined contribution stakeholder
pension scheme in respect of which the Company has agreed to make
a contribution of up to a maximum of 9 per cent of his base salary
in excess of this cap.
Details of pension entitlements can be found in the table on page 48.
(v) Other benefits (audited information)
Further benefits contained within the remuneration packages of the
Executive Directors (with the exception of the Chairman) comprise tax
assessable benefits arising from employment and include car and petrol
allowances, medical insurance for the Executive Directors and their
immediate dependants and life assurance. (vi) Service contracts (audited information)

(vii) Total Shareholder Return (unaudited information)
The chart below sets out the TSR generated by Charter and the TSR of the constituents of the FTSE Mid 250 Index (excluding investment trusts)
since 2001.
In the opinion of the Directors, the FTSE Mid 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) is the most appropriate index against which the TSR of Charter plc
should be measured because it is an index of similar sized companies.

(3) The transfer value has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
(4) The transfer value of the accrued entitlement represents the value of assets that the pension schemes would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the scheme’s liabilities in respect of the
Director’s pension benefits. It does not represent sums payable to the individual Directors and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
(5) The transfer value of the increases in accrued benefits, required by the Listing Rules, discloses the current value of the increase in accrued benefits that the Director has earned in the period, whereas the change in
his transfer value, required by the Companies Act, discloses the absolute increase or decrease in his transfer value and includes the change in value of the accrued benefits that results from market volatility affecting

14 March 2007 Audit opinion – group financial statements
Independent Auditors’ report to the members of Charter plc
We have audited the group financial statements of Charter plc for the
year ended 31 December 2006 which comprise the Consolidated
income statement, the Consolidated balance sheet, the Consolidated
cash flow statement, the Consolidated statement of changes in equity
and the related notes. These group financial statements have been
prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the parent company financial
statements of Charter plc for the year ended 31 December 2006
and on the information in the Remuneration report that is described
as having been audited.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the
group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the group financial statements in accordance
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including the
opinion, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members
as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985
and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or
assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the group financial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the group financial
statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We report to
you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report
is consistent with the group financial statements. The information given
in the Directors’ report includes that specific information presented in
the Business and financial review that is cross referred from the Business
review section of the Directors’ report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information
specified by law regarding director’s remuneration and other transactions
is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate governance statement reflects the
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 Combined
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to
consider whether the board’s statements on internal control cover all
risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s
corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider
whether it is consistent with the audited group financial statements.
The other information comprises only the Directors’ report, the
Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s statement, the Business
and financial review, the unaudited part of the Remuneration report,
the Corporate governance statement and the other information listed
on the contents page of the Annual Report. We consider the implications
for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements
or material inconsistencies with the group financial statements.
Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant
to the amounts and disclosures in the group financial statements. It also
includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made
by the directors in the preparation of the group financial statements,
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide
us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the group
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused
by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information
in the group financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance
with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the state of the
group’s affairs as at 31 December 2006 and of its profit and cash flows
for the year then ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS
Regulation; and
• the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with
the group financial statements.

1 Accounting policies
(i) Basis of preparation
The financial information in this report has been prepared on the basis of accounting policies set out below in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’), International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) interpretations as endorsed by the European Union
and implemented in the UK as well as those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
Use of adjusted measures
To help provide a better indication of the Group’s underlying business performance, items which are both material and non-recurring are presented
as exceptional items and excluded from adjusted earnings per share.
Adjusted earnings per share also excludes foreign currency exchange differences on the retranslation of intercompany loans, which are determined
by reference to movements in exchange rates. These amounts are likely to be volatile and are unrelated to underlying performance.
The principal accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to all the periods presented in respect of the Company, its subsidiaries
and associated undertakings.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of financial assets and
financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates, assumptions and
judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge
of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The application of accounting principles requires the Group to make estimates, judgements and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements. On an ongoing basis,
estimates are evaluated using historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods that are considered reasonable in the particular
circumstances to ensure compliance with IFRS. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates, the effect of which is recognised in the
period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.
Critical accounting policies
Certain of the Group’s accounting policies have been identified as critical accounting policies, as these policies involve particularly complex
or subjective decisions or assessments. These are detailed below.
Estimated fixed asset economic lives
The reported amounts for amortisation of intangible fixed assets and depreciation of property, plant and equipment can be materially affected by the
judgements exercised in determining their estimated economic lives. Intangible asset amortisation and depreciation of property, plant and equipment
for continuing operations amounted to £1.9 million and £13.5 million respectively in 2006 and £1.2 million and £14.7 million respectively in 2005.
Provisions
Provision is made for liabilities that are uncertain in timing or amount of settlement. These include provisions for disposal and restructuring costs,
warranty and product liabilities and legal and environmental claims. Calculations of these provisions are based on estimated cash flows relating to
these costs, discounted at an appropriate rate where the impact of discounting is material. The total costs and timing of cash flows relating to legal
and environmental claims are based on management estimates supported by the use of external consultants. At 31 December 2006 provisions
amounted to £50.9 million (2005: £40.7 million).
Tax estimates
The Group’s tax charge is based on the profit for the year and tax rates in effect. The determination of appropriate provisions for taxation requires
the Group to take into account anticipated decisions of tax authorities and estimate the Group’s ability to utilise tax benefits through future earnings
and tax planning. These estimates and assumptions may differ from future events.
Changes to accounting standards
Amendments to published standards effective in 2006
The amendment to IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’ is mandatory for the Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2006. This
amendment introduces the option of an alternative recognition approach for actuarial gains and losses. It may impose additional recognition
requirements for multi-employer plans where insufficient information is available to apply defined benefit accounting. It also adds new disclosure
requirements. The Group has not changed its accounting policy adopted for recognition of actuarial gains and losses and in 2006 an additional liability
of £0.2 million has been recognised in respect of the Group’s multi-employer plans. The required additional disclosures of information about plan
assets and liabilities and the assumptions underlying the components of the defined benefit cost have been included for both 2006 and 2005.

• IFRIC 5, Rights to interests arising from decommissioning, restoration and environmental rehabilitation funds; and
• IFRIC 6, Liabilities arising from participating in a specific market – Waste electrical and electronic equipment.
Interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group
The following interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for the Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after
1 January 2007 or later periods but which the Group has not early adopted:
• IFRIC 8, ‘Scope of IFRS 2’ (effective from annual periods beginning on or after 1 May 2006). IFRIC 8 requires consideration of transactions involving
the issuance of equity instruments – where the identifiable consideration received is less than the fair value of the equity instruments issued –
to establish whether or not they fall within the scope of IFRS 2. The Group will apply IFRIC 8 from 1 January 2007, but it is not expected to have
any significant impact on the Group’s financial statements.
• IFRIC 10, ‘Interim financial reporting and impairment’ (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 November 2006). IFRIC 10 prohibits
the impairment losses recognised in an interim period on goodwill and investments in equity instruments and in financial assets carried at cost
to be reversed at a subsequent balance sheet date. The Group will apply IFRIC 10 from 1 January 2007 but it is not expected to have any significant
impact on the Group’s financial statements.
New accounting standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group
The following new accounting standards have been published that are mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007
or later periods but which the Group has not early adopted, are as follows:
• IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’, introduces new disclosures about financial instruments. It requires the disclosure of information about
exposure to risks arising from financial instruments, including specified minimum disclosures about credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, including
sensitivity analysis to market risk. It replaces the disclosure requirements in IAS 32.
• IAS 1 (amendment) ‘Presentation of financial statements – Capital disclosures’ introduces disclosures about the level of an entity’s capital and how
it manages capital.
(ii) Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity. A shareholding of more than
one-half of the voting rights will normally be the basis of such control. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred
to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the
fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus the costs directly attributable
to the acquisition. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired, including all
separately identifiable intangible assets, is goodwill which has been recorded as an intangible asset since 1 January 1998 (see Goodwill below).
Where additional shareholdings in associate entities are acquired any fair value adjustments related to the shareholdings prior to the increase are taken
directly to equity.
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, normally on the basis of a shareholding of between 20 per cent
and 50 per cent of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recorded at cost.
The Group’s share of its associates’ post acquisition profits or losses, net of interest and tax, is recognised in the income statement and its share of
post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in reserves. Accounting policies of associates have been changed where necessary to ensure
consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Intercompany balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains arising from intercompany transactions, are eliminated in preparing the
consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s
interest in the associates.
The Group has taken advantage of the business combinations exemption in IFRS 1 and has not restated business combinations that took place
before 1 January 2004.
(iii) Segmental reporting
The Group’s primary reporting format is business segments and its secondary format is geographical segments. A business segment is a group of
assets and operations engaged in providing products that are subject to risks and returns that are different from other business segments. Segmental
assets comprise total assets excluding income tax assets. Segmental liabilities comprise total liabilities excluding income tax liabilities and borrowings
other than bank overdrafts. A geographical segment is engaged in providing products within a particular economic environment that are subject to
risks and returns that are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments. 1 Accounting policies (continued)
(iv) Foreign currencies
Items included in the financial statements for each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment
in which that entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, the functional currency and
presentation currency of Charter plc.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of Group entities using the exchange rate at the date of transaction. Foreign
exchange gains and losses arising from the settlement of transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and
liabilities are recognised in the income statement except where deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges. The results and net assets of all
Group companies that have non-sterling functional currency are included in the consolidated financial statements as follows:
(a) Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date;
(b) Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the relevant period; and
(c) All resulting exchange differences arising since 1 January 2004 are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities are taken to shareholders’ equity. When a foreign
operation is sold, such exchange differences arising since 1 January 2004 are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
(v) Financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency swaps, are used as hedges in the financing
and financial risk management of the Group and are initially measured at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently
re-measured at their fair value at each balance sheet date.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature
of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as either: (1) hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities (fair value
hedge); (2) hedges of highly probable forecast transactions (cash flow hedge); or (3) hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
For fair value hedges, any gain or loss from re-measuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised in the consolidated income statement
together with any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.
For cash flow hedges and net investment hedges, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge
is recognised in shareholders’ equity, with any ineffective portion recognised in the income statement. When hedged cash flows result in the
recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the associated gains or losses previously recognised in shareholders’ equity are included in the initial
measurement of the asset or liability. For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in shareholders’ equity are transferred to
the income statement in the same period in which the hedged cash flows affect the income statement. For net investment hedges gains and losses
accumulated in shareholders’ equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments not designated as hedges are recognised in the income statement.
(vi) Property, plant and equipment
The Group’s policy is to carry property, plant and equipment at historic cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses except that
certain properties were revalued on transition to IFRS at 1 January 2004. These revaluations are treated as deemed cost as at 1 January 2004
as allowed by IFRS 1.
In accordance with the benchmark treatment under IFRS, borrowing costs associated with expenditure on property, plant and equipment are not
capitalised. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable
that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount
of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they
are incurred.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight line method spreading the difference between cost and residual
value over the estimated useful life as follows:
Buildings 30-50 years
Plant, machinery and equipment 8-14 years
Vehicles 5 years
IT equipment 3-5 years
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. A review of useful lives of plant,
machinery and equipment was performed during the year. This resulted in a reduction of the depreciation charge of £1.6 million for the year, which
is expected to recur over the remaining life of the plant, machinery and equipment.
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its recoverable amount
(see (viii) Impairment of assets below).
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in the income statement.

1 Accounting policies (continued)
(vii) Intangible assets
(a) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets of the subsidiary
or associate acquired.
Goodwill represented by the carrying value at 1 January 2004 under the Group’s previous accounting policy together with additional amounts
arising since that date is no longer amortised and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is included in intangible
assets in relation to subsidiaries and in investments in associates in relation to associates. In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004,
the classification and accounting treatment of business combinations has not been restated on transition to IFRS, as permitted by IFRS 1.
Goodwill arising prior to 1 January 1998 was written off directly to reserves. Goodwill arising in the period 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2003
was capitalised as an intangible asset in relation to subsidiaries and amortised on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life, a period
not exceeding 20 years or included as part of the carrying value of associates.
Goodwill acquired in business combinations and carried in the balance sheet is allocated to the cash-generating units (‘CGUs’) that are
expected to benefit from the business combination.
(b) Research and development
Research expenditure is charged to income in the year in which it is incurred.
Internal development expenditure is charged to income in the year in which it is incurred, unless it meets the recognition criteria of IAS 38
‘Intangible assets’, in which case such costs are capitalised and amortised over the estimated useful life of the asset created, usually between
three and ten years.
(c) Computer software
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred and amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated
useful life of the licence, usually between 3 and 5 years.
Internal expenditure associated with developing or maintaining computer software programmes is charged to income in the year in which it is
incurred, except costs directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group that are likely
to generate benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, in which case such costs are capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over the
estimated useful life of the software product, usually less than 3 years.
(d) Intangibles arising on acquisitions
In establishing the fair value of assets and liabilities arising on acquisitions the Group identifies the fair values attributable to intangible assets.
The intangible assets recognised include the value in respect of brands and trademarks, intellectual property rights, customer contracts and
relationships and proprietary technology rights and know-how. All intangibles recognised on business combinations are amortised over the
expected useful economic lives, usually between 3 and 10 years.
(viii) Impairment of assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, including goodwill, are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are
subject to depreciation or amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets
are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units).
(ix) Inventory
Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the first-in first-out (‘FIFO’) basis or the average cost basis.
Cost includes expenditure which is incurred in the normal course of business in bringing the product to its present location and condition.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less all disposal costs to be incurred.
(x) Assets held for sale
Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is met only when the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale is highly probable within one year from
the date of classification.
Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and cease to be depreciated from
the date of classification.
(xi) Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any
provision for impairment. A provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all
amounts due. The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement. Trade receivables are discounted when the time value of money
is considered material. Amounts due after more than 12 months from the balance sheet date are classified in the balance sheet as ‘non-current’.
(xii) Cash, cash equivalents and bank overdrafts
For the purpose of the cash flow statement, cash, cash equivalents and bank overdrafts includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks,
other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of 3 months or less and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within
borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
(xiii) Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
(xiv) Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, and are subsequently stated at amortised cost. Where borrowings
are used to hedge the Group’s interest in the net assets of foreign operations, the portion of the gain or loss on the borrowings that are determined
to be an effective hedge is recognised in shareholders’ equity. Gains and losses accumulated in shareholders’ equity are included in the income
statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months
after the balance sheet date. 1 Accounting policies (continued)
(xv) Taxation
Taxation is that chargeable on the profits for the period, together with deferred taxation. Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the
extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity including share-based payments (see (xvii) Share-based payments below), in which case
it is recognised in equity.
Deferred taxation liabilities are provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax basis of assets and liabilities
and their carrying amounts in the consolidated balance sheet.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences
can be utilised.
Deferred taxation is not provided on the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the resulting temporary difference is
controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future or where the remittance would not
give rise to incremental tax liabilities or is otherwise not taxable.
(xvi) Employee benefits
The Group accounts for pensions and similar post-employment benefits (principally healthcare) under IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’.
In respect of defined benefit pension plans, where the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement is defined by the plan,
the liability recorded in the balance sheet is the present value of the defined obligation at that date less the fair value of the plan assets, together with
an adjustment for any unrecognised actuarial gains or losses and past service costs. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by
independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
As permitted under IFRS 1 all actuarial gains and losses as at 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, were recognised for each plan. To the
extent that cumulative actuarial gains and losses arising subsequent to 1 January 2004 exceed 10 per cent of the higher of plan assets or liabilities
as at the end of the previous year, this excess is normally amortised in the income statement over the expected average remaining working lives
of the employees participating in the plan. Otherwise, the accumulated actuarial gains and losses are not recognised.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in income, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining
in service for a specified period, in which case the past service costs are spread over that period.
For defined benefit schemes, the amount charged to operating profit in the income statement comprises the current service cost, interest on plan
liabilities, the expected return on plan assets, past service cost, the impact of any settlements or curtailments and actuarial gains or losses to the
extent they are recognised.
For defined contribution plans, where the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligations to pay
further contributions irrespective of whether or not the fund has sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to service in the current
and prior periods, the contributions are recognised as an expense when they are due.
For other defined benefit post-employment obligations, principally post-employment medical arrangements in the US, a similar accounting methodology
to that for defined benefit pension plans is used.
Where the actuarial valuation of a scheme demonstrates that the scheme is in surplus, the recognised asset is limited to the extent that the Group
can benefit in future, for example, by refunds or a reduction in contributions.
(xvii) Share-based payments
The Group operates both equity-settled and cash-settled share-based compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the participation in the plan is recognised as an expense in the income statement.
In the case of equity-settled plans the fair value of the employee service is based on the fair value of the equity instruments granted. This expense
is spread over the vesting period of the instrument. The corresponding entry is credited to equity. Taxation attributable to the fair value of employee
service is taken to equity. The liability for social security costs arising in relation to the awards is re-measured at each reporting date based on the share
price as at the reporting date and the elapsed portion of the relevant vesting periods to the extent it is considered probable that a liability will arise.
Cash-settled plans are measured on a similar basis except that the fair value of the liability is re-measured at each reporting date, with changes
recognised in the income statement. For cash-settled plans the corresponding entry is included as a liability.
(xviii) Government grants
Grants receivable from governments or similar bodies are credited to the balance sheet in the period in which the conditions relating to the grant
are met. Where they relate to specific assets they are amortised on a straight line basis over the same period as the asset is depreciated. Where
they relate to revenue expenditure and/or non-asset criteria they are taken to the income statement to match the period in which the expenditure
is incurred and criteria met.
(xix) Provisions
Provisions for disposal and restructuring costs, warranty and product liability, and legal and environmental liability are recognised when the Group
has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle
the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. If all these conditions are not met then no provision is recognised. Incurred but not reported
(‘IBNR’) amounts are included in provisions. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. If the effect of discounting is material, provisions
are determined by discounting the expected value of future cash flows at a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time
value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.

1 Accounting policies (continued)
(xx) Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods and services and the value of work executed during the year
in respect of construction contracts. Revenue, which is recorded net of value-added tax, rebates and discounts, and after eliminating intra-group
sales, is recognised as follows:
(a) Sales of goods and services
The majority of the Group’s revenues relate to the sale of goods and services which are recognised when a Group entity has fulfilled
its contractual obligations to a customer and has obtained the right to receive consideration. In respect of the sale of goods this is usually
on despatch but is dependent upon the contractual terms that have been agreed with a customer.
(b) Construction contracts
Revenue is recognised by a Group entity in accordance with the stage of completion of its contractual obligations to the customer. The stage
of completion is usually based on the proportion of costs incurred compared to the total expected costs to complete the contract, where this
also represents a right to receive consideration, and provided the outcome of the contract can be assessed with reasonable certainty.
Losses on contracts are recognised in the period in which the loss first becomes foreseeable. Contract losses are determined to be the amount
by which estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract.
(xxi) Leases
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the lease term. Leasing agreements which transfer to the Group
substantially all the benefits and risks of ownership of an asset are treated as if the asset had been purchased outright. The assets are included in
property, plant and equipment and the capital element of the leasing commitments is shown as an obligation under finance leases. The lease rentals
are treated as consisting of capital and interest repayment elements. The capital element is applied to reduce the outstanding obligations and the
interest element charged to income so as to give a constant periodic rate of charge on the remaining balance outstanding at each accounting period.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and the useful lives of equivalent owned assets.
(xxii) Dividends
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised in the period when paid or, if earlier, in which the dividends are approved by the
Company’s shareholders. 2 Segment analysis
Primary reporting format – business segments
The Group is organised into two principal businesses, ESAB (welding, cutting and automation) and Howden (air and gas handling). For the purposes
of IAS 14 ‘Segment reporting’, ESAB is split into two segments; (i) welding and (ii) cutting and automation. Inter segmental revenue is not significant.
The following is an analysis of the revenue, results, assets and liabilities for the period analysed by business segment, the Group’s primary basis
of segmentation.

5 Exceptional items
To help provide a better indication of the Group’s underlying business performance, items which are both material and non-recurring are presented
as exceptional items.
In the year ended 31 December 2006, there was an exceptional credit to the tax charge of £10.5 million on the recognition of a deferred tax asset
in respect of unrecognised tax losses in North America that arose in prior years that will be utilised in future periods. As a consequence of this,
the tax charge for the year ended 31 December 2006 has been reduced by £10.5 million.
In the year ended 31 December 2005, there was exceptional income of £4.2 million, arising from the settlement of an action brought against City
Index in respect of losses incurred as a consequence of certain unauthorised payments having been made by a former employee. The proceeds
of the settlement, earlier recoveries from the Company’s insurers and realisations of a former employee’s assets have resulted in a full recovery except
for a £200,000 insurance policy deductible.

9 Earnings per share
Basic headline earnings per share is calculated on an average of 165,952,056 shares (2005: 157,739,159 shares).
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of 1,101,560 (2005:
2,208,746) dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Group has two classes of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to
employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year and the potentially
issuable shares under the Group’s long-term incentive plans.
To help provide a better indication of the Group’s underlying business performance, exceptional items and exchange gains and losses on retranslation
of intercompany loans (including attributable tax) are excluded from the calculations of adjusted earnings per share as set out in the following table.
It should be noted that the term ‘adjusted’ is not defined under IFRS and may not therefore be comparable with similarly titled profit measures
reported by other companies. It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, IFRS measures of profit.

Goodwill acquired in business combinations and carried in the balance sheet is allocated to the cash-generating units (‘CGUs’) that are expected
to benefit from that business combination. The carrying amounts of goodwill have been allocated as follows:
2006 2005
£m £m
Welding
Alcotec (single CGU) 10.4 10.4
ESAB Sp z.o.o (single CGU) 5.8 5.8

Air and gas handling
Howden South Africa (several CGUs) 0.9 0.9
Howden Compressors (several CGUs) (note 29) 7.2 –
39.3 33.1
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those
regarding discount rates, growth rates, expected sales prices and direct costs during the period. Management estimates discount rates that reflect
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts
and internal forecasts. Selling prices and direct costs are based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next two years and
extrapolates cash flows for the following years based on estimated growth rates of up to 5 per cent. This does not exceed the average long-term
growth rate for the relevant markets.
The rates used to discount the forecast cash flows were 9.2 to 22.0 per cent (2005: 11.6 to 20.5 per cent).
Other intangible assets have finite lives, over which the assets are amortised. The amortisation periods are set out in the accounting policies on page 59.
Amortisation has been included in the income statement as follows:

Total 1.0 0.9 0.9 0.3 1.9 1.2
Development costs are amortised once the asset is brought into use. The Group tests development costs for assets not yet brought into use
at least annually for impairment.
No impairment losses have been recognised in either 2006 or 2005.

(i) Disposal and restructuring costs include £1.6 million (2005: £3.1 million) in respect of employee severance costs, of which £0.6 million (2005:
£0.5 million) is in the welding, cutting and automation business and £1.0 million (2005: £nil) is in the air and gas handling business, and £0.3
million (2005: £0.5 million) in respect of property costs in the welding, cutting and automation business. This is expected to result in cash
expenditure in the next 12 months. The remaining provisions in this category are expected to be utilised over the next one to two years.
(ii) Warranty and product liability provisions relate to continuing businesses and are expected to be utilised over a period of one to two years
dependent on the warranty period provided but will also be replaced by comparable amounts as they are utilised.
(iii) Provision has been made for the probable exposure arising from legal and environmental claims and disputes, both existing and threatened,
in some cases arising from warranties given on disposal of businesses. Provisions have been made representing the best estimate of the
outcome of the claims including costs before taking account of insurance recoveries. Where the outcome of a claim is uncertain the legal costs
of defence have been provided for to the extent that they are reliably measurable. Where appropriate insurance recoveries are recognised in
‘receivables’. At 31 December 2006 these amounted to £6.9 million (2005: £1.7 million). If the effect of discounting is material, provisions are
determined by discounting the expected value of future cash flows at a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the
time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Due to their nature, it is not possible to predict precisely when these
provisions will be utilised though most are expected to be utilised over the short to medium-term with utilisation in the next year expected to be
in the region of £10 million before taking account of insurance recoveries.
(iv) Other provisions include various amounts which are not individually material. Due to their nature it is not possible to predict precisely when
these provisions will be utilised but utilisation in the next year is expected to be in the region of £1 million to £2 million.

19 Deferred tax (continued)
Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward to the extent to which the realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable
profits is probable. The Group did not recognise deferred tax assets of £53.0 million (2005: £70.6 million) in respect of taxable losses of £173.4 million
(2005: £223.8 million) that can be carried forward against taxable profits. Of these losses £113.9 million have no expiry date and £59.5 million
in respect of the US Group and China expire as follows:

In addition the Group has an unrecognised deferred tax asset in respect of its provision for post-retirement benefits under IAS 19 of £24.3 million
(2005: £37.4 million).
No deferred tax is provided on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiary undertakings as the Group is able to control the remittance
of such earnings and has no intention of making any such remittance.
A deferred tax liability of £1.5 million (2005: £1.4 million) is provided in respect of the tax that would be payable on the remittance of the retained
earnings of associates.

20 Retirement benefit obligations
The major pension schemes operated by the Group are in the United Kingdom and are of the defined benefit type, the assets of which are held
in trustee administered funds. The Group also provides post-employment medical benefits in the United States.
In accordance with the transitional rules in IFRS 1 all cumulative surpluses and deficits were recognised in the balance sheet at 1 January 2004.
Subsequent to that date IAS 19 allows a smoothing approach in which some of the movement in surpluses and deficits is deferred and recognised
over time commencing in the following accounting period (the ‘corridor approach’). Any surplus or deficit arising as a consequence of actuarial gains
and losses arising subsequent to 1 January 2004 is not fully recognised in the balance sheet.
The valuation of United Kingdom and overseas defined benefit pension schemes and the liability for United States post-employment medical benefit
liabilities are assessed by professionally qualified independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The principal actuarial assumptions used were as follows:
2006 2005
UK Overseas UK Overseas
%% %%
Discount rate 5.10 5.50 4.70 5.30
Inflation rate 3.10 2.50 2.85 2.50

Future pension increases 3.20 2.10 3.00 2.30
Medical costs inflation (ultimate rate) 5.00 5.00
The mortality assumptions for the UK schemes are based on the PA92 standard mortality tables after retirement with allowance for future mortality
improvements and scheme specific factors. Based on the rates used, a member currently aged 45 who retires at age 60 will live on average for
a further 25 years (2005: 24 years) after retirement if they are male and for a further 28 years (2005: 27 years) after retirement if they are female.
The overseas schemes are principally in the United States. The mortality assumptions for the United States schemes have been derived from the
RP-2000 table. Based on the rates used, a member currently aged 45 who retires at age 60 will live on average for a further 22 years (2005: 22 years)
after retirement if they are male and for a further 24 years (2005: 24 years) after retirement if they are female. Mortality assumptions for schemes in
Sweden and Germany have been derived from the P94 tables and the Heubeck 2005 G tables respectively.

20 Retirement benefit obligations (continued)
The expected return on plan assets is a blended average of projected long-term results for the various asset classes. Equity returns are developed
based on the selection of the equity risk premium above the risk-free rate which is measured in accordance with the yield on government bonds.
Bond returns are selected by reference to the yields on government and corporate debt as appropriate to the schemes’ holdings of these instruments.
Other class asset returns are determined by reference to current experience.
A 1% increase in the inflation assumption on medical costs would increase the total service cost and interest cost by £0.2 million and the liability
by £1.9 million. A 1% decrease in the inflation assumption on medical costs would reduce the total service cost and interest cost by £0.2 million
and the liability by £1.8 million.

21 Financial instruments and risk management
(a) Treasury management
Charter’s central treasury department is responsible for ensuring the availability and flexibility of funding arrangements in order to meet the ongoing
requirements of the Group. In addition, it is responsible for managing the interest rate risks, liquidity risks and balance sheet foreign exchange
translation risks of the Group. Foreign exchange transaction exposures are generally managed directly by operating subsidiaries within strict
guidelines and controls established by their divisional management and overseen by Charter treasury. It is the Group’s policy not to hedge profit
and loss account translation exposure.
(b) Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mix of equity and borrowings. Borrowings are made in the desired currencies at both fixed and floating
rates of interest. It is the Group’s objective to minimise the cost of borrowings whilst retaining the flexibility of funding opportunities. When considered
appropriate, the Group uses interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and collars and forward rate agreements to generate the desired interest profile
and to manage the Group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
(c) Currency risks
The Group has significant investments in overseas operations. As a result, movements in exchange rates can significantly affect the Group’s balance
sheet. In certain circumstances, currency borrowings, forward foreign exchange contracts or other derivatives may be used to hedge balance sheet
exposures. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge currency flows within its operating units. The Group seeks to comply with the
requirements of hedge accounting where considered appropriate. Until the underlying hedged item affects the consolidated income statement, the
revaluation gains and losses arising from such hedges are recognised in the consolidated statement of changes in equity to the extent that they are
effective. The ineffective portion of any hedge is recognised directly in the consolidated income statement. 21 Financial instruments and risk management (continued)
(d) Credit risk
The credit status of dealing counterparties and institutions where cash is held is kept under review with credit limits being set and monitored accordingly.
(e) Liquidity management
Together with the management of interest rate and balance sheet translation risks, the Group’s objective is to achieve a balance between continuity
and flexibility of funding by maintaining a range of maturities on its borrowings and deposits.

operations at 31 December 2006. No net investment hedges were outstanding as at 31 December 2005.
Fair values of financial liabilities
Set out below is a comparison by category of book values and fair values of all the Group’s financial liabilities at the year end:
Book value Fair value
2006 2005 2006 2005
£m £m £m £m
Primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the Group’s operations:
Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term borrowings (11.4) (10.4) (11.4) (10.4)
Long-term borrowings (7.8) (71.8) (7.8) (75.7)
The fair values of foreign exchange contracts have been calculated by reference to the prices available from the market on which the instruments
are traded. All other fair values shown above have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates. The fair values of short-term
deposits and borrowings approximate to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Market price risk
On the basis of the Group’s analysis, it is estimated that a rise of one percentage point in the principal interest rates to which the Group’s borrowings
and cash balances are exposed would increase profit before tax by approximately £0.3 million.
On the basis of the Group’s analysis, it is estimated that a fall of one percentage point in the principal interest rates to which the Group’s borrowings
and cash balances are exposed would decrease profit before tax by approximately £0.3 million.

At the Annual General Meeting held on 27 June 2006, the shareholders approved an increase in the authorised share capital to £4,600,000.
In 2006, 314,371 ordinary shares were issued for cash of £580,390 on the exercise of employee share options, 1,120,579 ordinary shares were
allotted to David Gawler in settlement of his entitlement under the terms of the DG (2004) incentive plan and 72,786 options over ordinary shares were
surrendered for cash consideration of £489,710.
At 31 December 2006 5 participants held options over a total of 242,146 ordinary shares of the Company. These options were granted under various
employee share option schemes and are exercisable during various periods up to 29 March 2011 at prices ranging from 139.9 pence to 641.2 pence.
Included in the above, under the terms of the Equity Partnership Plan approved by shareholders in 1997, are deferred rights to acquire shares.
This plan has not operated since 2001. At 31 December 2006, 1 participant held rights over 13,004 shares. As none of the performance targets
associated with any of the awards has been met, the awards would only be of value in the event of a change of control of the Company. The exercise
price of these awards would be funded by a cash bonus payable at the date of exercise and therefore the effective cost to the allottee would be nil.
Details of awards of contingent rights to the allotment of ordinary shares in the Company under long-term incentive plans are given in the
Remuneration report on pages 44 to 49.

26 Contingent liabilities
(i) Central operations
Since about 1985, Charter, its principal subsidiary Charter Consolidated PLC, and certain of their wholly owned subsidiaries have been named as
defendants in asbestos-related actions in the United States. These lawsuits have alleged that the Charter defendants were liable for the acts of Cape
PLC, a former partly owned subsidiary of Charter. Between 1985 and 1987, the issue was tried in several matters, each of which was resolved in
Charter's favour either at trial or on appeal. In subsequent years, Charter and its subsidiaries have continued to be named in asbestos-related lawsuits.
Charter has contested these actions and, in most cases, has obtained dismissals. Charter has settled some of the cases brought in Mississippi.
Currently, the only pending cases against Charter are in Mississippi, which cases are dormant and are not actively being pursued by plaintiffs. The
Directors have received legal advice that Charter and its wholly owned subsidiaries should be able to continue to defend successfully the actions
brought against them, but that uncertainty must exist as to the eventual outcome of the trial of any particular action. It is not practicable to estimate
in any particular case the amount of damages, which might ensue if liability were imposed on Charter or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries. The
defence costs and other expenses charged against Charter’s operating profits in 2006 were negligible. The litigation is reviewed each year and, based
on that review and legal advice, the Directors believe that the aggregate of any such liability is unlikely to have a material effect on Charter’s financial
position. In these circumstances, the Directors have concluded that it is not appropriate to make provision for any liability in respect of such actions.
(ii) Air and gas handling
Howden Buffalo Inc., an indirect subsidiary of Charter, has been named as a defendant in a number of asbestos-related actions in the United States.
On the advice of counsel, Howden Buffalo is vigorously defending all the cases that have been filed against it. Over the past few years, Howden
Buffalo has sought and received dismissals in 7,781 cases and has, on the advice of counsel, settled 228 cases. These cases were all settled for
nuisance value amounts, much less than the cost of defending the cases at trial. Howden Buffalo has received legal advice indicating that it should
be able to continue to defend successfully the actions that are brought. At this time, it is not practical to estimate the amount of any potential
damages or to provide details of the current stage of proceedings in particular cases, as the majority of cases do not specify the amount of damages
sought and the cases are at varying stages in the litigation process. However, legal fees associated with the defence of these claims and the cost
of the settlements have been covered by applicable insurance. The Directors believe, based on legal advice, that the majority of asbestos-related
lawsuits against Howden Buffalo, including those resulting from the historical operations of a predecessor of Howden Buffalo known as Buffalo Forge
Company, will continue to be covered, in substantial part, by applicable insurance. The situation is reviewed regularly and based on the most recent
review and legal advice obtained by Howden Buffalo, the Directors believe that the aggregate of any potential liability is unlikely to have a material
effect on Charter’s financial position.

26 Contingent liabilities (continued)
(iii) Welding
The ESAB Group Inc. (‘EGI’), an indirect subsidiary of Charter, has been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits in state and federal courts
in the United States alleging personal injuries from exposure to manganese in the fumes of welding consumables. Other current and former
manufacturers of welding consumables have also been named as defendants as well as various trade associations, including the American Welding
Society, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, the Ferroalloys Association, and others. The claimants seek compensatory and, in some
cases, punitive damages for unspecified amounts. A multi-district litigation proceeding has been established to consolidate and co-ordinate pre-trial
proceedings in the federal court cases. Last year, EGI was a defendant in two trials in the federal court involving three claimants. The juries found for
the defence and against each claimant. No further trials are currently scheduled in the federal court. EGI was also a defendant in three state trials,
each involving one claimant. All of these trials resulted in defence verdicts. Over 15 state court trials, most involving EGI, are scheduled for 2007,
but it is not anticipated that they will all begin as scheduled. Whilst litigation is notoriously uncertain and the risk of an adverse jury verdict in any trial
exists, having considered the advice of EGI’s counsel in the United States, the Directors believe that EGI has meritorious defences to these claims,
most of which should be covered in whole or in part by insurance. EGI, in conjunction with other current and former US manufacturers of welding
consumables, is defending these claims vigorously. The defence costs, net of insurance recoveries, are estimated to be of the order of US$16 million,
which is reflected in EGI’s balance sheet at 31 December 2006. In view of the foregoing and, in particular, the legal advice received in the United
States, the Directors do not consider that such claims will have a material adverse effect on Charter’s financial position.
EGI has also been named as a defendant in a small number of lawsuits in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania in which claimants allege asbestos-
induced personal injuries. The claimants seek compensatory and, in some cases, punitive damages for unspecified amounts from EGI, other welding
consumable manufacturers and other defendants who manufactured a variety of asbestos products. Several cases are listed for trial this year;
however, EGI has been dismissed prior to trial in the previous cases in which it was named as a defendant. Upon the advice of counsel, the Directors
believe that EGI has meritorious defences to these claims and EGI intends vigorously to defend these lawsuits, which should be covered in whole
or in part by insurance. In addition, the majority of defence costs are being borne by EGI’s insurers.

Current year acquisitions
On 22 December 2006, the 51% shareholdings in Howden Compressors Limited and Howden Compressors LLC not owned by the Group were
acquired for a cash consideration of £12.9 million (including costs of £0.3 million).
The value attributed to the assets acquired represents the Directors’ current estimate of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance
with IFRS 3, the values attributable to the acquisition made on 22 December 2006 may be revised as further information becomes available.

29 Acquisitions (continued)
Prior year acquisitions
On 13 September 2005, following approval by shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting, the Company completed the acquisition of the
49 per cent minority interest in the South American welding, cutting and automation businesses from the Acevedo family. Part of the purchase
consideration was satisfied on 13 September 2005 by the issue of 6,424,914 new ordinary shares in the Company, being 3.9 per cent of the enlarged
share capital with a fair value of £21.2 million based on the share price. This acquisition was classified as a related party transaction by the UK Listing
Authority. Costs of £0.9 million were directly attributable to the acquisition.
In January 2006 the vendors received £4.4 million in cash in lieu of dividends not paid in respect of the period from 1 January 2004 to 13 September 2005.

1 Basis of preparation
The financial information in this report for the Company has been prepared on the basis of accounting policies set out in note 2 using accounting
principles generally accepted in the UK (UK GAAP) and the Companies Act 1985. As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the profit
and loss account is not presented. Details of auditor’s remuneration payable by the Company is disclosed in note 4 to the consolidated accounts
on page 64.
2 Principal accounting policies
The principal accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to all the periods presented.
Foreign currencies
Foreign currency transactions are translated using the exchange rate at the date of transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from
the settlement of transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the profit
and loss account.
Investment in subsidiary undertakings
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are included at cost less provision for any impairment in value.
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is provided on the incremental liability approach in respect of timing differences giving rise to an asset or liability. Deferred taxation assets
are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Share-based payments
The Company operates equity-settled share-based compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the participation in the plan is recognised as an expense in the profit and
loss account.
The fair value of the employee service is based on the fair value of the equity instruments granted. This expense is spread over the vesting period
of the instrument. The corresponding entry is credited to equity. The liability for social security costs arising in relation to the awards is re-measured
at each reporting date based on the share price as at the reporting date and the elapsed portion of the relevant vesting periods to the extent it is
considered probable that a liability will arise.
Interest
Interest on cash and cash equivalents and borrowings held at amortised cost is recognised in the profit and loss account using the effective interest
method. Interest includes exchange differences arising on cash and cash equivalents and borrowings.
Dividends
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised in the period when paid or, if earlier, in which the dividends are approved by the
Company’s shareholders. Dividends receivable are recognised when the Company’s right to receive payment has been established and is unconditional.

At the Annual General Meeting held on 27 June 2006, the shareholders approved an increase in the authorised share capital to £4,600,000.
In 2006, 314,371 ordinary shares were issued for cash of £580,390 on the exercise of employee share options, 1,120,579 ordinary shares were
allotted to David Gawler in settlement of his entitlement under the terms of the DG (2004) incentive plan and 72,786 options over ordinary shares
were surrendered for cash consideration of £485,710.
At 31 December 2006 5 participants held options over a total of 242,146 ordinary shares of the Company. These options were granted under various
employee share option schemes and are exercisable during various periods up to 29 March 2011 at prices ranging from 139.9 pence to 641.2 pence.
Included in the above, under the terms of the Equity Partnership Plan approved by shareholders in 1997, are deferred rights to acquire shares.
This plan has not operated since 2001. At 31 December 2006, 1 participant held rights over 13,004 shares. As none of the performance targets
associated with any of the awards has been met, the awards would only be of value in the event of a change of control of the Company. The exercise
price of these awards would be funded by a cash bonus payable at the date of exercise and therefore the effective cost to the allottee would be nil.
Details of awards of contingent rights to the allotment of ordinary shares in the Company under long-term incentive plans are given in the
Remuneration report on pages 44 to 49.

9 Contingent liabilities
Since about 1985, Charter, its principal subsidiary Charter Consolidated PLC, and certain of their wholly owned subsidiaries have been named as
defendants in asbestos-related actions in the United States. These lawsuits have alleged that the Charter defendants were liable for the acts of Cape
PLC, a former partly owned subsidiary of Charter. Between 1985 and 1987, the issue was tried in several matters, each of which was resolved in
Charter's favour either at trial or on appeal. In subsequent years, Charter and its subsidiaries have continued to be named in asbestos-related lawsuits.
Charter has contested these actions and, in most cases, has obtained dismissals. Charter has settled some of the cases brought in Mississippi.
Currently, the only pending cases against Charter are in Mississippi, which cases are dormant and are not actively being pursued by plaintiffs.
The Directors have received legal advice that Charter and its wholly owned subsidiaries should be able to continue to defend successfully the actions
brought against them, but that uncertainty must exist as to the eventual outcome of the trial of any particular action. It is not practicable to estimate
in any particular case the amount of damages, which might ensue if liability were imposed on Charter or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries.
The defence costs and other expenses charged against Charter’s operating profits in 2006 were negligible. The litigation is reviewed each year and,
based on that review and legal advice, the Directors believe that the aggregate of any such liability is unlikely to have a material effect on Charter’s
financial position. In these circumstances, the Directors have concluded that it is not appropriate to make any provision for any liability in respect
of such actions.

(ii) Shareholders who are or may be unable to attend the AGM in person are entitled to appoint a proxy to attend and, on a poll, vote on their behalf.
The proxy may also demand or join in a demand for a poll. A form of proxy for shareholders accompanies this notice, and should be returned to
the Registrars (Computershare Investor Services PLC, The Pavilions, Bridgewater Road, Bristol BS13 8FB) to reach them not later than noon on
24 June 2007. A shareholder who has submitted a proxy may amend or cancel that proxy, prior to the deadline, by the submission of a further
proxy appointment or letter to cancel.
(iii) The Directors encourage all shareholders to complete and return the enclosed proxy form, whether or not they intend to be present at
the meeting.
(iv) Number of shares and voting rights
At 27 April 2007 (the last practicable date before this notice), there were 166,688,855 ordinary shares in issue, each of which carries one vote
on a poll at the AGM. No shares were held in Treasury. If a vote is taken by a show of hands at the AGM, each shareholder present and voting
will have one vote.
(v) Details of Director’s interests
Details of the interests of Directors and their connected persons in the share capital of the Company (under Section 324 of the Companies Act
1985 and DTR 3.1.2R of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the FSA), and copies of the Director’s service contracts, will be available
for inspection by members at the Registered Office of the Company during normal business hours on any working day (Saturdays and Bank
Holidays excepted) from the date of this notice and will, on the date of the AGM, be available for inspection at the offices of ABN AMRO from
11.45am to the conclusion of the meeting. On 22 March 2007 Michael Foster, Robert Careless and James Deeley were granted 46,673, 29,170
and 23,336 conditional awards respectively over the Company’s ordinary shares pursuant to the Charter 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan. There
have been no other changes in the interests of Directors between 14 March 2007 and 27 April 2007, being a date not more than one month
prior to the notice of the AGM.
(vi) Substantial shareholdings
Between 14 March 2007 and 27 April 2007, being a date not more than one month prior to the date of the notice of the AGM, there had been
no further notification of substantial shareholdings in the Company.
AGM business
(i) Consideration of the Annual Report and Accounts
Resolution 1 invites the shareholders to receive and consider the 2006 Annual Report and Accounts. Copies will also be available at the meeting.
(ii) Report on Directors’ Remuneration
Resolution 2 seeks the approval by shareholders of the Directors’ remuneration report for the financial year ended 31 December 2006. The report
is set out on pages 44 to 49 of the 2006 Annual Report and Accounts of the Company.
(iii) Re-election of Directors
Grey Denham, Non-Executive Director
Resolution 3 proposes the re-election of Grey Denham (age 58) as a Director. A qualified barrister, he is currently Company Secretary of
GKN plc and is Chairman of the GKN plc board sub-committee on governance and risk. He is the President of GKN America Corporation and
is also a director of GKN Holdings plc and GKN (United Kingdom) plc. He is also a Non-Executive Director of the charity Young Enterprise UK.
Andrew Osborne, Non-Executive Director
Resolution 4 proposes the re-election of Andrew Osborne (age 40) as a Director. He is a chartered accountant and serves as the Finance and
Corporate Development Director of Geoffrey Osborne Limited. He was appointed as a Director of the Company in February 2005, and serves
on the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees.
John Neill, Non-Executive Director
Resolution 5 proposes the re-election of John Neill (age 59) as a Director. John Neill was appointed as a Director of the Company in February
1994. He is Group Chief Executive of the Unipart Group of Companies Ltd. and a Non-Executive Director of Royal Mail Group plc. He was
formerly a Director of the Bank of England. Although John Neill is no longer considered to be independent by virtue of his length of service on the
Board and his relationship with the Unipart Group of Companies, the Board greatly values his extensive industry experience and considers that
he continues to make a positive contribution to the Board and the direction of the Company. Accordingly the Board recommends his re-election
as a Non-Executive Director.
James Deeley, Legal Director and Company Secretary
Resolution 6 seeks the approval of shareholders for the appointment of James Deeley (age 43), who was appointed to the Board as Legal
Director since the last AGM. He also serves as Company Secretary. James Deeley is a qualified solicitor with wide experience in public company
legal matters. He began his career with Slaughter and May before moving to Charter plc as Group Legal Adviser. He has subsequently held
positions as Director of Legal Services at Regus plc, Head of Group Legal at DS Smith plc and was Corporate Services Director and Company
Secretary of Numerica Group plc. He is also a Trustee of SeeAbility (formerly The Royal School for the Blind), a registered charity.
The Chairman has confirmed that, following a formal performance evaluation of the Board, its committees and of individual Directors, Messrs.
Denham, Osborne and Neill continue to be effective in their roles as Non-Executive Directors of the Company, and demonstrate appropriate
commitment in this capacity (including ensuring that sufficient time is available for Board and committee meetings, and other duties as required). (iv) Re-appointment of Auditors
The current Auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , have indicated that they are willing to be re-appointed as the Auditors of the Company
for the period to the next AGM, and Resolution 7 proposes that they are re-appointed for that period.
Resolution 8 authorises the Directors to set the remuneration of the Auditors. This is delegated by the Board to the Audit Committee, which
is entirely composed of Independent Non-Executive Directors.
(v) Authority to allot shares
Resolution 9 authorises the Directors to allot authorised but unissued ordinary shares of the Company up to a total of 55,562,951 shares,
representing one-third of the of the issued share capital as at 27 April 2007, the last practicable date prior to the publication of this notice.
This authority will expire at the close of the 2008 AGM of the Company.
(vi) Disapplication of pre-emption rights
Resolution 10 authorises the Directors to allot shares as if the normal pre-emption requirements did not apply. The Resolution grants two authorities:
(a) in respect of a broadly pre-emptive offer, it permits the Directors to deal with fractional entitlements and to provide for jurisdictions where there
are legal or practical restrictions on allotting shares;
(b) for allotments which are not pre-emptive, the Directors are limited to allotting a maximum of 8,334,442 shares, representing approximately
5 per cent of the issued share capital of the Company as at 27 April 2007, the last practicable date prior to the publication of this notice.
This corresponds with the guidance level indicated by the Association of British Insurers and the National Association of Pension Funds.
This authority will also expire at the end of the 2008 AGM of the Company. The Directors have no present intention of exercising this authority
or that in Resolution 9, except for allotments of shares pursuant to the Company's share option schemes and long term incentive plan (‘LTIP’),
and would not seek to issue more than 7.5 per cent of the issued share capital of the Company in any rolling three-year period without prior
consultation with the investment committees of the Association of British Insurers and National Association of Pension Funds.
(vii) Authority to purchase shares on the market
Resolution 11 authorises the Company to make market purchases of ordinary shares at a price not in excess of the average price for the five
business days before the date of purchase. The authority is limited to a maximum of 16,668,885 shares, representing about 10 per cent of the
issued share capital of the Company as at 27 April 2007, the last practicable date prior to the publication of this notice. This corresponds with
the guidance level indicated by the Association of British Insurers and the National Association of Pension Funds.
At the present, the Directors have no intention to use this authority except to ensure that obligations under the Company’s share option schemes
and LTIP can be met in an appropriate and timely way. The Directors anticipate that any shares bought under this authority would be held as
treasury shares rather than cancelled.
At 27 April 2007, (the last practicable date prior to the publication of this notice) 242,146 options to subscribe for shares in the Company were
outstanding, representing approximately 0.15 per cent of the issued share capital at that date. If the full authority granted in Resolution 11 were
exercised, they would represent approximately 0.16 per cent of the reduced issued share capital.
(viii) Approval for political donations
The law currently prohibits any company from making a donation or providing other support to a political party without the prior consent of
the shareholders.
It is the policy of the Board that Charter will not provide financial or other support for or to a political party in the form of donations. However,
certain activities that are undertaken in the usual course of the business may fall within the legal definition of support for a political party.
Therefore, the Directors have decided that authority should be sought from the shareholders to ensure that all of the activities of the Company
fully comply with the law.
Resolution 12 authorises the Directors to make political donations for the five-year period commencing with the date of the AGM. The law does
not currently permit the shareholders to formally restrict the discretion of the Directors to make donations when authorised. However, the Board
intends to use this authority only where incidentally necessary in the normal course of business, and will not be making direct donations
to political parties.
(ix) Shareholder communication through the internet
Resolution 13 seeks the agreement of shareholders to permit the Company to communicate with them electronically by placing shareholder
documents (including but not limited to, notices of meetings and copies of the Annual Report and Accounts) on a website and notifying them
in writing that such documents are available, thereby taking advantage of new provisions in the Companies Act 2006 and the Disclosure and
Transparency Rules of the FSA.
(x) Refreshments
Prior to the meeting refreshments will be available for shareholders at the venue from 11.30am.

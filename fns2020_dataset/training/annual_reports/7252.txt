AsreportedbyHoweRobinson:“Annualdry-bulkreview2010andoutlookfor2011” CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
I am pleased to report that Hellenic Carriers has delivered strong and
healthyresultsfor2010despitethechallengingmarketconditionsof
the dry bulk sector.
The volatility and uncertainty in the global ﬁnancial markets, and the
shipping market in particular, was a signiﬁcant factor during the
reporting period. Yet, as a result of implementing a prudent and
proactive business strategy, Hellenic has been able to strengthen the
Company’s trading performance and cash reserves by restructuring
existing time charter agreements and taking advantage of short term
opportunitiesthataroseduringtheyear.Despitethemarketdownturn
thatoccurredattheendof2008anditssequentialeﬀectsinto2009,
togetherwiththecontinuedvolatilitytheglobalmarketshavefacedin
2010, Hellenic is pleased to report that the Company has continued
with its dividend payments each year.
During2010theCompany’sﬂeetrenewalandexpansionprogramwas
initiated to improve long term growth and proﬁtability with the sale of
oneolderPanamaxvesselatfavourableterms,andtheplacingoforders
fortheconstructionoftwonewbuildingKamsarmaxvessels.Hellenic’s
operational ﬂeet now comprises of three Panamaxes, one Supramax
and one Handymax, a diversiﬁed ﬂeet which oﬀers wider employment
opportunities. The Company’s expansion in the Kamsarmax sector will
not only grow the ﬂeet with larger vessels and reduce the weighted
average age, but will also enhance our versatility as these vessel sizes
have shown high resilience, strong returns and employment ﬂexibility.
Looking forward, Hellenic Carriers is in a strong ﬁnancial condition to
take advantage of the opportunities in this testing market to further
grow the ﬂeet through selective acquisitions that will maximize the
long term value for our shareholders. With an eﬃciently run ﬂeet and
experienced management, Hellenic is well positioned to face the
market challenges of the coming year.

payment of a ﬁnal dividend for 2010 of GBP 5.45 pence per share or
total GBP 2,486,118 evidencing the Company’s consistency and
reliability throughout the shipping cycle.
During the year we continued to employ our vessels primarily under
medium to long term charters generating healthy cash ﬂows, to
strengthen our balance sheet and to reinforce our liquidity. This
strategy, which we have persistently followed during the last three
years, has allowed us not only to face challenging market conditions,
torewardourshareholdersthroughourdividendpayments,butalsoto
initiate our ﬂeet renewal and expansion programme.
Since early 2010 the market conditions placed a signiﬁcant premium
onsecondhandvessels,relativetothevalueofnewbuildings.Wetook
advantage of this opportunity by selling in May 2010 a 17-year old
Panamax dry bulk carrier at a price of U.S.$23.5 million out of which
U.S.$21.0 million was used towards debt repayment. We then placed
ordersfortheconstructionoftwoKamsarmaxnew-buildingvesselsat
U.S.$34.2 million each. Through the order of these vessels, which will
be delivered in the Q1 2013, we shall expand our presence in the
Panamax / Kamsarmax sector which has performed strongly and
shown resilience during times of depressed freight earnings.
Volatility has been present in the dry bulk market, however since Q4

owned ship owning subsidiaries, and operator, through its wholly
ownedmanager,HellenicShipmanagementCorp.,ofaﬂeetofdrybulk
vesselsthattransportironore,coal,grain,steelproducts,aluminaand
other dry bulk cargoes worldwide.
During the period in review, the Company, through its two newly
formed subsidiaries, placed orders for the construction of two
Kamsarmax vessels with delivery in January and March 2013. In
addition, one of its older vessels, a 1993 built Panamax vessel was
sold in August 2010. Following the sale of this vessel, the operating
ﬂeet at the end of the period under review included three Panamax
vessels, one Supramax vessel and one Handymax vessel.
TheCompany,whichwasincorporatedunderthelawsofJerseyon26

Outlook / Future prospects
TheCompany,throughitssubsidiaries,operatesaﬂeetofdrybulkcarrier
vessels throughout the world’s trade routes. Shipping markets are by
naturecyclicalandpronetovolatilityandasaconsequencecharterrates,
vessel values and in turn operational results are directly aﬀected by the
prevailingchangesintheshipdemandandsupplybalance.
Average earnings in 2010 for the dry bulk shipping markets were
marginally higher than the levels witnessed in 2009. This is despite a
considerable increase in the world ﬂeet as deliveries of new buildings
gathered pace during the year. Although well below the highs
witnessed in previous years, the fact that vessels’ earnings were
maintained last year despite the sizeable increase in the overall ﬂeet,
evidences that demand for dry bulk shipping continues to grow.
Going forward, despite continued presence of strong demand for dry
bulk cargoes, earnings will inevitably come under pressure as
deliveriesofnewbuildingvesselscontinueinto2011.Freightvolatility
will remain a feature of the market and in response Hellenic will
maintain its ﬂexible chartering strategy adapting to the prevailing
market conditions.
Weconsiderthatmarketconditionsin2011willprovideopportunities
to further grow our existing ﬂeet through prudent acquisitions of
second hand or new building tonnage which will add to the long term
value of the Company. Hellenic will continue to work closely with
existing Charterers and seek to create ties with new reliable
counterparties, whilst closely managing the company’s operational
costs, in order to achieve the continued proﬁtable employment of the
Company’s ﬂeet.

anddisclosureofcontingentliabilitiesatthereportingdate.However,
uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in
outcomesthatrequireamaterialadjustmenttothecarryingamount
of the asset or liability aﬀected in the future. The estimates and
assumptions that have the most signiﬁcant eﬀect on the amounts
recognisedintheconsolidatedﬁnancialstatements,arethefollowing:
Vessels: Managementmakesestimatesinrelationtousefullivesof
vessels considering industry practices. (Vessels have a carrying
amount of U.S.$146,491 and U.S.$173,459 as at 31 December
2010and2009,respectively).Estimatesandassumptionsrelating
to the impairment of vessels are discussed in paragraph (m) below.
Provisions for doubtful trade receivables: Provision for
doubtful trade receivables are recorded based on management’s
expectedfuturecollectabilityofthereceivables.Tradereceivables,
haveacarryingamountofU.S.$418andU.S.$236asat31December
2010 and 2009, respectively).
Insurance Claims: Amounts for insurance claims are provided
when amounts are virtually certain to be received, based on the
Company’s judgement and estimates of independent adjusters as
to the amount of the claims (Insurance claims have a carrying
amount of U.S.$3,772 and U.S.$1,148 as at 31 December 2010
and 2009, respectively).
(e) Revenues and Related Expenses: The Company through its
subsidiaries generates revenues from the charter hires and/or
freights earned by the vessels. Vessels are chartered using either
timecharters,whereacontractisenteredintofortheuseofavessel
for a speciﬁc period of time and a speciﬁed daily charter hire rate;
orvoyagecharters,whereacontractismadeinthespotmarketfor
the use of a vessel for a speciﬁc voyage against a speciﬁed freight
calculated on the basis of the quantity of cargo carried on board.
If a time charter agreement exists and collection of the related
revenueisreasonablyassured,revenueisrecognisedonastraight
line basis over the period of the time charter. Such revenues are
treated in accordancewith IAS 17 as lease incomeas explained in
paragraph (r) below. Associated voyage expenses, which primarily
consist of charterers’ address commissions and brokers’
commissions,arerecognisedonapro-ratabasisovertheduration
of the period of the time-charter.
Ifavoyagecharterexists,thevoyageisdeemedtocommenceupon
the completion of discharge of the vessel's previous cargo and is
deemed to end upon the completion of discharge of the cargo
carried under the speciﬁc voyage charter. Vessel voyage expenses
primarily consisting of port, canal and bunker expenses that are
unique to a particular charter are paid for by the charterer under
time charter arrangements or by the vessel owning companies
undervoyagecharterarrangements.Thevesselowningcompanies
defer bunker expenses under voyage charter agreements and
chargethemtotheconsolidatedincomestatementovertherelated
voyagecharterperiodtotheextentrevenueisrecognised.Portand
36 canal costs are accounted for on an actual basis. Operating
expenses are accounted for on an accrual basis.
Deferred revenue represents cash received prior to the ﬁnancial
positiondatewhichrelatestorevenueearneda ersuchdate.When
a vessel is time chartered, the charterer as per industry practice
pays the revenue related to the speciﬁc agreement in advance
(usually 15 days in advance). Therefore, as of ﬁnancial position
date,theamountofrevenuerelatingtothenextﬁnancialyearthat
was paid by the charterer is presented in deferred revenue.
Deferred revenue also includes the value ascribed to time charter
agreements assumed upon the purchase of a vessel, if any. This
ascribedamountisamortisedovertheremainingtermofthetime
charter and the amortised portion for the period is included in
revenue for the period.
(f) Foreign Currency Translation: The functional and presentation
currency of the Company and its subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar
because the vessels operate in international shipping markets
whichutilisetheU.S.dollarasthefunctionalcurrency.Transactions
involving other currencies during the year are converted into U.S.
dollars using the exchange rates in eﬀect at the time of the
transactions. At the ﬁnancial position dates, monetary assets and
liabilities, which are denominated in currencies other than the U.S.
dollar, are translated into the functional currency using the year-
endexchangerate.Gainsorlossesresultingfromforeigncurrency
transactions are included in foreign currency gain or loss in the
consolidated income statement.
(g) Cash and Cash Equivalents: The Company and its subsidiaries
consider highly liquid investments such as time deposits and
certiﬁcatesofdepositwithanoriginalmaturityofthreemonthsor
less to be cash equivalents.
(h) Restricted Cash: Certain of the Company’s and its subsidiaries’
loanagreementsrequirethemtodepositfundsintoaloanretention
account in the name of the borrower. The amount deposited is
equivalent to the monthly portion of the next capital and interest
payment. In addition, certain loan agreements require the
establishment of earnings recapture account for the deposit of
fundsduetothelenders,beingpartoftheexcessearningsderived
fromtheoperationofthevessels.Theamountisnotfreelyavailable
and it is used for repaying interest and principal on the loan.
(i) Inventories: Inventories consist of lubricants and victualling and
are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost is
determined by the ﬁrst-in ﬁrst-out method. As at 31 December
2010, one vessel was operating under a voyage charter, thus
inventory of bunkers amounting to U.S.$271 was included in
inventories,whereason31December2009,allvesselswereunder
time-charter agreements, thus there was no inventory of bunkers.
(j)TradeReceivables:Theamountshownastradereceivablesateach

Impaired debts are derecognized when they are assessed as
uncollectible.AllowancefordoubtfulreceivablesamountedtoU.S.$
nil and U.S.$446 at 31 December 2010 and 2009, respectively.
(k) Insurance Claims: The Company and its subsidiaries recognise
insurance claim recoveries for damages to vessels in relation to
insured risks. Insurance claim recoveries are recorded net of any
deductible amounts, at the time the vessels suﬀer such damages.
They include the recoveries from the insurance companies for the
claims, provided the amounts are virtually certain to be received.
Claims are submitted to the insurance company, which may
increase or decrease the claim amount. Such adjustments are
recordedintheyeartheybecomeknown.Insuranceclaimsreceivable
amounted to U.S.$3,772 and U.S.$1,148 at 31 December 2010
and 2009, respectively (note 17).
(l)Vessels:Thevesselsarestatedatcost,netofaccumulateddepreciation
and any accumulated impairment loss. Vessel cost consists of the
contractpriceforthevesselandanymaterialdirectcostsincurred
37 upon acquisition of the vessel (initial repairs, improvements,
deliverycostsandotherexpenditures)topreparethevesselforits
initial voyage. Subsequent expenditures for major improvements
are also capitalised when it is probable that future economic
beneﬁtsassociatedwiththeimprovementwillﬂowtotheentityand
the cost of the improvement can be measured reliably.
For vessels acquired in the second-hand market and where the
Company identiﬁes any intangible assets or liabilities associated
with the acquisition of a vessel, the Company allocates the
purchase price between the vessel and any identiﬁed intangible
assets or liabilities based on their relative fair values.
Fairvalueisdeterminedbyreferencetomarketdata.TheCompany
determinesthefairvalueofanyintangibleassetorliabilityrelated
to time charters assumed, by reference to the market value of the
time charters at the time the vessel is acquired. The amount to be
recorded as an asset or liability at the date of vessel delivery is
based on the diﬀerence between the current fair market value of
the charter and the net present value of future contractual cash
ﬂows. When the present value of cash ﬂows of the time charter
assumed is greater than the current fair market value of such
charter, the diﬀerence is recorded as prepaid charter revenue (an
asset). When the opposite situation occurs, the diﬀerence is
recorded as deferred revenue (a liability). Such assets and
liabilities, respectively, are amortised as a reduction of, or an
increase in, revenue over the period of the time charter assumed.

income statement in the year the vessel is derecognised.
From time to time the vessels are required to be dry-docked for
inspection and re-licensing at which time major repairs and
maintenance that cannot be performed while the vessels are in
operation are generally performed. The costs associated with dry-
dockingarecapitalisedandaddedtothecostofvesselasoccurred.
They are amortised on a straight-line basis over the year until the
next scheduled dry-docking, generally 2.5 years. In cases where,
the dry-docking takes place earlier than 2.5 years since the
previous one, the carrying amount of the previous dry-docking is
derecognised.Intheeventofavesselsale,therespectivecarrying
values of dry-docking costs are derecognised together with the
vessel’s carrying amount at the time of sale.
At the date of acquisition of a second-hand vessel, management
estimates the component of the cost that corresponds to the
economicbeneﬁttobederiveduntilthenextscheduleddry-docking
of the vessel and this component is depreciated on a straight-line
basis over the remaining period until the next estimated dry-
docking date.
(m) Impairment of Vessels: Thevesselsarereviewedforimpairment
inaccordancewithIAS36,"ImpairmentofAssets."UnderIAS36,
the Company and its subsidiaries assess at each reporting date
whetherthereisanindicationthatavesselmaybeimpaired.Ifsuch
an indication exists, the Company and its subsidiaries make an
estimate of the vessel’s recoverable amount. Any impairment loss
of the vessel is assessed by comparison between the carrying
amount of the asset and its recoverable amount. Recoverable

If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount of the
vessel,theassetisconsideredimpairedandanexpenseisrecognised
equal to the amount required to reduce the carrying amount of the
vessel to its then recoverable amount. Fair value of vessels is
determined by independent marine appraisers. If the valuation from
the appraiser indicates possible impairment, the Company and its
subsidiariesproceedtocalculatethevessel’svalueinuse.
Thecalculationofvalueinuseismadeattheindividualvessellevel
since separately identiﬁable cash ﬂow information is available for
each vessel. In developing estimates of future cash ﬂows, the
38 relevantvesselowningcompaniesmakeassumptionsaboutfuture
charter rates, vessel operating expenses and the estimated
remaining useful lives of the vessels.

speciﬁc circumstances of the Company and its subsidiaries and
derived from its weighted average cost of capital (WACC).
The impairment loss recognised by the Company and its
subsidiaries was U.S.$ nil and U.S.$ nil for the years ended
31 December 2010 and 2009 respectively (note 7).

accountanyissuecostsandanydiscountorpremiumonsettlement.
A ﬁnancial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the
liability is discharged or cancelled or expired.
The Company and its subsidiaries capitalise borrowing costs that are
directly attributable to acquisition or construction of the asset.
(o) Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging: The Company
and its subsidiaries use derivative ﬁnancial instruments such as
interest rate swaps to hedge risks associated with interest rate
ﬂuctuations. Such derivative ﬁnancial instruments are initially
recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract
is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value
using bid-market prices on each reporting date. Derivatives are
carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities
when the fair value is negative.
Anygainsorlossesarisingfromchangesinfairvalueonderivatives
during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken
directly to proﬁt or loss.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classiﬁed as:
• Fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to changes in the
fairvalueofarecognisedassetorliabilityoranunrecognisedﬁrm
commitment (except for foreign currency risk); or
• Cash ﬂow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash
ﬂowsthatiseitherattributabletoaparticularriskassociatedwith
a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast
transaction or the foreign currency risk in an unrecognised ﬁrm
commitment; or
• Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation.
At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Company and its
subsidiariesformallydesignateanddocumentthehedgerelationship
to which they wish to apply hedge accounting and the risk
managementobjectiveandstrategyforundertakingthehedge.The
documentationincludesidentiﬁcationofthehedginginstrument,the

how the entity will assess the hedging instrument’s eﬀectiveness in

be highly eﬀective in achieving oﬀsetting changes in fair value or
cash ﬂows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that
they actually have been highly eﬀective throughout the ﬁnancial
reporting periods for which they were designated.
39 Hedges which meet the strict criteria for hedge accounting are
accounted for as follows:
Cash Flow Hedges
Theeﬀectiveportionofthegainorlossonthehedginginstrument
is recognised directly in equity, while any ineﬀective portion is
recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the consolidated
income statement when the hedged transaction aﬀects proﬁt or
loss,suchaswhenthehedgedﬁnancialincomeorﬁnancialexpense
is recognised or when a forecast sale occurs. Where the hedged
item is the cost of a non-ﬁnancial asset or non-ﬁnancial liability,
the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying
amount of the non-ﬁnancial asset or liability.
If the forecast transaction or ﬁrm commitment is no longer
expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are
transferred to the consolidated income statement. If the hedging
instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without
replacementorrollover,orifitsdesignationasahedgeisrevoked,
amounts previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the
forecast transaction or ﬁrm commitment occurs.
The Company and its subsidiaries use interest rate swaps as
hedges of their exposure to hedge risks associated with interest
rate ﬂuctuations (note 14).
(p) Segment Reporting: The Company and its subsidiaries report
ﬁnancialinformationandevaluatetheiroperationsbycharterrevenues
and not, for example, by (i) the length of ship employment for their
customers,i.e.spotortimecharters;or(ii)typeofvessel.Management
reviews operating results solely by revenue per day and operating
results of the ﬂeet and thus the Company and its subsidiaries have
determined that they operate under one reportable segment.

(q) Finance Income: Finance income is earned from the short-term
deposits of the Company and its subsidiaries and is recognised on
the accrual basis.
(r) Leases: Leases of vessels where the vessel owning companies do
not transfer substantially all the risks and beneﬁts of ownership of
thevesselareaccountedforasoperatingleases.Leaseincomeon

(t) Provisions and Contingencies: Provisions are recognised when
the Company and its subsidiaries have a present legal or
constructiveobligationasaresultofpastevents,itisprobablethat
an outﬂow of resources embodying economic resources will be
required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the
amount of the obligation can be made. Provisions are reviewed at
each ﬁnancial position date and adjusted to reﬂect the present
value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the
obligation. Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the ﬁnancial
statementsbutaredisclosedunlessthepossibilityofanoutﬂowof
resources embodying economic beneﬁts is remote. Contingent
assets are not recognised in the ﬁnancial statements but are
disclosed when an inﬂow of economic beneﬁts is probable.
(u) Oﬀsetting of Financial Assets and Liabilities: Financial assets
and liabilities are oﬀset and the net amount is presented in the
consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position only when the
Company and/or its subsidiaries have a legally enforceable right
to set oﬀ the recognised amounts and intend either to settle such
asset and liability on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle
the liability simultaneously.
(v) Derecognition of Financial Assets and Liabilities:
(i) Financial assets
A ﬁnancial asset (or, where applicable a part of a ﬁnancial asset or
part of similar ﬁnancial assets) is derecognised where:
• the rights to receive cash ﬂows from the asset have expired;
• the Company and/or its subsidiaries retain the right to receive
40 cashﬂowsfromtheasset,buthaveassumedanobligationtopay
them in full without material delay to a third party under a
“pass-through” arrangement; or
•theCompanyand/oritssubsidiarieshavetransferredtheirrights
toreceivecashﬂowsfromtheassetandeither(a)havetransferred
substantially all the risks and rewards of the assets, or (b) have
neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and
rewards of the asset, but have transferred control of the asset.
Where the Company and/or its subsidiaries have transferred their
rights to receive cash ﬂows from an asset and have neither
transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of
the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the asset is
recognised to the extent of the Company and/or its subsidiaries
continuing involvement in the asset. Continuing involvement that
takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is
measuredattheloweroftheoriginalcarryingamountoftheasset
and the maximum amount of consideration that the Company
and/or its subsidiaries could be required to repay.
(ii) Financial liabilities
A ﬁnancial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the
liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. Where an existing
ﬁnancial liability is replaced by another from the same on
substantiallydiﬀerentterms,orthetermsofanexistingliabilityare
substantially modiﬁed, such an exchange or modiﬁcation is treated
as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a
new liability, and the diﬀerence in the respective carrying amounts
is recognised in the consolidated income statement.

(y) IFRS and IFRIC Interpretations not yet eﬀective:TheCompany
and its subsidiaries have not applied the following IFRS and IFRIC
Interpretationsthathavebeenissuedbutarenotyeteﬀectiveand
not early adopted:
-IFRIC19,“ExtinguishingFinancialLiabilitieswithEquityInstruments”.
The interpretation is eﬀective for annual periods beginning on or
a er 1 July 2010. This interpretation addresses the accounting
treatment when there is a renegotiation between the entity and
the creditor regarding the terms of a ﬁnancial liability and the
creditoragreestoaccepttheentity’sequityinstrumentstosettle

instruments are “consideration paid” in accordance with
paragraph 41 of IAS 39. As a result, the ﬁnancial liability is
derecognised and the equity instruments issued are treated as
consideration paid to extinguish that ﬁnancial liability. The
Company and its subsidiaries do not expect that the amendment
will have an impact on their ﬁnancial position or performance.

The balance due from Hellenic Carriers Corporation S.A., a related
party under common control, was created upon the Group’s
restructuring during the Company’s preparation for admission to AIM
and is expected to be settled.
Directors’ remuneration for the year ended 31 December is analysed
as follows:
Mr.DimitrisSfakianakisresignedfromthepostofChiefFinancialOﬃcer
and stepped down as a Director of the Company on 31 October 2009.
The Director’s remuneration amounts are agreed in currencies other
than the U.S. dollar (namely GBP and Euro), therefore the variation
between the amounts of 2010 and 2009 reﬂect foreign exchange
diﬀerences. No pension contributions were made during the years
ended 31 December 2010 and 2009. 13. Long-Term Debt

notional amounts of the swaps were U.S.$33,650 and U.S.$37,700
representing81.3%and58.6%oftheoutstandingbalanceofloansa
and b respectively (see note 13).
The cash ﬂow hedges of the expected future libor payments were
assessed to be highly eﬀective throughout the ﬁnancial period,
therefore, a net unrealised loss on cash ﬂow hedges amounting to
U.S.$488 has been charged to the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income for the year ended 31 December 2010. For
the year ended 31 December 2009, the Company recognised a net

Permanent repairs were carried out in a dry-docking yard and were
concluded on 17 November 2010, together with the vessel’s special
survey. The vessel remained oﬀ-hire for an aggregate period of 136
days and was redelivered to her charterers on 5 December 2010, to
resume service under the time charter agreement. The shipowning

19. Commitments and contingencies
Further to the repudiation of a two year time charter contract between
Arkadia Maritime Corp. (“Arkadia”), the vessel owning company of the
M/V Hellenic Horizon and Samsun Logix Corporation (“Samsun”) as
charterers in February 2009, Arkadia was registered as unsecured
creditor in the Rehabilitation proceedings that were commenced by
Samsun in Korea with respect to its claim for unpaid hire and damages
amounting to U.S.$17.5 million. Following a dispute before the Korean
CourtsbetweenArkadiaandSamsunonthedamagesclaimthecompetent
courtsofSeoulruledinfavourofArkadiaon14December2009.
GivenSamsun’srighttoappealagainsttheabovejudgementaswellas
the uncertainty of the outcome of the implementation of the
rehabilitation proceedings, the Company provided, on 31 December
2009,fortheoutstandinghirefromSamsunanddidnotrecogniseany
amount for damages that were being claimed.
55 On 19 January 2010, a settlement agreement was reached between
Arkadia and Samsun, whereby: a) Samsun acknowledged the total
amount of the claim and waived its rights to appeal against the above
mentioned decision of the Korean Court and b) Arkadia consented to
approve the Rehabilitation Plan, prepared by Samsun, at the meeting
of the Samsun creditors of 5 February 2010. According to the plan,
Arkadia may recover the acknowledged claim as follows: (i) 34% of
the claim in cash over 10 years (2010-2019) which will be non-
interest bearing and (ii) 66% in Samsun’s shares bearing no voting
rights, to be issued a er the court’s approval.
The ﬁrst non-interest cash payment of U.S.$593, being 10% of the
recoverableclaimasdescribedinsub-paragraph(i)abovewasreceivedon
30 December 2010 and was credited to other operating income in the
accompanying consolidated income statement for the year ended

are uncertain. Accordingly, the Company has not recognised future cash

In addition, in July 2010 Arkadia received 212,018 Samsun shares in

21. Financial Risk management objectives
and policies
TheCompany’sanditssubsidiaries’principalﬁnancialliabilities,other
than derivatives, are bank loans. The main purpose of these ﬁnancial
liabilities is to ﬁnance the operations of the Company and its
subsidiaries. The Company and its subsidiaries have various other
ﬁnancial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents, restricted
cash, trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from
theiroperations.TheCompanyalsoentersintoderivativetransactions,
primarily interest rate swaps, the purpose of which is to manage the
interest rate risk arising from the Company’s and its subsidiaries’
sources of ﬁnance.
The main risks arising from the Company’s and its subsidiaries’
ﬁnancial instruments are interest rate risk and credit risk.
Interest rate risk

TheCompany’spolicyistomanageitsinterestcostusingamixofﬁxed
andvariableratedebts.TheCompany’spolicyistokeepbetween40%
and 70% of its borrowings at ﬁxed rates of interest. To manage this,
the Company enters into interest rate swaps, in which the Company
agrees to exchange variable to ﬁxed interest rate. These swaps are
designated to hedge underlying debt obligations. At 31 December
2010, a er taking into account the eﬀect of interest rate swaps,
67.5% of the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ long-term borrowings
are at ﬁxed rate of interest (2009: 60%).
The table below demonstrates the sensitivity of the proﬁt or loss

the valuation of the interest rate swap), to a reasonably possible
change in interest rates (libor), with all other variables held constant:
Foreign currency risk
The majority of the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ transactions are
denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company has transactional currency
exposure in GBP currency. Such exposure arises from cash outﬂows
representing the payment of interim and annual dividends. The
Company mitigates its foreign exchange risk related to dividends by
converting the U.S. dollar amount in the respective amount of GBP at
thedateofdividendsdeclarationbytheBoardofDirectorsratherthan
the actual date of payment.
Furthermore, part of the operating expenses of the vessels and the
administrative costs are denominated in Euro currency. The vessel
owning companies and the management company mitigate their
exposuretoEurocurrencybyconvertingU.S.dollarsamountsintoEuro
within the year at rates that are deemed as reasonable, in order to

there is no signiﬁcant balance or transaction in foreign currency.

instruments exposed to insigniﬁcant risk of changes in market value,
being placed on interest-bearing deposit with maturities ﬁxed at no
more than 3 months.
The table below summarises the maturity proﬁle of the ﬁnancial
liabilities at 31 December 2010 and 2009, based on contractual
undiscounted payments (including interest to be paid, which is

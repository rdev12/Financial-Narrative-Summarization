Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015 “ The Board is looking forward to another successful 
chapter in the Group’s history and, in due course,  
to invite shareholders to invest in the next project.”
I am pleased to report our 13
th
 set of 
annual results since flotation in 2003.
Results for the Group
2015 has been a highly successful year for 
Melrose and represents another milestone 
in our proven “buy, improve, sell” strategy.  
In March, £200.4 million was returned  
to shareholders following the sale of  
Bridon in November 2014. In December, 
we completed the sale of the Elster 
business to Honeywell International Inc.  
for a cash consideration of £3.3 billion  
and, at the same time, divested the related  
and certain unrelated pension obligations. 
Further details on this transaction are  
set out in the Chief Executive’s review  
on the opposite page. 
The presentation of this year’s results  
has been dominated by the Elster disposal, 
which contributed over three quarters  
of the revenue of the Group in 2014 and,  
up to the date of disposal, had contributed 
£1,107 .4 million to revenue during 2015.
Melrose’s remaining business, Brush,  
has faced a challenging year. Revenue  
from continuing businesses for the year  
was £261.1 million (2014: £324.3 million) 
and headline operating profit (before 
exceptional costs, exceptional income  
and intangible asset amortisation) was 
£20.8 million (2014: £47.7 million).
Further details of these results are 
contained in the Finance Director’s review 
on pages 20 to 26.
As ever, I would like to thank all our 
employees for their efforts in helping to 
produce this outstanding performance.
Dividend 
Following the sale of Elster and the 
subsequent £2.4 billion capital return, 
shareholders have received £4.3 billion  
of payments over the lifetime of Melrose, 
comfortably exceeding the £2 billion  
that they have invested. These payments 
to shareholders have come largely from 
significant gains on selling companies,  
but also from a progressive annual  
dividend policy.
The Board recognises that the Group has 
a different shape, owning one business 
and carrying no debt, and that prior to any 
new acquisition it is appropriate to rebase 
the annual dividend per share to reflect  
the current size and shape of the Group.
The Board proposes to pay a final  
dividend of 2.6p per share (2014: 5.3p).  
This will be paid on 16 May 2016 to those 
shareholders on the register at 8 April 
2016, subject to approval at the Annual 
General Meeting (“AGM”) on 11 May 2016. 
Board matters
Succession planning is critical to 
maintaining the effectiveness and quality  
of the Melrose Board and it remains an 
area of focus for 2016. Perry Crosthwaite 
will be retiring from the Board at the 
conclusion of this year’s AGM. Perry  
has held a non-executive position on the 
Melrose Board since 2005 and his advice 
and extensive financial experience have 
been invaluable to Melrose; we wish him 
every success in the future. Perry will be 
replaced as senior non-executive Director 
by John Grant, who will also continue  
to hold the position of Chairman of the 
Audit Committee. A search is underway  
for a new non-executive Director and  
an appointment is expected to be made 
during the year. 
Strategy 
Since Melrose’s flotation in 2003 and  
the introduction of our “buy, improve, sell” 
strategy, we have seen many changes  
in economic and stock market conditions. 
Nevertheless, through all this, returns to 
shareholders have been extremely good. 
We continue to see businesses which  
are candidates for our management and 
investment methods and we are confident 
we will identify a suitable opportunity  
in due course. In the meantime, we will 
continue to focus on developing our 
existing business, Brush. 
Outlook 
The world economy remains uncertain. 
Across the manufacturing sector this 
uncertainty is leading to reduced business 
investment. Brush is not immune to these 
economic challenges. However, for the 
reasons set out in the Chief Executive’s 
review, we believe that Brush is well 
positioned to capitalise on new business 
opportunities and to benefit from any 
improvement in market conditions.
The search actively continues for 
businesses which meet our investment 
criteria. The Board is looking forward to 
another successful chapter in the Group’s 
history and, in due course, to invite 
shareholders to invest in the next project. 
Recent conditions in the global equity 
markets have only confirmed your Board’s 
view that 2016 could be an exciting year  
for Melrose and we are confident that  
a suitable acquisition will be identified, 
bringing with it another opportunity to 
create substantial value for shareholders.

Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015
Strategic Report “ Whilst it is anticipated that the end-market for Brush  
will remain challenging in 2016, we believe that  
focus on new product development and continued  
operational improvements will mean that Brush is  
well positioned in the marketplace to take advantage  
of new opportunities and any uplift in the market.”
Melrose continues its “buy, improve, 
sell” strategy of acquiring high-quality 
manufacturing businesses with the 
potential for significant development 
and improvement under Melrose 
management, undertaking operational  
improvements, realising the value in 
such businesses at the appropriate time 
and returning the value to shareholders.
Following Elster’s disposal, the Group  
now consists of Brush, the last remaining 
business from the FKI acquisition. The 
search for new businesses which meet 
Melrose’s investment criteria is a key 
objective in 2016, together with the continued 
improvement of its existing business.
Disposals during the year 
2015 marks yet another successful year  
for Melrose. Following an announcement  
in July 2015, Melrose completed the  
£3.3 billion disposal of the Elster business  
to Honeywell International Inc. in December. 
This represented a return of 2.3 times 
shareholders’ investment, which is a  
33% equity rate of return per annum  
in the three years since acquiring Elster  
for an enterprise value of £1.8 billion.
In addition, Honeywell International Inc. 
assumed Melrose’s FKI UK and McKechnie 
UK defined benefit pension plans, as well  
as the Elster-related pension obligations. 
These comprised the majority of the 
Group’s pension plans prior to the disposal.
Following the sale, and in accordance with 
our strategy, we announced our intention 
to return approximately £2.4 billion to 
shareholders in February 2016. Including 
this return and since being first listed  
on AIM in 2003, Melrose has returned 
approximately £4.3 billion in cash to 
shareholders. 
Brush
Brush Turbogenerators is the world’s 
largest independent manufacturer of 
electricity generating equipment for the 
power generation, industrial, Oil & Gas  
and offshore sectors. 
Despite a challenging year with difficult 
end-market conditions, actions taken in 2015 
are expected to result in a better performance 
in the medium-term. Investment also 
continues in product development, exploring 
new routes to market, with particular  
focus on Aftermarket, servicing and larger 
air-cooled generators. Driving efficiency  
and maintaining a firm control on costs  
will remain a focus for the future.
Action was instigated during the first half  
of 2015 to reduce the manufacturing  
cost base in line with the decline in sales. 
These actions were substantially concluded 
during the second half of the year.
During the course of the year, factory 
headcount was reduced by around 10% 
and opportunities were taken to improve 
capabilities across many areas of the 
business. During the second half of the  
year, attention was also given to reducing 
overheads, although there was no material 
financial impact in 2015. As a result of  
these actions, Brush finished the year as a 
stronger business and is better equipped to 
deal with the challenging market conditions.
The £30 million capital investment in a 
greenfield generator manufacturing plant 
near Shanghai, China, was completed 
during 2015, with operations commencing 
in March 2015. The new 14,400m
2
 
purpose-built facility will produce 2-pole 
variants of Brush’s 24 MVA to 150 MVA 
turbogenerators. Despite the Chinese 
Government’s commitment to switch  
from coal to gas-fired power generation, 
the move in favour of gas has been  
slower than anticipated. As a result, the 
development of this business is between  
18 months and two years behind  
original projections. 
The Aftermarket business also had a 
challenging first half of 2015, particularly  
in North America. It did, however, finish  
the year strongly. Significant investment 
has been made in increasing and improving  
the sales resource to underpin both the 
new-build and Aftermarket sales revenue. 
This is particularly important for Brush to aid 
development in new sectors of the market  
in a challenging environment. The investment 
in a rotor balance facility in Pittsburgh, US, 
nears completion and it is anticipated that 
the facility will be available for use in early 
2016. This will further enhance Brush’s North 
American Aftermarket business.
Switchgear revenue was lower this year 
than in 2014, mainly due to a greater 
proportion of large “direct current” projects, 
which are more susceptible to order 
placement delays than the standard 
Switchgear products.
The Transformer business had a much 
improved year, recovering from the 
previous Ofgem cycle and with sales 
finishing well ahead of 2014. Following its 
launch in 2015, the 132 kV range is gaining 
traction, with good potential for the future.
Outlook 
Whilst it is anticipated that the end-market  
for Brush will remain challenging in 2016, 
we believe that focus on new product 
development and continued operational 
improvements will mean that Brush is well 
positioned in the marketplace to take 
advantage of new opportunities and any 
uplift in the market.
As a result of current market conditions 
and more attractive valuations, your Board 
believes that there could be some exciting 
acquisition opportunities for Melrose in 
2016 and we are confident in our ability  
to find a deal that will create significant 
value for shareholders.

Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015 Market overview
This section details the market trends and external factors affecting the 
growth of Melrose and its existing business, Brush, and explores how both 
Melrose and Brush are responding to these trends and factors.
Melrose
Market environment 
for Melrose
Melrose invests in international 
manufacturing companies and  
is therefore directly and indirectly  
impacted by events occurring in the 
global economy.
The world economy remains very 
uncertain and generally there has been 
an increase in nervousness amongst 
most economic commentators, many  
of whom are concerned that growth  
will be harder to achieve over the near 
term. This caution applies to most  
major economies of the world.
Some major themes are driving  
these concerns, including the well-
documented events in the Oil & Gas 
sector, the slowing growth in China  
and the persisting recessions in Brazil 
and Russia. Other economic concerns 
exist and this uncertainty is leading  
to weaker business investment across  
the globe. Manufacturing companies  
are not immune to these concerns  
and some are more acutely affected  
than others, such as those closely 
aligned to the Oil & Gas sector. 
Business response
Given this background, Melrose is 
content to watch developments carefully 
and to wait for the right opportunity  
to arise to acquire a business. Melrose 
recognises that it may face strong 
competition from a range of market 
players for these businesses. 
The Board notes that, as the  
economic outlook appears more 
uncertain, valuations of businesses  
can decrease, potentially making 
acquisition opportunities more exciting. 
Given that the Group has recently 
reduced significantly in size, as a  
result of the successful sale of Elster  
and Return of Capital to shareholders,  
the uncertain world economic backdrop 
could be an opportunity for Melrose  
to find its next successful acquisition  
at an attractive price. Furthermore,  
the Board is confident that the  
necessary funding will be available  
to finance this.

Brush
Brush Turbogenerators is the 
world’s largest independent 
manufacturer of electricity 
generating equipment for the 
power generation, industrial, 
Oil & Gas and offshore 
sectors. 
Current market trends 
Slow growth in the global economy has 
impacted growth in power generation. 
Advances in technology are resulting  
in the development of larger, more 
efficient turbines, often in excess of  
sizes traditionally supplied by Brush. 
Exceptionally low Oil & Gas prices are 
having a negative impact on Oil & Gas 
investment projects, predominantly  
in the upstream sector of the industry,  
to which Brush has exposure through  
its end-users.
External factors
Some Brush businesses have strong UK 
revenue streams, principally Transformers, 
the customers of which are regulated  
by Ofgem, the UK Government regulator  
for gas and electricity markets. 
Brush has seen increased consolidation 
within its customer base, whereby current 
or potential customers have acquired 
generator manufacturing businesses. 
In China, the Government’s ‘Energy 
Development Strategy Action Plan’ 
underpins the move away from coal-fired 
energy generation in favour of a gas-fired 
alternative. This switch is anticipated to  
be reinforced in the Chinese Government’s 
13
th
 Five-Year Plan, which is expected to 
be finalised in March 2016. It is anticipated 
that this, together with lower gas prices 
globally, will assist in stimulating growth  
in gas-fired energy generation.
Business response
During a challenging year, operational 
improvements have continued to be 
made, with the expectation that Brush 
will be well placed to take advantage  
of new opportunities and any uplift in 
market conditions.
Prior to the completion of the factory in 
China, Brush supplied generators to its 
Chinese customers from its European 
factories. The newly-constructed  
Chinese plant will supply both local  
and international customers. The factory 
produced and successfully tested its  
first generator in November 2015, with 
expected delivery in the second quarter  
of 2016. 
Brush’s product development of larger, 
air-cooled generators is expected to 
position the business well in future years.

 Bru sh
Brush Turbogenerators 
(“Turbogenerators”) is the 
world’s largest independent 
manufacturer of electricity 
generating equipment for the 
power generation, industrial, 
Oil & Gas and offshore 
sectors. 
From its five plants in the UK, Czech 
Republic, Netherlands, US and China 
(which commenced operations in 2015), 
Brush designs, manufactures and services 
turbogenerators, principally in the 10 MVA 
to 300 MVA range, for both gas and  
steam turbine applications, and supplies  
a globally-diverse customer base. 
In addition, Brush designs and 
manufactures systems and power 
transformers under the brand name  
Brush Transformers (“Transformers”)  
and also produces a wide range of indoor 
and outdoor medium voltage AC/DC 
switchgear under the Hawker Siddeley 
Switchgear brand name (“Switchgear”). 
Finally, Brush’s subsidiary, Harrington 
Generators International, is a specialist 
UK-based small generator manufacturer 
supplying the construction, military, 
telecoms and rail sectors. 
2015 was a challenging year for  
Brush sales, particularly for new-build  
generators. An already soft market was 
made significantly worse by the dramatic 
fall in oil prices affecting the upstream  
Oil & Gas sector. In the first half of 2015, 
the aftermarket business (“Aftermarket”) 
was also not immune from these effects. 
However, ground was made up in 
Aftermarket during the second half,  
with revenue finishing moderately behind  
the previous year.

Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015
Strategic Report Action was instigated during the first half  
of 2015 to reduce the manufacturing cost 
base in line with the decline in sales. These 
actions were substantially concluded during 
the second half of the year. 
 
During the course of the year, factory 
headcount was reduced by around 10% 
and opportunities were taken to improve 
capabilities across many areas of the 
business. During the second half of the 
year, attention was also given to reducing 
overheads, although there was no material 
financial impact in 2015. As a result of  
these actions, Brush finished the year as  
a stronger business and is better equipped 
to deal with the challenging market 
conditions. 
Despite difficult trading conditions,  
Brush has still increased investment in 
product development across its business 
streams. Brush is well positioned for the 
medium-term and to exploit new routes  
to market, particularly those associated 
with Aftermarket.
The £30 million capital investment in a 
greenfield generator manufacturing plant 
near Shanghai, China, was completed 
during 2015, with operations commencing 
in March 2015. The new 14,400m
2
 
purpose-built facility will produce 2-pole 
variants of Brush’s 24 MVA to 150 MVA 
turbogenerators. 
Despite the Chinese Government’s 
commitment to switch from coal to 
gas-fired power generation, the move  
in favour of gas has been slower than 
anticipated. As a result, the development 
of this business is between 18 months  
and two years behind original projections. 
The Aftermarket business also had a 
challenging first half of 2015, particularly  
in North America. It did, however, finish  
the year strongly. Significant investment 
has been made in increasing and 
improving the sales resource to underpin 
both the new-build and Aftermarket sales 
revenue. This is particularly important for 
Brush to aid development in new sectors  
of the market in a challenging environment. 
The investment in a rotor balance facility  
in Pittsburgh, US, nears completion  
and it is anticipated that the facility will  
be available for use in early 2016. This will 
further enhance Brush’s North American 
Aftermarket business.
Switchgear revenue was lower this year 
than in 2014, mainly due to a greater 
proportion of large “direct current” 
projects, which are more susceptible to 
order placement delays than the standard 
Switchgear products.
The Transformer business had a much 
improved year, recovering from the previous 
Ofgem cycle and with sales finishing well 
ahead of 2014. Following its launch in 
2015, the 132 kV range is gaining traction, 
with good potential for the future.
Outlook 
The difficult end-market conditions 
experienced in 2015 are expected to 
continue in 2016. Notwithstanding this,  
the medium and long-term prospects  
for the power market and in particular  
the aeroderivative gas turbine sector, 
where Brush has a strong position, remain 
positive. Brush will continue to focus on 
further operational improvements and  
new product development to position  
the business for medium and long-term 
success.

Annual Report 2015 Transformers
The Transformers business  
had a much-improved year,  
with sales finishing well ahead  
of 2014.
Investments in research and 
development have led to the 
launch of 132 kV transformers, 
supporting the demand for 
large transformers from a range 
of industries, including energy 
and transport, whilst upgrades 
in manufacturing and testing 
facilities have led to reductions 
in lead times by up to a fifth.
Switchgear
Steps have been taken  
to realise cost reductions, 
complemented by strategic 
efforts to target processes. 
Aftermarket
Investments in a state-of-the-art 
balance pit at Brush’s Pittsburgh 
facility commenced in 2015, 
with completion expected  
in early 2016. The investment 
allows Brush to offer technology 
which can help to dramatically 
improve machine reliability, 
whilst also reducing repair 
times and complementing 
Brush’s current Aftermarket 
offerings. 
Generators
Resources have been applied 
to research and development, 
with a prototype 270 MW large 
air-cooled generator having 
been produced during the year.
The newly-built Chinese factory 
commenced operations in 
2015, with delivery of its first 
generator expected in 2016.
Furthermore, efforts have  
been spent in reconstructing 
the new-build sales force,  
with nine new sales managers 
and directors recruited from 
across the US, Europe and 
Asia. The new team has been 
in place since October 2015 
and consists of strong industry 
professionals, with established 
networks and a drive to 
succeed.
Investments have also been 
made in the development  
of a new robotic generator 
maintenance fleet, to deliver 
rapid and detailed internal 
inspections of generators 
without the time-consuming 
disassembly process 
previously required. Four of 
Brush’s maintenance teams  
are now equipped with the  
new technology, with further 
roll-outs planned for 2016.
In collaboration with 
established local maintenance 
providers, Brush has taken 
steps to open service locations 
in Oman and Singapore, to 
increase Aftermarket offerings  
in the Middle East and Asia.  
The first project for the 
Singapore workshop took 
place in autumn 2015, with 
operations expected to 
commence in Oman in 2016.

2012–2015
Prior to its sale in December 2015, Melrose 
continued to seek operational improvements  
in the Elster businesses.
Since acquiring Elster in 2012, 
Melrose reorganised the group 
into three separately-managed 
business units, Elster Gas, 
Elster Electricity and Elster 
Water, and invested heavily  
to improve each of them. 
Over the three years of 
ownership, Melrose achieved:
• an increase in headline

operating margins of nine 
percentage points, a 70% 
improvement;
• average headline

profit conversion to cash  
(pre capex) of 91%; and
• the acquisition of Eclipse,  
a manufacturer of gas 
combustion components  
and systems to complement 
Elster’s expertise in industrial 
gas combustion applications.
Operational highlights during 
the year prior to the disposal 
include a number of significant 
manufacturing footprint

Annual Report 2015 Disposal of Elster
In July 2015, Melrose announced the disposal  
of the Elster business, a world leader in 
measuring and improving the flow of natural 
gas, electricity and water, to Honeywell 
International Inc. for cash consideration  
of £3.3 billion. The shareholders of Melrose 
approved the disposal on 21 August 2015  
and, following receipt of necessary regulatory 
approvals, the sale was completed in 
December 2015.

As part of the terms of the

pension obligations remained 
with Elster and, in addition, 
Honeywell assumed the  
FKI UK and McKechnie UK 
defined benefit pension plans. 
In total, as at the date of the 
disposal, pension liabilities  
with a net accounting deficit  
of £112 million were transferred  
to Honeywell.
Following the sale and in 
accordance with the Melrose 
strategy, Melrose returned 
approximately £2.4 billion of the 
sale proceeds to shareholders, 
the equivalent of 240 pence  
per share. The sale and Return 
of Capital represents another 
successful investment period 
for Melrose.
“   The disposal of Elster 
represents an excellent 
outcome for Melrose 
shareholders and another 
milestone in our track record. 
Through investing heavily  
and improving operational 
performance we have 
created substantial value  
for shareholders, more than 
doubling their money in three 
years. I am pleased that we 
are able to deliver this return 
to shareholders earlier than 
we had originally anticipated 
and have every confidence 
that Elster will continue its 
success story under the 
ownership of Honeywell.”

the Board uses a number of financial and non-financial key performance 
indicators (“KPIs”). Details of a selection of the KPIs are shown below. 
KPIs include the results of continuing and discontinued businesses, including 
Elster, which was owned until 29 December 2015. Additional business level 
KPIs are also used, which are relevant to their particular circumstances.

to the exact nature of the business and its 
associated risks.
Strategic objective
The Company has an objective to stop all 
preventable accidents.

health and safety initiatives undertaken by 
Brush during 2015 can be found within the 
Corporate Social Responsibility report on  
pages 40 and 41.
Environment and energy usage
Method of calculation
Due to the decentralised nature of the  
Group and differing operations of businesses 
which the Company may acquire, there are  
no standardised environmental KPIs used 
throughout the Group. A range of environmental 
measures are utilised, including energy 
consumption, CO
2
 emissions, water 
consumption, water contamination, waste 
disposal, solid and liquid waste generation, 
recycling and volatile organic compound 
emissions. 
Strategic objective
Melrose fully understands the importance  
of the Group’s environmental responsibilities 
and is committed to ensuring that operations 
have the minimum possible adverse effect on  
the environment.

Other non-financial KPIs
Due to the diverse nature of the Group, each 
business acquired by the Group uses a range  
of its own specific non-financial KPIs, which  
are used to drive business performance and 
assist in managing risk. This helps to ensure 
that the KPIs used are relevant to each business 
and take into account specific operational  
and reporting requirements. Such KPIs cover 
operational, quality, commercial and human 
resource measures. Further information

Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015 The presentation of the results this year is 
impacted by the disposal of the Elster division. 
Elster contributed over three quarters of the 
revenue and headline operating profit of the 
Group in 2014, and, in accordance with IFRS 5, 
is shown as discontinued in these accounts.
Group trading results for the year
The revenue and headline operating profit in continuing operations 
consist only of the Brush business and Melrose central costs. 
However, in accordance with IFRS 5, the finance charges shown 
in continuing operations include the interest on the debt which 
was used to finance the Elster Group. 
As a consequence, below operating profit, the statutory results 
are not fully reflective of the underlying performance of the 
continuing Group and consequently on the face of the Income 
Statement the term headline has only been used where suitable. 
However exceptional charges within finance costs and tax are 
disclosed within the notes to the financial statements.
The term ‘headline’ describes operating profit calculated before 
exceptional items and intangible asset amortisation. 
For continuing operations, the split of revenue, headline operating 
profit and headline operating profit margin for 2015 and 2014  
was as follows:

The performance of Brush is discussed in detail in the Chief 
Executive’s review.
Central costs comprise £12.7 million (2014: £11.9 million) of 
Melrose corporate costs and a Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) 
accrual of £5.0 million (2014: £5.4 million). This LTIP accrual 
includes £4.0 million in respect of the Melrose share-based 
Incentive Plan (2014: £4.0 million) and a net charge of £1.0 million 
(2014: £1.4 million) for the cash-based Brush management 
incentive plan.
After exceptional costs, exceptional income and intangible  
asset amortisation, the continuing Group operating profit was 
£4.8 million (2014: £37.0 million) and the loss before tax was 
£30.7 million (2014: profit of £12.5 million).
Disposal of Elster
On 29 December 2015, Melrose completed the disposal of  
Elster to Honeywell International Inc. (“Honeywell”) for cash 
consideration of £3.3 billion, on a cash free and debt free basis.  
In addition to the Elster defined benefit pension plans, Honeywell 
assumed the Group’s FKI UK and McKechnie UK defined benefit 
pension plans which together had combined gross liabilities  
of £848.7 million and a net IAS 19 deficit of £111.9 million at  
the date of disposal. The profit on the disposal in the year was 
£1,256.3 million.
Elster contributed £1,107.4 million to revenue and achieved  
an operating profit after exceptional items and intangible asset 
amortisation of £229.4 million in 2015.
Elster was an extremely successful investment for Melrose.  
Since it was acquired in August 2012 the enterprise value 
increased from £1.8 billion to £3.3 billion, and the equity value 
increased by 2.3 times.
New Group holding company, returns of capital and  
number of shares
In line with the Group strategy, a large part of the proceeds 
of recent disposals have been returned to shareholders. 
On 16 March 2015, following the sale of Bridon, £200.4 million was 
returned to shareholders. This return was made via a redeemable 
share scheme alongside a 13 for 14 share consolidation which 
reduced the number of ordinary shares by 7%, from 1,071.8 million 
to 995.2 million.
Later in the year, to enable a significant amount of the Elster 
disposal proceeds to be returned to shareholders promptly and 
efficiently, a corporate reorganisation was performed whereby  
a new holding company was introduced to the Melrose Group.
Finance Director’s review
20
Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015
Strategic Report “  Elster was an extremely successful investment  
for Melrose. Since it was acquired in August 2012 
the enterprise value increased from £1.8 billion  
to £3.3 billion, and the equity value increased  
by 2.3 times.”
 Geoffrey Martin
 Group Finance Director
Shareholder approval for the introduction of the new holding 
company was received on 29 October 2015 followed by  
a scheme of arrangement being sanctioned by the High Court  
of England and Wales on 18 November 2015. The scheme of 
arrangement became effective on 19 November 2015 following 
which Melrose Industries PLC became the new holding company. 
A proportion of the merger reserve, created on inception of  
this new holding company, was capitalised on 26 January 2016  
to create B shares to assist the Group in returning £2,388 million 
(equivalent to 240 pence per ordinary share) to shareholders. 
Alongside this Return of Capital, a 7 for 48 share consolidation  
was performed which reduced the number of shares by 85%, 
from 995.2 million to 145.1 million. The diluted number of shares 
at this date was 165.8 million.
Following this latest Return of Capital, Melrose has returned 
approximately £4.3 billion in cash to shareholders and created  
net shareholder value of approximately £2.8 billion including 
shareholders’ existing investment in Melrose.
Finance costs and income
The continuing net finance costs in 2015 were £35.5 million 
(2014: £24.5 million). 
Included within this charge was £17 .8 million (2014: £18.5 million)  
of interest on external debt, overdrafts and cash balances.  
This included interest on the external debt used to finance the 
acquisition of Elster and an exceptional £0.7 million charge relating 
to the early close-out of interest rate swap arrangements following 
the repayment of all external debt facilities. 
In addition, a £15.9 million (2014: £4.0 million) charge relating to the 
amortisation of banking fees was incurred in 2015. This included  
an exceptional charge of £12.4 million relating to the acceleration of 
future year’s charges following the sale of Elster and the repayment 
of all external debt facilities on 29 December 2015. 
Also included in net finance costs is a net interest cost on  
net pension liabilities of £1.6 million (2014: £1.4 million) and  
a charge for the unwinding of discounts on long-term provisions  
of £0.2 million (2014: £0.6 million). 
Tax
The tax credit on continuing items for the year was £14.4 million 
(2014: a charge of £4.3 million).
The main reason for the tax credit arising on continuing items in 
the year was an exceptional tax credit of £14.5 million related to 
the recognition during the year of deferred tax assets on additional 
UK tax losses. As a result of the sale of Elster, future UK taxable 
profits of the Group are expected to arise in companies where 
losses are brought forward. In addition, a tax credit of £0.8 million 
on exceptional operating costs and a £2.1 million tax credit on 
intangible asset amortisation were incurred. 
The overall tax rate, after exceptional items, intangible asset 
amortisation and discontinued operations, was 18.7% (2014: 31.6%). 
This is lower than the weighted average statutory tax rate of  
31.5% (2014: 28.5%) primarily because of the additional deferred 
tax asset recognition.
The total gross tax losses within the continuing Group are  
shown below:

No significant taxes are expected to arise as a result of the  
Elster disposal.
Cash taxes of £2.8 million (2014: £3.4 million) were paid by 
continuing Group operations and £51.2 million (2014: £35.9 million) 
was paid by discontinued operations.
The deferred tax liability in respect of intangible assets of 
£13.7 million (2014: £259.8 million) is not expected to represent  
a future cash tax payment of the business and will unwind as the 
intangible assets are amortised.

Annual Report 2015 Exceptional operating costs and amortisation  
of intangible assets
During the year exceptional operating costs of £7.9 million 
(2014: £7.5 million) were incurred of which £5.9 million were in 
respect of a restructuring programme across the Brush business 
to align the cost base with the reduced revenue. A further 
£1.7 million related to the costs of the corporate reorganisation 
whereby a new holding company was introduced to the Group, 
along with costs incurred in returning capital to shareholders.  
The remaining charge of £0.3 million was in respect of acquisition 
and disposal-related activities. 
The charge for amortisation of intangible assets, in continuing 
operations, in the year was £8.1 million (2014: £8.6 million).
Earnings per share (“EPS”) 
In accordance with IAS 33, two sets of basic and diluted EPS 
numbers are disclosed on the face of the Income Statement,  
one for continuing operations and one that includes discontinued 
operations. The diluted EPS for continuing operations in the  
year was a loss of 1.6p (2014: gain of 0.7p), whereas including 
discontinued operations, and thereby including the performance 
and the profit on the disposal of Elster, was a gain of 137.1p 
(2014: 17.5p). These are calculated after exceptional costs, 
exceptional income and amortisation of intangible assets.
Given the significant change in the size of the Group post the sale 
of Elster and following the share consolidation in January 2016, 
the best measure of underlying performance is based on the 
following 2015 proforma: 
Proforma Income

This proforma Income Statement uses the continuing Group

Group is in a relatively small net cash position, and an estimated 
continuing Group tax rate of 30%. 
Cash generation and management
The Group moved from net debt to a cash position in the year, 
summarised as follows:
Movement in net (debt)/cash £m
Opening net debt (501.3)
Cash flow from trading (after all costs including tax) (14.6)
Net cash flow from disposals 3,262.5
Amount paid to shareholders  
(return of capital and dividends)
(281.0)
Foreign exchange and other non-cash movements (14.2)
Closing net cash 2,451.4
The net cash position of the Group at 31 December 2015 was 
prior to returning any Elster disposal proceeds to shareholders. 
The proforma cash position of the Group after this return, and 
following contributions paid early to the Brush UK Pension Plan  
of £8.8 million, would have been £54.1 million. This is considered 
to be a better reflection of the ongoing cash position of the 
continuing Group.

£1.9 billion of net assets during the year, repaid net debt and 
moved into a net cash position of £2.5 billion. The cash position 
has decreased by £2.4 billion following the Return of Capital in 
February 2016.
Goodwill, intangible assets and impairment review
The total value of goodwill as at 31 December 2015 was  
£198.1 million (31 December 2014: £1,516.7 million) and intangible 
assets was £73.7 million (31 December 2014: £859.8 million). 
These balances reduced significantly in the year following the 
disposal of Elster. 
The remaining goodwill and intangible assets relate to Brush  
and have been tested for impairment as at 31 December 2015. 
The Board is comfortable that no impairment is required.
Provisions
Total provisions as at 31 December 2015 were £30.0 million 
(31 December 2014: £172.8 million). The largest movement in the 
year was the transfer of £86.4 million of Elster-related provisions  
to liabilities held for sale at 30 June 2015. These provisions were 
subsequently disposed of on 29 December 2015. 
The following table details the movement in provisions in the year:

At 31 December 2015 30.0
The net charge to continuing headline operating profit in the 
period was £2.0 million which included the Brush LTIP charge 
along with normal net warranty expenses in the year. 
 
The charge to exceptional items of £5.9 million related to the 
restructuring programme performed across the Brush business.
 
Other movements on provisions in the year relate to the net effect 
of the unwinding of discounting on long-term provisions and the 
relevant foreign exchange impact.
Pensions
On 29 December 2015, Honeywell assumed all Elster-related 
pension plans, along with the FKI UK and the McKechnie UK 
Pension Plans. Taken together these pension plans had gross 
liabilities of £848.7 million, gross assets of £736.8 million and  
a net deficit of £111.9 million at the date of disposal and therefore 
represented 87% of the previous Melrose defined benefit  
pension deficit.
Two defined benefit pension plans remain in the Group, namely 
the Brush Group (2013) Pension Plan and the Brush Aftermarket 
North America, Inc. Group Pension Plan (formerly the FKI US 
Pension Plan). These plans are closed both to new members  
and current members’ future service.
The Brush Group (2013) Pension Plan had a net IAS 19 
accounting surplus as at 31 December 2015 of £1.4 million 
(31 December 2014: deficit of £28.4 million). This plan had assets 
of £197.1 million (31 December 2014: £197.4 million) and liabilities 
of £195.7 million at 31 December 2015 (31 December 2014: 
£225.8 million). The Brush Aftermarket North America, Inc.  
Group Pension Plan had a net IAS 19 accounting deficit as at 
31 December 2015 of £18.6 million (31 December 2014: £18.7 
million). This plan had assets of £146.4 million (31 December 2014: 
£176.5 million) and liabilities of £165.0 million at 31 December 
2015 (31 December 2014: £195.2 million). During the year lump 
sums were offered to all terminated vested participants with 
deferred benefits in the Brush US Pension Plan. Approximately 
40% of those offered accepted, resulting in a reduction in gross 
liabilities of £20.0 million, and a benefit of £2.2 million to the overall 
pension charge for the year, shown within central costs.

Annual Report 2015 The values of the two remaining plans were updated at

Inflation (RPI) 3.0 n/a 3.1 n/a
Based on the mortality assumptions used in the Brush UK plan,  
a male aged 65 in 2015 is expected to live for a further 21.4 years 
(31 December 2014: 21.6 years) whilst a woman aged 65 would 
live a further 23.6 years (31 December 2014: 23.8 years). 
For the Brush US plan, a male aged 65 in 2015 is expected to  
live for a further 20.3 years (31 December 2014: 21.1 years) whilst 
a woman aged 65 would live a further 22.3 years (31 December 
2014: 23.3 years). 
The average lifetime of a member in the Brush plans is expected 
to increase by 1.6 years (8%) for a male and 1.8 years (8%) for  
a female aged 65 in 2035.
It is noted that a 0.1 percentage point decrease in the discount 
rate would increase the pension liabilities of the Group by 
£5.1 million, or 1%, and a 0.1 percentage point increase to inflation 
would increase the liabilities by £3.0 million, or 1%. Furthermore, 
an increase by one year in the expected life of a 65-year-old 
member would increase the pension liabilities on these plans  
by £11.1 million, or 3%.
Following agreement with the Brush Group (2013) Pension Plan 
Trustees, the Group has contributed £8.8 million early to the 
Brush UK Plan in the year ending 31 December 2016 which  
has increased the surplus by this amount. Consequently, no 
contributions to the Plan are expected to be made in the year 
ending 31 December 2017. Annual contributions to the Brush  
US Plan are approximately £0.1 million per annum.
Risk management
The financial risks the Group faces have been considered and 
policies have been implemented to best deal with each risk.  
The most significant financial risks are considered to be liquidity 
risk, finance cost risk, exchange rate risk, contract and warranty 
risk and commodity cost risk. These are discussed in turn below.
Liquidity risk management
Following the receipt of the Elster disposal proceeds, the Group’s 
external financing facilities were repaid such that the Group had 
no external debt at 31 December 2015 and the net cash position 
of the Group was £2,451.4 million, compared to a net debt 
position of £501.3 million a year earlier. 
The Sterling multi-currency revolving credit facility was reduced to 
£200 million and remained undrawn at the year end. The Sterling 
term loan, along with the Euro and US Dollar-denominated 
revolving credit facilities were cancelled. 
The reduced banking facility continues to have two financial 
covenants, a net debt to headline EBITDA covenant (debt  
cover covenant) and an interest cover covenant, both of which  
are tested half yearly at June and December. The first of these 
covenants is set at a maximum 3.5x leverage for each of the 
half-yearly measurement dates for the remainder of the term.  
At 31 December 2015, the Group was in a net cash position  
and therefore the debt cover covenant test was not relevant.  
The interest cover covenant is set at 4.0x or higher throughout  
the life of the facility and was 15.3x at 31 December 2015, 
affording significant headroom.
In addition to the £200 million banking facility, there are a number 
of uncommitted overdraft, guarantee and borrowing facilities 
made available to the Group. These uncommitted facilities are 
lightly used.
The combination of having a positive cash position and the  
size of the reduced committed bank facility allows the Directors  
to conclude that the Group has sufficient access to liquidity for  
its current needs.
The Board considers carefully its counterparty risk with banks 
when deciding where to place the cash on deposit held within  
the Melrose Group. At 31 December 2015, £2,425 million  
of the Group’s cash balance was held in AAA-rated Sterling 
denominated money market funds and the balance of the  
cash was held with banks with strong credit ratings. 
Finance Director’s review continued
24
Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015
Strategic Report Finance cost risk management
The interest rates that the Group was exposed to during the  
year were variable and linked to interbank rates of interest plus  
a margin determined by reference to the Group’s debt cover  
ratio. Previously, when the Group had net debt, it was appropriate  
that financial instruments were entered into to protect against 
movement in interest rates. Now that the Group has net cash  
this protection is not necessary and the interest rate swaps were 
closed out prior to the year end. 
Exchange rate risk management
The Group trades in various countries around the world and  
is exposed to many different foreign currencies. The Group 
therefore carries an exchange rate risk that can be categorised  
into three types: transaction, translation and disposal-related  
risk, as described below. The Board policy is designed to protect 
against the majority of the cash risks but not the non-cash risks. 
The most common exchange rate risk is the transaction risk  
the Group takes when it invoices a sale in a different currency  
to the one in which its cost of sale is incurred. This is addressed 
by taking out forward cover against approximately 60% to 80%  
of the anticipated cash flows over the following 12 months,  
placed on a rolling quarterly basis and for 100% of each material 
contract. This does not eliminate the cash risk but does bring 
some certainty to it.

The translation rate risk, being the effect on the results in the year 
due to the translation movement of exchange rates from one year 
to the next, is shown below. The table illustrates the translation 
movement in revenue and headline operating profit if the 2014 
average exchange rates had been used to calculate the 2015 
results rather than the 2015 average exchange rates. 
The translation difference in 2015  £m
Revenue decrease 7.2
Headline operating profit decrease 1.7
For reference, in respect of the continuing Group, an indication  
of the short-term exchange rate risk, which shows both translation 
exchange risk and unhedged transaction exchange rate risk,  
is as follows:
Sensitivity of profit to translation and unhedged

For every 10 cent strengthening of the US Dollar  
against Sterling
0.6
For every 10 cent strengthening of the Euro  
against Sterling
0.1
For every 10 per cent strengthening of the Czech Koruna 
against Sterling
1.4
The long-term exchange rate risk, which ignores any hedging 
instruments, is as follows:
Sensitivity of profit to translation and full transaction  
exchange rate risk
Increase/
(decrease) in 
headline
operating profit
£m
For every 10 cent strengthening of the US Dollar  
against Sterling
2.7
For every 10 cent strengthening of the Euro  
against Sterling
(0.5)
For every 10 per cent strengthening of the Czech Koruna 
against Sterling
1.4
No specific exchange instruments are used to protect against  
the translation risk because it is a non-cash risk to the Group. 
However, when the Group has net debt, the hedge of having a 
multi-currency debt facility funding these foreign currency trading 
units protects against some of the balance sheet and banking 
covenant translation risk.
Strategic Report
25
Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015 Lastly, potentially the most significant exchange risk that the 
Group has arises when a business that is predominantly based  
in a foreign currency is sold. The proceeds for those businesses 
may be received in a foreign currency and therefore an exchange 
risk might arise if foreign currency proceeds are converted  
back to Sterling, for instance to pay a dividend to shareholders. 
Protection against this risk is considered on a case-by-case basis. 
Contract and warranty risk management
The financial risks connected with contracts and warranties, 
which include the consideration of warranty terms, duration  
and any other commercial or legal terms, are considered carefully 
by Melrose before being entered into.
Commodity cost risk management
As Melrose can own engineering businesses across various 
sectors the cumulative expenditure on commodities is important. 
The Group addresses the risk of base commodity costs 
increasing by, wherever possible, passing on the cost increases 
to customers or by having suitable purchase agreements with  
its suppliers which sometimes fix the price over some months  
into the future. These risks are minimised through sourcing 
policies (including the use of multiple sources, where possible) 
and procurement contracts where prices are agreed for up to  
one year to limit exposure to price volatility.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely  
to affect its future development, performance and position are  
set out in the Strategic Report section of the Annual Report.  
In addition, the consolidated financial statements, and in particular 
notes 19 and 24, include details of the Group’s borrowing facilities 
and hedging activities along with the processes for managing  
its exposures to credit risk, capital risk, liquidity risk, interest risk, 
foreign currency risk and commodity cost risk. 
The Group has adequate financial resources and has a consistent 
cash generation record, and, as a consequence, the Directors 
believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks 
successfully despite the current uncertain economic outlook.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue  
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, 
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.

Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015
Strategic Report In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Directors have assessed the prospects  
of the Company over a longer period than the 12 months required 
by the “Going Concern” provision.
A period of three years is believed to be appropriate for this 
assessment since this is consistent with the Group’s financing 
cycle, whereby on average the Group has refinanced debt in line 
with this timescale.
The Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will continue in operation and meet its liabilities, 
as they fall due, up to December 2018.
The Directors’ assessment has been made by reference to the 
Group’s financial position as at 31 December 2015, its prospects, 
the Group’s strategy, the Board’s risk appetite and the Group’s 
principal risks and their management, all of which are described  
in the Strategic Report.
The Directors’ assessment of the Group’s viability is supported  
by comprehensive and detailed analysis and modelling. The 
model underpinning this statement is stress-tested, proven and  
is frequently used by management when determining working 
capital requirements for transactions and corporate restructuring. 
The model includes three years of forecast data from the  
Group’s business assets and incorporates agreed sensitivities  
for economic risk, foreign exchange risk and liquidity risk
(1)
  
(each of which have been considered both individually and in 
combination by the Board), together with expected achievable 
mitigating actions, from the working capital model to create 
severe, but plausible, scenarios. 
In preparing this statement, the following qualifications and 
assumptions are made:
(i) the viability model is based on the Group as at the date
of this Annual Report with no consideration of any further
acquisitions or future disposals of continuing businesses.
We note future acquisitions would be based on the same
proven business model applied previously, with related
bank debt and equity raised to support the acquisition with
sufficient headroom to cover business risks; and
(ii) financing arrangements and bank covenant testing are in line
with the current facility which is committed for the period
under review.

mitigating actions being taken by management, please refer to the Risks and uncertainties

Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015 Risk management
The Board recognises that operating in a dynamic and rapidly evolving 
commercial environment requires a pragmatic, flexible and responsive  
risk management framework that changes with the business and provides 
management with a comprehensive view of the Group’s risk profile  
at any given time.
The Board’s risk management 
assessment undertaken in 2015 has 
resulted in a number of changes to our 
principal risks and uncertainties. These 
changes are detailed in the principal 
risks and uncertainties table on pages 
30 to 35.
Risk management strategy  
and framework 
The objectives of the Directors and senior 
management are to safeguard and increase 
the value of the business and assets of the 
Group. Achievement of these objectives 
requires the development of policies and 
appropriate internal control frameworks to 
ensure the Group’s resources are managed 
properly and any key risks are identified and 
mitigated, where possible.
The Board recognises that it is ultimately 
responsible for determining the nature  
and extent of the principal risks it is willing  
to take to achieve its strategic objectives.  
It also recognises the need to define a risk 
appetite for the Group, to maintain sound 
risk management and internal control 
systems and to monitor its risk exposures 
and mitigations to ensure that the nature 
and extent of risks taken by the Group are 
consistent and aligned with its strategic 
objectives.
The Board confirms that there is an 
ongoing process for identifying, evaluating 
and managing the principal risks faced  
by the Company and that these systems, 
which are subject to regular monitoring 
and review, have been in place for the  
year under review and up to the date of 
approval of the Annual Report and financial 
statements.
The Board further confirms that the 
systems, processes and controls in place 
accord with the guidance contained in the 
Financial Reporting Council’s “Guidance 
on Risk Management, Internal Control  
and Related Financial Business Reporting”.
The Audit Committee monitors the 
effectiveness of the risk management and 
internal control processes implemented 
across the Group, through regular updates 
and discussions with management and  
a review of the key findings presented  
by the external and internal auditors. The 
Board is responsible for considering the 
Audit Committee’s recommendations and 
ensuring implementation by management 
of those recommendations it deems 
appropriate for the business. A description 
of the Audit Committee’s activities during 
the year on risk management can be found 
on page 60. 
During 2015, in accordance with provision 
C.2.3 of the UK Corporate Governance
Code, the Board instructed the Audit
Committee to undertake a robust review
of the effectiveness of the Group’s risk
management and internal control systems,
covering all material controls including
financial, operational and compliance
controls. The Audit Committee reported
its findings to the Board. From this review
of the risk management and internal control
systems, the Board did not identify, nor
was it advised of, any failings or weakness
which it would determine to be significant.
The Board concluded that the Group’s risk
management and internal control systems
and processes were operating effectively
and therefore a confirmation in respect
of necessary actions to be undertaken
has not been considered appropriate.
The Group operates on a decentralised 
basis and the Board has established  
an organisational structure with clear 
reporting procedures, lines of responsibility 
and delegated authority, as depicted in the 
diagram on the following page. Consistent 
with this, the Group operates a top-down/
bottom-up approach to risk management, 
comprising Board and senior management 
oversight coupled with bottom-up risk 
management embedded in the day-to-day 
activities of its individual businesses. 
Risk appetite
The Board has undertaken a comprehensive 
exercise to consider its risk appetite across 
a number of key business risk areas. The 
results of this review indicate the relative 
appetite of the Board across the risk factors 
at a specific point in time. Any material 
changes in risk factors will impact the 
Board’s assessment of its risk appetite. 
The Board has a higher risk appetite 
towards its strategic and operational risks 
and a balanced appetite towards macro-
economic and political risk. The Board 
seeks to minimise all health and safety 
risks and has a low risk appetite in relation 
to legal, compliance and regulatory  
risk. Similarly, a conservative appetite  
is indicated by the Board with respect  
to pension and finance-related risks. 
The results of the risk appetite review  
will support the Board’s decision making 
processes during 2016. It is the intention  
to undertake a review of the Board’s risk 
appetite at least annually.
2015 risk management actions 
In 2014, the Board initiated a root and 
branch audit and review of the risk 
management framework and the underlying 
processes in operation in every business 
across the Melrose Group. The results  
of this review were presented to the Board 
and an action plan setting out key risk 
management priorities was agreed. 
During 2015, the Board, supported by  
the Company Secretary and BDO LLP, 
delivered on these priorities and an 
enhanced risk management framework 
was implemented across the Group. 
Specific actions undertaken during the 
year include:
• reviewing and reaffirming the Board’s
risk appetite;
• updating and relaunching the Melrose
Risk Management Strategy;
• developing and implementing an
enhanced risk management governance
framework across the Group. This
framework defines the Melrose
principles for risk management and
sets the standards for the identification,
evaluation, prioritisation, recording,
review and reporting of risks and their
management or mitigation throughout
the organisation;
28
Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015
Strategic Report • cascading throughout the Group a new 
risk register template and a risk profile 
mapping application. These provide the 
Board with greater levels of detail and 
visibility on the risk management systems 
and processes in place, and illustrate 
each principal risk facing the Group from 
both a gross risk (pre-mitigation) and net 
risk (post–mitigation) position. The risk 
mapping application provides Directors 
with a clear risk profile for the Group  
and enables the Board to determine the 
degree to which this profile is aligned  
with its risk appetite;
•  rolling out a Group-wide education and 
training programme focused on instilling 
and embedding a culture of effective risk 
management;
•  providing a series of risk management 
workshops, attended by risk champions 
from each business unit, which provide  
a forum for sharing, learning and refining 
risk tools and processes; and
•  reviewing and improving the Group’s 
processes around the assessment of 
principal risks and the monitoring and 
reporting of the Group’s risk management 
performance. 
Assessment of principal risks
During the year the Board undertook  
a robust, in-depth and comprehensive 
assessment of the principal risks facing  
the Group and specifically those that  
might threaten the delivery of its strategic 
business model, its future performance,

Sound progress has been made during 
2015 in respect of the Group’s risk 
management processes. However, the 
Board recognises that Melrose cannot  
be complacent. In 2016, management  
will continue to focus on refining the  
risk management framework and on 
embedding a culture of effective risk 
management across the Group to ensure 
that risks and opportunities are identified 
and managed to ensure the delivery of 
long-term value creation. Further resources 
will also be devoted to strengthening the 
mechanisms for providing independent 
assurance on the effectiveness of the 
Group’s risk management governance, 
processes and controls.

Acquisition of new businesses 
and improvement strategies
The success of the Group’s acquisition strategy depends on identifying available and suitable targets,  
obtaining any consents or authorisations required to carry out an acquisition and procuring the necessary 
financing, be this from equity, debt or a combination of the two. In making acquisitions, there is a risk of 
unforeseen liabilities being later discovered which were not uncovered or known at the time of the due diligence 
process. Further, as per the Group’s strategy to buy and improve good but under-performing manufacturing 
businesses, once an acquisition is completed, there are risks that the Group will not succeed in driving strategic 
operational improvements to achieve the expected post-acquisition trading results or value which were originally 
anticipated, that the acquired products and technologies may not be successful or that the business may  
require significantly greater resources and investment than anticipated. If anticipated benefits are not realised  
or trading by acquired businesses falls below expectations, it may be necessary to impair the carrying value  
of these assets. The Group’s return on shareholder investment may fall if acquisition hurdle rates are not met. 
The Group’s financial performance may suffer from goodwill or other acquisition-related impairment charges,  
or from the identification of additional liabilities not known at the time of the acquisition.
• Structured and focused due diligence undertaken.
• Focus on acquisition targets that have strong headline
fundamentals, high-quality products, leading market
share but which are underperforming their potential
and ability to generate sustainable cash flows and
profit growth.
• Hands-on role taken by Directors and other senior
employees of the Group.
• Development of strategic plans, restructuring
opportunities, capital expenditure and working capital
management.

Timing of disposals In line with our strategy and depending where the Group is within the “buy, improve, sell” cycle, the expected 
timing of any disposal of businesses is considered as a principal risk which could have a material impact on  
the Group strategy. Further, due to the Group’s global operations, there may be a significant impact on timing  
of disposal due to political and macroeconomic factors. Depending on the timings of disposals and nature  
of businesses’ operations there may be long-term liabilities which could be retained by the Group following  
a disposal. Insufficient allowance for such retained liabilities may affect the Group’s financial position.

a disposal to realise maximum value for shareholders.

Operational risk
Economic and political The Group operates, through manufacturing and/or sales facilities, in numerous countries and is affected by 
global economic conditions. Businesses are also affected by government spending priorities and the willingness 
of governments to commit substantial resources. Current global economic and financial market conditions, 
including any fluctuation in commodity prices (in particular, the prices of oil and gas), the potential for a significant 
and prolonged global recession and any uncertainty in the political environment may materially and adversely 
affect the Group’s operational performance, financial condition and could have significant impact on timing  
of acquisitions and disposals. 
A recession may also materially affect customers, suppliers and other parties with which the Group does 
business. Adverse economic and financial market conditions may cause customers to terminate existing orders, 
to reduce their purchases from the Group, or to be unable to meet their obligations to pay outstanding debts  
to the Group. These market conditions may also cause our suppliers to be unable to meet their commitments  
to the Group or to change the credit terms they extend to the Group’s businesses.
• Regular monitoring of order books and other leading 
indicators, to ensure the Group and each of its 
businesses can respond quickly to any adverse trading 
conditions. This includes the identification of cost 
reduction and efficiency measures.
• Finance for acquisitions is readily available to the  
Group from banking syndicates. This has proven to be 
available to the Group even during periods of economic 
downturn, for example during the global financial crisis  
in 2008.
Executive

The fall in oil prices has resulted in a 
challenging year for Brush sales, with 
difficult end-market conditions expected  
to continue in 2016. However, the  
Board notes that economic uncertainty, 
lower levels of investment and a downturn 
in corporate earnings can depress 
business valuations and this may increase 
the number of potential acquisition 
opportunities for Melrose.

Loss of key management The success of the Group is built upon strong management teams. As a result, the loss of key personnel  
could have a significant impact on performance, at least for a time. The loss of key personnel or the failure  
to plan adequately for succession or develop new talent may impact the reputation of the Group or lead  
to a disruption in the leadership of the business. Competition for personnel is intense and the Group may not  
be successful in attracting or retaining qualified personnel, particularly engineering professionals. The loss of  
key employees, the Group’s inability to attract new and adequately-trained employees or a delay in hiring key 
personnel could seriously harm the Group’s business. Over time, the Group’s competitive advantage is defined 
by the quality of its people; should the Group fail to attract, develop and retain key talent, the competitive 
advantage will erode, leading to weaker growth potential or returns.
• Succession planning within the Group and its businesses 
is coordinated via the Nomination Committee in 
conjunction with the Board and includes all Directors  
and senior employees. 
• The Company recognises that, as with most 
businesses, particularly those operating within  
a technical field, it is dependent on Directors and 
employees with particular managerial, engineering  
or technical skills. Appropriate remuneration packages 
and long-term incentive arrangements are offered  
in an effort to attract and retain such individuals.

Compliance and ethical risk
Legal, regulatory  
and environmental
There is a risk that the Group may not always be in complete compliance with laws, regulations or permits,  
for example concerning environmental requirements. The Group could be held responsible for liabilities and 
consequences arising from past or future environmental damage, including potentially significant remedial  
costs. There can also be no assurance that any provisions for expected environmental liabilities and remediation 
costs will adequately cover these liabilities or costs.
The Group operates in highly-regulated sectors. In addition, new legislation, regulations or certification 
requirements may require additional expense, restrict commercial flexibility and business strategies or introduce 
additional liabilities for the Group or Directors. For example, the Group’s operations are subject to anti-bribery 
and anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, competition, anti-trust and trade compliance laws and regulations. 
Failure to comply with certain regulations may result in significant financial penalties, debarment from 
government contracts and/or reputational damage and impact our business strategy.
• Regular monitoring of legal and regulatory matters  
at both a Group and business level. Consultation with 
external advisers where necessary.
• A robust control framework is in place underpinned by 
comprehensive corporate governance and compliance 
procedures at both a Group and business level.
• Due diligence processes during the acquisition stage 
seek to identify legal, regulatory and environmental risks. 
At the business level, controls are in place to prevent 
such risks from crystallising. 
• Any environmental risks that crystallise are subject  
to mitigation by specialist consultants engaged for  
this purpose. External consultants assist the Group  
in complying with new and emerging environmental 
regulations.
• Insurance cover mitigates certain levels of risk.

Information security and cyber threats are currently a priority across all industries and remain

Like many businesses, Melrose recognises that the Group may have a potential exposure  
in this area.
• Management is working with information security 
consultants to better understand the extent to which the 
Group is exposed to cyber security risk and to ensure 
appropriate mitigations are in place.
• Management has developed an information security 
strategy to mitigate the Group’s exposure to cyber risk. 
This strategy, which follows the UK Government’s 
recommended steps to cyber security, covers the 
following security areas:
 – network security;
 – malware protection;
 – active monitoring of information systems  
and networks;
 – user education and awareness;

Financial risk
Foreign exchange Due to the global nature of operations and volatility in the foreign exchange market, exchange rate fluctuations 
have and could continue to have a material impact on the reported results of the Group.
The Group is exposed to three types of currency risk: transaction risk, translation risk and risk that when a 
business that is predominantly based in a foreign currency is sold, it is sold in that foreign currency. The Group’s 
reported results will fluctuate as average exchange rates change. The Group’s reported net assets will fluctuate 
as the year-end exchange rate changes.
• The Group policy is to protect against the majority of 
foreign exchange risk which affects cash, by hedging 
such risks with financial instruments.
• Protection against specific transaction risks is taken  
by the Board on a case-by-case basis.

Consideration for the Elster disposal was 
provided in Sterling. For repayments of the 
Group’s Euro and US Dollar denominated 
facilities, which were predominantly used 
to finance Elster operations, exchange  
rate risk was mitigated by entering into  
a contingent foreign exchange trade upon 
the signing of the disposal agreement, 
which matured only upon completion.

Pensions Any shortfall in the Group’s pension schemes may require additional funding. Following the disposal of the  
Elster business, through which the Group also disposed of the FKI UK and McKechnie UK defined benefit 
pension plans, the Group has retained the Brush UK and US plans. As at 31 December 2015, these Brush  
plans had a net liability of £17 .2 million on an accounting basis. Changes in discount rates, inflation, asset  
values or mortality assumptions could lead to a materially-higher deficit. For example, the cost of a buyout  
on a discontinued basis uses more conservative assumptions and is likely to be significantly higher than the 
accounting deficit. Alternatively, if the plans are managed on an ongoing basis, there is a risk that the plans’ 
assets, such as investments in equity and debt securities, will not be sufficient to cover the value of the 
retirement benefits to be provided under the plans. The implications of a higher pension deficit include a direct 
impact on valuation, credit rating and potential additional funding requirements at subsequent triennial reviews. 
In the event of a major disposal that generates significant cash proceeds which are returned to the shareholders, 
the Group may be required to make additional cash payments to the plans or provide additional security.
• The Group’s key funded pension plans are now closed 
to new entrants and future service accrual. Long-term 
funding arrangements are agreed with the plans and 
reviewed following completion of actuarial valuations. 
• Active management of pension plan assets.

deficit of £112 million and gross liabilities  
of £849 million.

Liquidity The Group had no external debt as at 31 December 2015. 
The ability to raise debt or to refinance existing borrowings in the bank or capital markets is dependent on 
market conditions and the proper functioning of financial markets. Furthermore, in line with the Group’s strategy, 
investment is made in the businesses (capital expenditure in excess of depreciation) and there is a requirement 
to assess liquidity and headroom when new businesses are acquired. In addition, the Group may be unable to 
refinance its debt when it falls due.
• Ensure the Company has adequate resources to meet 
its liabilities by reviewing its quarterly forecasts, ensuring 
there is sufficient headroom within committed bank 
facilities to cope with market volatility.

Consideration for the Elster disposal was 
provided in Sterling. For repayments of the 
Group’s Euro and US Dollar denominated 
facilities, which were predominantly used 
to finance Elster operations, exchange  
rate risk was mitigated by entering into  
a contingent foreign exchange trade upon 
the signing of the disposal agreement, 
which matured only upon completion.
Potential acquisition targets are analysed

Pensions Any shortfall in the Group’s pension schemes may require additional funding. Following the disposal of the  
Elster business, through which the Group also disposed of the FKI UK and McKechnie UK defined benefit 
pension plans, the Group has retained the Brush UK and US plans. As at 31 December 2015, these Brush  
plans had a net liability of £17 .2 million on an accounting basis. Changes in discount rates, inflation, asset  
values or mortality assumptions could lead to a materially-higher deficit. For example, the cost of a buyout  
on a discontinued basis uses more conservative assumptions and is likely to be significantly higher than the 
accounting deficit. Alternatively, if the plans are managed on an ongoing basis, there is a risk that the plans’ 
assets, such as investments in equity and debt securities, will not be sufficient to cover the value of the 
retirement benefits to be provided under the plans. The implications of a higher pension deficit include a direct 
impact on valuation, credit rating and potential additional funding requirements at subsequent triennial reviews. 
In the event of a major disposal that generates significant cash proceeds which are returned to the shareholders, 
the Group may be required to make additional cash payments to the plans or provide additional security.
• The Group’s key funded pension plans are now closed 
to new entrants and future service accrual. Long-term 
funding arrangements are agreed with the plans and 
reviewed following completion of actuarial valuations.

As part of the Elster disposal, Melrose 
divested its responsibility for the FKI UK 
and McKechnie UK defined benefit 
pension plans, as well as all Elster-related 
pension obligations. As at the date of

deficit of £112 million and gross liabilities  
of £849 million.

Liquidity The Group had no external debt as at 31 December 2015. 
The ability to raise debt or to refinance existing borrowings in the bank or capital markets is dependent on 
market conditions and the proper functioning of financial markets. Furthermore, in line with the Group’s strategy, 
investment is made in the businesses (capital expenditure in excess of depreciation) and there is a requirement 
to assess liquidity and headroom when new businesses are acquired. In addition, the Group may be unable to 
refinance its debt when it falls due.
• Ensure the Company has adequate resources to meet 
its liabilities by reviewing its quarterly forecasts, ensuring 
there is sufficient headroom within committed bank 
facilities to cope with market volatility.

multi-currency revolving credit facility, 
maturing in July 2019. Should circumstances 
change and, in line with the Group’s  
strategy, the Group requires access to

Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015 Whilst Melrose supports and monitors the corporate social 
responsibility policies, practices and initiatives across its 
businesses, the Group operates on a decentralised basis. 
Consequently, responsibility for the adoption of policies, 
practices and initiatives sits at a local business unit level. 
This ensures that rigorous and targeted policies and  
procedures are implemented that meet local regulatory 
requirements and guidance, whilst also taking into account 
the size and nature of the businesses.
Following the divestment of Elster on 29 December 2015, the Melrose 
Group consists of Brush and, consequently, the information set out in 
this Corporate Social Responsibility Report focuses on the initiatives  
taken by that business during 2015. However, Melrose will implement  
the policies, practices and initiatives set out in this report within  
any new business it acquires, where appropriate.

Strategic Report “ The Group recognises its responsibilities 
for the fair treatment of all its current  
and potential employees.”
1. Employment policies
The Group recognises its responsibilities 
for the fair treatment of all its current 
and potential employees, in accordance 
with legislation applicable to the 
territories within which it operates, 
together with relevant guidance on  
good practice where appropriate. 
As part of the Group’s decentralised 
approach, each of Melrose’s businesses  
is responsible for setting and measuring  
its own employment and employee- 
related KPIs and, as such, these can  
vary throughout the Group. However,  
such measurements will generally include 
absenteeism, punctuality, headcount and 
employee relations issues. Any concerns 
or adverse trends are responded to in  
a timely manner. 
Equal opportunities for appropriate 
training, career development and 
promotion are available to all employees 
within the Group regardless of any 
disability, gender, religion, race,  
nationality, sexual orientation or age. 
Applications for employment by  
disabled persons are always fully and  
fairly considered by the Group and are 
considered on merit, with regard only  
to the job-specific requirements and the 
relevant applicant’s aptitude and ability  
to carry out the role. Where reasonable  
to do so, arrangements will be made to 
enable disabled persons to carry out  
a specific role. 
Furthermore, as a Group-wide policy  
and so far as particular disabilities permit, 
Melrose and each of its businesses will, 
where practicable, make every effort  
to provide continued employment in the 
same role for employees who are disabled 
during their period of employment or, 
where necessary, provide such employees 
with a suitable alternative role, together 
with appropriate training.
It is the Group’s policy that in recruitment, 
training, career development and 
promotion, the treatment of disabled 
persons should, as far as possible, be 
identical to that of other employees. 
Melrose is proud to be a member of the 
Business Disability Forum, a not-for-profit 
member organisation that works with  
the business community to understand  
the changes required in the workplace  
in order that disabled persons are  
treated fairly, so that they can contribute  
to business success, to society and to 
economic growth.

Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015 3. Employee initiatives 
During 2015, Brush implemented a 
range of employee-related initiatives. 
Some of these are listed below: 
• Brush US initiated a Tuition 
Reimbursement Program to all full-time 
employees. The Group believes that  
by supporting its employees in self-
development and educational efforts, 
through partial reimbursements for 
expenses associated with continuing 
education courses through accredited 
institutions of learning or certificated 
programmes, it will help to secure 
increased responsibility and growth  
within an individual’s professional career, 
as well as enhancing the business’s  
ability to meet customer needs. An 
employee is eligible for participation  
in this programme providing they have 
completed at least six full-time months  
of employment and the courses are  
job and/or industry-related.
• Brush US also introduced inter-
departmental training throughout  
the business. Among other things,  
the training covers: operations, human 
resources, project management and 
health and safety. Through this training, 
employees have the opportunity to 
increase their knowledge of the whole  
of the business, which assists with 
inter-departmental communication.  
It also affords employees the opportunity 
to apply for vacancies within other 
departments or divisions.
2. Employee involvement, 
consultation and development
The Group places great importance  
on good labour relations, employee 
engagement and employee 
development. The responsibility for  
the implementation and management  
of employment practices rests with 
local management, in a manner 
appropriate to each business.
A culture of clear communication and 
employee consultation and engagement  
is inherent across the Group. Employee 
briefing sessions with employee 
representatives are held on a regular basis 
to communicate strategy, key changes, 
financial results, achievements and other 
important issues to employees, and to 
receive feedback from them on these 
issues. Regular appraisals, employee 
surveys, notice boards, team meetings, 
suggestion boxes and newsletters are  
also used to communicate and engage 
with employees, and to solicit their 
feedback on issues of concern to them.
Extensive training is available to all staff 
and is actively encouraged to ensure that  
a high standard of skill is maintained across 
the Group. Inter-departmental training 
programmes are also put in place across 
the Group to ensure that skills are shared 
between operations. The importance of 
training extends beyond on-the-job training 
and also focuses on enhancing personal 
development. In addition, apprenticeship 
programmes help to assist with training  
a new generation of employees and  
to ensure knowledge is retained within  
the businesses. Employees across the 
Group are encouraged to think innovatively  
and to have regard for both financial and 
economic factors affecting the Group.
The Group regards employee training  
and advancement as an essential element 
of industrial relations.
“ The Group places great importance  
on good labour relations, employee 
engagement and employee 
development.”

Strategic Report Brush employees’  
charitable achievements
• Brush UK has continued to invest  
in its apprentice programme, with 41 
apprentices taken on during 2015. The 
business has concentrated on enhancing 
the development of its apprentices by 
working in partnership with the Prince’s 
Trust. The apprentices were asked to 
raise funds for the Prince’s Trust through 
a project management orientated initiative 
which resulted in them raising around 
£2,000. This initiative assisted with their 
personal development and leadership 
skills as well as raising the profile of Brush 
and the Prince’s Trust.
• Following the launch in 2014 of the  
Brush Leadership and Development 
Programme, accredited to the Institute of 
Leadership & Management (ILM), Brush 
UK decided to build on this success by 
running the programme again in 2015. 
The programme was delivered across  
the business and included qualifications 
such as: Level 2 Certificate in Leadership 
and Team Skills, Level 3 Certificate in 
Leadership and Management and the 
Level 4 Diploma in Leadership and 
Management. 
• During 2015, Brush UK continued to  
raise the profile of its graduate scheme  
by reviewing and refining its existing 
programme and attending an increased 
number of graduate fairs.
• Brush takes the health and well-being  
of its employees very seriously and  
has continued to develop and enhance  
its Occupational Health Service,  
which is available to employees five  
days a week. The service can make 
referrals to doctors, physiotherapists  
or counselling services, as required, 
ensuring that the business supports  
its employees throughout any periods  
of absence or illness. Health promotion  
is a key feature of the service, which  
is continually developing through 
awareness campaigns and has had a 
positive impact on both the employees 
and the business as a whole. 
Mud run for Cancer Research
Supporting victims of cancer, Alison Barker, from  
Brush’s Harrington Generators International, took part  
in the Race for Life Pretty Muddy run, a 5km mud-filled 
obstacle course. With the support and encouragement 
of colleagues, friends and family, Alison successfully 
completed the course and raised over £600 for  
Cancer Research.
Wolf Run
A team of colleagues from across Turbogenerators, 
Transformers and Switchgear recently took part in  
the Wolf Run, a 10km off-road challenge which involves 
running, climbing, jumping, crawling and swimming 
through the obstacles on the course. The team raised 
£1,650 for the MS Society, a charity dedicated to helping 
people who suffer from multiple sclerosis.
“ There was a real sense of 
achievement completing the  
race as a team. I’m so grateful  
to the rest of the runners for  
taking part and to everyone  
who supported and  
sponsored us.”

There were no issues or concerns 
identified by the Board during 2015.  
While no corrective measures were 
deemed necessary, the Board continues 
to encourage management to remain 
vigilant where employee and third-party 
safety is concerned. 
For more information on Brush’s health 
and safety KPIs, see the key performance 
indicators section on page 19 of the 
Strategic Report.
Brush’s manufacturing locations in  
both the UK and the Czech Republic  
hold ISO 18001 certification, the 
internationally-recognised assessment 
standard for occupational health and 
safety management systems, with the 
Netherlands plant hoping to achieve 
certification in 2016. Divisional managers 
within Brush are responsible for ensuring 
that health and safety remains a key focus 
and that active procedures and monitoring 
systems are in place. Detailed health and 
safety plans are set by Brush management 
each year to determine annual targets  
and improvement initiatives. Since 
commencement of operations in March 
2015, Brush’s factory in China has 
operated with zero lost time incidents.
4. Gender diversity
The charts below show the total number 
of males and females working within  
the Group as at 31 December 2015.
The Board continues to pursue diversity, 
including gender diversity, throughout  
the Group. However, given the Group’s 
strategic business model and the frequent 
turnover of businesses, the Group does 
not think that setting and committing  
to specific diversity targets in relation  
to the composition of the Board, senior 
management and the workforce in the 
Group’s businesses is correct for Melrose. 
The utmost priority, across the Group, is to 
ensure both Melrose and its businesses 
employ the best person for each role.
(1) Defined as senior head office employees of Melrose, located in the London, Birmingham and Atlanta offices.
5. Health and safety
The Board is committed to minimising 
the health and safety risks that each 
Group employee is exposed to by 
promoting the effective use and 
management of business-specific 
policies and procedures.
The Group has a policy to ensure that the 
Directors are made aware of any serious 
health and safety incidents, wherever they 
occur in the world, without delay, to ensure 
that suitable investigations and corrective 
action can be organised. Current events 
and issues relating to health and safety 
matters are also discussed within the 
Group at quarterly Board meetings of  
the Company.
Brush is responsible for setting its  
own detailed arrangements concerning 
health and safety policies and procedures, 
in accordance with local health and  
safety legislation. As a general rule, Brush 
strives to achieve best practice in terms  
of what is suitable and practical for the  
size and nature of its operations. Defined 
and business-specific health and safety 
key performance indicators are also used. 
Reports detailing Brush’s performance  
in relation to three health and safety KPIs 
(major accident frequency rate, accident 
frequency rate and accident severity rate) 
are presented to the Melrose Board and 
reviewed at each quarterly Board meeting.

Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015
Strategic Report Following these initiatives, among others, 
Brush has recognised the following 
benefits: 
• a 40% reduction in accident frequency 
rate (based upon the number of all  
lost time accidents per 200,000 hours 
worked) compared to 2014, with the 
accident severity rate (based on the 
average number of days employees have 
taken off work following work-related 
accidents) also being reduced by 40% 
over the year;
• a workforce engaged in matters relating 
to health and safety; 
• a clear demonstration of the Brush 
management’s intentions to continually 
improve the standard of health and safety 
within the business; and 
• a recognition that a strong health and 
safety culture can have a positive impact 
on the growth and brand value of the 
business. 
Brush also has health and safety 
committees, which meet on a regular  
basis and are made up of representatives 
from both management and shop floor 
level personnel. Each of the committees 
has wide-ranging responsibilities which 
vary between operations and include  
the review of reported incidents and  
the monitoring of incident trends. These 
committees are also responsible for 
ensuring that corrective measures are 
implemented when accidents occur and 
that all incidents, whether or not they are 
deemed reportable under local legislation, 
are given due attention. 
One of the key responsibilities for these 
committees is to carry out regular tours  
of the premises in which they operate,  
in order to ensure compliance with local 
policies and procedures. These tours  
also identify potential hazards, for which 
counter-measures can be identified to 
prevent accidents from happening. Each 
committee recommendation is followed  
up at the next divisional board meeting  
to ensure that issues are resolved. 
Additionally, operations are audited by  
the committees at least annually and 
reports of performance and recommended 
improvements are prepared and circulated 
to the divisional senior management 
teams. Divisional managers are provided 
with detailed health and safety reports  
on a frequent basis to ensure that such 
matters are given high visibility and that 
improvements are authorised and 
implemented quickly.
6. Health and safety initiatives 
During 2015, Brush implemented a 
range of health and safety initiatives, 
some of which are listed below: 
• During 2015, the behavioural safety 
programme implemented by Brush UK  
in 2014 continued to improve the already 
strong health and safety culture within  
the business. The programme focuses on 
developing a proactive approach among 
Brush employees so that they increase 
their responsibility and accountability  
for their own, and their working group’s, 
actions while ensuring they intervene at 
the earliest opportunity to stop hazardous 
acts or correct any unsafe condition. 
• During 2015, Brush’s operations in  
the Czech Republic focused its health 
and safety efforts on working at heights.  
It installed a fall protection system onto 
crane runways and thereby significantly 
decreased the dangers associated  
with falls during regular maintenance 
activities. In total, Brush’s operations in 
the Czech Republic implemented more 
than 100 health and safety improvements 
during the year.
“ The Board is committed to minimising the  
health and safety risks that each Group employee  
is exposed to by promoting the effective use  
and management of business-specific policies  
and procedures.”
Strategic Report

Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015 The reported emissions cover all 
continuing operations of the Group as  
at 31 December 2015. Emissions from 
entities disposed of during the financial 
year ended 31 December 2015 are not 
accounted for in the reported GHG data. 
Therefore, for example, the data from the 
Elster business has not been included 
within the reported GHG data, as this 
business was divested during the year.
 
7. The environment 
The Melrose Board fully understands  
the importance of the Group’s 
environmental responsibilities and is 
committed to ensuring that operations 
have the minimum possible adverse 
effect on the environment. 
Although there are no standardised 
environmental KPIs currently used within 
the Group, the Group ensures businesses 
understand the importance of monitoring 
the impact of their operations on the 
environment. A range of KPIs are used  
as environmental measures, including 
energy consumption, CO
2
 emissions, 
water consumption, water contamination, 
waste disposal, solid and liquid waste 
generation, recycling and volatile organic 
compound emissions. These KPIs are then 
used to plan for ongoing improvements. 
During the year, the Company continued  
to comply with the ongoing annual 
reporting requirements of the UK’s  
Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy 
Efficiency Scheme.
8. Environmental initiatives
During 2015, Brush implemented a 
range of environmental improvement 
initiatives. Some of these are listed 
below:
• Brush UK focused on making further 
energy savings, including in gas and 
electricity consumption. Lighting initiatives 
across the Loughborough site have 
continued to generate savings in certain 
working facilities.
• Brush UK introduced the use of reusable 
plastic pallets to minimise the use of 
wooden pallets, packaging and waste 
disposal. 
9. Greenhouse gas emissions 
The Group is required to measure  
and report its direct and indirect 
greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions 
pursuant to the Companies Act 2006 
(Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Reports) Regulations 2013.
The GHG reporting period is aligned to  
the Company’s financial reporting year.
The data has been prepared in accordance 
with the principles and requirements of  
the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, Corporate 
Accounting and Reporting Standard 
(Revised Edition) 2004 for Scope 1 and 
Scope 2 emissions and the Department  
for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs 
(“DEFRA”) guidance on how to measure 
and report on greenhouse gas emissions, 
as first published in 2013 and subsequently 
updated. 
We have reported on all emission sources 
required under the Companies Act 2006 
(Strategic Report and Directors’ Reports) 
Regulations 2013. These emission sources 
fall within our consolidated financial 
statements.
Corporate Social Responsibility

Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015
Strategic Report 11. Supply chain assurance
Owing to the geographical and 
operational diversity of Melrose and 
Brush, and therefore its supplier base, 
there is no single over-arching Group 
policy currently in use in relation to 
suppliers. 
However, the security, assurance and 
ethical compliance of business supply 
chains is very important to Melrose. 
Responsibility for the implementation and 
management of all supplier-related policies 
rests with local management. Such 
policies are used in a manner appropriate 
to the size and complexity of the business 
and also take into account the nature  
and geographical representation of key 
suppliers. A supplier approval process 
exists within Brush, which is linked to 
specific and tailored supplier assessments 
and due diligence requirements. 
All material emissions from within the 
organisational and operational scope and 
boundaries of the Group are reported. The 
emissions from owned vehicle transport 
(i.e. Group-owned cars and vans, lorries 
and fork lift trucks) and the emissions 
associated with refrigeration have been 
excluded from the report on a de minimis 
basis. The GHG emissions from these 
sources have been estimated to account 
for less than 1% of the total Melrose Group 
emissions reported on an individual basis 
and as a combined total to account for 
less than 2% of the total Melrose Group 
GHG emissions reported.
The financial reporting year of 2014 was 
the second year in which the Company 
had been required to disclose its GHG 
emissions data within the Annual Report 
and represents the baseline against  
which subsequent emission data sets  
are expected to be based. The main 
change in the data compared to the 
baseline data, as presented in the table 
above, is due to the divestment of the 
Elster business units in 2015. The Elster 
group represented approximately 52%  
of the total GHG emissions previously 
reported in the Annual Report for the year 
ended 31 December 2014. Other, smaller, 
changes have resulted from the closure 
and relocation of activities from some  
sites and general efficiency savings and 
improvements at a number of other sites.
Given that the Melrose business model  
is to acquire and divest businesses over  
a three-to-five-year time frame, there may 
be significant year-on-year changes in the 
reported emissions data which may not 
reflect the underlying GHG performance  
of the Group’s businesses.
10. Energy Savings 
Opportunity Scheme
Article 8 of the EU Energy Efficiency 
Directive (“EED”) 2012/27/EU requires 
‘large’ organisations to carry out  
energy audits at least once every  
four years to help achieve the EU’s 
target of 20% improvement in energy 
efficiency by 2020. 
In the UK, Article 8 of the EED was 
transposed into the Energy Savings 
Opportunity Scheme (“ESOS”) Regulations 
2014, which came into force on 17 July  
2014 and which require qualifying 
organisations to measure energy 
consumption, evaluate energy efficiency, 
identify management opportunities, store 
data and confirm to the UK Environment 
Agency by 5 December 2015 that  
an ESOS compliance audit has been 
completed. Other EU Member states  
have imposed their own interpretations  
of Article 8, but generally have similar 
requirements.
During 2015, Melrose worked with  
a specialist energy consultancy, CMR 
Consultants Limited, to ensure that the 
Group fully complied with its EU EED 
Article 8 obligations. Energy audits were 
carried out at Group sites across Europe 
and compliance was achieved through 
submission of reports, data and 
information to the relevant authorities,  
as appropriate.

12. Human rights  
and ethical standards
The decentralised nature of the Group 
means there is no single over-arching 
policy currently in place with regard  
to human rights. 
However, sound business ethics and 
integrity are core to the Group’s values  
and a high importance is placed on 
dealings with all employees, customers, 
suppliers and other stakeholders. Melrose 
is committed to good practice in respect  
of human rights. Employees across  
the Group are required, at all times, to 
exhibit the highest levels of integrity and  
to maintain the highest ethical standards  
in business affairs. The full text of the 
Melrose Code of Ethics, which all 
employees of the Group are required  
to familiarise themselves with, can be 
found on the Company’s website at  
www.melroseplc.net/about-us/ 
code-of-ethics
In addition to the Melrose Code of Ethics, 
each Group business is expected to have 
its own code of ethics dealing with matters 
such as human rights. All business-specific 
employee policies are prepared locally 
within each business in order to ensure 
compliance with local laws and standards 
as a minimum. Responsibility for the 
communication and implementation of 
such policies rests with the relevant senior 
managers within the Group’s businesses.
Finally, in advance of the need for the 
Company to report in accordance with  
the Modern Slavery Act 2015, the Group  
is taking steps to put in place effective  
and proportionate procedures to ensure 
that there are no forms of modern slavery 
in the Group’s business or supply chains.  
It is expected that a full statement will be 
prepared and published on the Group’s 
website following the end of the current 
financial year.

on the Melrose Board since 2005 and his advice and extensive 
financial experience have been invaluable to Melrose; we wish  
him every success in the future. Perry will be replaced as senior 
non-executive Director by John Grant, who will also continue to 
hold the position of Chairman of the Audit Committee. A search 
is underway for a new non-executive Director and a search and 
selection specialist has been engaged to support the recruitment 
process. An appointment is expected to be made during 2016. 
Remuneration
The Directors’ Remuneration Report, comprising the Annual  
Report on Remuneration and the Directors’ remuneration policy,  
is set out on pages 64 to 81. The Directors’ remuneration policy  
is forward-looking and is subject to a binding vote at the AGM.  
Our existing remuneration policy was approved by shareholders  
at the 2014 AGM and would normally remain in place until the  
AGM in 2017. However, following the introduction of a new holding 
company for the Group in November 2015, we are required to  
seek shareholder approval for the Directors’ remuneration policy  
at this year’s AGM. It is important to note that no changes have 
been made to the remuneration policy being put to shareholders;  
it is wholly consistent with the remuneration policy approved  
in 2014, to the extent that the policy remains applicable going 
forwards. In addition, our remuneration philosophy remains 
unchanged; executive remuneration should be simple, transparent, 
support the delivery of the business strategy and only pay for 
performance.
Risk management and compliance 
During 2015, the Melrose risk management framework  
was relaunched. The Group’s risk management strategy was  
updated, risk training workshops were introduced, an enhanced 
risk register and risk mapping and profiling application was 
Introduction from the Chairman 
The Board remains committed to maintaining the high 
standards of corporate governance required to ensure  
that the Company can continue to deliver on its strategic 
goals and to achieve long-term success for the benefit  
of its shareholders.
As part of this approach, the Board supports, applies and 
complies with the Main Principles, the Supporting Principles  
and the respective related provisions of corporate governance 
contained in the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “UK Code”) 
issued by the Financial Reporting Council (the “FRC”) and 
available to view on the FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/
Our-Work/Codes-Standards/Corporate-governance.aspx
In support of this commitment, the Board carried out a number  
of key governance activities during 2015 designed to ensure that 
Melrose remains compliant with the provisions of the UK Code 
and also to enable continuous improvement in line with best 
practice corporate governance guidelines.
Succession planning
Succession planning was an area of focus for Melrose in 2015 
and a dedicated Board session was held to review the leadership 
needs of the Group, present and future, together with the  
skills and experiences needed from its Directors going forward.  
We recognise that succession planning is an ongoing process 
and is critical to maintaining an effective and high-quality board.  
With this in mind, a number of changes to the Board are planned 
during 2016. Perry Crosthwaite will be retiring from the Board  
at the conclusion of this year’s Annual General Meeting (“AGM”),  
to be held on 11 May 2016. Perry has held a non-executive position

adopted and a risk monitoring and assurance programme  
was implemented. Taken together, these initiatives have enhanced  
the Group’s effectiveness at identifying and managing risks and 
are promoting and embedding a more risk-aware culture across 
the business. Further details on the Group’s management of risk 
can be found on pages 28 to 35 of this Annual Report.
Melrose’s reputation for acting responsibly plays a critical role in 
its success as a business and its ability to generate shareholder 
value. We maintain high standards of ethical conduct and take a 
zero tolerance approach to bribery, corruption and other unethical 
or illegal practices. In 2015, we updated our Code of Ethics and 
developed a best practice compliance framework with policies 
covering anti-bribery and anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, 
competition and anti-trust, trade compliance and data privacy. 
Supporting these policies is a comprehensive online training 
platform and an industry-leading whistleblowing reporting facility. 
The integrity of the compliance framework is further reinforced  
by the use of independent assurance and compliance audits. 
Engagement with shareholders 
During 2015, the Company continued its programme of 
engagement with major investors and the governance bodies  
in respect of our remuneration policy and incentive arrangements. 
The Board is pleased with the support and constructive feedback 
throughout these discussions and it is our intention to continue 
this programme for the foreseeable future.

Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015 The Directors of Melrose Industries PLC 
present their Annual Report and audited 
financial statements of the Group for the 
year ended 31 December 2015. 
Incorporated information
The Corporate Governance Report set out on pages 54 to 57 ,  
the Finance Director’s review on pages 20 to 26 and the Corporate 
Social Responsibility section of the Strategic Report on pages 36  
to 44 are each incorporated by reference into this Directors’ Report. 
Disclosures elsewhere in the Annual Report are cross-referenced 
where appropriate. Taken together, they fulfil the combined 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 (the “Act”) and of the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules (the “DTRs”) and the Listing 
Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority. 
Structure of the Group
On 6 October 2015, Melrose Industries PLC (since renamed 
Melrose Holdings Limited) (“Old Melrose”) announced its intention 
to implement a corporate reorganisation by way of a Court-
sanctioned scheme of arrangement, pursuant to which a new listed 
holding company, New Melrose Industries PLC (since renamed 
Melrose Industries PLC) (“New Melrose”) was to be introduced  
for the Melrose Group. The shareholders of Old Melrose approved 
the proposed scheme of arrangement on 29 October 2015 and, 
following the Court’s sanction on 18 November 2015, the scheme 
of arrangement became effective on 19 November 2015, when 
New Melrose became the new holding company of Old Melrose 
and its subsidiaries (the “Restructuring”). 
In this Annual Report, unless explicitly stated otherwise, references 
to the “Company” and to “Melrose” are references to Old Melrose 
up to but excluding 19 November 2015, and to New Melrose from 
19 November 2015 onwards. References to the “Board”, to the 
“Directors” and to Board positions are references to the Board,  
to the Directors and to Board positions of the relevant company  
for those periods. No changes were made to the composition  
of the Board, nor to each Director’s Board positions, as a result  
of the Restructuring.
AGM 
The Annual General Meeting of the Company will be held at 
Barber-Surgeons’ Hall, Monkwell Square, Wood Street, London, 
EC2Y 5BL at 11.30 a.m. on 11 May 2016 (the “AGM”). The notice 
convening the meeting is shown on pages 144 to 149 and 
includes full details of the resolutions to be proposed, together with 
explanatory notes in relation to such resolutions (the “AGM Notice”).
Directors 
The Directors of the Company as at the date of this Annual Report, 
together with their biographical details, can be found on pages  
48 and 49. 
There were no changes to the Board during the year. Details 
of Directors’ service contracts are set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on page 80. 
The statement of Directors’ responsibilities in relation to the 
consolidated financial statements is set out on page 82, which 
is incorporated into this Directors’ Report by reference. 
Appointment and removal of Directors and their powers 
The Company’s articles of association (“Articles”) give the Directors 
the power to appoint and replace other Directors. Under the terms 
of reference of the Nomination Committee, any appointment must 
be recommended by the Nomination Committee for approval by 
the Board. 
Pursuant to the Articles and in line with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, all of the Directors of the Company are required 
to stand for re-election on an annual basis. All current Directors of the 
Company will be standing for re-election by the shareholders at the 
forthcoming AGM, with the exception of Perry Crosthwaite, who will 
be retiring from office with effect from the conclusion of the AGM.
The Directors are responsible for managing the business of  
the Company and exercise their powers in accordance with the 
Articles, directions given by special resolution and any relevant 
statutes and regulations. 
Insurance and indemnities 
In accordance with the Articles and the indemnity provisions  
of the Act, the Directors have the benefit of an indemnity from the 
Company in respect of any liabilities incurred as a result of their 
office. This indemnity is provided both within the Articles and 
through a separate deed of indemnity between the Company  
and each of the Directors.
The Company has taken out an insurance policy in respect of those 
liabilities for which the Directors may not be indemnified. Neither  
the indemnities nor the insurance provides cover in the event that  
a Director is proved to have acted dishonestly or fraudulently. 
Post Balance Sheet events 
In December 2015, the Company completed the disposal of its 
Elster business to a subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc.,  
for cash consideration of £3.3 billion (see note 9 to the financial 
statements for further details, which are incorporated by reference 
into this report). 
In accordance with its strategy to return value to shareholders, the 
Company returned approximately £2.4 billion from the proceeds  
of the disposal to shareholders (the “Return of Capital”). 
In order to realise the Return of Capital, holders of ordinary shares 
in the Company as at 5.00 p.m. on 26 January 2016 (the “Record 
Date”) received one B share with a nominal value of 240 pence 
each in the capital of the Company for every ordinary share they 
held as at the Record Date. The B shares were not admitted to 
listing or dealing on any exchange.
On 27 January 2016, the High Court of England and Wales 
approved the cancellation of the B shares. On 5 February 2016, 
cheques representing the nominal value of the B shares (240 pence 
each) were dispatched to their holders and CREST accounts were 
credited with the proceeds, as appropriate. 
Following the Return of Capital, the ordinary share capital of the 
Company was sub-divided and consolidated (the “Share Capital 
Consolidation”). This was to ensure that, so far as possible,  
the market price of an ordinary share in the Company remained 
approximately the same before and after the Return of Capital and, 
so far as possible, historical per share data remained comparable 
against future per share data. 
The Share Capital Consolidation was effected by the sub-division of 
each existing ordinary share of 1 penny in the capital of the Company 
(the “Existing Ordinary Shares”) into 7 shares of 1/7 pence each in 
the capital of the Company and, forthwith upon such sub-division, 
the consolidation of every 48 shares of 1/7 pence each resulting 
Directors’ Report

Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015
Governance from such sub-division into one new ordinary share of 48/7 pence  
in the capital of the Company (the “New Ordinary Shares”). The 
record date for the Share Capital Consolidation was 6.00 p.m.  
on 27 January 2016 and the New Ordinary Shares were admitted  
to listing and trading from 8.00 a.m. on 28 January 2016. Subject  
to allowance for fractional entitlements, shareholders continued  
to own approximately the same proportion of the ordinary  
share capital of the Company before and after the Share Capital 
Consolidation.
The Return of Capital and the Share Capital Consolidation were 
approved by shareholders of New Melrose at a general meeting  
of New Melrose held on 2 October 2015 and by shareholders  
of Old Melrose at a general meeting of Old Melrose held on  
29 October 2015.
Worked example
If you held 1,000 Existing Ordinary Shares of 1 penny each in  
the capital of the Company as at 6.00 p.m. on 27 January 2016,  
after the Return of Capital and the Share Capital Consolidation,  
you would receive:
• £2,400 in cash, by cheque or settlement through CREST; and
•  145 New Ordinary Shares of 48/7 pence each in the capital  
of the Company.
You would also be entitled to 5/6 of a New Ordinary Share.  
This fractional entitlement would be grouped together with all other 
fractional entitlements and sold in the market with the proceeds,  
net of commission, donated to charity.

are contained in note 29 to the financial statements, which are

(1)  Fractional entitlements resulting from the share capital consolidation effective on  
23 February 2015 were aggregated and sold in the market. The aggregated proceeds of 
sale, net of commission, were donated to a charity nominated by the Board, the Rainbow 
Trust. In order to ensure that the aggregate of all fractional entitlements to be sold in the 
market added up to a whole number of Existing Ordinary Shares, nine ordinary shares of 
13/110 pence each were allotted and issued to Investec Bank plc on 3 February 2015 at 
266.8 pence per share, being the closing middle-market price of an ordinary share in the 
Company on 2 February 2015. These ordinary shares were issued pursuant to the general 
authorities granted by the Company’s shareholders in accordance with section 551 and 
section 570 of the Act at the Company’s AGM held on 13 May 2014. The terms of this issue 
were fixed on 2 February 2015 following a meeting of the Board. These ordinary shares were 
subject to the share capital consolidation in the ratio of 13 for 14 and were entitled to 
participate in the return of capital of 18.7 pence per ordinary share. The share capital 
consolidation and the return of capital were approved by the shareholders at a general 
meeting of the Company held on 20 February 2015.
(2)  Fractional entitlements resulting from the Share Capital Consolidation effective on  
28 January 2016 were aggregated and sold in the market. The aggregated proceeds of sale,  
net of commission, were donated to a charity nominated by the Board, the Motor Neurone 
Disease Association. In order to ensure that the aggregate of all fractional entitlements  
to be sold in the market added up to a whole number of New Ordinary Shares, 26 Existing 
Ordinary Shares were allotted and issued to Investec Bank plc on 26 January 2016 at  
281.0 pence per share, being the closing middle-market price of an Existing Ordinary Share 
on 26 January 2016. These ordinary shares were issued pursuant to the general authorities 
granted by the Company’s shareholders in accordance with section 551 and section 570  
of the Act at a general meeting of the Company held on 2 October 2015. The terms of this 
issue were fixed on 26 January 2015 following a meeting of the Board. These Existing 
Ordinary Shares were not entitled to participate in the Return of Capital, but were subject  
to the Share Capital Consolidation.
Details of the 2012 Incentive Plan are set out on pages 68 to 70  
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report and note 22 to the financial 
statements, which are incorporated by reference into this report.
Shareholders’ voting rights
Subject to any special rights or restrictions as to voting attached  
to any class of shares by or in accordance with the Articles, at a 
general meeting of the Company each member who holds ordinary 
shares in the Company and who is present (in person or by proxy) 
at such meeting is entitled to:
• on a show of hands, one vote; and
• on a poll, one vote for every ordinary share held by them.
There are currently no special rights or restrictions as to voting 
attached to any class of shares.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between 
shareholders that restrict voting rights attached to the ordinary 
shares in the Company.
Where any call or other amount due and payable in respect of an 
ordinary share remains unpaid, the holder of such shares shall not 
be entitled to vote or attend any general meeting of the Company  
in respect of those shares. As at 2 March 2016, all ordinary shares 
issued by the Company are fully paid.
Details of the deadlines for exercising voting rights in respect of the 
resolutions to be considered at the 2016 AGM are set out in the 
AGM Notice on pages 148 and 149.
The rights and restrictions attached to the New Ordinary Shares 
following the Share Capital Consolidation remain exactly the same 
as those attached to the Existing Ordinary Shares immediately prior 
to the Share Capital Consolidation.
Restrictions on transfer of ordinary shares
The Articles do not contain any restrictions on the transfer of 
ordinary shares in the Company, aside from the usual restrictions 
applicable where shares are not fully paid up, if entitled to do so 
under the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, where the 
transfer instrument does not comply with the requirements of  
the Articles or, in exceptional circumstances, where approved  
by the UK Listing Authority provided such refusal would not disturb  
the market in such shares. Restrictions may also be imposed by 
laws and regulations (such as insider trading and market abuse 
provisions). Directors and certain senior employees of the Group 
may also be subject to internal approvals before dealing in ordinary 
shares of the Company and minimum share holding requirements.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between 
shareholders that restrict the transfer of ordinary shares in the 
Company.

the Restructuring. The Articles of New Melrose were based upon 
the Articles of Old Melrose at that date, with the amendments 
described in the Prospectus dated 6 October 2015, which was 
published in relation to the Restructuring.
The Articles were further amended on 26 October 2015 pursuant to 
a special resolution approved at a general meeting of New Melrose, 
in order to better facilitate the Return of Capital.
The Articles may only be amended by a special resolution at  
a general meeting of the shareholders of the Company. There  
are no amendments proposed to be made to the Articles at the 
forthcoming AGM.

Shareholder dividend
The Directors are pleased to recommend the payment of a final 
dividend of 2.6 pence per share (2014: 5.3 pence) to be paid  
on 16 May 2016 to ordinary shareholders on the register of 
members of the Company at the close of trading on 8 April 2016. 
This dividend recommendation will be put to shareholders at the 
forthcoming AGM of the Company, to be held on 11 May 2016. 
Subject to shareholder approval being obtained at the AGM for the 
final dividend, this will mean a full year 2015 dividend of 5.4 pence 
per share (2014: 8.1 pence).
In November 2014, the Company completed the disposal  
of its Bridon business for an enterprise value of £365 million.  
In accordance with its strategy to return value to shareholders,  
the Company announced its intention to return approximately  
£200 million from the proceeds of the disposal to shareholders,  
by way of a redeemable share scheme with both income and 
capital options. This return of capital was approved by shareholders 
at a general meeting of the Company held on 20 February 2015. 
This return to shareholders is not included in the full year dividend 
figure stated above.
Following the disposal of the Elster business in December 2015,  
the Company announced its intention to return approximately  
£2.4 billion from the proceeds of the disposal to shareholders,  
by way of the Return of Capital detailed earlier in this Directors’ 
Report. The Return of Capital and the Share Capital Consolidation 
were approved by shareholders of New Melrose at a general 
meeting of New Melrose held on 2 October 2015 and by 
shareholders of Old Melrose at a general meeting of Old Melrose 
held on 29 October 2015. The Return of Capital is not included  
in the full year dividend figure stated above. 
For discussions on the Board’s intentions with regards to the 
dividend policy, please see the Chairman’s statement on page 06, 
which is incorporated into this report by reference. 
The Company offers a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (“DRIP”) which 
gives shareholders the opportunity to use their dividend payments 
to purchase further ordinary shares in the Company. Further  
details about the DRIP and its terms and conditions can be  
found within the Investors section of the Company’s website at  
www.melroseplc.net 
Ability to purchase own shares
Pursuant to sections 693 and 701 of the Act and a special 
resolution passed at a general meeting of New Melrose on 
2 October 2015, the Company is authorised to make market 
purchases of up to 99,520,696 of its ordinary shares, representing 
approximately 10% of the issued share capital of the Company 
immediately following the Restructuring. The Company has not 
made any purchases of its own shares pursuant to this authority.
This authority will expire at the end of this year’s AGM. The 
Company is seeking approval from shareholders at this year’s  
AGM for the Company to make market purchases of up to 
14,513,435 of its ordinary shares, representing approximately  
10% of the issued share capital of the Company following the  
Share Capital Consolidation. The full text of the resolution, together 
with minimum and maximum price requirements, is set out in the 
AGM Notice on page 145.
Financial instruments
The disclosures required in relation to the use of financial 
instruments by the Company, including the financial risk 
management objectives and policies (including in relation to 
hedging) of the Company and the exposure of the Company to 
price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, cash flow risk, exchange rate  
risk, contract and warranty risk and commodity cost risk, can  
be found in the Finance Director’s review on pages 20 to 26,  
the risks and uncertainties section of the Strategic Report on  
pages 30 to 35 and in note 24 to the financial statements,  
which are incorporated by reference into this Directors’ Report.
Research and development activities
The industries in which the Melrose Group invests are highly 
competitive and the businesses within the Group are encouraged 
to research and develop new and innovative product lines and 
processes in order to meet customer demands in a continuously 
evolving environment.

Disclosures required under Listing Rule 9.8.4R
Other than the following, no further information is required to  
be disclosed by the Company in respect of Listing Rule 9.8.4R:
• details of the 2012 Incentive Plan, which are set out on pages  
68 to 70 of the Directors’ Remuneration Report and note 22  
to the financial statements (incorporated by reference into  
this report); and
• details of allotments of ordinary shares to Investec Bank plc,  
as part of the share capital consolidations, which are set out  
on page 51 of this Directors’ Report.
Significant agreements and change of control
With the exception of the Group’s banking facilities, the 2012 
Incentive Plan (including the options granted under this plan) and 
the divisional management long-term incentive plans, there are  
no other agreements that would have a significant effect upon  
a change of control of Melrose Industries PLC as at 2 March 2016.
In June 2012, as part of the process to acquire Elster, the Group 
entered into a £1.5 billion multi-currency term and revolving bank 
facilities agreement, which was restated and amended from time  
to time. By an amendment and restatement agreement dated 
30 September 2015, it was agreed that each of the facilities would 
be repaid and subsequently cancelled using part of the proceeds  
of the disposal of the Elster business, save for a £200 million 
multi-currency revolving credit facility which remains in place,  
but which is not currently utilised.
The amended facility agreement contains substantially the same 
terms as previously, except for a reduction in various thresholds  
to reflect the smaller size of the Group following the disposal and 
Return of Capital. 
In the event of a change of control of the Company following a 
takeover bid, the Company and lenders under the amended facility 
agreement are obliged to enter into negotiations to determine 
whether, and if so how, to continue with the facility. There is no 
obligation for the lenders to continue to make the facility available 
for more than 30 days beyond any change of control. Failure to 
reach agreement with parties on revised terms could require an 
acquirer to put in place replacement facilities.
In the event of a takeover of the Company, options granted under 
the 2012 Incentive Plan would be exercised and any 2012 incentive 
shares resulting from such exercise, or that had previously been 
issued, would convert into ordinary shares in the Company or  
an entitlement to a dividend paid in cash, the rate of conversion 
being based upon the offer price of the Company’s ordinary  
shares as calculated on the date of the change of control of the 
Company. If the offer price, or any element of the offer price, is  
not in cash, the Remuneration Committee will determine the value 
of the non-cash element, having been advised by a reputable 
investment bank that such valuation is fair and reasonable.
Following the maturity of an earlier scheme, a long-term incentive 
plan has been put in place for certain employees of Brush, which 
would be triggered upon a takeover of the Company. The plan 
provides for the payment of bonuses to certain key managers  
of Brush based upon the increase in value of the business. 
Auditor
So far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information (being information that is needed by the Company’s 
auditor to prepare its report) of which the Company’s auditor is 
unaware. Each Director has taken all the steps that he/she ought to 
have taken as a Director to make him/herself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is 
aware of that information. 
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance 
with the provisions of section 418 of the Act.
On behalf of the Board, the Audit Committee has reviewed the 
effectiveness, performance, independence and objectivity  
of the existing external auditor, Deloitte LLP , for the year ended 
31 December 2015 and concluded that the external auditor was in 
all respects effective. Deloitte LLP has expressed its willingness to 
continue in office as auditor of the Group. Accordingly, resolutions 
will be proposed at this year’s AGM for the reappointment of 
Deloitte LLP as auditor of the Group and to authorise the Audit 
Committee to determine its remuneration.

Governance
53
Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015 In line with the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”)  
and the Listing Rules issued by the Financial Conduct Authority,  
this section of the Annual Report details the ways in which the 
Company has applied and complied with the principles and 
provisions of the Code during the year ended 31 December 2015.
In September 2014, the Financial Reporting Council (“FRC”) 
amended the Code with effect for accounting periods beginning on 
or after 1 October 2014. A copy of the revised Code is available at  
www.frc.org.uk/Our-Work/Codes-Standards/Corporate-
governance.aspx
The Audit Committee Report, Nomination Committee Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the risk management and 
risks and uncertainties sections of the Strategic Report also form 
part of this Corporate Governance Report.
Statement of compliance
Throughout the year ended 31 December 2015, the Company  
has applied and complied with the main principles, the supporting 
principles and the respective related provisions of the Code,  
with the exception of the following:
D.1.1  Schedule A of the Code recommends that grants under 
executive share options and other long-term investment 
plans should normally be phased, rather than awarded in 
one block. Grants under the 2012 Incentive Plan, details  
of which are set out on pages 68 to 70 of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report, were awarded in one block, rather 
than phased. The 2012 Incentive Plan was recommended 
as being in the best interests of shareholders as a whole  
by the Board and was approved by shareholders at  
a general meeting held on 11 April 2012.
All other aspects of the executive Directors’ remuneration 
fully comply with Schedule A of the Code.
Main Principle A: Leadership
The Board
Details of the structure of the Board and its key responsibilities 
are shown on pages 46 and 47 .
There were four formally-scheduled Board meetings held during  
the year and the attendance of each Director at these meetings is 
shown on page 56. In addition, a number of unscheduled Board 
meetings were held during the year in connection with corporate 
transactions, for example capital returns, restructurings, business 
divestments and, since the year end, the Return of Capital to 
shareholders and the associated Share Capital Consolidation.
In addition, business review meetings are held between scheduled 
Board meetings. There were three business review meetings held 
during the year. The attendance of each Director at these review 
meetings is set out on page 56. These meetings are critical to 
providing the Directors with a comprehensive understanding of the 
current performance of, and the key issues affecting, the Group’s 
businesses, without the formality or rigidity of a Board meeting.  
Chief executives and other senior management from the Melrose 
businesses are periodically invited to attend and present to these 
meetings, providing the Directors with an opportunity to discuss  
each business directly and to develop relationships with their 
leadership teams.
A pack of briefing papers and an agenda are provided to each 
Director in advance of each Board, Committee or business review 
meeting. The Directors are able to seek further clarification and 
information on any matter from any other Director, the Company 
Secretary or any other employee of the Group whenever necessary. 
Decisions are taken by the Board in conjunction with the 
recommendations of its Committees and advice from external 
consultants, advisers and senior management.
The Board has a fully-encrypted electronic board portal system, 
enabling Board, Committee and review papers to be delivered 
securely and efficiently to Directors. This facilitates a faster and 
more secure distribution of information, accessed using electronic 
tablets and reduced resource usage.
The Company Secretary is responsible for advising and supporting 
the Chairman and the Board on corporate governance matters  
as well as ensuring a smooth flow of information to enable effective 
decision making. All Directors have access to the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary and, through him, have access 
to independent professional advice in respect of their duties, at the 
Company’s expense. The Company Secretary acts as secretary  
to the Board, the Audit Committee, the Nomination Committee  
and the Remuneration Committee.
In accordance with its Articles and in compliance with the 
Companies Act 2006, the Company has granted a qualifying third 
party indemnity to each Director. This indemnity is provided both 
within the Company’s Articles and through a separate deed of 
indemnity between the Company and each of the Directors. The 
Company also maintains Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance.
Chairman, Vice-Chairman and Chief Executive
The roles of Chairman and Vice-Chairman are, and will remain, 
separate to that of the Chief Executive of the Company, in 
accordance with best practice and Board policy.
The Chairman, with the assistance of the Vice-Chairman,  
is responsible for leadership of the Board. The Chairman sets  
the Board agenda and ensures that adequate time is given to  
the discussion of issues, particularly those of a strategic nature. 
Responsibility for ensuring effective communications are made  
to shareholders rests with the Chairman, Vice-Chairman and the 
two other executive Directors. 
The Board notes, and confirms its satisfaction with, the choice  
of an executive Chairman. Christopher Miller, the current executive 
Chairman of the Group, is one of the founding members of Melrose, 
having been a Director since its incorporation in 2003. Christopher’s 
long-standing involvement brings a wealth of experience to the 
Board and his oversight of corporate governance and compliance 
matters complements the work of the Group’s non-executive 
Directors. Christopher continues to play an active role in identifying 
and evaluating new opportunities for the Group.
The Chief Executive is responsible for strategic direction and 
decisions involving the day-to-day management of the Company.
Non-executive Directors
The Company’s non-executive Directors are encouraged to,  
and do, scrutinise the performance of the executive Directors  
in all areas, including on strategy, risks and financial information, 
through their roles on the Company’s Committees, at the Board’s 
scheduled meetings and review sessions and on an ad hoc basis.
Main Principle B: Effectiveness
Board composition
As at 2 March 2016, the Board comprised an executive Chairman, 
Corporate Governance Report
54
Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015
Governance three other executive Directors and four non-executive Directors.  
The Board believes that the Directors possess diverse business 
experience in areas complementary to the activities of the Company. 
Biographies of the Directors are shown on pages 48 and 49 and  
on the Company’s corporate website at www.melroseplc.net 
These biographies identify any other significant appointments  
held by the Directors. None of the executive Directors hold 
non-executive positions outside the Company. 
The Board and the Nomination Committee undertake an annual 
review of the time commitment required from both the executive 
and non-executive Directors. The consensus view between the 
Directors is that the current time commitment is appropriate.
The Board notes that, following Perry Crosthwaite’s retirement as a 
non-executive Director at the conclusion of this year’s AGM, the Board 
will consist of an executive Chairman, three other executive Directors 
and three non-executive Directors and, as a result, will temporarily have 
a greater proportion of executive Directors to non-executive Directors. 
A search is currently underway for a new non-executive Director  
and Stonehaven Associates, search and selection specialists, have 
been engaged to support the recruitment process. Aside from their 
assistance with the recruitment process, Stonehaven Associates 
have no other connection with the Company.
The Nomination Committee has agreed upon selection criteria  
for the role, which has then formed the basis of a shortlist.  
The Nomination Committee is currently in the process of working 
through such a shortlist, using a rigorous and comprehensive 
weighted scoring system to select the candidate most appropriate 
for the position. An appointment is expected to be made during 2016.
Whilst the recruitment process continues, the Board is satisfied  
that there will be sufficient challenge by non-executive Directors  
of executive management in meetings of the Board and that no 
individual or small group of individuals dominates its decision making.
Non-executive Director independence
In accordance with the provisions of the Code, consideration has 
been given to the independence of all non-executive Directors. The 
Board considers all of the non-executive Directors to be independent.
Under the Code, the Board is required to state its reasons if it 
determines that a Director is independent notwithstanding the 
existence of any circumstances which may appear relevant  
to its determination.
Perry Crosthwaite, currently the Board’s senior non-executive 
Director, will retire from his position at the conclusion of this year’s 
AGM, having served three three-year terms as a non-executive 
Director. Perry’s role as a non-executive Director, and in particular 
the length of his time in office, has been closely monitored by  
the Board. Even though Perry has served as a non-executive 
Director for more than nine years since the date of his first  
election, the Board has determined that he continues to maintain 
his independence. In addition, the Board has continued to  
benefit from Perry’s invaluable experience in financial and  
other corporate matters. Perry will be replaced in the position  
of senior non-executive Director by John Grant.
The Board notes that John Grant, who was appointed as a non-
executive Director on the Melrose Board in August 2006 and first 
elected at the 2007 AGM, will have served three, three-year terms  
at the time of the 2016 AGM. However, the Board is of the opinion 
that, due to his invaluable financial and global executive experience 
gained in the automotive and other engineering sectors, John Grant 
continues to maintain both his effectiveness and his independence  
as a non-executive Director of the Company. The Board will continue 
to monitor this position but feels at the present time that John Grant 
continues to make an important contribution to the Company.
The non-executive Directors are not entitled to any cash bonus  
or shares under the 2012 Incentive Plan.
Board induction, training and support
A full and formal induction programme tailored to the needs of 
individual Directors is provided for new Directors joining the Board. 
The primary aim of the induction programme is to introduce  
new Directors to, and educate new Directors about, the Group’s 
businesses, its operations and its governance arrangements. 
Individual induction requirements are monitored by the Chairman 
and the Company Secretary to ensure that new Directors gain 
sufficient knowledge to enable them to contribute to the Board’s 
deliberations as quickly as possible.
Board visit
One of the outputs of the 2014 Board evaluation exercise was  
a desire to continue to incorporate into the Board schedule visits  
to major operating businesses and periodic sessions with senior 
management from the Group’s businesses.
In April 2015, the Board visited Brush’s head office in Loughborough. 
Meetings were held with senior management from across the Brush 
businesses, which were complemented by a tour of the production 
facility and presentations focused on, among other things, market 
position, drivers of competition, growth opportunities and financials.
Board evaluation
Evaluation approach and process
During 2015, the Chairman held meetings with each of the 
Directors, including the senior non-executive Director, to discuss 
the performance of individual Directors and the Board as a whole. 
After two years of externally-facilitated Board evaluation exercises 
(supported by Lintstock Limited, a specialist governance 
consultancy), the Board decided that a more free-ranging 
discussion was merited for 2015.
A range of topics were discussed including: Board mix, profile  
and diversity, succession planning, risk and internal controls, 
strategy, Board processes, future investor strategy and the Group’s 
preparedness at managing the cyber risks facing the business.
The discussion also included a review of the actions agreed 
following the 2014 Board evaluation, and the steps taken in 2015  
to address these needs:
Actions agreed from  
2014 evaluation What we have delivered in 2015
To continue to plan  
for executive Director 
succession and 
managing the succession 
of non-executive 
Directors
Executive and non-executive succession 
remains a core focus for the Nomination 
Committee and for the Board. Having 
completed three three-year terms as a 
non-executive Director of the Company,  
Perry Crosthwaite will retire from his position  
at the conclusion of this year’s AGM. A search 
and selection process is underway and the 
appointment of a new non-executive Director  
is expected to be announced in the near future.
To continue to focus on 
risk management and 
internal control and to 
delineate accountabilities 
between the Board and 
the Audit Committee
Risk management and internal control  
have been areas of focus in 2015. A new  
risk management framework has been 
implemented across the Group and there  
is now a clear delineation of accountabilities  
for risk management between the Board and 
Audit Committee, which is enshrined in the 
reserved matters for the Board and the Audit 
Committee’s terms of reference.

Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015 Actions agreed from  
2014 evaluation What we have delivered in 2015
To continue visits to 
major operating units  
to ensure that the Board 
develops and maintains  
a sound knowledge of 
the businesses within  
the Group and is visible 
to the operations
In April 2015, the Board attended a  
two-day site visit to Brush’s head office in 
Loughborough. In addition to reviewing the 
production facilities at the site, the Board 
received a series of business briefings from  
the Brush leadership team.
To increase the frequency 
of management 
presentations so that the 
chief executive of each 
business reports to the 
Board annually
Following the success of the programme  
of presentations given by the Elster Gas  
and Electricity leadership teams to the Board 
during 2014, the Board received a series of 
briefings from the executive team at Brush as 
part of the visit to the Brush site during 2015.
To review the format  
and content of the 
management information 
provided to the Board 
and in particular to 
consider the inclusion  
of additional market 
intelligence information
The format and content of the information 
received from the Group’s businesses has 
been reviewed, with an increased focus  
on market overview information, including 
competitor information.
Outputs of the evaluation
Overall, the Board was satisfied with its performance, and agreed 
that the Chairman and the senior non-executive Director continued  
to be very effective.
In order to continue and further enhance the Board’s effectiveness, 
the following areas were designated as the subject of management 
focus during 2016:
• the composition, expertise and diversity of the Board;
• succession planning for the executive Directors and senior 
management and the Board’s visibility of potential successors 
within the Group; and
• risk management and internal control and, in particular, the 
embedding of a culture of effective risk management across  
the Group.
It was further recognised that cyber risk was an increasing area  
of concern and would be focused on in 2016. 
In accordance with the provisions of the Code, it is anticipated that 
externally-facilitated Board evaluations will be carried out at least 
once every three years. The scope for each evaluation is designed  
to build upon learning gained in the previous year to ensure that the 
recommendations agreed in the evaluations are implemented and 
that year-on-year progress is measured and reported upon. 
Annual re-election of Directors
Pursuant to the Company’s Articles of Association and in 
accordance with the provisions of the Code, all of the Directors 
stood for re-election at the 2015 Annual General Meeting. With the 
exception of Perry Crosthwaite, who will be retiring from office with 
effect from the conclusion of the meeting, all current Directors of  
the Company will be standing for re-election by shareholders at this 
year’s Annual General Meeting.
Following performance evaluations of each of the Directors  
and having carefully considered the commitments required and  
the contributions made by each Director, the Chairman is of the  
opinion that each Director’s performance continues to be effective 
and continues to demonstrate commitment to the role. Similarly, 
following performance evaluations of the Chairman and having 
carefully considered the commitments required and the 
contributions made by the Chairman, the non-executive Directors, 
led by the senior non-executive Director, are of the opinion that  
the Chairman’s performance continues to be effective and that  
he continues to demonstrate commitment to the role.
Attendance of Directors at meetings
The following table shows the attendance of each of the Directors 
at the scheduled meetings of the Board and its Committees  
held during the year. The quorum necessary for the transaction  
of business by the Board and each of its Committees is two. 
Briefing papers and meeting agendas are provided to each  
Director in advance of each meeting. Decisions are taken by the 
Board in conjunction with the recommendations of its Committees 
and advice from external advisers and senior management as 
appropriate. The representations of any Director who is unable  
to attend a meeting of the Board or a standing Committee are  
duly considered by those Directors in attendance.

Main Principle C: Accountability
Objectives and policy
The objectives of the Directors and senior management are to 
safeguard and increase the value of the business and assets of  
the Group for the benefit of its shareholders. Achievement of their 
objectives requires the development of policies and appropriate 
internal control frameworks to ensure the Group’s resources are 
managed properly and any key risks are identified and mitigated 
where possible.
The Board is ultimately responsible for the development of the 
Group’s overall risk management policies and system of internal 
control frameworks and for reviewing their respective effectiveness, 
while the role of senior management is to implement these policies 
and frameworks across the Group’s business operations. The 
Directors recognise that the systems and processes established  
by the Board are designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the 
risk of failing to achieve business objectives and cannot provide 
absolute assurance against material financial misstatement or loss.

Annual Report 2015
Governance The Board is committed to satisfying the internal control guidance 
for Directors set out in the FRC’s Guidance on Risk Management, 
Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting.  
In accordance with this guidance, the Board assumes ultimate 
responsibility for risk management and internal controls, including 
determining the nature and extent of the principal risks it is willing  
to take to achieve its strategic objectives (its “risk appetite”) and 
ensuring an appropriate culture has been embedded throughout 
the organisation. The establishment of a revised risk management 
and internal control system has been complemented by ongoing 
monitoring and review, to ensure the Company is able to adapt  
to an evolving risk environment. 
A separate Audit Committee Report is set out on pages 58 to 61 
and provides details of the role and activities of the Committee and 
its relationship with the internal and external auditors.
Managing and controlling risk
Since 2014, the Group’s approach to risk management has been 
reviewed and enhanced. The systems, processes and controls  
in place accord with the Code and the FRC’s updated guidance. 
Details on the Group’s risk management strategy are set out on 
pages 28 and 29.
Further information regarding the Group’s financial risk objectives  
and policies can be found in the Finance Director’s review on pages 
20 to 26. A summary of the principal risks and uncertainties that 
could impact upon the Group’s performance is set out on pages  
30 to 35.
Internal financial controls and reporting
The Group has a comprehensive system for assessing the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls, including strategic 
business planning and regular monitoring and reporting of financial 
performance. A detailed annual budget is prepared by senior 
management and thereafter is reviewed and formally adopted  
by the Board. 
The budget and other targets are regularly updated via a rolling 
forecast process and regular business review meetings are held  
with the involvement of senior management to assess performance.  
The results of these reviews are in turn reported to and discussed  
by the Board at each meeting. As discussed in the Audit Committee 
Report on page 61, the Group engages BM Howarth as internal 
auditor. A total of 22 internal audit visits, covering 44.4% of Group 
turnover, were completed during 2015. It is intended that all 
remaining Brush sites not visited in 2015 shall be visited in 2016.
The Directors are pleased to report that there were no material 
deficiencies and that the majority of the recommendations 
presented in the internal audit reports have now been, or are  
in the process of being, implemented. 
The Board confirms that, from the review of internal controls, it  
has not determined any significant failings or weaknesses that it 
considers to require remedial action. The Board also confirms that  
it has not been advised of any material weaknesses in the internal 
control systems that relate to financial reporting. 
The Audit Committee also monitors the effectiveness of the internal 
control process implemented across the Group through a review  
of the key findings presented by the external and internal auditors. 
Management is responsible for ensuring that the Audit Committee’s 
recommendations in respect of internal controls and risk 
management are implemented.
Compliance and ethics
The Company takes very seriously its responsibilities under the 
laws and regulations in the countries and jurisdictions in which the 
Group operates and has in place appropriate measures to ensure 
compliance. A compliance framework is in place comprising  
a suite of policies governing anti-bribery and anti-corruption, 
anti-money laundering, competition, trade compliance, data 
privacy, whistleblowing, document retention and joint ventures. 
These policies are in place within each business and apply  
to all directors, employees (whether permanent, fixed-term,  
or temporary), pension trustees, consultants and other business 
advisers, contractors, trainees, volunteers, business agents, 
distributors, joint venture partners or any other person working  
for or performing a service on behalf of the Company, its 
subsidiaries and/or associated companies in which the Company  
or any of its subsidiaries has a majority interest. 
In addition, in conjunction with their internal audit function,  
BM Howarth conduct compliance audits across the Group and its 
businesses to identify any areas for improvement. Furthermore, an 
anti-bribery and anti-corruption assurance exercise is undertaken 
by the Group on an annual basis.
During 2015, the Company implemented an externally-hosted 
whistleblowing hotline across the Group, together with a roll-out  
of a Group-wide online compliance training platform, covering 
topics such as antitrust, trade compliance and export controls, data 
privacy, anti-bribery and anti-corruption and anti-money laundering. 
Between its launch in November 2015 and 31 December 2015, 
7 ,159 modules of the training platform were completed by 
employees of the Group. 
Main Principle D: Remuneration
Details regarding Directors’ remuneration, both generally and in  
relation to the requirements of the Code, are set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report, which is presented in the following three 
sections:
• the annual statement from the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee, which can be found on pages 64 to 67; 
• the Annual Report on Remuneration, which can be found on 
pages 68 to 76; and
• the Directors’ remuneration policy, which can be found on pages 
76 to 81.
Main Principle E: Relations with shareholders
Through regular meetings and presentations between the executive 
Directors, analysts and institutional shareholders, including those 
following the announcements of the Company’s annual and interim 
results, the Company seeks to build on a mutual understanding  
of objectives with its shareholders. The non-executive Directors  
are available to meet institutional shareholders should there be 
unresolved matters shareholders wish to bring to their attention. 
The views of key analysts and shareholders are generally reported 
to the Board directly by individual Directors or via the Company’s 
brokers. This helps to ensure that all members of the Board 
develop an understanding of the views and any concerns of 
shareholders.
The Board welcomes the attendance of shareholders at the  
Annual General Meeting, the notice for which can be found  
on pages 144 to 149. The Annual General Meeting provides all 
shareholders with the opportunity to attend and vote on the matters 
put to shareholders, either in person or by proxy. The results of  
the voting on each of the resolutions proposed will be announced 
shortly after the Annual General Meeting has concluded, via the 
Melrose corporate website at www.melroseplc.net
Governance

Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015 • reviewing and considering the Annual Report and financial
statements to ensure that it is fair, balanced and understandable
and advising the Board on whether it can state that this is the case.
Composition 
Each member of the Committee is deemed to be independent by 
the Company and brings recent and relevant financial experience 
from senior executive and non-executive positions as described  
in their biographies on pages 48 and 49. 
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee. 
The Committee invites the Group Finance Director, the Head of 
Financial Reporting and senior representatives of the external  
and internal auditors to attend meetings where appropriate to the 
business being considered. The Committee has the right to invite 
any other Directors and/or employees to attend meetings where 
this is considered appropriate. In addition, the Committee meets  
at least once per year with both the external and internal auditors 
without management present. 
Summary of meetings in the year
The Committee is expected to meet not less than three times  
a year. In 2015, the Committee met in March, July and November. 
The scheduling of these meetings is designed to be aligned with 
the financial reporting timetable, thereby enabling the Committee  
to review the Annual Report and financial statements, the interim 
financial report and the audit plan ahead of the year-end audit  
and to maintain a view of the internal controls and processes 
throughout the year. The release of the interim results was brought 
forward from August to July 2015, to align with the announcement 
relating to the sale of the Elster businesses.
The attendance of its members at these meetings is shown in 
the table opposite. 
Significant issues related to the financial statements 
In discharging its duties under its terms of reference, the Committee 
undertook the following recurring activities that receive annual scrutiny: 
• reviewed the Annual Report and financial statements and interim
financial report, including the going concern assumption and the
assessment forming the basis of the longer-term viability statement.
As part of this review the Committee received reports from
the external auditor on their audit of the Annual Report and
financial statements and their review of the interim financial report;
• considered the processes in place to generate forecasts of
cash flows and accounting valuation information, including the
reasonableness and consistent use of assumptions;
• reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management
and internal controls and disclosures made in the Annual Report
and financial statements on this matter;
• considered the Annual Report and financial statements in the
context of being fair, balanced and understandable and reviewed
the content of a paper prepared by management with regard
to this principle in relation to the 2015 Annual Report and financial
statements. The Committee advised the Board that, in its view,
the 2015 Annual Report and financial statements when taken
as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s
performance, business model and strategy; and
• reviewed and agreed the scope of the audit work to be
undertaken by the internal auditor and the external auditor.
Role and responsibilities 
The Committee’s role and responsibilities are set out in its terms  
of reference. These were updated in December 2015 in line with 
best practice and are available on the Company’s website and  
from the Company Secretary at the Company’s registered office.  
In discharging its duties, the Committee embraces its role of protecting 
the interests of shareholders with respect to the integrity of financial 
information published by the Company and the effectiveness of the 
audit. Specifically, the Committee is responsible for: 
• reviewing and monitoring the integrity of the financial statements
of the Group, including the Annual Report and interim report;
• keeping under review the effectiveness of the Group’s financial
reporting, risk management and internal control systems and
compliance controls;
• monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the internal audit
function;
• reviewing and challenging the going concern assumption and the
assessment forming the basis of the longer-term viability statement;
• focusing and challenging the consistency of accounting policies,
methods used to account for significant or unusual transactions
and compliance with accounting standards;
• reviewing the Group’s arrangements for its employees to raise
concerns in confidence about possible wrongdoing in financial
reporting, in accordance with the Company’s whistleblowing policy;
• developing, implementing and monitoring the Group’s policy on
external audit and for overseeing the objectivity and effectiveness
of the auditor; and

Governance In addition to these matters, the Committee considered the following significant issues in relation to the financial statements during the year:
The Audit Committee’s activities during 2015
Significant issue considered by the Audit Committee How the issue was addressed by the Audit Committee
Impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and  
other fixed assets
The judgements in relation to goodwill impairment testing 
relate to the assumptions applied in calculating the value in  
use of the cash-generating units being tested for impairment. 
The key assumptions applied in the calculation relate to the 
future performance expectations of the cash-generating units. 
The Committee has also considered the related disclosures 
within the financial statements.
(Refer to notes 3 and 12)
Budget plans prepared by management, which support the future performance 
expectations used in the calculation, were approved by the executive Directors.  
The Committee challenged the outcome of the impairment review performed by 
management.
The impairment review was also an area of focus for the external auditor,  
who reported their findings to the Committee.
The Committee considered management’s approach, the assumptions applied  
in relation to the impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and other fixed assets  
and related disclosures and, having taken input from the external auditor, agreed 
with management’s impairment assessment.
Provisions for legal and environmental claims and 
other provisions
The level of provisioning for legal and environmental claims 
and other provisions requires significant judgement. 
Although provisions are reviewed on a regular basis  
and adjusted for management’s best current estimates,  
the judgemental nature of these items means that future 
amounts settled may be different from those provided.
(Refer to notes 3 and 20)
The Committee considered management’s proposed provisioning in respect  
of these legal and environmental claims and other provisions including the key 
judgements made and relevant legal advice.
The external auditor also reported on all material provisions to the Committee.
Having considered the matter and sought guidance from the external auditor,  
the Committee concluded that management’s proposed provisioning and the 
associated disclosures in the Annual Report were appropriate.
Classification of exceptional items 
The reporting, classification and consistency of exceptional 
items, specifically restructuring, were an area of continued 
focus for the Committee.
(Refer to note 6)
The Committee considered the nature, classification and consistency of exceptional 
items. These items were detailed in the external auditor’s paper to the Committee. 
The Committee considered this issue and concluded that these exceptional items 
were appropriately captured and disclosed.
Disposal of Elster
The Company’s accounting treatment of the disposal  
of the Elster net assets and the disposal of the FKI UK  
and McKechnie UK defined benefit pension plans. 
The Company’s accounting treatment of the divestment of the Elster Group and  
the FKI UK and McKechnie UK defined benefit pension plans was examined by  
the Committee.
The Committee considered management’s approach and, having taken input from  
the external auditor, agreed that it was appropriate.
Taxation risks and recognition of deferred tax assets
Judgement is required in determining the Group’s income 
statement tax charge and its provision for income taxes 
including estimating tax provisions where additional current  
tax may become payable in the future following the audit by 
the tax authorities of previously filed tax returns. Judgement  
is also required as to whether a deferred tax asset should be 
recognised based on the availability of future taxable profits. 
(Refer to notes 3, 8 and 21)
Management’s taxation judgements, accounting treatment and the appropriateness 
of tax disclosures have been reviewed by the Committee. 
The Committee reviewed the tax implications of corporate transactions undertaken 
during the year. The tax risks and provisions, particularly those relating to audits  
by non-UK tax authorities, were also examined. The Committee also reviewed  
the Group’s recognised UK deferred tax asset and the key judgements which 
underpinned this.
Having taken input from the external auditor, the Committee agreed with 
management’s proposed treatment of tax risks and deferred tax assets.
External auditor rotation
The Group is required to comply with developing regulatory 
requirements in respect of external auditor rotation.
As noted below, the external auditor is required to rotate  
the audit signing partner every five years.
The Committee considered a paper which highlighted the developing regulatory and 
governance framework, the expected timeline and relevant impact on the Group. 
A new audit signing partner took office following the conclusion of the audit process 
in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2014.
Non-audit fees
Under new EU and Competition Commission rules, effective 
from 17 June 2016, new restrictions on non-audit services 
will apply.
The Committee received an update on the latest guidance on the new rules governing 
the provision of non-audit services and considered the impact on the Group. 
A policy on the engagement of the external auditor for the supply of non-audit services 
is in place and, in line with best practice, is subject to regular review. The Committee 
closely monitors the non-audit services provided by the incumbent external auditor  
to ensure that these are appropriate.

Annual Report 2015 The Audit Committee’s activities during 2015
Significant issue considered by the Audit Committee How the issue was addressed by the Audit Committee
Risk management and internal control 
Monitored the risk management and the internal control 
systems and conducted a review of their effectiveness.
The Committee received updates during the year from senior management on the 
Company’s risk management framework and internal control systems. 
The Committee also received a presentation from senior management on the risk 
management framework and on the financial, operational and compliance controls in 
place. The Committee considered the risk management and internal control systems 
and concluded that they were effective and reported this to the Board. 
Going concern and viability 
Assessment of the going concern assumptions and the  
basis of the viability statement.
The Committee reviewed and supported management’s recommendation to 
prepare accounts on a going concern basis. 
The Committee also considered papers prepared by management detailing the 
qualifications, assumptions, scenario modelling, sensitivity analysis and judgements 
which underpinned the longer-term viability statement to be included in the 2015 
Annual Report. The Committee concurred with the assumptions and judgements 
made by management and concluded that the longer-term viability statement  
was appropriate.
Risk management and internal control 
During 2015, the Committee monitored the effectiveness of the 
Group’s risk management and internal control systems through 
regular updates from management and a review of the key findings 
presented by the external and internal auditors. 
In accordance with provision C.2.3 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Board instructed the Committee to 
undertake a review of the effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control systems, covering all material 
controls including financial, operational and compliance controls. 
This review took the form of management presentations followed  
by a Committee discussion. The Company Secretary briefed the 
Committee on the key elements of the Melrose risk management 
framework including an updated risk strategy, a best practice  
risk register with risk mapping and profiling application, an 
education and training programme and an audit and assurance 
process. Management then reported on the Group’s internal  
control systems. Samples of both Group and business unit 
controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls, 
were presented and examined. The Group’s risk management  
and internal control systems were reviewed and the Committee 
concluded that these systems were effective. The Committee 
reported its conclusions to the Board at the next scheduled  
Board meeting. 
External audit 
Appointment, re-appointment and assessment  
of effectiveness 
The Committee reviews and makes recommendations with regard 
to the re-appointment of the external auditor. In making these 
recommendations, the Committee considers auditor effectiveness 
and independence, partner rotation and any other factors which 
may impact the external auditor’s re-appointment. 
The external auditor is required to rotate the audit signing partner 
every five years. The Group’s audit signing partner changed as part 
of that rotation process in 2015 following the conclusion of the audit 
process in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2014. 
The Committee has reviewed the external auditor’s performance 
and effectiveness. For 2015, the chairman of the Committee 
worked with the Company Secretary to develop a series of 
questions covering the key areas of the audit process that the 
Committee is expected to have an opinion over, including: 
• the calibre, continuity, experience, resources and technical and 
industry knowledge of the engagement partner and of the wider 
external audit team; 
• the planning and execution of the audit process; 
• the quality and timeliness of communications from the external 
auditor; 
• the quality of support provided to the Committee by the external 
audit partner; 
• the degree to which the external auditor and the audit process 
has contributed to improvements in financial reporting to 
Melrose’s shareholders; and 
• the external auditor’s independence and objectivity. 
The Committee, along with relevant members of the management 
team, were requested to complete a questionnaire containing  
these questions. The Company Secretary subsequently produced 
a report summarising the responses. Based on this report, the 
Committee concluded that the quality of the external audit team 
remains very high, the external audit process is operating effectively 
and Deloitte LLP continues to prove effective in its role as external 
auditor. 
As detailed on the following page, the Committee regularly monitors 
the objectivity and independence of the external auditor. Deloitte 
LLP was appointed in 2003 when the Company commenced 
trading and the external audit has not been formally tendered  
since then. The Committee is satisfied that the effectiveness and 
independence of the external auditor is not impaired in any way. 
There are no legal or contractual obligations that restrict the 
Group’s capacity to recommend a particular firm for appointment 
as auditor and therefore a resolution proposing the re-appointment 
of Deloitte LLP as external auditor will be put to the shareholders  
at the 2016 Annual General Meeting.
Audit Committee Report continued

Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015
Governance Audit tendering 
The Committee has considered the audit tendering provisions 
outlined in the UK Corporate Governance Code. The Committee 
has also reviewed the guidance provided by the European 
Commission and the Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”).  
It is the Committee’s understanding that under the CMA and  
the EU rules rotation of the external audit firm is required by 2024.  
It is the Committee’s intention to put the external audit out to  
tender in accordance with the CMA and the EU timeframes.
The current audit engagement partner was appointed in 2015  
and is not due to rotate until the year ending 31 December 2019. 
The Committee remains satisfied with the quality, integrity and the 
effectiveness of the work undertaken by Deloitte LLP on behalf of 
the Melrose shareholders. Accordingly, it is not proposed to put the 
audit out to tender at the present time but the matter will be kept 
under review. 
Non-audit services 
Under new EU and Competition Commission rules, effective from 
17 June 2016, new restrictions on non-audit services will apply, 
which will cap the level of permissable non-audit services awarded 
to the external auditor at 70% of the average audit fee for the 
previous three years. It is the Committee’s understanding that  
the cap applies prospectively and so will first apply in respect  
of the Company’s 2020 financial year.
A policy on the engagement of the external auditor for the  
supply of non-audit services is in place to ensure that the provision 
of non-audit services does not impair the external auditor’s 
independence or objectivity. In accordance with best practice  
FRC guidelines, the Company policy in relation to non-audit 
services is kept under regular review (it was re-examined during 
2014). The policy outlines which non-audit services are pre-
approved (being those which are routine in nature, with a fee that  
is not significant in the context of the audit or audit-related services), 
which services require the prior approval of the Committee and 
which services the auditor is excluded from providing. The general 
principle is that the audit firm should not be requested to carry out 
non-audit services on any activity of the Company where the  
audit firm may, in the future, be required to give an audit opinion. 
During 2015, the main non-audit services provided by Deloitte LLP 
were in relation to the Group’s disposal of Elster, the introduction  
of the new Melrose Group holding company, taxation advice, 
compliance and planning services. 
An analysis of the fees earned by the external auditors for audit  
and non-audit services can be found in note 7 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
Auditor objectivity and independence 
The Committee carries out regular reviews to ensure that auditor 
objectivity and independence is maintained at all times. A different 
senior partner oversees the taxation audit of the Company 
compared to those working on the non-audit taxation services. 
No fees were paid to Deloitte LLP on a contingent basis. Based  
on these strict procedures, the Committee remains confident that 
auditor objectivity and independence have been maintained but 
accepts that non-audit work should be controlled to ensure that  
it does not compromise the auditor’s position. 
At each year end, Deloitte LLP submits a letter setting out how  
it believes its independence and objectivity have been maintained.  
As noted above, Deloitte LLP is also required to rotate the audit 
partner responsible for the Group audit every five years and 
significant subsidiary audits every seven years. 
Internal audit 
Due to the size and complexity of the Group, it is appropriate  
for an internal audit programme to be used within the business. 
BM Howarth, an external firm, provides internal audit services  
to the Group. A rotation programme is in place, such that every 
business unit will have an internal audit at least once every three 
years, with the largest sites being reviewed at least once every  
two years. The rotation programme allows divisional management’s 
actions and responses to be followed up on a timely basis. The 
internal audit programme of planned visits is discussed and agreed 
with the Committee during the year. 
The internal auditor’s remit includes assessment of the 
effectiveness of internal control systems, compliance with the 
Group’s Policies and Procedures Manual and a review of the 
businesses’ Balance Sheets. A report of key findings and 
recommendations is presented to the Group Finance Director and 
the Head of Financial Reporting, followed by a meeting to discuss 
these key findings and to agree on resulting actions. 
A review of the internal audit process and scope of work covered 
by the internal auditor is the responsibility of the Committee,  
to ensure their objectives, level of authority and resources  
are appropriate for the nature of the businesses under review.  
A report of significant findings is presented by the internal auditor  
to the Committee at each meeting and implementation of 
recommendations by the Board is followed up at the subsequent 
Committee meeting. The Committee also reviews BM Howarth’s 
performance against the agreed internal audit programme.

Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015
Governance Composition
In compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the 
majority of the members of the Committee were independent 
non-executive Directors throughout 2015. The Committee  
was chaired by Liz Hewitt. Perry Crosthwaite, John Grant and  
Justin Dowley also served on the Committee throughout the year. 
Christopher Miller, Executive Chairman of the Board, was also  
a member of the Committee throughout the year.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee. 
On occasion, the Committee invites the Chief Executive, the 
Executive Vice-Chairman and the Group Finance Director to  
attend discussions where their input is required. 
Diversity
Melrose is a meritocracy and individual performance is the key 
determinant in any appointment, irrespective of ethnicity, gender  
or other characteristic, trait or orientation. The Board recognises  
the importance of diversity throughout the workforce, be it 
geographical, cultural or market-aligned and encompassing gender, 
race, sexual orientation and disability, and the Board is committed 
to equality of opportunity for all employees. For example, Melrose is 
proud to support the Business Disability Forum, a body committed 
to understanding the changes required in the workplace so that 
disabled people are treated fairly and they can contribute to 
business success, to society and to economic growth. 
The Committee currently takes into account a variety of factors 
before recommending any new appointments to the Board, 
including relevant skills to perform the role, experience and 
knowledge. The most important priority of the Committee, however, 
has been and will continue to be ensuring that the best candidate  
is selected to join the Board and this approach will remain in place 
going forward.
The Committee will endeavour to pursue diversity, including  
gender diversity, throughout the Melrose Group and notes the 
recommendations of Lord Davies’ review, “Women on Boards”. 
However, given the Company’s strategic business model and the 
frequent turnover of businesses, the Committee does not think  
that setting and committing to specific diversity targets in relation  
to the composition of the Board, and the workforce in the wider 
businesses within the Group, is correct for Melrose.
What the Committee did in 2015
The principal focus of the Committee during 2015 has been to 
consider the items set out below:
• The Committee considered the composition and balance of
the Board and the timing of future Board changes and reviewed
the succession plans in place in respect of executive Directors
and non-executive Directors in conjunction with the provisions of
the UK Corporate Governance Code. In particular, it was agreed
that an additional non-executive Director would be required to
replace Perry Crosthwaite who, having served more than three,
three-year terms as a non-executive Director, would stand down
from the Board following the conclusion of the 2016 AGM. The
recruitment process is underway and an executive search and
selection specialist has been appointed to assist the Committee.
An appointment is expected to be made during 2016;
• The existing time commitment of the Company’s non-executive
Directors was reviewed and confirmed as appropriate;
• The Committee membership was reviewed and a
recommendation made to the Board that, subject to the
appointment of a new non-executive Director, no changes
would be required to be made in 2016;
• Consideration was given to the re-appointment of the Directors
before making a recommendation to the Board regarding
each Director’s re-election at the 2016 AGM, with the exception
of Perry Crosthwaite, who will be retiring from office at the
conclusion of the 2016 AGM;
• A review of the leadership requirements of Melrose, both
executive and non-executive, was undertaken and this confirmed
that the existing management team is appropriate for the Group.
This review also demonstrated that appropriate and effective
leadership is in place within the businesses and that processes
are in place to ensure that performance is reviewed regularly
against operational and financial criteria;
• The Committee examined the career planning and talent
management programmes in operation across the Group
and concluded that these were appropriate for the needs
of the business;
• The Committee reviewed and re-affirmed the principles
underlying the Company’s diversity policy; and
• The Committee’s terms of reference were reviewed during
the year and it was determined that these were in line with
best practice.

Annual Report 2015 Dear Shareholder, 
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present our report on 
Directors’ remuneration at the end of yet another highly successful 
year, the highlight of which has been the sale of Elster to Honeywell 
International Inc. (“Honeywell”). The Directors’ Remuneration  
Report sets out the amounts earned in respect of the year ended 
31 December 2015 and the remuneration policy for the Directors  
of Melrose. 
The Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year ended 
31 December 2015 is presented in two sections: the Annual  
Report on Remuneration and the Directors’ remuneration policy. 
The Annual Report on Remuneration provides details on the 
amounts earned in respect of the year ended 31 December 2015 
and will be subject to an advisory vote at the AGM to be held on 
11 May 2016. 
The existing Directors’ remuneration policy was approved by 
shareholders at the 2014 AGM and took binding effect from  
the conclusion of that meeting. The approval of the Directors’ 
remuneration policy is normally valid for three years, provided the 
Company does not intend to make changes to the policy within  
this period, and therefore shareholder approval of the policy would 
not normally be required until the AGM in 2017 . 
However, due to the introduction of a new holding company  
for the Group in November 2015, the Company is required  
to seek shareholder approval for the Directors’ remuneration  
policy in respect of the new holding company at the 2016 AGM.  
It is important to note that no changes have been made to  
the remuneration policy being put to shareholders; it is wholly 
consistent with the remuneration policy approved in 2014. It  
should be noted that the 2012 Incentive Plan, which is a legacy 
arrangement, no longer forms part of the forward-looking policy  
as explained below. We have also formally incorporated within  
the policy the clawback arrangements which have applied in 
respect of the annual bonus for 2015 and future years, as referred 
to in the 2014 Directors’ Remuneration Report. The Directors’ 
remuneration policy sets out the forward-looking remuneration 
policy that will be subject to a binding vote at the AGM and shall 
take binding effect from the conclusion of that meeting. 
A key element of the Melrose remuneration framework is the “2012 
Incentive Plan”, the Company’s long-term incentive arrangement, 
which was approved by special resolution of shareholders at  
a general meeting held in April 2012. As no more awards will be 
granted to executive Directors under the 2012 Incentive Plan, it is  
not included in our forward-looking Directors’ remuneration policy. 
The existing options (set out on page 73) will continue in accordance 
with their terms. In the interests of transparency, we have set out on 
The Board has delegated to the 
Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”) 
responsibility for overseeing the remuneration 
of the Company’s Directors, Company 
Secretary and other senior employees.

over the period from the start of the 2012 Incentive Plan in March 
2012 might translate into value earned by participants in that plan. 
Performance in 2015
2015 was another very strong year for Melrose and marked another 
milestone in our “buy, improve, sell” strategy:
• In December 2015, we completed the sale of the Elster business 
to Honeywell for cash consideration of £3.3 billion, being a 
multiple of 3.1 times 2014 revenue and 14.3 times 2014 headline
(1)
 
EBITDA
(2)
.
• Melrose generated a return of 2.3 times equity investment and  
a 33% equity rate of return per annum in the three years since  
it acquired Elster for an enterprise value of £1.8 billion.
• In addition, Honeywell assumed all Elster-related pension 
obligations as well as the Group’s FKI UK and McKechnie  
UK defined benefit plans, which had combined gross liabilities  
of £849 million and a net accounting deficit of £112 million at  
the date of disposal.
• In accordance with our strategy, the Board returned £2.4 billion of 
the disposal proceeds to shareholders, equivalent to 240 pence 
per ordinary share. 
• Since flotation on AIM in 2003, Melrose has raised approximately 
£2.0 billion from shareholders, provided a total shareholder return 
of 574% (as at 2 March 2016, compared to 144% for the FTSE 
350), created net shareholder value of £2.8 billion, including 
shareholders’ existing investment in Melrose, and following  
the recent Return of Capital, returned in cash approximately 
£4.3 billion to shareholders. 
It is with this performance in mind, and in line with Melrose’s 
remuneration philosophy of pay for performance, that the Committee 
has taken its decisions in respect of executive Directors’ 
remuneration arrangements for 2015 and 2016.
Our remuneration structure for executive 
Directors
Melrose’s remuneration philosophy is that executive remuneration 
should be simple and transparent, support the delivery of the 
business strategy and pay for performance. This philosophy is 
reflected in our remuneration structure. 
The Committee feels strongly that rewards should be linked to 
generation and delivery of real returns to shareholders.
• Base salary: Base salaries are paid in line with a market-
competitive range compared with companies of similar size and 
complexity. Since flotation in 2003, all current executive Directors 
have received the same annual increases to base salary. In the 
last six years these increases have averaged 3%.
• Pension: Pension contributions/salary supplements for executive 
Directors are payable at the level of 15% of base salary, which  
is considered modest for a business of the size and complexity  
of Melrose. No executive Director participates in, or has ever 
participated in, any Group defined benefit pension scheme.
(1) Before exceptional costs, exceptional income and intangible asset amortisation.

 operating profit before depreciation and amortisation of computer software  
and development costs.
• Annual bonus: The maximum bonus payable is set at 100%  
of base salary. All Directors who participate in the annual bonus 
scheme receive the same percentage bonus. In the last six years, 
the average percentage of base salary payable has been 84%. 
The maximum opportunity is deliberately positioned below the 
median maximum opportunity for FTSE 250 companies and  
is a percentage of salaries that are paid in line with the market 
competitive range compared with companies of similar size  
and complexity.
• Long-term incentives: The only long-term incentive 
arrangement in which the executive Directors participate is the 
2012 Incentive Plan which was approved by shareholders by 
special resolution at a general meeting held on 11 April 2012. 
Entitlements under the 2012 Incentive Plan were awarded in April 
2012. Any payment made will be dependent upon shareholder 
value generated over a five-year time period.
Rather than successive one-year long-term incentive arrangements, 
we believe that a five-year arrangement is preferable, given that  
it is closer to a typical ownership cycle for an acquired business.  
By its nature, this means that any payment under the Group’s 
long-term incentive arrangements is only made once every five 
years and so the payment in that fifth year should not be regarded 
as an annual payment.
The long-term incentive arrangements are intended to directly  
align our executive Directors’ incentive arrangements with the 
interests of shareholders by linking remuneration specifically  
to shareholder value. The structure of the 2012 Incentive Plan  
is designed to ensure that, whilst shareholder investment exceeds 
returns, only once shareholder value has achieved compound 
annual growth in excess of the Retail Prices Index (“RPI”) + 2% 
does the 2012 Incentive Plan have any value at all. This means that, 
whilst shareholder investment exceeds returns, the 2012 Incentive 
Plan has a minimum growth requirement (effectively a charge) 
which requires the net invested capital to be inflated by RPI + 2% 
per annum. Equally, if and so long as shareholder returns exceed 
shareholder investment, the net shareholder returns are treated as 
increased by the RPI + 2% per annum amount. The value payable 
to management under the 2012 Incentive Plan comprises 7 .5% of 
value created in excess of these amounts. The 2012 Incentive Plan 
is then paid out to participants in predetermined proportions, either 
in ordinary shares or (and only in certain circumstances which are 
within the complete control of the Remuneration Committee) as a 
cash dividend, with the total being equal in value to 7 .5% (reduced 
from 10% in the equivalent 2009 plan) of the increase in shareholder 
value in excess of the minimum growth requirement from the date 
of grant to 31 May 2017 . The formula by which growth is calculated, 
as set out in the Company’s articles of association, takes account 
of every change to the capital structure and dividend payment.

Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015 We have included on pages 68 to 70 further information in relation 
to the 2012 Incentive Plan, including an illustration of how any 
increase in value would be shared between shareholders and 
participants in the plan.
The Remuneration Committee strongly believes that this simple  
and transparent incentive framework is aligned with the Company’s 
strategy for growth. We believe that this remuneration strategy  
has also directly driven historical outperformance when compared 
with our competitors, supported the Company’s success and has 
led to increased shareholder value. In this regard, our remuneration 
arrangements are tailored to the culture and strategy of the 
Company and provide a strong platform for the ongoing long-term 
success of the Company.
Together with their own purchases of shares, the remuneration 
policy has also enabled the executive Directors to build up and 
retain significant shareholdings in the Company. As at 31 December 
2015, the Chairman and Chief Executive held 92 and 50 times  
their base salary, respectively, in Melrose shares. The table below 
shows the number of ordinary shares held by the executive 
Directors as at 31 December 2015 and the value of each executive 
Director’s shareholding at that date as a multiple of their 2015 base 
salary. None of the executive Directors have sold any shares in the 
Company within the last five years. Further details on Directors’ 
shareholdings are given on pages 72 and 73.

with Christopher Miller within the meaning of section 252 of the Companies Act 2006.
As noted on page 73, internal Company rules on shareholdings  
are extended to senior Melrose management in addition to  
the executive Directors in order that appropriate remuneration 
principles are applied to senior management on a similar basis  
to executive Directors. 
Our remuneration structure for non-executive 
Directors
A simple remuneration structure is applied for the non-executive 
Directors. Non-executive Directors are paid fees to reflect market 
conditions and to attract individuals with appropriate knowledge 
and expertise. Fees for non-executive Directors are determined  
by the executive Directors and non-executive Directors do not 
participate in the Company’s pension arrangements, the annual 
bonus or long-term incentive arrangements. 
2015 key decisions and incentive pay-outs
The Remuneration Committee remains committed to a responsible 
approach to executive pay. As described in the Strategic Report 
section of this Annual Report, the Company had a successful year, 
with the disposal of the Elster businesses. The executive Directors’ 
remuneration rewards that performance. 
Annual bonuses for executive Directors are calculated using  
two elements, 80% being based on diluted earnings per share 
growth and 20% based on a strategic element. The maximum 
bonus opportunity is set at 100% of base salary, which is below  
the maximum median annual bonus opportunity for FTSE 250 
companies, and reflects the participation of the Chief Executive  
and Group Finance Director in the 2012 Incentive Plan. 
In line with the Directors’ remuneration policy approved by 
shareholders at the AGM in 2014, the Committee is permitted  
to adjust the formulaic outcome of the annual bonus calculation.  
The Committee has considered whether, in recognition of the 
Group’s exceptional achievements during the year and the value 
delivered to shareholders, such an adjustment should be made. 
However, the Committee has concluded that no such adjustment 
should be made and that the bonus outturn for 2015 should be 
determined on the formulaic basis consistent with previous years.
The earnings growth element of the bonus includes both the 
continuing and the discontinued Melrose businesses. At the date  
of its disposal on 29 December 2015, Elster represented the major 
part of the Group, and excluding its results from the earnings 
calculation would have adversely impacted the earnings element  
of the bonus calculation. The Committee believes that excluding 
Elster’s earnings and thereby penalising the Chief Executive and 
Group Finance Director in an exceptional year, as a consequence  
of an action that has realised considerable shareholder value, is 
inappropriate. The Committee has therefore determined that the 
Elster earnings from 1 January 2015 to 29 December 2015 should 
be included for the purposes of the earnings growth calculation.  
For the strategic element of the annual bonus calculation, the 
Committee set objectives for the year relating to the value that 
could be achieved from the sale of Elster and also the reduction  
in the Group’s pension liabilities. 
Having listened to our investors and a number of corporate 
governance advisers, and in the interests of transparency, 
comprehensive details are included on the objectives and 
deliverables and on how the Remuneration Committee determined 
the level of award under the 2015 annual bonus. The threshold, 
target and maximum performance levels relating to the sale of 
Elster are, however, commercially sensitive and are not reported. 
Further detail on the determination of the annual award is set out  
on page 77 .
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued

Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015
Governance In line with increases in previous years, an increase of 3%  
was made to the executive Directors’ salaries with effect from 
1 January 2015. This is consistent with the salary rises awarded  
to the wider head office population. Non-executive Directors’ basic 
fees increased by 3% with effect from January 2015. However,  
the additional fees payable to the committee chairmen and the 
senior non-executive Director (which had been subject to market 
adjustment in 2014 and disclosed in that year’s Directors’ 
Remuneration Report) were left unchanged.
Awards under the 2012 Incentive Plan were made in April 2012  
and are due to crystallise in May 2017 . Accordingly, no executive 
Director received any payout under a long-term incentive plan  
in 2015, including as a result of the sale of Elster.
Business unit long-term incentive plans
Long-term incentive plans are put in place for the leadership of  
the Group’s businesses with payouts based on the performance  
of their respective businesses.
Approach to Directors’ remuneration for 2016
The Directors’ remuneration policy is set out for shareholder 
approval on pages 76 to 81. Details of how the policy will be  
applied in practice for 2016 are set out in the Annual Report  
on Remuneration on pages 68 to 76. 
Executive Directors’ base salaries have been increased by 3%,  
with effect from 1 January 2016, the same as for other head office 
employees, other than where other such employees’ salaries  
have been increased on a different basis to reflect individual 
circumstances such as promotions. Non-executive Directors’  
basic fees for 2016 have also been increased by 3%, with effect 
from 1 January 2016. However, the additional fees payable to the 
committee chairmen and the senior non-executive Director are 
viewed as appropriate and have been left unchanged.
The overall framework for the executive Directors’ annual bonus 
arrangements for 2016 will remain the same as in 2015, with  
a maximum bonus opportunity of 100% of salary, 80% of which  
is based on financial performance metrics and 20% of which  
is based on strategic performance metrics. 
The Remuneration Committee supports the application of malus 
and clawback in respect of the executive Directors’ variable 
remuneration opportunities, having taken into account the views  
of our investors, the corporate governance advisory agencies  
and the recent changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
Annual bonus awards for 2015 and future years will also be subject 
to a clawback arrangement, giving the Remuneration Committee 
the ability to require repayment of some or all of any bonus  
earned in the event of: (1) material misstatement of financial results; 
(2) miscalculation of any performance measure on which the  
bonus earned was calculated; and/or (3) serious misconduct by  
the relevant participant. The Remuneration Committee will have 
discretion to apply clawback at any time up until the Annual General 
Meeting held in the second year following the payment of the  
bonus – for example, clawback may be applied in respect of any 
bonus earned in respect of performance in 2015 at any time up  
until the Annual General Meeting in 2018. As referred to in the 2014 
Directors’ Remuneration Report, clawback of some form will apply 
to the new long-term incentive arrangements which will replace,  
in 2017 , the 2012 Incentive Plan.
Shareholder engagement
We remain committed to maintaining an open and transparent 
engagement with our investors. We believe that a key objective of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report is to communicate clearly how 
much our executive Directors are earning and how this is clearly 
linked to performance. Members of the Remuneration Committee 
are engaged in an ongoing dialogue with corporate governance 
advisory agencies and investors in order to better understand their 
views on Melrose’s approach to executive remuneration.

Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015 Melrose’s remuneration philosophy is that executive remuneration 
should be simple and transparent, support the delivery of the 
business strategy and pay for performance. This philosophy is 
reflected in our remuneration structure, whereby:
• fixed elements of remuneration (salary and pension) are 
positioned in line with the market; 
• annual incentive remuneration (annual bonus) is positioned below 
the median maximum opportunity for FTSE 250 companies; and
• long-term incentive remuneration (the 2012 Incentive Plan) is 
intended to directly align executive Directors’ remuneration with 
that of shareholders by connecting remuneration specifically to 
shareholder value. 
The Remuneration Committee strongly believes that this simple 
and transparent incentive framework is aligned with the Company’s 
strategy for growth and that our remuneration arrangements are 
tailored to the culture and strategy of the Company. 
The Annual Report on Remuneration sets out the amounts 
earned by Directors in 2015 as a result of the application of our 
remuneration philosophy and in accordance with the Directors’ 
remuneration policy approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM, 
and how that philosophy will be applied in 2016.

Governance The 2012 Incentive Plan
In the interests of transparency and to illustrate how the 2012 
Incentive Plan may operate, we have set out on the previous page 
an illustration of how the growth in value of the Company over the 
period from the start of the plan in March 2012 might translate into 
value earned by participants in that plan, calculated in accordance 
with the principles in the Company’s articles of association, but 
assuming a trigger date of 1 January 2016.
It is important to note that this illustration is theoretical only and  
the value derived under the 2012 Incentive Plan will be entirely 
determined by reference to the value that will be delivered to 
shareholders over the period to crystallisation.
The calculation of the growth in value of the Company for  
the purposes of the 2012 Incentive Plan shall be determined in 
accordance with the formula set out in the Company’s articles  
of association. Those articles provide that, whilst shareholder 
investment exceeds returns, the net investment is increased  
by a minimum growth threshold of RPI + 2% per annum.  
Equally, if and so long as shareholder returns exceed shareholder 
investment, the net shareholder returns are treated as increased  
by the RPI + 2% per annum amount. Participants in the plan  
are entitled to 7.5% of the increase in shareholder value after  
taking into account these amounts.
The formula by which growth is calculated, as set out in the 
Company’s articles of association, takes account of every change 
to the capital structure of, and dividend payment by, the Company. 
In this way, the participants will only receive a share of returns  
over and above that adjusted level. 
Structure of the Group
On 6 October 2015, Melrose Industries PLC (since renamed 
Melrose Holdings Limited) (“Old Melrose”) announced its intention 
to implement a corporate reorganisation by way of a Court-
sanctioned scheme of arrangement, pursuant to which a new listed 
holding company, New Melrose Industries PLC (since renamed 
Melrose Industries PLC) (“New Melrose”) was to be introduced  
for the Melrose Group. The shareholders of Old Melrose approved  
the proposed scheme of arrangement on 29 October 2015 and, 
following the Court’s sanction on 18 November 2015, the scheme 
of arrangement became effective on 19 November 2015, when 
New Melrose became the new holding company of Old Melrose 
and its subsidiaries (the “Restructuring”). 
In this Annual Report on Remuneration, unless explicitly stated 
otherwise, references to the “Company” and to “Melrose” are 
references to Old Melrose up to but excluding 19 November 2015, 
and to New Melrose from 19 November 2015 onwards. References

(2)  Under the 2012 Incentive Plan, a maximum of 50,000 options may be awarded to participants. Christopher Miller, David Roper, Simon Peckham and Geoffrey Martin have each been awarded  
8,500 options under the 2012 Incentive Plan, representing 17% individually or 68% in aggregate of the total unvested interests under the plan. Therefore, of the stated theoretical value to 
management, only 68% would be to the benefit of the four executive Directors.
(3)  The number of shares to be issued in accordance with this calculation differs from the diluted number of shares of 20.7 million disclosed in note 11 to the financial statements. The difference 
arises due to the requirements of IAS 33 which stipulate that unrecognised future service costs for long-term incentive plans (calculated in accordance with IFRS 2) should be deducted from  
the calculation of diluted shares for the purposes of earnings per share calculations.
(4)  Theoretical dilution calculated by taking the theoretical total number of new shares issued under the 2012 Incentive Plan as a percentage of the aggregate of the number of issued ordinary 
shares on 31 December 2015 (actual or theoretical, as relevant) and the theoretical total number of new shares issued under the 2012 Incentive Plan.
(5)  Theoretical number of ordinary shares issued on 31 December 2015 assumes the Share Capital Consolidation ratio was calculated using a market price of £2.82505, the average price

(1)  The Company’s long-term incentive arrangement for Directors is the 2012 Incentive Plan. This five-year plan is scheduled to crystallise in 2017 and, accordingly, no value was vested to 
participants in respect of the year to 31 December 2015. 
(2)  Of the £255,330 attributable to pension contributions, £217,830 was paid as a supplement to base salary in lieu of pension arrangements. The balance of £37,500 was paid into the Directors’ 
individual nominated private pension plans.
(3) Includes £5,000 per annum in recognition of the role of senior non-executive Director.

(6) Includes £2,500 per annum in recognition of chairmanship of the Nomination Committee.
The chart below represents how the illustrative calculation of the 
increase in the value of the Company, relevant for the purposes of 
the 2012 Incentive Plan and whilst shareholder investment exceeds 
returns, is shared between participants in the 2012 Incentive Plan 
and the Company’s shareholders.
Share of illustrative increase in value, under the 2012 Incentive 
Plan, if crystallised on 31 December 2015
Based on this illustration, if the entitlements under the 2012 
Incentive Plan were to have been settled in ordinary shares  
of one penny each (being the nominal value of ordinary shares  
on 1 January 2016), this would have resulted in the issue to the 
participants of 22,664,007 ordinary shares (i.e. £64,026,952  
(7 .5% of the illustrative increase in value) divided by £2.82505  
(the average price of an ordinary share for 40 business days prior  
to 31 December 2015)). While it is the Remuneration Committee’s 
intention that entitlements under the 2012 Incentive Plan shall be 
settled in ordinary shares, the entitlements can be settled in 
alternative ways as set out in the Company’s articles of association 
and as referred to in the chairman’s letter to this Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on page 65. In any event, the number  
of ordinary shares issued to satisfy entitlements under the 2012 
Incentive Plan shall not exceed 5% of the aggregate number of 
shares in issue on 22 March 2012 plus 5% of any additional shares 
issued by the Company after that date. 
Malus has applied to awards granted under the 2012 Incentive Plan 
since its inception. The rules of the plan provide for compulsory 
return at nominal value of incentive shares held by bad leavers 
(defined as any person who ceases to be a Director or employee 
other than by reason of death, permanent ill health or disability or  
as a result of a change of control) at the Remuneration Committee’s 
discretion. In addition, the Company’s articles of association 
provide the Remuneration Committee with the discretion to adjust 
the calculation of the amount to which holders of incentive shares 
and options shall be entitled, in certain circumstances.
As part of the Scheme of Arrangement and in accordance with their 
terms, all options over shares in Old Melrose issued pursuant to the 
2012 Incentive Plan were exchanged for like options over shares in 
New Melrose, on substantially the same terms and economic basis 
as the options over shares in Old Melrose. Upon such exchange 
taking effect, the old options lapsed.
No further options over 2012 incentive shares will be granted  
to executive Directors pursuant to the 2012 Incentive Plan. 
Accordingly, this arrangement is not disclosed in the Directors’ 
remuneration policy on pages 76 to 81 as part of the forward-
looking remuneration policy, although, as noted on page 64,  
those options will continue and may be exercised by their holders  
in accordance with their terms. The options over such shares 
currently held by the executive Directors are set out on page 73.

(7)  Includes £1,586 in recognition of chairmanship of the Nomination Committee from the close of the 2014 AGM on 13 May 2014 to 31 December 2014.
Base salary
Salaries are fixed at a level which is in line with a market competitive range compared with companies of similar size and complexity.  
Each executive Director received an increase in base salary of approximately 3% effective from January 2015. 
Benefits
The range of benefits provided to Directors has not changed since the inception of Melrose and there is no intention to widen the range  
of benefits Directors may receive. All of the executive Directors received taxable benefits during 2015, being a company car allowance,  
fuel allowance, private medical insurance, life insurance and group income protection. Geoffrey Martin also received paid train travel to  
and from London. 
Bonus
The maximum bonus opportunity is set below the maximum median annual bonus opportunity for FTSE 250 companies to reflect the 
participation of the executive Directors in the 2012 Incentive Plan. For the year ended 31 December 2015, the maximum bonus opportunity 
was equal to 100% of base salary. Following the application of the formulaic basis used in previous years and as explained in the table  
on page 72 of this report, it was determined by the Remuneration Committee that Simon Peckham and Geoffrey Martin (being the only 
executive Directors participating in the annual bonus plan) should be awarded a bonus of 88% of base salary.

Statement of Directors’ shareholding and share interests 
(audited information)
As disclosed at the time of the crystallisation of the 2009 Incentive 
Plan, the executive Directors considered it appropriate that they, 
together with their immediate families, would hold at least half  
of the shares acquired pursuant to that crystallisation (after making 
adequate provision for any tax liability arising in connection with  
that crystallisation) for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the 
Remuneration Committee has adopted the following guidelines  
in relation to the holding of ordinary shares by executive Directors 
who participated in the 2009 Incentive Plan and who participate  
in the 2012 Incentive Plan, reinforcing the executive Directors’ 
long-term stewardship of the Company and long-term investment  
in the Company’s shares. 
No executive Director may dispose of any ordinary shares  
without the consent of the Remuneration Committee, which will  
not normally be withheld provided the executive Director holds  
at least the “minimum number” of ordinary shares referred to  
in the table opposite.

(1)  The minimum number of ordinary shares to be held by the executive Directors has been 
adjusted pursuant to the returns of capital and the associated share capital consolidations  
in February 2014, February 2015 and January 2016, effective as of 28 January 2016. 
Accordingly, as of 28 January 2016, the minimum number of ordinary shares to be held  
by Christopher Miller is 200,492, for David Roper the minimum number is 189,034, for  
Simon Peckham the minimum number is 209,100 and for Geoffrey Martin the minimum 
number is 120,841.
(2)  As at 31 December 2015, the interest of Christopher Miller included 5,311,426 ordinary 
shares held by Harris & Sheldon Investments Limited, a company which is connected  
with Christopher Miller within the meaning of section 252 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Immediately following the Share Capital Consolidation, Harris & Sheldon Investments 
Limited held 774,582 ordinary shares in the Company.
(3)  For these purposes, the value of a share is 290.9 pence, being the closing mid-market  
price on 31 December 2015.
As at 31 December 2015, each executive Director held significantly 
more than the minimum number of ordinary shares and so satisfied 
the guidelines.

operations and the large profit from the disposal of Elster is included in the earnings per share calculation from continuing and discontinued operations. These calculations are set out in the 
Consolidated Income Statement on page 90 of this Annual Report and financial statements. For the purposes of the annual bonus, the Remuneration Committee determined it to be inequitable 
to exclude recognition for the trading results of Elster over the year in determining performance and, as such, earnings per share have been adjusted to include the trading results  
of Elster to 29 December 2015.
(2) Monetary targets are not provided, due to their commercially sensitive nature.
(3)  As set out in the Directors’ remuneration policy approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM, the Remuneration Committee is permitted to adjust the bonus determined by reference to the 
formulaic output based upon an assessment of a range of financial and non-financial metrics. Notwithstanding the performance during the year, the Remuneration Committee has determined 
that no such adjustment will be made.

Following the Share Capital Consolidation, the minimum number of ordinary shares to be retained by each executive Director was  
adjusted accordingly, to reflect the adjusted share capital of the Company. As at 2 March 2016, each executive Director continued to  
hold significantly more than the minimum number of ordinary shares required under the adjusted guidelines.
Internal Company rules on shareholdings are extended to senior management in addition to the executive Directors, in order that 
appropriate remuneration principles are applied to senior management on a similar basis to executive Directors.

(1)  The Directors’ holdings in ordinary shares were adjusted pursuant to the Return of Capital and the associated Share Capital Consolidation, effective upon 28 January 2016, in the same  
manner as other shareholders. Accordingly, immediately following the Share Capital Consolidation: Christopher Miller held 2,071,308 ordinary shares (including 774,582 ordinary shares  
held by Harris & Sheldon Investments Limited, a company which is connected with Christopher Miller within the meaning of section 252 of the Companies Act 2006), David Roper held 
1,098,239 ordinary shares, Simon Peckham held 1,133,882 ordinary shares, Geoffrey Martin held 545,278 ordinary shares, Perry Crosthwaite held 25,480 ordinary shares, John Grant  
held 40,141 ordinary shares, Justin Dowley held 65,809 ordinary shares and Liz Hewitt held 3,529 ordinary shares. 
(2)  As at 31 December 2015, the interest of Christopher Miller included 5,311,426 ordinary shares held by Harris & Sheldon Investments Limited, a company which is connected with Christopher 
Miller within the meaning of section 252 of the Companies Act 2006. Immediately following the Share Capital Consolidation, Harris & Sheldon Investments Limited held 774,582 ordinary shares 
in the Company.
(3)  Each of these options are over 2012 incentive shares. Although the option can be exercised at any time, the value which may be derived from the shares acquired on exercise will be determined 
at the relevant “trigger date” as discussed on page 69. 2012 incentive shares acquired on or before the trigger date may be forfeited in accordance with the Company’s articles of association. 
The option exercise price is £1 per share, which is equal to the nominal value of those shares.
Performance graph
The total shareholder return graph below shows the value as at 31 December 2015 of £100 invested in the Company on 31 December 
2008, compared with £100 invested in the FTSE 100 Index, the FTSE 250 Index or the FTSE All-Share Index. The Remuneration 
Committee considers the FTSE 100 Index, the FTSE 250 Index and the FTSE All-Share Index to be appropriate indices for the year  
ended 31 December 2015 for the purposes of this comparison because of the comparable size of the companies which comprise the 
FTSE 100 Index and the FTSE 250 Index and the broad nature of companies which comprise the FTSE All-Share Index. The data shown 
below assumes that all cash returns to shareholders made by the Company during this period are reinvested in ordinary shares.

Annual Report 2015 Percentage change in Chief Executive’s remuneration
The table opposite sets out, in relation to salary, taxable benefits 
and annual bonus, the percentage increase in pay for the 
Company’s Chief Executive compared to the average increase for  
a group consisting of the Company’s senior head office employees, 
managing directors and finance directors of the Group’s businesses 
and direct senior reports of those managing directors and finance 
directors. The percentages shown below relate to the financial  
year ended 2015 as a percentage comparison to the financial year 
ended 2014. This group of senior management was considered  
an appropriate comparator group because of their level of seniority 
and the structure of their remuneration package. The spread of  
the Company’s operations across various countries and industries 
means that remuneration policies vary to take account of 
geography and industry such that the Remuneration Committee 
considers that selecting a wider group of employees would not 
provide a meaningful comparison.

(1)  In the year ending 31 December 2012, David Roper was Chief Executive for the period from 1 January 2012 until 9 May 2012 and Simon Peckham was Chief Executive for the period from  
9 May 2012 onwards. In the table above: 
 (i)  the “Total remuneration” figure shows, in respect of David Roper, his total remuneration in respect of his service in the period 1 January 2012 to 9 May 2012 and in respect of Simon Peckham 
his total remuneration in respect of his service in the period from 9 May 2012 to 31 December 2012. Included in this figure for each of David Roper and Simon Peckham is the value of the 
long-term incentives vesting in the year pro-rated to reflect the portion of the year for which he was Chief Executive; and 
 (ii)  the “Total remuneration excluding the long-term incentive value” shows in respect of each of David Roper and Simon Peckham total remuneration in respect of the period for which he was 
Chief Executive excluding any value received on the maturity in April 2012 of the 2009 Incentive Plan. 
(2)  On the crystallisation in April 2012 of the 2009 Incentive Plan awarded in 2009, participants as a whole were entitled to 10% of the increase in shareholder value from 18 July 2007 to  
23 March 2012. Because the value derived on the crystallisation of the 2009 incentive shares depended upon the shareholder value created over the relevant period, it is not possible to express 
the value derived as a percentage of the maximum opportunity. The crystallisation of the 2009 incentive shares was satisfied by the conversion of those shares into ordinary shares. 
(3)  The value derived in 2012 from the 2009 incentive shares represents the Chief Executive’s share, determined in accordance with the terms of those shares, of the shareholder value created  
over a period of approximately five years.

Chief Executive Remuneration for previous seven years
In accordance with the regulations governing the reporting of Directors’ remuneration which came into effect in October 2013, the  
total figure of remuneration set out in the table below includes the value of long-term incentive vesting in respect of the financial year. 
This means that the full value of the crystallisation of the 2009 Incentive Plan on 11 April 2012 is shown for the year ended 31 December 
2012 and no value will be reflected in the total figure of remuneration for the 2012 Incentive Plan until the trigger date (which will be  
May 2017 or an earlier trigger date determined in accordance with the arrangements).
The value of the 2009 Incentive Plan was earned over a period of approximately five years. Therefore, in the view of the Remuneration 
Committee, inclusion of this value in respect of the year ended 31 December 2012 does not give a fair representation of the Chief 
Executive’s yearly remuneration over each of the previous five years. Therefore, an additional column has been added to the table below 
to show total remuneration excluding the value received on the maturity in April 2012 of the 2009 Incentive Plan. No other long-term 
incentive plan vested in favour of any executive Director in any of the other years. 
The amount of that value shown in respect of David Roper and Simon Peckham for the year ended 31 December 2012 reflects the 
proportion of that year for which each was the Chief Executive.

Implementation of Directors’ remuneration policy for the 
financial year commencing on 1 January 2016
The Remuneration Committee strongly believes that its 
remuneration framework is aligned with the Company’s strategy  
for growth and no structural changes to the Directors’ remuneration 
arrangements are proposed for 2016. 
Executive Directors’ salaries have increased by 3% with effect  
from January 2016, the same as for other head office employees 
(other than where other such employees’ salaries have been 
increased on a different basis to reflect individual circumstances 
such as promotions), as shown in the following table.

Christopher Miller 448 461 3%
David Roper 448 461 3%
Simon Peckham 448 461 3%
Geoffrey Martin 359 369 3%
The overall framework for the executive Directors’ annual bonus 
arrangements for 2016 will remain the same as in 2015, with  
a maximum bonus opportunity of 100% of salary, based on 
financial performance metrics as regards 80% of the opportunity 
and strategic performance metrics as regards the balance.  
In the event of a significant acquisition in 2016, the Remuneration 
Committee will consider how to deal with this as appropriate.  
The Remuneration Committee considers that the strategic 
performance measures are commercially sensitive but will disclose 
the nature of those measures on a retrospective basis, where 
appropriate, on a similar basis to the disclosure on page 72  
in respect of the annual bonus for the year ending 31 December 
2015. As noted on page 67 , annual bonus awards for 2016  
(as well as payments in respect of the 2015 annual bonus) will  
be subject to a clawback arrangement giving the Remuneration 
Committee the ability to require repayment of some or all of any 
bonus earned in the event of: (1) material misstatement of financial 
results; (2) miscalculation of any performance measure on which 
the bonus earned was calculated; and/or (3) serious misconduct  
by the relevant participant. The Remuneration Committee will have 
discretion to apply clawback to any bonus earned for 2016 at any 
time up until the 2019 Annual General Meeting.
Non-executive Directors’ basic fees have been increased by 3% 
with effect from January 2016. The non-executive Director fee levels 
for 2015 and 2016 are set out in the table below.

Directors’ remuneration policy
This part of the report sets out the Company’s Directors’ remuneration policy, which, subject to shareholder approval at the 2016 Annual 
General Meeting, shall take binding effect from the conclusion of that meeting. This policy reflects the policy approved by the shareholders 
of Old Melrose at the 2014 AGM, recognising that this policy is being proposed to shareholders at the 2016 AGM as a result of the 
Restructuring of the Group in November 2015.

Base salary Core element of fixed 
remuneration, reflecting the 
size and scope of the role.
Purpose is to attract and 
retain Directors of the calibre

Normally reviewed annually and 
usually fixed for 12 months from 
1 January, although salaries  
may be reviewed more frequently  
or at different times of the year  
if the Remuneration Committee

Salary is paid in cash and levels are 
determined by the Remuneration 
Committee taking into account  
a range of factors including:
•  role, experience and 
performance;
•  prevailing market conditions;
•  external benchmarks for similar 
roles at comparable companies; 
and
•  salary increases awarded for 
other employees in the Group.
To avoid setting 
expectations of executive 
Directors and other 
employees, no maximum 
has been set under the 
remuneration policy.
Increases may be  
made to salary levels in 
certain circumstances  
as required, for example 
to reflect:
•  increase in scope of 
role or responsibility; 
and
•  performance in role.
Salary increases will take 
into account the average

Annual bonus Rewards performance 
against annual targets  
which support the strategic 
direction of the Company.
Targets are set annually and payout 
is determined by the Remuneration 
Committee after the year-end 
based on performance against 
those targets. The Remuneration 
Committee has discretion to vary 
the bonus pay-out (upwards or 
downwards) should any formulaic 
output not produce a fair result  
for either the individual executive 
Director or the Company, taking 
account of overall business 
performance.
The treatment of bonus payments 
upon loss of office is described  
on page 81.
For executive Directors 
participating in the 
Company’s 2012 
Incentive Plan, the 
maximum annual bonus 
opportunity is 100%  
of base salary.
The Remuneration Committee will 
have regard to various performance 
metrics (which will be determined  
by the Remuneration Committee) 
measured over the relevant financial 
year, when determining bonuses.
At least 50% of the award will be 
based on financial measures and the 
balance of the award will be based  
on strategic measures and/or personal 
objectives, as determined by the 
Remuneration Committee.
Financial metrics
The element of the bonus subject to  
a financial metric will be determined 
between 0% and 100% for 
performance between “threshold” 
performance (the minimum level of 
performance that results in any level of 
payout) and “maximum” performance.
Strategic element
The strategic element of an award will 
be determined to the extent assessed 
by the Remuneration Committee 
between 0% and 100% based  
on the Remuneration Committee’s 
assessment of a range of financial 
and non-financial metrics and/or 
personal objectives.

2012 Incentive Plan
The Company’s long-term incentive arrangement for the Executive Directors is the 2012 Incentive Plan, which takes the form of options 
originally granted in 2012, following approval by a special resolution of shareholders on 11 April 2012. As part of the Restructuring of  
the Group and in accordance with their terms, the options were exchanged for like options over 2012 incentive shares in New Melrose,  
on substantially the same economic terms as the former options.
No further options will be granted to executive Directors pursuant to the 2012 Incentive Plan. However, the existing options will continue 
and may be exercised by their holders in accordance with their terms (and the 2012 incentive shares acquired pursuant to any such 
exercise shall then be dealt with in accordance with the Company’s articles of association). The options over such shares currently held  
by the executive Directors are set out on page 73.
Further information on the 2012 Incentive Plan is included on pages 68 to 70.

Explanation of performance metrics chosen 
Performance measures are chosen to align with the Company’s strategy.
Annual bonus
Stretching performance targets are set each year for the annual bonus, to reflect the key financial and strategic objectives of the Company 
and to reward for delivery against these targets. When setting the targets, the Remuneration Committee will take into account a number  
of different reference points including its plans and strategy and the market environment.
Differences between the Company’s policy on Directors’ remuneration and its policy on remuneration for other employees
Remuneration arrangements throughout the Group are determined based on the same principle that rewards should be sufficient as  
is necessary to attract and retain high calibre talent, without paying more than is necessary and should be achieved for delivery of the 
Company’s strategy.
The Company has operations in various countries, with Group employees of differing levels of seniority. Accordingly, though based on the 
over-arching principle above, reward policies vary to take account of these factors.
The Company has also implemented divisional long-term incentive plans for senior managers of businesses within the Group to incentivise 
them to create value for the Company and its shareholders.
Illustration of the application of Directors’ remuneration policy
The options under the 2012 Incentive Plan were granted in 2012 prior to the policy set out in this Directors’ Remuneration Report coming 
into effect. Therefore, and in accordance with the requirements of the applicable regulations, they are not taken into account in the charts 
below. However, in the interests of transparency, and to illustrate how the 2012 Incentive Plan may operate, we have set out on page 68  
an illustration of how the growth in value over the period from the start of the 2012 Incentive Plan might translate into value earned by 
participants in that arrangement. Accordingly, in illustrating the potential reward under the policy set out in this Directors’ Remuneration 
Report, the following assumptions have been made:
• Minimum performance: fixed elements of remuneration only (base salary effective from 1 January 2016, and benefits and pension rate 
as set out in the single figure table for the year ended 31 December 2015 on page 70).

Recruitment remuneration policy
When agreeing a remuneration package for the appointment of a new executive Director, the Remuneration Committee will apply the 
following principles:
• the package will be sufficient to attract the calibre of Director required to deliver the Company’s strategy;
• the Remuneration Committee will seek to ensure that no more is paid than is necessary; and
• in the next Annual Report on Remuneration after an appointment, the Remuneration Committee will explain to shareholders the rationale 
for the arrangements implemented.
In addition to the policy elements set out in the table on pages 76 and 77 , the Remuneration Committee retains discretion to make appropriate 
remuneration decisions outside the standard policy to meet the individual circumstances of the recruitment, including discretion to include  
any other remuneration component or award. The Remuneration Committee does not intend to use this discretion to make a non-performance 
related incentive payment (for example a “golden hello”). In this regard, elements that the Remuneration Committee may consider for the 
purposes of a remuneration package for the recruitment of a new executive Director include but are not limited to the following:
Element Approach
Incentive remuneration 
opportunity
Recognising that any new executive Director would not participate in the 2012 Incentive Plan or any other existing 
long-term incentive arrangement, the Remuneration Committee may award a maximum annual bonus opportunity  
of up to 300% of salary until such time as a new long-term incentive arrangement is put in place for the executive 
Directors in which that new executive Director could participate.
Compensation for forfeited 
remuneration arrangements
The Remuneration Committee may make awards on hiring an external candidate to buy out remuneration arrangements 
forfeited on leaving a previous employer. In doing so, the Remuneration Committee will have regard to relevant factors, 
including any performance conditions attached to such arrangements, the form of those awards (e.g. cash or shares)  
and the time frame of such awards. While such awards are excluded from the maximum level of variable remuneration 
referred to on the following page, the Remuneration Committee’s intention is that the value awarded (as determined by 
the Remuneration Committee on a fair and reasonable basis) would be no higher than the expected value of the forfeited 
arrangements. Where considered appropriate, buyout awards will be subject to forfeiture or clawback on early departure.
Notice period The notice period will be the same as the Company’s ordinary policy of 12 months.
Relocation costs Where necessary, the Company will pay appropriate relocation costs. The Remuneration Committee will seek to ensure 
that no more is paid than is necessary.
Retirement benefits The maximum contribution of 15% of salary referred to in the policy table on page 77 will apply to any new executive 
Director. However, the Remuneration Committee reserves the right to pay the contribution into any pension arrangement 
or to pay the amount as a supplement to base salary in lieu of a pension arrangement.
  Base salary, benefits and pension  Annual bonus
Governance
79
Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015 Under the applicable reporting regulations, the Company is required to set out the maximum level of variable remuneration that may  
be granted when agreeing the components of a remuneration package for the appointment of Directors, excluding any remuneration 
constituting compensation for the forfeiture of any variable remuneration award with a previous employer. In order to provide sufficient 
flexibility in recruitment scenarios and to reflect the fact that a newly-appointed executive Director would not participate in the 2012 
Incentive Plan or any other existing long-term incentive arrangement, the Remuneration Committee has set this maximum level of variable 
remuneration at three times salary. 
Incentive awards and “buyout” awards may be granted under new plans as permitted under the Listing Rules, which allow for the grant  
of awards to facilitate, in unusual circumstances, the recruitment of a Director.
Where a position is filled internally, any ongoing remuneration obligations or outstanding variable pay elements shall be allowed to continue 
in accordance with their subsisting terms.
The remuneration package for a newly-appointed non-executive Director would normally be in line with the structure set out in the policy 
table for non-executive Directors.
Service contracts and policy on payment for loss of office
The Company’s policy is for executive Directors to be employed on the terms of service agreements, which may be terminated by either 
the Director or the Company on the giving of not less than 12 months’ written notice (subject to certain exceptions).
Each executive Director originally entered into a service agreement with Melrose PLC, effective upon the dates stated below, which was 
subsequently novated on the same terms to Old Melrose. Upon the Restructuring, each executive Director was appointed as an executive 
Director of New Melrose on the dates set out below and each service agreement was again novated on the same terms to New Melrose, 
conditional upon New Melrose becoming the parent company of the Group. Details of the executive Directors’ original appointment dates 
and notice periods are set out below.

Old Melrose. Upon the introduction of Old Melrose as the new parent company of the Group, any letters of appointments with Melrose PLC 
were replaced with letters of appointment with Old Melrose, on the same terms. Upon the Restructuring, each non-executive Director was 
appointed as a non-executive Director of New Melrose, on the dates set out below, and each letter of appointment with Old Melrose was

Annual Report 2015
Governance The principles on which the determination of payments for loss of office will be approached are summarised below:
Provision Treatment upon loss of office
Payment in lieu of notice If the Company terminates an executive Director’s employment with immediate effect, a payment in lieu of notice may be 
made. This may include base salary, pension contributions and benefits.
Annual bonus This will be at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee on an individual basis and the decision whether or not to 
award a bonus in full or in part will be dependent upon a number of factors including the circumstances of the executive 
Director’s departure and their contribution to the business during the bonus period in question. Typically, bonus amounts 
will be pro-rated for time in service up to termination.
Other payments The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to make additional exit payments where such payments are made in 
good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation) or by way  
of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of a Director’s office or employment.
In appropriate circumstances, payments may also be made in respect of legal fees.
The overall amount of any payment made in respect of a loss of office will not exceed the aggregate of any payment in lieu 
of notice and any payment made in respect of annual bonus, as referred to above. Entitlements in respect of the 2012 
Incentive Plan will be dealt with in accordance with their terms and, were the Company to make an award on recruitment 
of an executive Director to buy out remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer, the leaver 
provisions for that award would be determined at the time of grant.
If an executive Director ceases to be employed by the Company, the Company is wound up or there is a change of control of the 
Company, the options granted pursuant to the 2012 Incentive Plan, and any 2012 incentive shares issued in accordance with the plan,  
will be dealt with in accordance with their terms. 
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company
Salary, benefits and performance-related awards provided to employees are taken into account when setting policy for executive Directors’ 
remuneration. There is no consultation with employees on Directors’ remuneration.
Statement of consideration of shareholder views
The Company is committed to ongoing engagement and seeks the views of major shareholders in advance of amending its remuneration 
policies. The policies are set to reflect the Company’s commercial strategy and the 2012 Incentive Plan was approved by shareholders  
in 2012.
Shareholding guidelines
The shareholding guidelines which apply to the executive Directors and the minimum levels of shareholdings are set out on page 72. 
Payments outside the policy in this report
The Remuneration Committee retains discretion to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office outside the policy  
set out in this report:
• where the terms of the payment were agreed before the policy came into effect;
• where the terms of the payment were agreed at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the 
opinion of the Remuneration Committee, the payment was not in consideration of the individual becoming a Director of the Company; 
and/or
• to satisfy contractual commitments under legacy remuneration arrangements.
For these purposes, “payments” includes the satisfaction of awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares,  
the terms of the payment are “agreed” at the time the award is granted. Any such payment shall include the satisfaction of the exercise  
of any options under the 2012 Incentive Plan and the delivery of the value attributable to the 2012 incentive shares in accordance with the 
Company’s articles of association.

of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company  
for that period. 
In preparing the parent company financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable
and prudent;
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will
continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable
information;
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events
and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial
performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue
as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time  
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity  
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may  
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the
relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation
taken as a whole;
• the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development
and performance of the business and the position of the
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks
and uncertainties that they face; and
• the Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a whole,
are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s
performance, business model and strategy.

Opinion on financial statements of Melrose Industries PLC 
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2015
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)
as adopted by the European Union;
• the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice, including FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland”; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the 
Consolidated and the Company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Consolidated and Company Statement 
of Changes in Equity, the related notes 1 to 30 to the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 1 to 8 to the Company

applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation  
of the Parent Company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice), including FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland”.
Going concern and the Directors’ assessment of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity  
of the Group 
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ statement regarding the appropriateness of the going concern basis  
of accounting contained within note 2 to the financial statements and the Directors’ statement on the longer-term viability of the Group 
contained within the Strategic Report on page 27 . 
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
• the Directors’ confirmation on page 29 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including
those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
• the disclosures on pages 30 to 35 that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
• the Directors’ statement in note 2 to the financial statements about whether they consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern
basis of accounting in preparing them and their identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s ability to continue to do so over
a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements; and
• the Directors’ explanation on page 27 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done
so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the
Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any
related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We agreed with the Directors’ adoption of the going concern basis of accounting and we did not identify any such material uncertainties. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
Independence
We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s Ethical Standards for Auditors and we confirm that we are independent 
of the Group and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. We also confirm we have not 
provided any of the prohibited non-audit services referred to in those standards.

Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015
Financials Our assessment of risks of material misstatement 
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation  
of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team:
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Accounting for the disposal of Elster
During the year, the Group completed the disposal of the Elster 
businesses, together with the FKI UK and McKechnie UK pension plans 
(together “the disposal group”) to Honeywell International Inc., recording 
a profit on disposal of £1,256.3 million.
The accounting for this transaction is considered to be a risk due to  
the non-recurring and significant size of the transaction and the quantum  
of the gain on disposal. Additionally, the risk of material misstatement 
identified and discussed below relating to provisions was also applicable 
to the disposal group.
Note 9 within the financial statements includes full disclosure of the profit 
for the year from discontinued operations.
We obtained and read the sale and purchase agreement for the transaction 
in order to understand the terms on which the disposal had been made.
We tested management’s calculation of the gain on disposal by agreeing 
the calculation to the terms of the sale and purchase agreement, where 
applicable, and the net assets disposed and profit recorded in the period  
to the underlying audit work performed on the disposal group. We have 
also recalculated the cumulative translation loss arising on disposal. 
We traced the consideration received in cash to the completion statement 
and to the bank statement and agreed a sample of disposal costs to 
supporting documentation such as invoices in order to determine that  
they were costs directly attributable to the disposal. 
Provisions
Legal, environmental, restructuring, property, incentive scheme related 
and warranty provisions as at 31 December 2015 totalled £30.0 million 
within the continuing Group and a further £75.7 million of provisions  
were disposed of with Elster on 29 December 2015 (2014: £172.8 million 
across the total Group). 
Given the nature of the Group’s operations, the recognition and  
valuation of the expected outcome of these provisions requires the 
exercise of management judgement, which is often dependent on the 
actions of third parties, the specific circumstances pertaining to each 
provision obligation and are generally outside the control of the Group. 
The use of estimates gives rise to inherent subjectivity in the amounts 
recorded in the financial statements. 
Note 3 includes this as one of the significant accounting judgements and 
key sources of estimation uncertainty and note 20 includes further details 
on the provisions. 
We challenged the assumptions underlying the recognition and valuation  
of provisions through checking and verifying inputs used to calculate the 
provisions, including review of the nature and timings of formal restructuring 
plans, review of third party correspondence, discussion with the Group’s 
lawyers, applicability of relevant laws and regulations and review of 
agreements.
Further, we assessed the level of historical warranty claims and obtained 
the specific warranty terms and conditions provided in order to ascertain 
whether the warranty provisions held were sufficient to cover all obligations 
in existence at the year-end within the continuing business and at the 
disposal date within the disposal balance sheet, in light of known claims 
and standard warranty periods provided. 
Exceptional items
The presentation and consistency of costs and income within exceptional 
items is a key determinant in the assessment of the quality of the Group’s 
underlying earnings. The exceptional operating costs and exceptional 
finance costs for the year ended 31 December 2015 are £7.9 million  
and £13.1 million respectively for the continuing Group. 
Note 2 includes the Group’s accounting policy for exceptional items  
and notes 6 and 7 include further details on the exceptional items. 
A sample of exceptional items, including all material items, have been 
agreed to source documentation and evaluated by the component and 
Group audit teams as to their nature in order to assess whether they are in 
line with the Group’s accounting policy, and also to assess consistency of 
management’s application of the policy with previous accounting periods.
We also assessed whether the disclosures within the financial statements 
provide sufficient detail for the reader to understand the nature of these items.

Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Impairment of the carrying value of goodwill and intangibles
The carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets (excluding computer 
software and development costs) of the Energy cash-generating unit 
(CGU) as at 31 December 2015 is £271.8 million (2014: £285.3 million). 
Management perform an impairment review on an annual basis  
and whenever an indication of impairment is identified. A significant  
risk of material misstatement exists as a result of the application of 
management judgement and estimation in performing the impairment 
reviews, in particular in relation to the forecasting of future cash flows,  
the perpetual growth rate and the selection of an appropriate discount 
rate. This risk relates only to the Energy CGU in light of the impairment 
review undertaken on the disposal group immediately before the 
classification as held for sale in line with IFRS 5.
This is included in note 3 as one of the significant accounting judgements 
and key sources of estimation uncertainty and note 12 includes more 
details on goodwill and intangibles. 
We challenged the reasonableness of the assumptions which underpin 
management’s forecasts with reference to the recent and historical  
trading performance of the Energy CGU, as well as the current order book. 
We have also reviewed historical financial performance of the business 
units compared with the original forecasts to evaluate the accuracy of 
management’s budgeting process. 
Our procedures included consulting with our valuation specialists to  
assess the discount rate applied to future cash flows and benchmarking 
assumptions such as the perpetual growth rate and discount rate  
to external macro-economic and market data. 
Having ascertained the extent of change in those assumptions that either 
individually or collectively would be required for the assets to be impaired 
by performing sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions, we considered 
the likelihood of such a movement in those assumptions arising. 
We have reviewed the disclosures included by management in relation  
to the reasonable possible change and are satisfied that these are 
appropriate.
Accounting for the disposal of Elster has been included as a risk in the current year following the completion of the sale of the Elster 
disposal group during 2015. 
Our prior year audit report also included a further risk relating to taxation which is not included in our report in the current year. Following 
the disposal of Elster, this risk has been re-assessed and is not considered to be one of those which has had the greatest effect on our 
audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and direction of the efforts of the engagement team.
 
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with the significant issues considered by the Audit Committee discussed  
on pages 58 to 60.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon,  
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions  
of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work 
and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £11 million (2014: £11 million), which is 4.6% of profit before exceptional costs, exceptional 
income, one-off items within discontinued operations, intangible asset amortisation and tax from continuing and discontinued operations 
(2014: 5.2% of profit before exceptional costs, exceptional income, intangible asset amortisation and tax from continuing operations)  
and below 1% (2014: below 1%) of equity. 
We use profit before exceptional costs, exceptional income, one-off items within discontinued operations, intangible asset amortisation 
and tax to provide a stable basis for materiality that reflects the focus of the users of the financial statements. This excludes the effect  
of exceptional items, as these can be volatile, and the amortisation of acquired intangibles, as excluding the relatively high amortisation 
charge, given the acquisitive nature of the Group, provides a more comparable measure with similar organisations and is consistent with 
the profit measure most relevant to analysts and investors. 
The use of profit before exceptional costs, exceptional income, one-off items within discontinued operations, intangible asset amortisation 
and tax from continuing and discontinued operations is an updated approach compared to 2014 where we used the headline profit before 
tax from continuing operations only. The revised approach reflects the size of the Elster businesses reported as discontinued operations 
within the Group financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015.

Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015
Financials We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £250,000 (2014: £250,000), 
as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit 
Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
An overview of the scope of our audit 
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls,  
and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. 
The Group’s 79 (2014: 78) locations are organised into the continuing Energy division and the Elster discontinued operations, which were 
previously disclosed as three divisions as described in the Business review on pages 10 and 11 of this Annual Report (2014: All four of 
these divisions were part of the continuing Group). 
Our Group audit scope focused primarily on audit work at 22 locations (2014: 29), of which four relate to businesses which form part of  
the continuing Group and a further 18 locations covered operations within the discontinued group. The change in the number of locations 
reflects the scale of the discontinued operations and our risk assessment in the current year. Additionally, the number of locations was 
higher in the prior year due to the non-statutory audits performed that year of certain of the Company’s businesses. 
The extent of our testing was based on our assessment of the risks of material misstatement and on the materiality of the Group’s business 
operations at these locations.
Continuing Group
In respect of the continuing Group, all four locations were subject to a full audit (2014: four). These four locations accounted for 86% of  
the continuing Group’s revenue and 93% of the total continuing Group’s headline operating profit and divisional costs (before central costs). 
The work performed at these four locations together with the work performed centrally by the Group audit team accounted for 98% of the 
Group’s net assets. 
Our work at the four locations forming part of the continuing business was performed to local statutory materiality which ranged between 
£0.4 million and £1.3 million.
In 2014, these four locations accounted for 86% of the revenue and 94% of the headline operating profit and divisional costs (before central 
costs) of the Energy division.
Discontinued operations
For the discontinued Elster operations, 12 locations were subject to a full audit (2014: 19), five were subject to specified audit procedures 
(2014: six) and one (2014: nil) was subject to specified audit procedures on the revenue balance. 
The 18 discontinued locations subject to full audit, specified audit procedures and specified audit procedures on the revenue balance 
accounted for 74% of discontinued revenue and 71% of discontinued operating profit and divisional costs (before central costs, one-off 
costs, one-off income and intangible asset amortisation). The work performed at these locations together with the work performed 
centrally by the Group audit team accounted for 98% of the disposed net assets at 29 December 2015. 
Our work and audit procedures at the 18 discontinued locations were performed at lower levels of materiality determined by reference  
to the relative scale of the business concerned and ranged between £0.1 million and £4.4 million. 
In 2014, the 25 Elster locations subject to a full audit or specified audit procedures accounted for 87% of the revenue and 86% of the 
operating profit and divisional costs (before central costs, one-off costs, one-off income and intangible asset amortisation) of the three 
Elster segments.

Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015 Involvement in the work of component auditors and work performed at group level
The senior statutory auditor or other senior members of the Group audit team visited eight of the largest locations for the audit (2014: 12).  
More locations were visited in the prior year as part of the handover between lead audit partners, due to the acquisition of Eclipse and  
our risk assessment of the Group. The senior statutory auditor also held a close meeting which covered all continuing and discontinued 
locations. In years when we do not visit a component within our Group audit scope, we will include the component audit team in our  
team briefing, discuss their risk assessment and review documentation of the findings from their work. 
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that 
there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject  
to audit or audit of specified account balances. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration have not 
been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. 
We have nothing to report arising from these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s 
compliance with certain provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the  
Annual Report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course  
of performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the  
audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the Annual 
Report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we consider should have been 
disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.

Financials Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We also comply with International 
Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality control procedures are 
effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated professional standards review team and 
independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them  
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based 
on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Financials Notes to the financial statements
1. Corporate information
Melrose Industries PLC (“the Company”) is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The address 
of the registered office is given on the back cover. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in note 5 and 
in the Business review on pages 10 and 11.
Following shareholder approval on 29 October 2015, a Scheme of Arrangement was sanctioned by the High Court of England and Wales 
on 18 November 2015, pursuant to which a new listed company was introduced for the Melrose Group of companies. The Scheme of 
Arrangement became effective on 19 November 2015 and New Melrose Industries PLC (subsequently renamed Melrose Industries PLC  
on 19 November 2015) became the new holding company of Melrose Industries PLC (subsequently renamed Melrose Holdings Limited  
on 19 November 2015) and its subsidiaries.
The Scheme of Arrangement resulting in New Melrose Industries PLC becoming the new holding company for the Group has been 
accounted for in these consolidated financial statements as a reverse asset acquisition using the principles of reverse acquisition 
accounting set out in IFRS 3: “Business combinations”.
As a consequence of applying reverse acquisition accounting principles, the consolidated results of Melrose Industries PLC  
(“the Group”) for the year ended 31 December 2015 comprise the results of Melrose Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries for the year 
ended 31 December 2015 consolidated with those of New Melrose Industries PLC from 19 November 2015. The comparative figures for 
the Group are those of the Group headed by Melrose Holdings Limited for the year ended 31 December 2014 except for the presentation 
of the Issued share capital, Merger reserve, Capital redemption reserve and Other reserves balances which have been restated to reflect 
the reserves position of the Group as if New Melrose Industries PLC had been the parent company during both periods presented.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2015 were authorised in accordance with a resolution 
of the Directors of Melrose Industries PLC on 3 March 2016.
These financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the 
Company is based. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
During the year, the Group completed its review of the assets and liabilities acquired following the acquisition of Eclipse, Inc. (“Eclipse”)  
by the Gas segment on 31 October 2014. As a result, the Group recorded its final adjustments to the opening balance sheet of Eclipse.  
In accordance with IFRS 3: “Business combinations” the Balance Sheet at 31 December 2014 has been restated to reflect these 
adjustments which decreased provisions by £4.2 million and decreased the goodwill arising on the acquisition of Eclipse from  
£64.6 million to £60.4 million.
On 29 December 2015, the Group completed the disposal of the Elster businesses (“Elster”) to Honeywell International Inc. (“Honeywell”). 
At the interim reporting date the disposal was highly probable and in accordance with IFRS 5: “Non-current assets held for sale and 
discontinued operations”, the assets and liabilities of Elster were classified as held for sale in the Balance Sheet at 30 June 2015 and 
subsequently disposed on 29 December 2015. 
Elster comprised the Gas, Electricity and Water segments along with their associated central costs. In addition, the “Elster disposal group” 
also contained the Elster divisional long-term incentive plans, the FKI UK defined benefit pension plan and the McKechnie UK defined 
benefit pension plan, all of which have been shown as discontinued operations in these financial statements.
On 18 December 2015, the Prelok business, previously included in the Energy segment, was disposed. Prelok is shown as a discontinued 
operation in these financial statements.
1.1 New Standards and Interpretations affecting amounts, presentation or disclosure reported in the current year 
In the current financial year, the Group has adopted a number of new or revised Standards and Interpretations, none of which significantly 
affected the amounts reported in these financial statements. Details of the Standards and Interpretations that were adopted are set out in 
section 1.2. 
1.2  New Standards and Interpretations adopted with no significant effect on financial statements
The following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted in the current year. Their adoption has not had any 
significant impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements, but may impact the accounting for future transactions and 
arrangements:
• Annual improvements to IFRSs: 2011–13 cycle
• Amendments to IAS 19: Defined benefit plans: Employee contributions

1.3  New Standards and Interpretations in issue but not yet effective
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations are in issue but not yet effective  
(and in some cases have not been adopted by the EU):
• IFRS 9: Financial instruments
• Amendments to IFRS 11: Accounting for acquisitions of interests in joint operations
• IFRS 14: Regulatory deferral accounts
• IFRS 15: Revenue from contracts with customers
• IFRS 16: Leases
• Amendments to IAS 1: Disclosure initiative
• Amendments to IAS 12: Recognition of deferred tax losses 
• Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: Clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation
• Amendments to IAS 27: Equity method in separate financial statements
• Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28: Sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture
• Annual improvements to IFRSs: 2012–14 Cycle
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the Standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the 
Group in future periods, except that IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement and disclosures of financial instruments and IFRS 15 may 
have an impact on revenue recognition and related disclosures. Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable 
estimate of the effect of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 until a detailed review has been completed. 
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”).  
The consolidated financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted for use in the European Union  
and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on an historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial 
instruments which are recognised at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value  
of the consideration given in exchange for assets. The principal accounting policies adopted are consistent with the prior year and are  
set out below. 
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements include the results of the parent undertaking and all of its subsidiary undertakings. The results of 
businesses acquired during the period are included from the effective date of acquisition and for those sold during the period to the 
effective date of disposal. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting 
policies used into line with those used by the Group. All intra-Group balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from 
intra-Group transactions, have been eliminated in full.
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. The interest of non-controlling 
shareholders is initially measured at the non-controlling interests’ proportion of the share of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net 
assets. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition 
plus the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling 
interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
Going concern
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis  
of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Further detail is contained on page 26 of the Finance Director’s review.
96
Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015
Financials Business combinations and goodwill
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of acquisition is measured at the fair value of  
assets transferred, the liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange of control and equity instruments issued by the Group in 
exchange for control of the acquiree. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies 
of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. Costs directly attributable to business combinations are recognised as an 
expense in the Income Statement as incurred. 
The acquired identifiable assets and liabilities are measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition except those where specific 
guidance is provided by IFRSs. Non-current assets and directly attributable liabilities that are classified as held for sale in accordance with 
IFRS 5: “Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations”, are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell. Also, 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12: “Income taxes”, liabilities and assets related  
to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 19 (revised): “Employee benefits” and liabilities or 
equity instruments related to the replacement by the Group of an acquiree’s share-based payments awards are measured in accordance 
with IFRS 2: “Share-based payment”. Any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired  
is recognised as goodwill. 
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs,  
the Group reports provisional amounts where appropriate. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period,  
or additional assets or liabilities recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the 
acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised at that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and 
circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and is subject to a maximum period of one year.
Goodwill on acquisition is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any 
non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree over the acquirer’s 
interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured  
at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes  
in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets exceeds the sum of the consideration 
transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest  
in the acquiree, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.
As at the acquisition date, any goodwill acquired is allocated to each of the cash-generating units acquired. Impairment is determined  
by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill relates. Where the recoverable amount of the  
cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised in the Income Statement and is not subsequently 
reversed. When there is a disposal of a cash-generating unit, goodwill relating to the operation disposed of is taken into account in 
determining the gain or loss on disposal of that operation. The amount of goodwill allocated to a partial disposal is measured on the  
basis of the relative values of the operation disposed of and the operation retained.
Joint ventures
A joint venture is an entity which is not a subsidiary undertaking but the interest of the Group is that of a partner in a business over which  
the Group exercises joint control. The results, assets and liabilities of joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and 
services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, customs duties and sales related taxes. Revenue is reduced for 
estimated customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances. The nature of agreements into which the Group enters means that:
• the contracts usually contain discrete elements, each of which transfers risks and rewards to the customer. Where such discrete 
elements are present, revenue is recognised on each element in accordance with the policy on the sale of goods. 
• the service element of the contract is usually insignificant in relation to the total contract value and is often provided on a short-term  
or one-off basis. Where this is the case, revenue is recognised when the service is complete. 
• aftermarket activities generally relate to the provision of spare parts, repairs and the rebuild of equipment. Revenue on the provision  
of parts is recognised in accordance with the policy on the sale of goods and revenue for repairs and rebuild is recognised upon 
completion of the activity.
The significant majority of the Group’s revenue is recognised on a sale of goods basis. 
Financials
97
Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015 2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
The specific methods used to recognise the different forms of revenue earned by the Group are as follows: 
Sale of goods
Revenue is recognised when all of the following conditions are satisfied:
• the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods;
• the Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control  
over the goods;
• the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
• it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group; and
• the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
Transfers of risks and rewards vary depending on the nature of the products sold and the individual terms of the contract of sale. Sales 
made under internationally accepted trade terms are recognised as revenue when the Group has completed the primary duties required  
to transfer risks as stipulated in those terms. Sales made outside of such terms are generally recognised on delivery to the customer.  
No revenue is recognised where recovery of the consideration is not probable or there are significant uncertainties regarding associated 
costs or the possible return of goods. 
Provision of services
As noted above, because revenue from the rendering of services is usually not significant in relation to the total contract value and  
is generally provided on a short-term or one-off basis, revenue is usually recognised when the service is complete. 
Construction contracts
As noted above, customer contracts usually contain discrete elements separately transferring risks and rewards to the customer.  
Where such discrete elements are present, revenue is recognised on each element in accordance with the policy on the sale of goods. 
Where such discrete elements are not in place, revenue from significant contracts is recognised in proportion to the stage of completion  
of the contract by reference to the specific contract terms and the costs incurred on the contract at the Balance Sheet date in comparison 
to the total forecast costs of the contract. This is normally measured by the proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed  
to date bear to the estimated total contract costs, except where this would not be representative of the stage of completion.
Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are included in revenue from construction contracts when the amount can  
be measured reliably and its receipt is considered probable. Variations are included when the customer has agreed to the variation or 
acknowledged liability for the variation in principle. Claims are included when negotiations with the customer have reached an advanced 
stage such that it is probable that the customer will accept the claim. Incentive payments are included when a contract is sufficiently 
advanced that it is probable that the performance standards triggering the incentive will be achieved.
Profit attributable to contract activity is recognised if the final outcome of such contracts can be reliably assessed. Where this is not the 
case contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred where it is probable they will be recovered. When it is probable 
that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Interest income
Interest income is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue can  
be measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest  
rate applicable.
Exceptional costs/income
Exceptional costs/income are those costs/income of a significant and non-recurring nature or those associated with significant 
restructuring programmes, acquisitions or disposals, which warrant separate additional disclosure in the financial statements in order  
to fully understand the underlying performance of the Group.
Headline operating profit
Headline operating profit is stated before exceptional operating costs, exceptional operating income and intangible asset amortisation. 
Headline operating profit is considered by the Directors to be the best measure of performance. 
Notes to the financial statements continued

Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015
Financials Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily 
take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the 
assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. 
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted 
from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Issue costs of loans
The finance cost recognised in the Income Statement in respect of the issue costs of borrowings is allocated to periods over the terms  
of the instrument using the effective interest rate method.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost, and any costs directly attributable to bring the asset into 
operation. The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to 
acquire the asset. 
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows:
Freehold land nil 
Freehold buildings and long leasehold property over expected economic life not exceeding 50 years
Short leasehold property over the term of the lease
Plant and equipment 3–12 years
The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis and, if necessary, changes in useful lives  
are accounted for prospectively.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying value may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists an impairment review is performed and, where the carrying values 
exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the assets are written down to their recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of property, 
plant and equipment is the greater of net selling price and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and  
the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined 
for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from 
the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds or costs and the carrying amount of the item) is included in the Income Statement in the year that the item is derecognised.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
On acquisition of businesses, separately identifiable intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Access to the use of brands and intellectual property are valued using a “relief from royalty” method which determines the net present 
value of future additional cash flows arising from the use of the intangible asset.
Customer relationships are valued on the basis of the net present value of the future additional cash flows arising from customer 
relationships with appropriate allowance for attrition of customers.
Financials
99
Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015 2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the asset as follows:
Customer relationships 20 years or less
Brands and intellectual property 20 years or less
Computer software 5 years or less
Development costs 5 years or less
Computer software is initially recorded at cost. Where these assets have been acquired through a business combination, this will be the 
fair value allocated in the acquisition accounting. Where these have been acquired other than through a business combination, the initial 
cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset.
Intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairment losses are measured on a similar basis to property, plant and equipment. Useful lives 
are also examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis.
Research and development costs
Research costs are expensed as incurred.
Costs relating to clearly defined and identifiable development projects are capitalised when there is a technical degree of exploitation, 
adequacy of resources and a potential market or development possibility in the undertaking that are recognisable; and where it is the 
intention to produce, market or execute the project. A correlation must also exist between the costs incurred and future benefits and  
those costs can be measured reliably. Capitalised costs are expensed on a straight-line basis over their useful lives of five years or less. 
Costs not meeting such criteria are expensed as incurred.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value and measured using a first in, first out basis. Cost includes all direct 
expenditure and appropriate production overhead expenditure incurred in bringing goods to their current state under normal operating 
conditions. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal. 
Provisions are made for obsolescence or other expected losses where necessary.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables and other receivables are measured and carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any 
impairment. The carrying amount of other receivables is reduced by the impairment loss directly and a charge is recorded in the Income 
Statement. For trade receivables, the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of 
amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account and changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account 
are recognised in the Income Statement.
Trade receivables that are assessed not to be impaired individually are also assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective 
evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the Group’s past experience of collecting receipts, an increase in the 
number of delayed receipts in the portfolio past the average credit period, as well as observable changes in national or local economic 
conditions that correlate with default on receivables. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the Balance Sheet comprise cash in hand, current balances with banks and similar institutions and  
short-term deposits which are readily convertible to cash which are subject to insignificant risks of changes in value.
For the purpose of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined 
above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the 
borrowings.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs, and any discount or premium on settlement.
Gains and losses are recognised in the Income Statement when the liabilities are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the 
amortisation process.

Financials Leases
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are  
capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.  
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the Balance Sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned 
between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance  
of the liability. 
Finance charges are charged directly against income. Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated  
useful life of the asset or the lease term.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Other financial liabilities 
Other financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured  
at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis. The effective interest 
method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant periods.  
The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash payments throughout the expected life of the financial liability,  
or, where appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount on initial recognition. The Group derecognises financial liabilities when 
the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity risks,  
arising from operating and financing activities. The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 
Details of derivative financial instruments are disclosed in note 24 of the financial statements.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised and stated at fair value. Their fair value is recalculated at each reporting date. The 
accounting treatment for the resulting gain or loss will depend on whether the derivative meets the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting.
Where derivatives do not meet the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses on the revaluation to fair value at the  
period end are recognised immediately in the Income Statement. Where derivatives do meet the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting, 
recognition of any resulting gain or loss on revaluation depends on the nature of the hedge relationship and the item being hedged.
Derivative financial instruments with maturity dates of less than one year from the period end date are classified as current in the  
Balance Sheet. 
Hedge accounting
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document from inception the relationship between the item being hedged 
and the hedging instrument and to show that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis. This effectiveness testing is performed 
at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedge instrument expires or is sold, terminated, 
exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
The Group designates certain hedging instruments as either fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign 
operations.
Fair value hedge
Derivative financial instruments are classified as fair value hedges when they hedge the Group’s exposure to changes in the fair value of  
a recognised asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded  
in the Income Statement immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk. 
Cash flow hedge
Derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge the Group’s exposure to the variability in cash flows 
that are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecasted cash flow. 
The effective portion of any gain or loss from revaluing the derivative financial instrument is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income and accumulated in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Income Statement. 
Financials
101
Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015 2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Amounts previously recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and accumulated in equity are recycled to the Income 
Statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in the Income Statement or when the forecast transaction is no longer 
expected to occur. However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-
financial liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement  
of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations
Derivative financial instruments are classified as net investment hedges when they hedge the Group’s net investment in foreign operations. 
The effective element of any foreign exchange gain or loss from revaluing the derivative at a reporting period end is recognised in the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income. Any ineffective element is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are recognised immediately in the Income Statement when the foreign operation is disposed  
of or when the hedge is no longer expected to occur.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that  
an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the 
amount of the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future 
cash flows at a rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to  
the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
Restructurings
A restructuring provision is recognised when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised  
a valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by either starting to implement the plan or by announcing its  
main features to those affected by it. The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from  
the restructuring, which are those amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated with the ongoing 
activities of the entity.
Warranties
Provisions for the expected cost of warranty obligations under local sale of goods legislation are recognised at the date of sale of the 
relevant products, using the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the Group’s obligation.
Onerous contracts
Present obligations arising under onerous contracts are recognised and measured as provisions. An onerous contract is considered  
to exist where the Group has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the 
economic benefits expected to be received under it.
 
Environmental liabilities
Liabilities for environmental costs are recognised when environmental assessments or clean-ups are probable and the associated costs 
can be reasonably estimated. Generally, the timing of these provisions coincides with the commitment to a formal plan of action. The 
amount recognised is the best estimate of the expenditure required. Where the liability will not be settled for a number of years, the amount 
recognised is the present value of the estimated future expenditure.
Employee benefits
Wages, salaries, bonuses, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave are accrued in the year in which the associated 
services are rendered by employees of the Group. The accounting policy for pensions and other retirement benefits is described below.
The Group also operates long term incentive plans (“LTIPs”) for Directors and certain employees. The expected settlement costs of these 
plans are expensed on a straight-line basis over the life of the plans.
Pensions and other retirement benefits
The Group operates defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans, some of which require contributions to be made to 
administered funds separate from the Group.
Notes to the financial statements continued
102
Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015
Financials For the defined benefit pension and retirement benefit plans, plan assets are measured at fair value and plan liabilities are measured on  
an actuarial basis and discounted at an interest rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high-quality corporate bond of equivalent 
currency and term to the plan liabilities. Any assets resulting from this calculation are limited to past service cost plus the present value  
of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan. The present value of the defined benefit obligation, and the related 
current service cost and past service cost, are measured using the projected unit credit method.
The service cost of providing pension and other retirement benefits to employees for the period is charged to the Income Statement.
Net interest expense on net defined benefit obligations is determined by applying discount rates used to measure defined benefit 
obligations at the beginning of the year to net defined benefit obligations at the beginning of the year. Net interest expense is recognised 
within finance costs.
Remeasurement gains and losses comprise actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return  
on plan assets (excluding interest). Remeasurement gains and losses, and taxation thereon, are recognised in full in the Statement  
of Comprehensive Income in the period in which they occur and are not subsequently recycled.
Actuarial gains and losses may result from differences between the actuarial assumptions underlying the plan obligations and actual 
experience during the period or changes in the actuarial assumptions used in the valuation of the plan obligations. 
For defined contribution plans, contributions payable are charged to the Income Statement as an operating expense when employees 
have rendered services entitling them to the contributions.
Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which  
it operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each 
Group company are expressed in pounds Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for  
the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency 
(foreign currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each Balance Sheet date, 
monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the Balance Sheet date. 
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when 
the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in the Income 
Statement for the period. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in the 
Income Statement for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and 
losses are recognised directly in equity. For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised 
directly in equity.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are translated  
at exchange rates prevailing on the Balance Sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for  
the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions  
are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and accumulated in equity 
(attributed to non-controlling interests as appropriate). Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period 
in which the related operation is disposed of. Any exchange differences that have previously been attributed to non-controlling interests  
are derecognised but they are not reclassified to the Income Statement.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity  
and translated at the rate prevailing at the Balance Sheet date.
Taxation
The tax expense is based on the taxable profits for the period and represents the sum of the tax paid or currently payable and deferred tax.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are  
taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax  
is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Financials
103
Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015 2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the Balance Sheet date between the tax bases  
of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except:
• where the deferred tax liability arises on the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business 
combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
• where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures 
can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses,  
to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and carry-forward  
of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised except:
• where the deferred tax asset arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination 
and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
• in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, deferred  
tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future  
and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the 
liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the relevant Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities 
and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and 
liabilities on a net basis. 
Tax relating to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and  
not in the Income Statement.
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax except:
• where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the sales 
tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable; and
• where receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales tax included.
The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the 
Balance Sheet.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2: “Share-based payment”. The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments  
to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value of the equity instrument excluding the effect of 
non-market based vesting conditions at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based 
payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest  
and adjusted for the effect of non-market based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black Scholes pricing model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on the 
Directors’ best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.

Financials Government grants
Government grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching  
to them and that the grants will be received.
Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to profit or loss over the 
expected useful lives of the assets concerned. 
Non-current assets and businesses held for sale
Non-current assets and businesses classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and businesses are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale 
transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as having been met only when the sale is highly probable and 
the asset or business is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale which should be 
expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the Directors are required to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experiences and other factors that are considered to be relevant. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision 
affects both current and future periods. 
In applying the Group’s accounting policies as set out in note 2, management has made critical accounting judgements regarding the 
impairment of non-current assets, the quantification of provisions, the valuation of retirement benefit obligations and in respect of taxation. 
Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making assumptions and estimates, actual outcomes may differ from those assumptions  
and estimates. An analysis of the key sources of estimation uncertainty at the Balance Sheet date that have a significant risk of causing  
a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year is provided below.
Impairment of non-current assets
Goodwill and intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts might  
be impaired and at least annually. Such events and circumstances include the effects of restructuring initiated by management. 
To determine whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units  
to which goodwill and other intangible assets have been allocated. The value in use calculation requires management to estimate the future 
cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the net present value. Such 
calculations require judgement relating to the appropriate discount factors and long-term growth prevalent in a particular market as well as 
short and medium-term business plans. Management draw upon experience as well as external resources in making these judgements.
The carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets (not including computer software and development costs) at the Balance 
Sheet date was £271.8 million (31 December 2014: £2,376.5 million). At 31 December 2015 and 2014, the Group recognised no 
impairment loss in respect of these assets. 
Provisions
The quantification of certain liabilities within provisions (environmental remediation obligations and future costs and settlements in relation 
to certain legal claims) have been estimated using the best information available. However, such liabilities depend on the actions of third 
parties and on the specific circumstances pertaining to each obligation, neither of which is controlled by the Group. Although provisions 
are reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted for management’s best current estimates, the judgemental nature of these items means that 
future amounts settled may be different from those provided. Further details are set out in note 20.
Financials

Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015 3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued
Retirement benefit obligations
Retirement benefits are accounted for under IAS 19 (revised): “Employee benefits”. For defined benefit plans, obligations are measured  
at the discounted present value whilst plan assets are recorded at fair value. Because of changing market and economic conditions,  
the expenses and liabilities actually arising under the plans in the future may differ materially from the estimates made on the basis of  
these actuarial assumptions. Therefore, declining returns on equity markets and markets for fixed income instruments could necessitate 
additional contributions to the plans in order to cover future pension obligations. Also, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter 
life of participants may have an impact on the amount of pension income or expense recorded in the future.
The discount rate used to discount retirement benefit obligations to present value is derived from the yields of senior, high-quality corporate 
bonds at the Balance Sheet date. These generally include AA rated securities. The discount rate is based on the market yield of a portfolio 
of bonds whose weighted residual maturities approximately correspond to the duration necessary to cover the entire benefit obligation.
Pension and other retirement benefits are inherently long-term and future experience may differ from the actuarial assumptions used to 
determine the net charge for retirement benefit obligations. Note 23 to these consolidated financial statements describes the principal 
discount rate, earnings increase and pension retirement benefit obligation assumptions that have been used to determine the net charge 
for retirement benefit obligations in accordance with IAS 19 (revised): “Employee benefits”. The calculation of any charge relating to 
retirement benefit obligations is clearly dependent on the assumptions used, which reflects the exercise of judgement. The assumptions 
adopted are based on prior experience, market conditions and the advice of plan actuaries.
At 31 December 2015, the Group’s retirement benefit obligation deficit was £17 .2 million (31 December 2014: £218.5 million). 
Taxation
The Group is subject to income tax in most of the jurisdictions in which it operates. Management is required to exercise judgement in 
determining the Group’s provision for income taxes. Management’s judgement is required in estimating tax provisions where additional 
current tax may become payable in the future following the audit by the tax authorities of previously filed tax returns. Management’s 
judgement is also required as to whether a deferred tax asset should be recognised based on the availability of future taxable profits.  
While the Group aims to ensure that the estimates recorded are accurate, the actual amounts could be different from those expected.

Segment information is presented in accordance with IFRS 8: “Operating segments” which requires operating segments to be identified on 
the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reported to the Group’s Board in order to allocate resources 
to the segments and assess their performance. Following the disposal of Elster, as described in note 1, the Group’s only remaining 
reportable operating segment under IFRS 8 is the Energy segment which includes the Brush business, a specialist supplier of energy 
industrial products to the global market.
In addition, there are two central cost centres which are also separately reported to the Board: the central corporate cost centre which 
contains the Melrose Group head office costs and the central long term incentive plan (“LTIP”) cost centre which contains the costs 
associated with the five year Melrose Incentive Plan (granted on 11 April 2012) and the divisional management LTIPs that relate to the 
Energy segment.
The discontinued segment comprises the Bridon and Prelok businesses along with the Elster disposal group (note 1) in 2014 and the 
Prelok business and the Elster disposal group (note 1) in 2015. 
All continuing revenue in these financial statements relates to the Energy segment.
Transfer prices between business units are set on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
Included in revenue arising from the Energy segment are revenues of approximately £67 .0 million (2014: £88.2 million) which arose from 
sales to the Group’s largest customer. No other single customer contributed 10% or more to the Group’s revenue in either 2014 or 2015.
The Group’s geographical segments are determined by the location of the Group’s non-current assets and, for revenue, the location  
of external customers. Inter-segment sales are not material and have not been disclosed. 
The following tables present the results and certain asset and liability information regarding the Group’s operating segment and

Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015
Financials The most significant identified intangible asset is included within the Energy segment, is in relation to brands, has a carrying amount  
as at 31 December 2015 of £66.6 million and has a remaining amortisation period of 12 years and 6 months. At 31 December 2014, the 
most significant identified intangible asset was included within the Gas segment, was in relation to customer relationships, had a carrying 
amount of £582.8 million and had a remaining amortisation period of 17 years and 8 months. 
The goodwill generated as a result of major acquisitions represents the premium paid in excess of the fair value of all net assets, including 
intangible assets, identified at the point of acquisition. The carrying value of goodwill represents the initial value that the Directors believed 
could be added to the acquired businesses through the application of their specialist turnaround experience.
The goodwill arising on bolt on acquisitions is attributable to the anticipated profitability and cash flows arising from the businesses 
acquired, synergies as a result of the complementary nature of the business with existing Melrose businesses, the assembled workforce, 
technical expertise, knowhow, market share and geographical advantages afforded to the Group. 
The future improvements applied to the acquired businesses, achieved through a combination of revised strategic direction, operational 
improvements and investment, are expected to result in improved profitability of the acquired businesses during the period of ownership 
and are also expected to result in enhanced disposal proceeds when the acquired businesses are ultimately disposed. The combined 
value achieved from these improvements is expected to be in excess of the value of goodwill acquired.
Goodwill is allocated to the businesses, each of which comprises several cash-generating units. Following the disposal of Elster on 
29 December 2015, the remaining goodwill is attributable to the Brush business included within the Energy segment.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. Value in use 
calculations are used to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill allocated to each group of cash-generating units (“CGUs”) which 
use the latest approved forecasts extrapolated to perpetuity using growth rates shown below, and which do not exceed the long-term 
growth rate for the relevant market. No impairment was identified. The basis of these impairment tests and the key assumptions are  
set out in the table below:

(1) Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rates
Cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate specific to each CGU. Discount rates reflect the current market assessments  
of the time value of money and are based on the estimated cost of capital of each CGU. In determining the cost of equity, the Capital Asset 
Pricing Model (“CAPM”) has been used. Under CAPM, the cost of equity is determined by adding a risk premium to the risk free rate to 
reflect the additional risk associated with investing outside of lending to a country (e.g. the purchase of UK Gilts). The premium is based on  
an industry adjustment (“Beta”) to the expected return of the equity market above the risk free return. The relative risk adjustment reflects 
the risk inherent in each CGU relative to all other sectors and geographies on average.
(2) Assumptions applied in financial forecasts
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from financial budgets and mid-term plans approved by management. The key 
assumptions used in forecasting pre-tax cash flows relate to future budgeted revenue and operating margins likely to be achieved and  
the likely rates of long-term growth by market sector. Underlying factors in determining the values assigned to each key assumption  
are shown below:
Revenue growth and operating margins 
Revenue growth assumptions in the forecast period are based on financial budgets and mid-term plans approved by management, taking 
into account industry growth rates and management’s historical experience in the context of wider industry and economic conditions. 
Projected sales are built up with reference to markets and product categories. They incorporate past performance, historical growth rates, 
projections of developments in key markets, secured orders and orders likely to be achieved in the short to medium-term given trends  
in the relevant market sector.
Operating margins have been forecast based on historical levels achieved considering the likely impact of changing economic 
environments and competitive landscapes on volumes and revenues and the impact of management actions on costs. Projected margins 
reflect the impact of all initiated projects to improve operational efficiency and leverage scale. The projections do not include the impact of 
future restructuring projects to which the Group is not yet committed. Forecasts for other operating costs are based on inflation forecasts 
and supply and demand factors.
Brush is a supplier of turbogenerators for the power generation, industrial, Oil & Gas and offshore sectors and a leading supplier of 
switchgear, transformers and other power infrastructure equipment. The key drivers for revenues and operating margins are i) original 
equipment investments in the global power market, both new capacity (mainly emerging markets) and replacement capacity (mainly  
in mature markets), ii) growth in service requirements of a growing installed base, and iii) new product introduction. Independent forecasts 
of growth in these power generation markets have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions. Forecasts for other operating costs  
are based on inflation forecasts and supply and demand factors. 
(3) Long-term growth rates
Long-term growth rates are based on long-term economic forecasts for growth in the manufacturing sector in the geography in which  
the CGU operates. Long-term growth rates are determined using a blend of publicly available historical data and a long-term growth  
rate forecast published by external analysts and further take into account the international presence and the markets in which each 
business operates. 
Sensitivity analysis
The forecasts, prepared using a methodology required by IAS 36: “Impairment of assets”, show headroom of £103 million above the 
carrying amount. In accordance with IAS 36 a sensitivity analysis has been undertaken and the required increase in the discount rate  
to reduce the recoverable amount of the CGU to its carrying value is from 11.1% to 13.4%, an increase of over 20%.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the large number of customers and because they are unrelated to each other. Credit 
control procedures are implemented to ensure that sales are only made to organisations that are willing and able to pay for them. Such 
procedures include the establishment and review of customer credit limits and terms. The Group does not hold any collateral or any other 
credit enhancements over any of its trade receivables nor does it have a legal right of offset against any amounts owed by the Group to  
the counterparty.

As at 1 January 2015, the Group held a five-year multi-currency facility split between a £180 million Sterling term loan and three revolving 
credit facilities comprising a £741.5 million facility, a US $290 million facility and a €300 million facility. These facilities were due to mature  
on 11 July 2019.
On 29 December 2015, a proportion of the Elster disposal proceeds were used to repay the drawdowns on the term loan and revolving 
credit facilities. On the same day, the term loan, the US Dollar and the Euro revolving credit facilities were cancelled. The Sterling multi-
currency revolving credit facility was resized to £200 million and remained undrawn at 31 December 2015. The remaining unamortised 
finance costs relating to the facilities were charged in full to finance costs (note 7) in the Income Statement. 
Throughout the year, the Group remained compliant with all covenants under the facilities disclosed above. A number of companies 
continue to be guarantors under the remaining bank facility. 
Drawdowns under the remaining facility would bear interest at interbank rates of interest plus a margin determined by reference to  
the Group’s performance under its debt cover covenant ratio, ranging between 0.75% and 1.90% (31 December 2014: range between  
0.75% to 1.90%). The margin as at 31 December 2015 was 1.55% (31 December 2014: 1.30%).

The provision for surplus leasehold property costs represents the estimated net payments payable over the term of these leases together 
with any dilapidation costs. This is expected to result in cash expenditure over the next one to four years.
Environmental and legal costs provisions relate to the estimated remediation costs of pollution, soil and groundwater contamination  
at certain sites and estimated future costs and settlements in relation to legal claims. Due to their nature, it is not possible to predict 
precisely when these provisions will be utilised. 
Incentive plan related provisions are in respect of long term incentive plans for divisional senior management, expected to result in cash 
expenditure in the next four years.
The provision for warranty related costs represents the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the Group’s obligations.  
Warranty terms are, on average, between one and five years.
Other provisions relate primarily to costs that will be incurred in respect of restructuring programmes, usually resulting in cash spend  
within one year.
Where appropriate, provisions have been discounted using a discount rate of 3% (31 December 2014: 3%).

As at 31 December 2015, the Group had gross unused losses of £184.0 million (31 December 2014: £183.6 million) available for  
offset against future profits. At 31 December 2015, a £21.2 million deferred tax asset (31 December 2014: £10.4 million) in respect of  
£114.8 million (31 December 2014: £40.9 million) of these gross losses was recognised in the Balance Sheet. No asset was recognised  
in respect of the remaining losses due to the divisional and geographic split of anticipated future profit streams. The majority of these 
losses may be carried forward indefinitely subject to certain continuity of business requirements. 
In addition, an asset of £4.5 million (31 December 2014: £33.6 million) related to other temporary differences. 
A deferred tax liability of £0.3 million (31 December 2014: asset of £24.7 million) was recognised in respect of Group retirement benefit 
obligations. 
As at 31 December 2015, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries was 
£99.5 million (31 December 2014: £474.0 million) on which deferred tax liabilities not recognised were £nil (31 December 2014: £4.3 million). 
No liability was recognised in 2014 in respect of these differences because the Group was in a position to control the timing of the reversal 
of the temporary differences and it was probable that such differences would not reverse in the foreseeable future.
22. Share-based payments
Melrose Incentive Plan
The Company has 50,000 options (31 December 2014: 50,000 options) in issue which enable the holder of these options to subscribe

provided in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 68 to 70.
The estimated value of the 2012 Incentive Shares at 31 December 2015 was £64.0 million (31 December 2014: £44.7 million).

The Group recognised an IFRS 2 charge of £4.0 million (2014: £4.0 million) in the year ended 31 December 2015 in relation to the  
equity-settled 2012 Melrose Incentive Plan.
23. Retirement benefit obligations
Defined contribution plans
The Group operates defined contribution plans for qualifying employees across several jurisdictions. The assets of the plans are held 
separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
The total costs charged in relation to the continuing businesses during the year of £3.8 million (2014: £3.9 million) represent contributions 
payable to these plans by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
Defined benefit plans
The Group sponsors defined benefit plans for qualifying employees of certain subsidiaries. The funded defined benefit plans are 
administered by a separate fund that is legally separated from the Group. The trustees of the funds are required by law to act in the interest 
of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the plans. The trustees of the pension funds are responsible for the investment policy with 
regard to the assets of the fund.
On 29 December 2015, Honeywell International Inc. assumed ownership of the Elster defined benefit pension plans, along with the FKI UK 
Pension Plan and the McKechnie UK Pension Plan. The remaining defined benefit pension plans in the Group at 31 December 2015 were:
• The Brush Group (2013) (“Brush UK”) Pension Plan, which is defined benefit in type and is a funded plan. The plan is closed to new 
members and the accrual of future benefits for existing members. 
• The Brush Aftermarket North America, Inc. (“Brush US”) Group Pension Plan (formerly the FKI US Pension Plan) which is defined benefit 
in type and is a funded plan. The plan is closed to new members and the accrual of future benefits for existing members. During the year 
certain vested participants accepted lump sum offers resulting in an adjustment to past service cost of £2.2 million. 
The cost of the Group’s defined benefit plans are determined in accordance with IAS 19 (revised): “Employee benefits” using the advice  
of independent professionally qualified actuaries on the basis of formal actuarial valuations and using the projected unit credit method.  
In line with normal practice, these valuations are undertaken triennially in the UK and annually in the US.
The valuation of the Brush UK Pension Plan was based on a full actuarial valuation as of 31 December 2013, updated at 31 December 
2015 by independent actuaries. The Brush US Pension Plan valuation was based on a full actuarial valuation as of 31 December 2014, 
updated at 31 December 2015 by independent actuaries. 
The Group contributed £5. 1 million (2014: £5.0 million) to the continuing defined benefit pension plans in the year ended 31 December 2015.
Following agreement with the Brush Group (2013) Pension Plan Trustees, the Group has contributed £8.8 million early to the Brush UK 
Pension Plan in the year ending 31 December 2016. No contributions are expected to be made in the year ending 31 December 2017 .  
The Group expects to contribute approximately £0.1 million to the Brush US Pension Plan in the year ending 31 December 2016.

Mortality
Brush UK Pension Plan 
Mortality assumptions for the Brush UK Pension Plan, as at 31 December 2015, were based on the Self Administered Pension Scheme 
(“SAPS”) “S1” base tables with a scaling factor of 110%, which reflected the results of a mortality analysis carried out on the plan’s 
membership. Future improvements are in line with the Continuous Mortality Investigation (“CMI”) improvement model with a long-term  
rate of improvement of 1.25% p.a. for both males and females. 
The assumptions were that a member currently aged 65 will live on average for a further 21.4 years (31 December 2014: 21.6 years) if  
they are male and for a further 23.6 years (31 December 2014: 23.8 years) if they are female. For a member who retires in 2035 at age 65, 
the assumptions were that they will live for a further 23.0 years (31 December 2014: 23.2 years) after retirement if they are male and for  
a further 25.5 years (31 December 2014: 25.7 years) after retirement if they are female.
The mortality assumptions were consistent with those adopted for the full valuation as at 31 December 2013.
Brush US Pension Plan
The mortality assumptions adopted as at 31 December 2015 were set to reflect the Group’s best estimate view of life expectancies of 
members of the pension arrangement. Each assumption reflected the characteristics of the membership of the Brush US Pension Plan.
The assumptions were that a member currently aged 65 will live on average for a further 20.3 years (31 December 2014: 21.1 years) if  
they are male and for a further 22.3 years (31 December 2014: 23.3 years) if they are female. For a member who retires in 2035 at age 65, 
the assumptions were that they will live for a further 22.0 years (31 December 2014: 22.8 years) after retirement if they are male and for  
a further 23.9 years (31 December 2014: 24.9 years) after retirement if they are female.
The mortality assumptions were consistent with those adopted for the full valuation as at 31 December 2014.

The assets were well diversified and the majority of plan assets had quoted prices in active markets. All government bonds were issued  
by reputable governments and were generally AA rated or higher. Interest rate and inflation rate swaps were also employed to complement 
the role of fixed and index-linked bond holdings for liability risk management.
The trustees continually review whether the chosen investment strategy is appropriate with a view to providing the pension benefits  
and to ensure appropriate matching of risk and return profiles. The main strategic policies included maintaining an appropriate asset mix, 
managing interest rate sensitivity and maintaining an appropriate equity buffer. Investment results were regularly reviewed.
There was no self investment (other than in relevant tracker funds) either in the Group’s own financial instruments or property or other 
assets used by the Group.

Risks and sensitivities 
The defined benefit plans expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, currency risk, salary risk, interest rate risk and market 
(investment) risk. The Group is not exposed to any unusual, entity specific or plan specific risks.
A sensitivity analysis on the principal assumptions used to measure the plan liabilities at the year end was as follows:
Change in

plan liabilities
£m
Increase/

Assumed life expectancy at age 65 (rate of mortality) Increase by 1 year (11.1) n/a
Decrease by 1 year 11.0 n/a
(1)  The inflation sensitivity encompasses the impact on pension increases, where applicable.
The sensitivity analysis above was determined based on reasonable possible changes to the respective assumptions, while holding all 
other assumptions constant. There has been no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis from 
prior years.
The sensitivities were based on the relevant assumptions and membership profile as at 31 December 2015 and were applied to the 
obligations at the end of the reporting period. Whilst the analysis does not take account of the full distribution of cash flows expected,  
it does provide an approximation to the sensitivity of the assumptions shown. Extrapolation of these results beyond the sensitivity figures 
shown may not be appropriate and the sensitivity analysis presented may not be representative of the actual change in the defined  
benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions  
may be correlated.

The Group’s principal financial assets were cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and derivative financial assets which represented 
the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Group’s credit risk on cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial assets was limited because the counterparties were  
AAA rated Sterling denominated money market funds and banks with strong credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.  
The Group’s credit risk was primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet  
were net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on prior experience and their assessment 
of the current economic environment. Note 16 provides further details regarding the recovery of trade receivables.
Capital risk
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern. 
The capital structure of the Group as at 31 December 2015 consisted of cash and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, 
comprising Issued share capital, Reserves and Retained earnings as disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. 
Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy for managing liquidity rate risk is set out in the Finance Director’s review.
Fair values
The Directors consider that the financial assets and liabilities have fair values not materially different to the carrying values.

Hedge of net investments in foreign entities
Following the disposal of Elster, on 29 December 2015, the Company repaid all external borrowings. Consequently as at 31 December 2015, 
the Group had no interest-bearing loans to designate as hedges of net investments.

£0.6 million for Sterling, £nil for US Dollar and £nil for Euros.
Interest rate risk management
The Group’s policy for managing interest rate risk is set out in the Finance Director’s review.
All interest rate swaps were closed out on the completion of the Elster disposal due to all external borrowings being repaid. 
Foreign currency risk
The Group’s policy for managing foreign currency risk is set out in the Finance Director’s review on pages 25 and 26.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
Currency risks are defined by IFRS 7: “Financial instruments: Disclosures” as the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial 
asset or liability will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
The following table details the transactional impact of hypothetical changes in foreign exchange rates on financial assets and liabilities  
at the Balance Sheet date, illustrating the increase/(decrease) in Group operating profit caused by a 10 cent strengthening of the US Dollar 
and Euro against Sterling compared to the year end spot rate. The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular other foreign 
currency exchange rates, remain constant. The Group operates in a range of different currencies, and those with a notable impact  
are noted here:

2015, the Group had no interest-bearing loans to designate as hedges of net investments. At 31 December 2014, the change in equity due 
to a 10 cent strengthening of the US Dollar and Euro against Sterling for the translation of net investment hedging instruments would have 
been a decrease of £10.8 million and £12.7 million respectively. However, there would have been no overall effect on equity because there 
would be an offset in the currency translation of the foreign operation.

Fair value measurements recognised in the Balance Sheet 
Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest 
rates matching the maturities of the contracts.
Interest rate swap contracts are measured using yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.

The fair value of these financial instruments are derived from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, 
either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) and they are therefore categorised within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy 
set out in IFRS 13: “Fair value measurement”. The Group’s policy is to recognise transfers into and out of the different fair value hierarchy 
levels at the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer to occur. There have been no transfers between levels  
in the year.

Financials On 19 November 2015, a scheme of arrangement approved by the High Court of England and Wales became effective and resulted  
in New Melrose Industries PLC (subsequently renamed Melrose Industries PLC on 19 November 2015) becoming the new holding 
company of Melrose Industries PLC (subsequently renamed Melrose Holdings Limited on 19 November 2015) and its subsidiaries.  
The arrangement resulted in the issue of 1 new 26.5 pence New Melrose Industries PLC ordinary share for each 7/55 pence  
Melrose Industries PLC ordinary share. New Melrose Industries PLC consequently issued 995,206,966 ordinary shares with  
a total nominal value of £263.8 million. 
As explained in note 1, the ordinary share capital for the year ended 31 December 2014 has been restated to reflect the nominal  
value of the ordinary shares of New Melrose Industries PLC at the date of which New Melrose Industries PLC became the new holding  
company. The nominal value of each ordinary share in issue at 31 December 2014 has therefore been restated from 7/55 pence to  
26.5 pence and the number of shares in issue has been restated from 1,071,761,339 to 995,206,966. 
On 23 November 2015, the nominal value of each ordinary share of New Melrose Industries PLC was reduced from 26.5 pence to  
1 penny and resulted in a transfer of £253.8 million to Retained earnings.
Translation reserve 
The Translation reserve contains exchange differences on the translation of subsidiaries with a functional currency other than Sterling  
and exchange gains or losses on the translation of liabilities that hedge the Company’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries.
Hedging reserve
The Hedging reserve represents the cumulative fair value gains and losses on derivative financial instruments for which cash flow hedge 
accounting has been applied.
Merger reserve and Other reserves
The Merger reserve represents the excess of fair value over nominal value of shares issued in consideration for the acquisition of 
subsidiaries. Other reserves comprise accumulated adjustments in respect of Group reconstructions.

under non-cancellable operating leases during the year was primarily as a result of the disposal of Elster.

and machinery.

At a general meeting of New Melrose Industries PLC (subsequently renamed Melrose Industries PLC on 19 November 2015) held on 
2 October 2015 and a general meeting of Melrose Industries PLC (subsequently renamed Melrose Holdings Limited on 19 November 2015) 
held on 29 October 2015, shareholders approved a Return of Capital of between £2.0 billion and £2.5 billion following the completion of  
the disposal of Elster. On 29 December 2015, the Company announced that the Return of Capital would be 240 pence per ordinary share 
totalling £2,388.5 million. 
‘B’ shares with a total value of £2,388.5 million were created on 26 January 2016 resulting in a corresponding reduction in the Merger 
reserve. The ‘B’ shares were cancelled on 27 January 2016 and capital return payments representing the nominal value of the ‘B’ shares 
(240 pence each) were made to shareholders on 5 February 2016.
Alongside the capital return, on 28 January 2016 the number of ordinary shares in issue was consolidated in a ratio of 7 for 48 in order  
to maintain comparability of the Company’s share price before and after the capital return. On 28 January 2016 the number of ordinary 
shares in issue became 145,134,353 each with a nominal value of 48/7 pence.
Further details of the capital return are provided on pages 50 and 51 in the Directors’ Report.
30. Contingent liabilities
As a result of acquisitions made by the Group, certain contingent legal, environmental, warranty and tax liabilities were identified  
either at the time of acquisition or as part of the completion of the acquisition accounting. Whilst it is difficult to reasonably estimate  
the ultimate outcome of these claims, the Directors’ best estimate has been included in the Balance Sheet where they existed at the time 
of acquisition and hence were recognised in accordance with IFRS 3: “Business combinations”. Where a provision has been recognised, 
information regarding the different categories of such liabilities and the amount and timing of outflows is included within note 20.
The Group has contingent liabilities representing guarantees and contract bonds given in the ordinary course of business on behalf  
of trading subsidiaries. No losses are anticipated to arise on these contingent liabilities. The Group does not have any other significant 
contingent liabilities.

Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015
Financials 1. Significant accounting policies
Melrose Industries PLC (“the Company”) was incorporated on 29 September 2015 as New Melrose Industries PLC. The Company 
changed its name to Melrose Industries PLC and was admitted to the London Stock Exchange as the new listed holding company  
of the Melrose Group on 19 November 2015. 
Basis of accounting
Melrose Industries PLC is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act. The address of the registered  
office is given on the back cover. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic Report on  
pages 02 to 44.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 
102 (FRS 102) issued by the Financial Reporting Council. 
The functional currency of Melrose Industries PLC is considered to be pounds Sterling because that is the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the Company operates. 
Melrose Industries PLC meets the definition of a qualifying entity under FRS 102 and has therefore taken advantage of the disclosure 
exemptions available to it in respect of its separate financial statements. Melrose Industries PLC is consolidated in its Group financial 
statements. Exemptions have been taken in these separate Company financial statements in relation to share-based payments, 
presentation of a cash flow statement and remuneration of key management personnel. 
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the period.
Going concern
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the Directors’ statement of going concern on page 26 of the Finance 
Director’s review.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are measured at cost less impairment. 
For investments in subsidiaries acquired for consideration including the issue of shares qualifying for merger relief, cost is measured  
by reference to the nominal value of the shares issued plus fair value of other consideration. Any premium is ignored. 
Impairment of assets
Assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. If there is objective evidence of impairment, an impairment 
loss is recognised in profit or loss as described below.
Non-financial assets
An asset is impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after initial recognition, the 
estimated recoverable value of the asset has been reduced. The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs  
to sell and its value in use. 
Where indicators exist for a decrease in impairment loss, the prior impairment loss is tested to determine reversal. An impairment loss is 
reversed on an individual impaired asset to the extent that the revised recoverable value does not lead to a revised carrying amount higher 
than the carrying value had no impairment been recognised. 
Share-based payments
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. The required disclosures are included in the Group 
consolidated financial statements.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non-market based vesting conditions) at the date 
of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over 
the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market 
based vesting conditions.
Notes to the Company Balance Sheet
Financials
139
Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2015 1. Significant accounting policies continued
Fair value is measured by use of the Black Scholes pricing model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on the 
Directors’ best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Where equity-settled share-based payments are made available to employees of the Company’s subsidiaries, these are treated as 
increases in equity over the vesting period of the award with a corresponding increase in the Company’s investment in subsidiaries.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates 
and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the Balance Sheet date where 
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the 
Balance Sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the Company’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial 
statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are 
recognised in the financial statements. 
2. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Company’s accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions 
are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision 
affects both current and future periods.
Management are required to exercise their judgement when assessing assets for indicators of impairment and determining what the 
appropriate valuation should be. At 31 December 2015, the Company’s principal asset, its investment in subsidiary undertakings,  
had a carrying amount of £2,764.8 million. Management use their judgement in estimating the recoverable amount of each investment.  
In addition to considering the current value of each investment’s net asset position, management also consider future performance which 
may require management to exercise judgement relating to future cash flows, discount factors and long-term growth rates. Management 
draw upon experience as well as external resources in making these judgements.
3. Profit for the period
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company has elected not to present its own Profit and Loss Account for the 
period. Melrose Industries PLC reported a loss for the financial period ended 31 December 2015 of £0.7 million.
The auditor’s remuneration for audit services to the Company is disclosed in note 7 to the Group consolidated financial statements.

On 19 November 2015, a scheme of arrangement approved by the High Court of England and Wales became effective and resulted in 
New Melrose Industries PLC (subsequently renamed Melrose Industries PLC on 19 November 2015) becoming the new holding company 
of Melrose Industries PLC (subsequently renamed Melrose Holdings Limited on 19 November 2015) and its subsidiaries. The arrangement 
resulted in the issue of 1 new 26.5 pence New Melrose Industries PLC ordinary share for each 7/55 pence Melrose Industries PLC  
ordinary share. New Melrose Industries PLC consequently issued 995,206,966 ordinary shares with a total nominal value of £263.8 million. 
The market capitalisation of the Melrose Group at that date was £2,764.7 million. The difference between the market capitalisation and  
the total nominal value of shares issued of £2,500.9 million has been taken to the Merger reserve. 
On 20 November 2015, Melrose Industries PLC received Court confirmation of the reduction in its Issued share capital pursuant to  
which the nominal value of each ordinary share was reduced from 26.5 pence to 1 penny effective on 23 November 2015. This resulted  
in Issued share capital decreasing by £253.8 million and Retained earnings increasing by an equivalent amount.
Details of share-based payments are given in note 22 to the Group consolidated financial statements.

At a general meeting of the Company held on 2 October 2015, shareholders approved a Return of Capital of between £2.0 billion and 
£2.5 billion following the completion of the disposal of Elster. On 29 December 2015, the Company announced that the Return of Capital 
would be 240 pence per ordinary share totalling £2,388.5 million. 
‘B’ shares with a total value of £2,388.5 million were created on 26 January 2016 resulting in a corresponding reduction in the Merger 
reserve. The ‘B’ shares were cancelled on 27 January 2016 and capital return payments representing the nominal value of the ‘B’ shares 
(240 pence each) were made to shareholders on 5 February 2016.
Alongside the capital return, on 28 January 2016 the number of ordinary shares in issue was consolidated in a ratio of 7 for 48 in order  
to maintain comparability of the Company’s share price before and after the capital return. On 28 January 2016, the number of ordinary 
shares in issue became 145,134,353 each with a nominal value of 48/7 pence.
As a consequence of the Return of Capital, the carrying value of the investment in subsidiaries was revised to be in line with the remaining 
value of the Group.

may either be held as treasury shares or cancelled by  
the Company, depending on which course of action is 
considered by the Directors to be in the best interests  
of shareholders at the time.
17.  That a general meeting other than an Annual General Meeting 
may be called on not less than 14 clear days’ notice.
Recommendation
The Board believes that each of the resolutions to be proposed at 
the Annual General Meeting is in the best interests of the Company 
and its shareholders as a whole. Accordingly, the Directors 
unanimously recommend that ordinary shareholders vote in favour 
of all of the resolutions proposed, as the Directors intend to do in 
respect of their own beneficial holdings.

Annual Report 2015 Explanatory notes to the proposed resolutions
Resolutions 1 to 14 (inclusive) are proposed as ordinary resolutions, 
which means that for each of those resolutions to be passed, more 
than half the votes cast must be cast in favour of the resolution. 
Resolutions 15 to 17 (inclusive) are proposed as special resolutions, 
which means that for each of those resolutions to be passed,  
at least three-quarters of the votes cast must be cast in favour  
of the resolution.
Resolution 1 – Receipt of 2015 Annual Report and financial 
statements
The Directors are required to lay the Company’s financial 
statements, the strategic report and the Directors’ and auditor’s 
reports on those financial statements (collectively, the “2015 Annual 
Report”) before shareholders each year at the Annual General 
Meeting (“AGM”). 
Resolutions 2 and 3 – Approval of Directors’ remuneration 
report and Directors’ remuneration policy
The Directors’ remuneration report (the “Directors’ Remuneration 
Report”) is presented in three sections:
• the annual statement from the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee; 
• the annual report on remuneration; and
• the Directors’ remuneration policy (the “Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy”).
The annual statement from the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee, set out on pages 64 to 67 of the 2015 Annual Report, 
summarises, for the year ended 31 December 2015, the major 
decisions taken on Directors’ remuneration, any substantial 
changes relating to Directors’ remuneration made during the year 
and the context in which those changes occurred and decisions 
that have been taken.
The annual report on remuneration, set out on pages 68 to 76  
of the 2015 Annual Report, provides details of the remuneration 
paid to Directors in respect of the year ended 31 December 2015, 
including base salary, taxable benefits, short-term incentives, 
long-term incentives vested in the year, pension-related benefits, 
any other items in the nature of remuneration and any sum(s) 
recovered or withheld during the year in respect of amounts paid  
in earlier years. 
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy, set out on pages 76 to 81 of 
the 2015 Annual Report, provides details of the Company’s policy 
on Directors’ remuneration (including the policy on payments for 
loss of office). 
The Directors’ Remuneration Report (other than the part containing 
the Directors’ Remuneration Policy) is subject to an annual advisory 
shareholder vote by way of an ordinary resolution. Resolution 2 is  
to approve the Directors’ Remuneration Report (other than the part 
containing the Directors’ Remuneration Policy).
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy is subject to a binding 
shareholder vote by way of an ordinary resolution at least once 
every three years. The policy was approved by shareholders at  
the AGM held on 13 May 2014 in respect of the former holding 
company of the Melrose Group. However, due to the introduction  
of a new holding company for the Melrose Group during 2015,  
the Company is required to seek shareholder approval for the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy in respect of the new holding 
company. The Directors’ Remuneration Policy set out on pages  
76 to 81 of the 2015 Annual Report reflects the policy approved  
by shareholders at the AGM held on 13 May 2014 (to the extent  
that the policy remains applicable going forwards).
All remuneration payments and payments for loss of office made  
by the Company to the current and any former Directors must be 
consistent with the Directors’ Remuneration Policy or, if inconsistent 
with the Directors’ Remuneration Policy, must have been separately 
approved by way of an ordinary resolution of the shareholders in 
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Act. 
Resolution 3 is to approve the Directors’ Remuneration Policy.  
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy will, subject to shareholder 
approval, take effect from the conclusion of the AGM. 
If the Directors’ Remuneration Policy is approved and remains 
unchanged, it will be valid for up to three years without new 
shareholder approval. If the Company wishes to change the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy, it must first seek approval  
of the amended policy from the shareholders. If the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy is not approved for any reason, the Company 
will, if and to the extent permitted by the Act, continue to make 
payments (including payments for loss of office) to the current and 
any former Directors in accordance with any existing contractual 
arrangements and will seek the approval of a proposed revised 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy from the shareholders as soon  
as practicable.
Resolution 4 – Declaration of final dividend
The Board is recommending, and shareholders are being asked  
to approve, the declaration of a final dividend of 2.6 pence per 
ordinary share for the year ended 31 December 2015. The final 
dividend will, subject to shareholder approval, be paid on 16 May 
2016 to the holders of ordinary shares whose names are recorded 
on the register of members of the Company at the close of 
business on 8 April 2016. 
Resolutions 5 to 11 (inclusive) – Re-election of Directors
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code (the 
“Code”) and the Company’s articles of association (the “Articles”), 
every Director (with the exception of the senior non-executive 
director, Perry Crosthwaite, who will retire at the conclusion of  
the AGM and will not stand for re-election) will stand for re-election 
at the AGM. Biographical details of each Director can be found  
on pages 48 and 49 of the 2015 Annual Report. All of the non-
executive Directors standing for re-election are currently considered 
independent under the Code. 
Resolution 12 – Re-appointment of auditor 
The Company is required to appoint auditors at each general 
meeting at which accounts are laid before shareholders, to hold 
office until the next such meeting. 
The Audit Committee has reviewed the effectiveness, performance, 
independence and objectivity of the existing external auditor, 
Deloitte LLP , on behalf of the Board, and concluded that the 
external auditor was in all respects effective.
This resolution proposes the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP  
until the conclusion of the next AGM.

Shareholder information Resolution 13 – Authority to agree auditor’s remuneration
This resolution seeks authority for the Audit Committee to 
determine the level of the auditor’s remuneration. 
Resolution 14 – Authority to allot shares
This resolution seeks shareholder approval to grant the Directors 
the authority to allot shares in the Company, or to grant rights  
to subscribe for or convert any securities into shares in the 
Company (“Rights”), pursuant to section 551 of the Act (“Section 
551 authority”). The authority contained in paragraph (A) of the 
resolution will be limited to an aggregate nominal amount of 
£3,317 ,356, being approximately one-third of the Company’s  
issued ordinary share capital as at 23 March 2016 (being the  
last business day prior to the publication of this notice). 
In line with guidance issued by the Association of British Insurers, 
paragraph (B) of this resolution would give the Directors authority  
to allot shares in the Company or grant Rights in connection with  
a rights issue up to aggregate nominal amount of £6,634,713, 
representing approximately two-thirds of the Company’s issued 
ordinary share capital as at 23 March 2016, as reduced by the 
aggregate nominal amount of any allotments or grants under 
paragraph (A) of this resolution.
The Company does not hold any shares in treasury.
If approved, the Section 551 authority shall, unless renewed, 
revoked or varied by the Company, expire at the end of the 
Company’s next AGM after the resolution is passed or, if earlier,  
at the close of business on 30 June 2017 . The exception to this is 
that the Directors may allot shares or grant Rights after the authority 
has expired in connection with an offer or agreement made or 
entered into before the authority expired. The Directors have no 
present intention to exercise the Section 551 authority.
Resolution 15 – Partial disapplication of pre-emption rights
This resolution seeks shareholder approval to grant the Directors 
the power to allot equity securities of the Company pursuant to 
sections 570 and 573 of the Act (the “Section 570 and 573 power”) 
without first offering them to existing shareholders in proportion  
to their existing shareholdings.
The power is limited to allotments for cash in connection  
with pre-emptive offers, subject to any arrangements that the 
Directors consider appropriate to deal with fractions and overseas 
requirements and otherwise for cash up to a maximum nominal 
value of £995,206, representing approximately 10% of the 
Company’s issued ordinary share capital as at 23 March 2016.
The Directors intend to adhere to the guidelines set out in the 
Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of Principles (as updated in March 
2015) and not to allot shares for cash on a non pre-emptive basis 
pursuant to the authority in Resolution 15(B):
• in excess of an amount equal to 5% of the Company’s issued 
ordinary share capital; or
• in excess of an amount equal to 7 .5% of the Company’s issued 
ordinary share capital in a rolling three-year period, in each case 
other than in connection with an acquisition or specified capital 
investment which is announced contemporaneously with the 
allotment or which has taken place in the preceding six-month 
period and is disclosed in the announcement of the allotment.
If approved, the Section 570 and 573 power shall apply until the 
end of the Company’s next AGM after the resolution is passed or,  
if earlier, until the close of business on 30 June 2017 . The exception 
to this is that the Directors may allot equity securities after the 
power has expired in connection with an offer or agreement made 
or entered into before the power expired. The Directors have no 
present intention to exercise the Section 570 and 573 power.
Resolution 16 – Authority to purchase own shares
This resolution seeks shareholder approval to grant the Company 
the authority to purchase its own shares pursuant to sections 693 
and 701 of the Act. 
This authority is limited to an aggregate maximum number of 
14,513,435 ordinary shares, representing 10% of the Company’s 
issued ordinary share capital as at 23 March 2016. 
The maximum price which may be paid for an ordinary share  
will be an amount which is not more than the higher of (i) 5% above  
the average of the middle market quotation for an ordinary share  
as derived from the Daily Official List of the London Stock Exchange 
for the five business days immediately preceding the day on which 
the ordinary share is purchased; and (ii) the higher of the price of the  
last independent trade and the highest current independent bid on 
the trading venue where the purchase is carried out (in each case, 
exclusive of expenses). 
If approved, the authority shall, unless varied, revoked or renewed, 
expire at the end of the Company’s next AGM after the resolution  
is passed or, if earlier, at the close of business on 30 June 2017 .  
The Directors have no present intention of exercising all or any of 
the powers conferred by this resolution and will only exercise their 
authority if it is in the interests of shareholders generally.
Resolution 17 – Notice period for general meetings  
other than AGMs
This resolution seeks shareholder approval to allow the Company  
to continue to call general meetings (other than AGMs) on 14 clear 
days’ notice. In accordance with the Act, as amended by the 
Companies (Shareholders’ Rights) Regulations 2009, the notice 
period required for general meetings of the Company is 21 days 
unless shareholders approve a shorter notice period (subject to  
a minimum period of 14 clear days). In accordance with the Act,  
the Company must make a means of electronic voting available to 
all shareholders for that meeting in order to be able to call a general 
meeting on less than 21 clear days’ notice. 
The Company intends to only use the shorter notice period  
where this flexibility is merited by the purpose of the meeting and  
is considered to be in the interests of shareholders generally, and  
not as a matter of routine. AGMs will continue to be held on at least 
21 clear days’ notice.
The approval will be effective until the Company’s next AGM, when 
it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed.

Annual Report 2015 Explanatory notes as to the proxy, voting and attendance 
procedures at the Annual General Meeting (AGM)
1.  The holders of ordinary shares in the Company are entitled  
to attend the AGM and are entitled to vote. A member entitled 
to attend, speak and vote at the AGM is also entitled to appoint 
a proxy to exercise all or any of his/her rights to attend, speak 
and vote at the AGM in his/her place. Such a member may 
appoint more than one proxy, provided that each proxy is 
appointed to exercise the rights attached to different shares.  
A proxy need not be a member of the Company.
2.  A form of proxy is enclosed with this notice. To be effective, a 
form of proxy must be completed and returned, together with 
any power of attorney or authority under which it is completed 
or a certified copy of such power or authority, so that it is 
received by the Company’s registrars at the address specified 
on the form of proxy not less than 48 hours (excluding any  
part of a day that is not a working day) before the stated time  
for holding the meeting (or, in the event of an adjournment,  
not less than 48 hours before the stated time of the adjourned 
meeting (excluding any part of a day which is not a working 
day)). Returning a completed form of proxy will not preclude  
a member from attending the meeting and voting in person.
3.  Any person to whom this notice is sent who is a person 
nominated under section 146 of the Act to enjoy information 
rights (a “Nominated Person”) may, under an agreement 
between him/her and the shareholder by whom he/she was 
nominated, have a right to be appointed (or to have someone 
else appointed) as a proxy for the AGM. If a Nominated Person 
has no such proxy appointment right or does not wish to 
exercise it, he/she may, under any such agreement, have  
a right to give instructions to the shareholder as to the exercise 
of voting rights. The statement of the rights of shareholders in 
relation to the appointment of proxies in paragraphs 1 and 2 
above does not apply to Nominated Persons. The rights 
described in paragraphs 1 and 2 can only be exercised by  
the holders of ordinary shares in the Company.
4.  To be entitled to attend and vote at the AGM (and for the 
purposes of the determination by the Company of the number 
of votes they may cast), members must be entered on the 
Company’s register of members by 6.00 p.m. on 9 May 2016  
(or, in the event of an adjournment, on the date which is two 
days, excluding any day which is not a working day, before  
the time of the adjourned meeting). Changes to entries on  
the register of members after this time shall be disregarded  
in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at  
the meeting.
5.  As at 23 March 2016 (being the last business day prior to the 
publication of this notice), the Company’s issued share capital 
consists of 145,134,353 ordinary shares of 48/7 pence each, 
carrying one vote each.
6.  CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies 
through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may 
do so by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual 
(available at www.euroclear.com). CREST Personal Members 
or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST 
members who have appointed a service provider(s), should 
refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who 
will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
7.  In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using  
the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST  
message (a “CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be properly 
authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland 
Limited’s specifications, and must contain the information 
required for such instruction, as described in the CREST 
Manual. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the 
appointment of a proxy or is an amendment to the instruction 
given to a previously appointed proxy, must, in order to be  
valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent 
(ID RA19) by 11.30 a.m. on 9 May 2016. For this purpose, the 
time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the 
time stamp applied to the message by the CREST Application 
Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the 
message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by 
CREST. After this time any change of instructions to proxies 
appointed through CREST should be communicated to the 
appointee through other means.
8.  CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST 
sponsors, or voting service providers should note that  
Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited does not make available special 
procedures in CREST for any particular message. Normal 
system timings and limitations will, therefore, apply in relation  
to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility 
of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST 
member is a CREST Personal Member, or sponsored member, 
or has appointed a voting service provider, to procure that  
his/her CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) 
such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message  
is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular 
time. In this connection, CREST members and, where 
applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting system providers 
are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST 
Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system 
and timings.
9.  The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction  
in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5) (a) of the 
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
10.  Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more 
corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all  
of its powers as a member provided that they do not do so in 
relation to the same shares.

Shareholder information 11.  Under section 527 of the Act, members meeting the threshold 
requirements set out in that section have the right to require  
the Company to publish on a website a statement setting out 
any matter relating to: (i) the audit of the Company’s accounts 
(including the auditor’s report and the conduct of the audit)  
that are to be laid before the AGM; or (ii) any circumstance 
connected with an auditor of the Company ceasing to hold 
office since the previous meeting at which annual accounts  
and reports were laid in accordance with section 437 of the Act. 
The Company may not require the shareholders requesting any 
such website publication to pay its expenses in complying with 
sections 527 or 528 of the Act. Where the Company is required 
to place a statement on a website under section 527 of the Act, 
it must forward the statement to the Company’s auditor not 
later than the time when it makes the statement available on  
the website. The business which may be dealt with at the AGM 
includes any statement that the Company has been required 
under section 527 of the Act to publish on a website.
12.  Any member holding ordinary shares attending the meeting  
has the right to ask questions. The Company must answer any 
such questions relating to the business being dealt with at the 
meeting but no such answer need be given if: (i) to do so would 
interfere unduly with the preparation for the meeting or involve 
the disclosure of confidential information; (ii) the answer has 
already been given on a website in the form of an answer to  
a question; and/or (iii) it is undesirable in the interests of the 
Company or the good order of the meeting that the question  
be answered.
13.  Voting at the AGM will be by poll. The Chairman will invite  
each shareholder, corporate representative and proxy present 
at the meeting to complete a poll card indicating how they wish 
to cast their votes in respect of each resolution. In addition, the 
Chairman will cast the votes for which he has been appointed 
as proxy. Poll cards will be collected during the meeting.  
Once the results have been verified by the Company’s registrar, 
Equiniti, they will be notified to the UK Listing Authority, 
announced through a Regulatory Information Service and  
will be available to view on the Company’s website.

at www.sharevote.co.uk. In order to register your vote online, 
you will need to enter the Voting ID, Task ID and Shareholder

who have already registered with Equiniti’s online portfolio 
service, Shareview, can appoint their proxy electronically by 
logging on to their portfolio at www.shareview.co.uk and

Share fraud warning
Many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning 
investment matters. Fraudsters use persuasive and high-pressure tactics to lure investors into scams. They may offer to sell shares that 
turn out to be worthless or non-existent, or to buy shares at an inflated price in return for an upfront payment. For more detailed information 
on this kind of activity or to report a scam, please call the Financial Conduct Authority’s Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768 or visit

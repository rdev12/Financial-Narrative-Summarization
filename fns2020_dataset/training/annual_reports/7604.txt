Well Construction 
Products and services provided in the drilling phase of 
exploration and production.
The company provides premium casing and Oil Country 
Tubular Goods (“OCTG”) in the construction of the 
wellbore; in-house design (Seal-Lock™) and threading of 
premium connections and associated technologies, which 
are well suited to the deeper and more challenging offshore 
environments as well as onshore shale plays. 
Hunting Innova’s substantial electronics capability adds to this 
core mechanical competence and together with the recent 
acquisitions of Dearborn, Doffing and Specialty, this has led to 
the formation of an Advanced Manufacturing Group to build a 
single source MWD/LWD capability.
The company is also an innovator in the design, manufacture 
and leasing of mud motors and associated drilling tools, 
especially for horizontal wells typical of shale formations.
Well Completion 
Manufacturing accessories and completion equipment for the 
world’s principal producing regions.
Providing products, proprietary technologies, engineering 
expertise and services below the wellhead to allow the flow 
of hydrocarbons to the surface. Premium tubing, connections 
and OCTG related goods and services are manufactured by 
38 company facilities around the world. OEM and in-house 
designed wellbore tools are used by the major energy service 
companies and international operators. Clear-Run™ technology 
provides a significant advantage for running tubing in zero 
emission environments.
The acquisition of Titan during the year projects the company 
into the design, manufacture and distribution of perforating 
systems, energetics, associated tools and MWD/LWD Wireline 
logging equipment. Titan extends the company product line 
by 43,000 parts alone.
Well Intervention 
Equipment manufacture and supply for the maintenance and 
restoration of producing oil and gas wells from company 
distribution points around the world. 
The organic growth of this division, coupled with targeted 
acquisitions, has allowed for the integration of an extensive 
range of pressure control equipment technologies, Wireline 
and Slickline products, together with intervention expertise to 
complement the Hunting range of well intervention tools.
The subsea technologies capability is being expanded to 
include chemical injection systems, hydraulic valves and 
couplings. This has been enhanced by the growing activities  
of Hunting Welltonic who are widely regarded as one of  
the leading Thru-Tubing service providers at the forefront  
of supplying down hole solutions to the world’s coiled  
tubing operators.

Chairman’ s Statement
Making significant strides
“  We are well 
placed to take 
advantage of this 
growth and look 
forward to the 
opportunities and 
challenges ahead.”
The Group has once again produced excellent 
results in a year of continuing expansion. Profit 
before tax from continuing operations and before 
amortisation and exceptional items in 201 1 was 
£79.8m (2010 – £47 .0m), a 70% increase. After 
amortisation and exceptional items, profit before 
tax from continuing operations was £38.8m 
(2010 – £33.0m). 
Outstanding acquisition opportunities arose 
and the Group took advantage of these, with the 
support of our banks and equity shareholders, 
as well as existing cash, to buy four companies 
– Titan being the largest purchase we have ever 
made. Despite this and the continuing investment 
in our manufacturing plants and service facilities, 
the balance sheet remains strong and healthy.
Industry trends identified in previous years 
continued in 201 1, with high oil prices, low 
natural gas prices (at least in North America) 
and an even more emphatic rush to develop 
unconventional, especially shale, resources.
Global financial worries have not seriously 
impacted the demand for energy in most of our 
markets, so that customers have continued with 
their development and investment programmes 
– leading to high demand for our products.
Activity levels in the Gulf of Mexico, an 
important market for us, are beginning to 
recover to somewhere near their pre-2010 levels. 
Meanwhile, the abundant resources available in 
shale deposits onshore in the United States and 
elsewhere are being tapped at an increasing rate, 
with the emphasis moving to liquids for reasons 
of price.

“  C u s t om er s h a v e 
continued with 
their development 
and investment 
programmes 
– leading to high 
demand for 
our products.”
A higher proportion of wells than ever before are 
being drilled horizontally and the Group has a 
comprehensive suite of products to support this 
trend. Our 201 1 acquisitions give us even more 
strength in MWD (“measurement-while-drilling”) 
and LWD (“logging-while-drilling”) applications, 
while the growing demand for fracturing shale 
deposits is well served by Hunting Titan, the 
largest acquisition.
The Well Construction operations of our principal 
operating company, Hunting Energy Services, 
contributed strongly in a very much improved 
year while the largest activity, Well Completion, 
again performed magnificently. Well Intervention 
had another profitable year. It is notable that 
Asian activities and markets became ever more 
important to us.
We have continued our capital spending 
programme in all areas of Hunting Energy 
Services activity, with a particular emphasis on 
advanced production machinery to improve 
efficiency and to reduce costs.
Outside the Hunting Energy Services stable, 
Gibson Shipbrokers had a successful year in 
highly volatile markets.
Diluted earnings per share from continuing 
operations, before amortisation and exceptional 
items, were 38.7p, an increase of 70% on the 
previous year. Reported diluted earnings per 
share from continuing operations were 20.3p 
(2010 – 15.4p). 
We are recommending a final dividend for 201 1 
of 1 1.0p per share, payable on 2 July 2012 to 
shareholders on the register on 8 June 2012, giving 
a total of 15.0p for the year, a 25% increase.
George Helland, a non-executive Director since 
2001, retired from the Company during the year. 
The Board thanks him for his thorough and 
constructive work, particularly in the role of 
Remuneration Committee Chairman.
Andrew Szescila, a US citizen and former Chief 
Operating Officer of Baker Hughes, joined the 
Board as a non-executive Director. David Barr, 
who had been appointed a non-executive 
Director at the beginning of the year, left us 
to take up an executive position elsewhere.
Your Company has had another excellent year 
and is considerably larger than before. The markets 
it serves seem poised to continue to grow as 
standards of living and energy consumption per 
head increase in much of the world. 
We are well placed to take advantage of this 
growth and look forward to the opportunities 
and challenges ahead.
I am grateful to our staff throughout the world for 
their fine contribution to our success.

Hunting PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 07 
“  Hu nt i n g h a s 
seen many of its 
facilities increase 
the number of 
production shifts 
in the year, with 
demand in 
certain areas 
of the Group 
exceeding the 
historic highs 
seen in 2008.”
Introduction
During 201 1, Hunting achieved a number 
of significant milestones in its growth strategy 
leading to the excellent financial results reported. 
The Group successfully concluded four 
acquisitions totalling £597 .9m in the second half 
of the year, which extended our technology 
offering and product reach into the oil and gas 
wellbore, while also broadening our advanced 
manufacturing capabilities offered to our 
customers. In parallel to these acquisitions, 
Hunting has continued its significant investment 
programme within its existing manufacturing 
facilities, with new sites formally opening in 
China and Scotland and further expansion 
projects commencing in North America. Within 
this positive operating environment, Hunting has 
seen many of its facilities increase the number 
of production shifts in the year, with demand in 
certain areas of the Group exceeding the historic 
highs seen in 2008.
Supporting our strategy for growth has been 
a strengthening in market momentum. In 201 1, 
worldwide rig counts increased 12% to close the 
year at a near record high of 3,612 active units. 
Accompanying this increase has been a 20% 
increase in horizontal drilling compared to 
2010 and a further shift to focusing on oil 
drilling. These factors have driven the demand 
for Hunting’s products and with the WTI oil price 
averaging US$95 per barrel in the year, which 
reflects a tight balance between supply and 
demand, the Group enters 2012 with a 
confident outlook.
Much of what Hunting has achieved in the 
year has been due to the high quality people 
we employ. Following the acquisitions, the 
Group now has 3,453 employees (2010 – 2,233). 
As part of the integration of the new businesses 
and personnel, the senior management within 
our primary operating unit, Hunting Energy 
Services, has been restructured, with the new 
positions of Chief Operations Officer, Director of 
Manufacturing, Manufacturing Analyst and a new 
Managing Director of Hunting Americas being 
created. These new positions will direct new 
initiatives to maximise the manufacturing 
efficiencies across the Group’s operations.
With this strong business momentum, particularly 
seen in the final quarter of the year, coupled with 
the business development highlighted, the Group 
reported a 44% increase in revenue to £608.8m 
(2010 – £423.3m). Our existing businesses 
contributed £120.7m to this growth, with the 
balance of £64.8m coming from our newly 
acquired companies. Profit from continuing 
operations before amortisation and exceptional 
items increased 80% to £81.0m (2010 – £45.0m) 
comprising £65.9m from existing operations and 
£15.1m from acquisitions. This performance leads 
us to report a 70% increase in diluted earnings 
per share from continuing operations before 
amortisation and exceptional items to 38.7p 
(2010 – 22.7p).
Profit from continuing operations after 
amortisation and exceptional items was 
£41.0m (2010 – £31.0m) and the reported diluted 
earnings per share from continuing operations 
was 20.3p (2010 – 15.4p).
Business Development
Hunting’s strong financial performance 
during 201 1 has been driven by an excellent 
performance from our existing businesses and a 
good contribution from the acquisitions made in 
the second half of the year. 
Hunting’s strategy is to invest in proprietary 
products, which have a strong market share and 
good synergies with the existing products offered 
by the Group. Each of the acquisitions completed 
during the year fulfilled these criteria:
Dearborn Precision Tubular Products 
(“Dearborn”) – In August 201 1, the Group 
completed the acquisition of Dearborn for a 
consideration of £50.6m. The business provides 
specialist precision machining services to the 
energy, aviation and power generation sectors, 
which demand close tolerance machining for 
components used in critical applications. 
Dearborn’s energy related product lines 
include the manufacture of complex components 
used in measurement-while-drilling (“MWD”) 
and logging-while-drilling (“LWD”) tools. Each 
customer has specific MWD/LWD requirements 
and each order is highly complex and can 
take many hours to complete. Dearborn fits 
well with the product lines manufactured 
by Hunting Innova, as Innova’s electronic 
measurement tools are often housed in 
Dearborn’s products.

Chief Executive’s Review continued
“  Part of the 
immediate 
integration 
strategy of 
Titan is to 
commence the 
manufacturing of 
its products at 
other Hunting 
facilities.”
W L Doffing (“Doffing”) – In early September 
201 1, Hunting completed the acquisition of the 
business and assets of Doffing, a precision 
machining services business, for a consideration 
of £14.2m. Doffing complements Dearborn, 
in that it supplies critical tolerance machining, 
prototyping and first-pass specialist production 
services used in MWD/LWD applications.
Titan – In mid-September 201 1, the Group 
also completed the acquisition of Titan, the 
largest acquisition in the Group’s history, for a 
consideration of £508.6m. Titan is a leading 
provider of perforating gun systems, shaped 
charges, well logging instrumentation and 
perforating gun switches used in drilling 
complex horizontal wells, predominantly for shale 
related drilling. Titan is a supplier of proprietary 
perforating products in North America and further 
exposes Hunting to the high growth global shale 
drilling market, to which the Group already 
supplies many other components. Part of the 
immediate integration strategy of Titan is to 
commence the manufacturing of its products at 
other Hunting facilities including the Wuxi facility 
in China where large growth opportunities have 
been identified. Further cross-selling opportunities

Specialty Supply (“Specialty”) – In October 
201 1, Hunting completed the acquisition 
of Specialty Supply, a supplier of precision 
machined components, for a consideration of 
£24.5m. Speciality’s products are used in the 
global directional drilling markets and include 
drill pipe screens, running gear, steering tools 
and gyro systems.
Since the completion of these acquisitions, 
all businesses have performed in line with 
management expectations, with business 
momentum being maintained from the final 
quarter of 201 1 into the new trading year. 
Manufacturing and sales synergies have already 
been identified and are being implemented, 
with further systems integration planned for 
the near future.
From the start of 2012, Hunting has commenced 
a unified marketing initiative for the Innova, 
Dearborn and Doffing product lines. Under 
the new branding of ‘Hunting Advanced 
Manufacturing Group’ , the Group now offers 
a single source solution for MWD/LWD 
measurement tools. Using the technical expertise 
of these three businesses, Hunting is aiming to 
become a leading supplier of MWD/LWD tools, 
removing the need for multiple component-
sourcing currently required by our customers.
Following the four acquisitions, Hunting now has 
38 manufacturing facilities worldwide (2010 – 30) 
with a global footprint totalling over 2.5m square 
feet of capacity. 
During the year, Hunting continued its internal 
investment programme across its global facilities. 
In 201 1, the Group increased capital expenditure 
to £58.0m (2010 – £49.0m), of which £57 .8m 
(2010 – £48.7m) was invested within the Group’s 
primary operating unit, Hunting Energy Services. 
Within the Group figure of £58.0m, new business 
development comprised of £45.2m (2010 – 
£36.8m) and replacement expenditure was 
£12.8m (2010 – £12.2m). During 201 1 the Group 
completed a project in Scotland to consolidate 
manufacturing to two principal sites at Badentoy 
and Fordoun, relocated and consolidated its

manufacturing capabilities in Dubai and formally 
opened its Wuxi facility in China. In 2012 new 
capital projects at Houma, Louisiana and Stafford, 
Texas are due to be completed, which will further 
increase the total operating footprint.
The Group also continued to build its Exploration 
and Production business where £2.3m was 
invested during the year (2010 – £7 .1m).
Health, Safety and Environment
During 201 1, Hunting Energy Services recorded 
3.36m personnel hours compared to 2.30m in 
2010, an increase of 46%. We are pleased to 
report that even with this increase, the number 
of recordable incidents decreased by 26% to 26 
incidents compared to 35 in 2010. The incident 
per million person hours worked therefore 
decreased 49% to 7 .7 compared to 15.2 in 2010.
Outlook
Hunting has commenced 2012 on a solid 
footing, as the demand for energy remains firm. 
The Group now has an established global 
manufacturing presence in key energy regions 
around the world, with a broad product and 
service offering for our customers. With our new 
acquisitions, we have extended the number of 
touch points in the oil and gas well bore and 
have many opportunities to cross-sell our 
products into the new and existing market 
segments in which we serve, while maximising 
the Group’s manufacturing efficiency with our 
enlarged operating footprint.
In North America, shale related drilling 
will continue to support product demand as 
customers continue to focus on oil related resource 
plays. As activity in the Gulf of Mexico continues 
to increase, Hunting anticipates increased business 
in this area, which will increase the demand for 
our products, particularly those applicable to 
deepwater drilling activity. In Europe, despite 
the reduced number of active rigs following 
the UK government’s new tax legislation, new 
development projects continue to be sanctioned 
in the North Sea, which will maintain activity 
throughout the year. In South East Asia, the 
continued increase in demand for energy will 
support our manufacturing activities in Singapore 
and China.
Oil and gas demand is forecast to continue to 
grow as we continue through the year, subject 
to the economic and geopolitical climate not 
declining further. In the medium to long term, 
industry commentators are forecasting a 70% 
increase in investment in capital spending over 
the next decade to meet anticipated hydrocarbon 
demand, which provides confidence that 
Hunting’s products will be required in the future.
Business Strategy
The key elements of the Group’s business strategy 
to deliver long term shareholder value remain:
•	 To deliver both acquisitive and organic growth 
across all of the Group’s core operations.
•	 To invest and develop the business platforms 
to augment:
 – Proprietary products and services;
 – Increased market share strength;
 – Enlarged global footprint; and
 – Capture of synergies from the opportunities 
thus created.
Underpinning these strategic objectives is a 
commitment to manufacture and deliver high 
quality products and services with a reputation 
for reliability and on time delivery under the 
Hunting brand.
Business Model
The key features of the Group’s business model 
which seeks to deliver its strategic objectives are:
•	 A decentralised management structure allowing 
local management to identify and react to 
customer or local market requirements.
•	 Close monitoring, support and direction from 
the centre.
•	 Short chains of command allowing for faster 
decision making.
•	 Framework of controls with discretionary 
limits and powers for local management.
•	 Flexible cost structures which can adapt to 
market conditions.
•	 Common standards for quality, health and 
safety across operations.
Maintaining high operational standards across 
all of the Group’s activities is viewed as one 
of the building blocks in delivering a strong 
financial performance.
Investment in proprietary products 
and expanded facilities, here in 
Scotland, have continued.

Operating Review
“  Hunting continues to position its technical expertise and operating  
footprint to meet the requirements of our customers.”
1
OUR STRATEGY:
PROPRIETARY  
PRODUCTS
To invest in and develop 
proprietary goods and services.
Hunting manufactures or distributes those 
products that enable the extraction of oil and gas. 
The Group’s customers include international 
energy companies, national oil companies and 
mid to large oil services groups. With increasingly 
complex resources to define and develop, in 
ever increasing challenging locations, Hunting 
continues to position its technical expertise and 
operating footprint to meet the requirements of 
these customers.
Hunting Energy Services
Hunting Energy Services is the primary operating 
unit of the Group and during 201 1 reported a 
45% increase in revenue to £582.8m (2010 – 
£400.7m) and an 80% increase in profit from 
continuing operations before amortisation and 
exceptional items to £79.3m (2010 – £44.1m). 
Reported profit from continuing operations was 
£50.1m (2010 – £33.2m). 
This growth has been achieved through:
•	 Near record levels of activity within certain 
businesses, including Premium Connections, 
Drilling Tools and Manufacturing.
•	 Good contributions from newly opened 
facilities around the Group including Conroe, 
Latrobe, Casper and Wuxi.
•	 Continued rollout of lean manufacturing 
across Hunting’s 38 locations.
•	 Addition of new acquisitions to the Hunting 
portfolio.
Our existing businesses delivered revenue 
growth of £1 1 7 .3m to £518.0m, with the balance 
of £64.8m coming from our newly acquired 
companies. Profit from continuing operations 
before amortisation and exceptional items from 
existing operations was £64.2m, with £1 5.1m being 
generated from the new companies in the Group. 
As the business enters 2012, Hunting Energy 
Services is continuing this momentum with 
increased demand from its chosen markets, while 
also benefiting from new opportunities being 
presented from our newly acquired businesses.
Well Construction
Hunting’s Well Construction division includes 
those businesses that are positioned in the initial 
drilling and construction phase of the wellbore. 
The division now includes Hunting Advanced 
Manufacturing Group which comprises Hunting 
Innova and the newly acquired Dearborn and 
Doffing businesses. 
The Well Construction division reported revenue 
of £194.5m (2010 – £111.3m), with benefits in the 
final quarter from the three new businesses in the 
segment. Profit from continuing operations before 
amortisation and exceptional items, increased in 
the year to £28.5m (2010 – £9.5m). Reported profit 
from continuing operations was £20.7m (2010 
– £7.8m). The platform comprises six business 
areas: Premium Connections, Drilling Tools, Oil 
Country Tubular Goods (“OCTG”), Trenchless 
Technologies, Hunting Advanced Manufacturing 
Group and Specialty Supply.
Premium Connections
Hunting’s Premium Connections business which 
comprises a range of connections including the 
SEAL-LOCK™ and WEDGELOCK™ product 
lines reported record results during 201 1, 
following completion of a number of major 
orders in the year. Momentum within the 
business has increased as customers prepare 
for renewed drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, in 
addition to continued demand for shale related 
connections in all of the key drilling regions 
across North America.

OUR STRATEGY:
MARKET SHARE 
STRENGTH
Expansion through leading 
market positions.
Drilling Tools
The Hunting Drilling Tools platform provides mud 
motors, shock tools, non-magnetic drill collars and 
other technologies to assist in the efficient drilling 
of oil and gas wells. During the year, demand for 
Hunting’s products increased strongly, leading to 
record sales in the final quarter of 201 1. Following 
the opening of three new facilities during 2010, 
demand has been driven by shale drilling in North 
America, particularly with customers drilling in the 
Bakken, Marcellus and EagleFord shale plays. New 
regional sales were also developed in Kurdistan 
during the year, as frontier exploration drilling 
continues to increase and more licenses are 
granted to western companies. Hunting’s recently 
established Equipment Management Services 
(“HEMS”) business, which provides downhole 
tool rental equipment, also reported its first profit 
during the final quarter of 201 1 after strong 
increases in sales throughout the year. HEMS has 
developed new opportunities across the MENA 
region and in December 201 1 successfully signed 
a contract to supply a leading oil services provider.
OCTG
Hunting’s OCTG business includes casing 
products and management services for customers. 
The Group has key relationships with steel 
manufacturers to facilitate just-in-time logistics.
Trenchless Technologies
During 201 1, the Trenchless business exceeded 
management’s expectations. All three product 
lines, drill stems, premium tubing threading and 
motor components achieved good sales growth in 
the year with business momentum extending into 
early 2012. The business also increased its number 
of distributors during the year to broaden the 
geographic reach of the Group’s product offering.
Advanced Manufacturing Group
Since the completion of the acquisitions of 
Dearborn and Doffing in the second half of 201 1, 
the businesses have performed in line with 
management’s expectations. With these new 
manufacturing capabilities, Hunting is now 
positioned to capture a higher proportion of the 
lower volume/higher margin manufacturing 
contracts related to the increasingly complex oil 
and gas well designs developed by our customers.
At Hunting Innova, the business continues to be 
integrated into the Group, following its first full 
year of ownership, with demand for products 
remaining strong, ending the year with a good 
order backlog. Innova continues to supply to the 
leading US oil service companies and during the 
year added new clients who will broaden the 
product reach of the business in the future.

 “  The Group’s customers include international energy companies,  
national oil companies and mid to large oil services groups.”
Specialty Supply
Specialty manufactures precision machined 
MWD parts used in directional drilling markets 
worldwide. These include a comprehensive line 
of running gear and associated products for 
MWD, LWD, steering tools and gyro systems. 
Additionally, Specialty’s product offering includes 
drill pipe screens for all drilling applications. 
Since completion of the acquisition, Specialty has 
exceeded management’s expectations, with new 
initiatives underway to reduce outsourcing.
Well Completion
Hunting’s Well Completion division provides 
products to customers during the completion 
phase of an oil and gas well. The Well 
Completion division reported revenue of 
£327 .2m in 201 1 (2010 – £224.2m) and 
benefited from the acquisition of Hunting 
Titan on 16 September. 
Profit from operations before amortisation and 
exceptional items totalled £41.2m (2010 – 
£23.2m). Reported profit from continuing 
operations was £21.4m (2010 – £23.2m). The 
division operates from four platforms: Hunting 
Titan, Premium Tubing, Manufacturing and 
Thread Protection.
Hunting Titan
Following completion of the acquisition of 
Titan, the business has performed in line with 
management’s expectations, with continued 
demand for shale related products and services, 
driven by the strong rig counts reported during 
the year. During 201 1, the business has continued 
to expand its manufacturing and distribution 
presence in North America to capture more 
market share in the region. It is anticipated 
that Titan will utilise Hunting’s existing facilities 
in China, Europe and Canada to maximise 
manufacturing opportunities, while developing 
new sales across South East Asia where the 
Group has an established presence.
Premium Tubing
Hunting’s Premium Tubing business reported its 
best year since 2008. While shale drilling has 
been a primary driver for this performance, new 
business has been captured in new regions 
including East Africa and the Middle East.
Manufacturing
The Group’s manufacturing business continued to 
perform well during 201 1, with particularly strong 
trading seen in the final quarter of the year. With 
the continuation of the implementation of lean 
manufacturing initiatives across the Group’s 
operations, further efficiency gains have been 
realised. During the year, the business 
commenced an expansion project in Houma, 
Louisiana, which is anticipated to be completed 
during mid 2012.
Thread Protection
Hunting’s thread protection platform provides 
protection solutions including SealLube™ 
thread compound, Preserve-A-Thread corrosion 
protection and CLEAR-RUN™, its environmentally 
friendly advanced tubular solution. In 201 1, the 
business performed strongly, following both 
external customer and internal demand for our 
product lines. Following an excellent year, the 
business will increase its in-house manufacturing 
of certain product lines to reduce outsourcing to 
other suppliers.
Well Intervention
Hunting’s Well Intervention division supplies 
a range of products and services required 
throughout the life of a well to enhance and 
maintain production and in 201 1 reported a 
profit from operations before amortisation and 
exceptional items of £7 .9m (2010 – £10.1m). 
Reported profit from continuing operations 
was £7 .3m (2010 – £9.3m).
The subsea valves and connections platform 
has seen a mixed performance in the year, 
predominantly due to the slowdown in deep water 
drilling activity following the Macondo disaster in 
Hunting Innova’s electronics and 
core mechanical competencies 
have aligned to provide the 
customer with complete 
downhole tool options.

OUR STRATEGY:
GLOBAL FOOTPRINT
Establishment and enlargement 
of facilities around the world.

2010, which impacted the demand for the 
business’ products. While the backlog remains 
strong and activity in the Gulf of Mexico improves, 
the revised regulatory procedures in the region 
have led to customers delaying orders during the 
year. With industry wide preparations underway 
anticipating increased drilling activity in the Gulf  
of Mexico, the business is shortly to complete an 
expansion of its facilities to address the future 
drilling demand anticipated both regionally  
and globally.
Hunting Welltonic provides pressure control 
equipment, control panels, e-line (wireline) and 
slickline tools. During 201 1 the business performed 
well following good demand for a number of 
product lines and a new product receiving 
acceptance from a major oil services company. 
Welltonic is currently expanding its presence in 
the US to develop sales of both Thru Tubing and 
pressure control products in the region.
Exploration & Production
Hunting’s Exploration and Production division 
has interests in the Southern US and offshore 
Gulf of Mexico, holding equity interests in over 
70 production properties. On a Net Equivalent 
Barrel (“NEB”) basis, production in the year was 
252,000 barrels (2010 – 230,000 barrels), with 
proven reserves at year end being 1.2m NEB 
(2010 – 1.3m NEB). Based on firm commodity 
prices throughout the year, the business reported 
a profit from operations before amortisation and 
exceptional items of £1.7m (2010 – £1.3m). 
Reported profit from continuing operations 
was £0.7m (2010 – £7.1m loss).
During 201 1, the business participated in four 
successful exploration wells in Lavaca County, 
Texas; Hidalgo County, Texas; Brooks County, 
Texas; and Goliad County, Texas. A fifth well 
drilled in Matagorda County resulted in a dry hole.
Following a year end valuation of reserves, which 
requires individual oil and gas properties to be 
impaired when the realisable value is less than 
the book value based on future production and 
commodity prices, the business has taken an 
impairment charge of £1.0m reflecting lower 
gas prices.
Other Operating Divisions
Gibson Shipbrokers
Gibson is one of the leading global shipbrokers 
and employs 148 staff. Despite extremely 
depressed shipping markets, caused by an 
oversupply of tonnage, the company expanded its 
depth of market coverage with an increase in staff 
and a 15% increase in trading volume during the 
year. Income and profit exceeded expectations 
reporting a profit from operations before 
amortisation and exceptional items of £1.7m 
(2010 – £0.9m).
With shipping markets expected to remain 
severely depressed for at least another 12 
months, the operating policy remains one of 
cautious expansion. Mindful of these difficult 
times we are engaged in positioning the business 
to be able to capture a greater share of projected 
market improvements. 
Division expansion has not been restricted to the 
London Headquarters. Singapore has grown with 
the addition of Dry Cargo, and more recently 
Clean Tankers, to the already successful 
Specialised and Gas activities.
Today, Gibson is active in Crude, Fuel and 
Clean Tanker chartering, Dry Bulk, Vegoils, 
Chemicals, LPG, LPG Broking and LNG, Sale and 
Purchase for New Buildings, second hand and 
re-sales as well as Demolition, Offshore including 
Seismic and renewables, and an enviable in-house 
Research and Consultancy section.
Field Aviation
Field Aviation is reported as a discontinued 
business, as it remains our intention to sell the 
business to management. On 30 June 201 1, the 
business was classified as a held for sale asset, 
reflecting progress on the sale of the company.
Synergies are being exploited, 
such as Hunting Energy’s variball 
system to deliver Titan products 
in the wellbore.

OUR STRATEGY:
SYNERGIES
Capture of synergies 
from acquisitions and 
organic growth.
Active discussions are currently in progress and 
the sale is considered to be highly probable. 
Field Aviation is recognised worldwide as a 
modifier of aircraft for special mission roles. 
The Aircraft Modification Centre in Toronto 
carries out the design, installation, testing and 
certification of aircraft modification. Interior 
modification capabilities transform regional 
airliners into VIP or corporate shuttle aircraft. 
Leading-edge avionics modifications keep 
aircraft productive, profitable and technologically 
advanced. As a build-to-print aircraft parts 
manufacturer, the Parts Manufacturing facility 
in Calgary specialises in the production of parts 
and spares for the international commercial 
and military aerospace industry. 
The business manufactures airframe parts and 
accessories for both current-production aircraft 
and out-of-production aircraft.
Field Aviation, as predicted, faced a challenging 
market with a weak order book on the back  
of reduced government spending worldwide.  
In 201 1, Field Aviation delivered a profit from 
operations of £0.8m (2010 – £5.2m) on revenues 
of £25.9m (2010 – £38.3m).

Introduction
201 1 has seen record results and improving 
margins on the back of strong market demand 
for our products and services. Delivering on 
our strategic objectives we completed four 
acquisitions in the year at a cost of £597 .9m – 
all four acquisitions have added to the Group’s 
product offering. Integration of the acquisitions 
is a priority, with measures including new IT 
systems and additional management resource 
being implemented.
The financial strength of the Group remains 
robust, with strong support from our shareholders 
and banks, as seen by our £83.5m share placing 
completed during the year and our new £375.0m 
five year bank facility signed on 5 August 201 1.
Results
Revenue
Group revenues increased 44% to £608.8m in 
2011 (2010 – £423.3m). Acquisitions contributed 
£64.8m of this revenue growth and revenue from 
existing businesses was up £120.7m or 29%. 
Well Construction was the strongest performing 
division, with revenue up 75% to £194.5m (2010 
– £111.3m). This division has benefited from a 
full year contribution from Innova, acquired in 
September 2010, as well as the Dearborn, 
Doffing and Specialty acquisitions contributing 
to the last quarter of 201 1. US Connections 
performed strongly leveraging the development 
of shale projects and improved activity in the 
Gulf of Mexico. Drilling Tools also performed 
strongly, benefiting from its wider distribution 
network and shale activity levels in North 
America. Well Completion revenue was up 46% 
to £327 .2m (2010 – £224.2m), mainly due to the 
contribution from the Titan acquisition, however, 
the like-for-like business was still up 25%. The 
Well Intervention division has had a more 
challenging year with revenues declining by 10% 
to £52.9m (2010 – £58.7m) partly due to product 
delivery delays associated with the increased 
regulatory environment in the Gulf of Mexico 
which affected sales from our subsea 
connections and intervention platform.
EBITDA and Profit from Operations
EBITDA before amortisation and exceptional 
items was £102.5m, £39.9m ahead of 2010, with 
acquisitions contributing £16.4m to this growth. 
The EBITDA margin increased from 15% in 2010 
to 17% in 201 1 helped by product mix and the 
higher margins from the acquisitions completed 
in 201 1. The year ended particularly strongly, 
aided by strong demand across most of our 
manufacturing facilities and benefiting from 
favourable weather conditions in key regions 
of the US and Canada. 
Profit from continuing operations before 
amortisation and exceptional items was £81.0m 
for 201 1, an increase of 80% over 2010 despite 
sterling strengthening against the US dollar to 
US$1.60 (2010 – US$1.55). The operating profit 
margin increased from 1 1% in 2010 to 13% in 
201 1. Well Construction profit from operations 
before amortisation and exceptional items was 
up 200% to £28.5m (2010 – £9.5m) due to the 
year-on-year impact of the acquisitions and 
growth in the Premium Connections and Drilling 
Tools businesses. In Well Completion, profit from 
operations before amortisation and exceptional 
items increased 78% to £41.2m (2010 – £23.2m) 
predominantly due to the addition of Titan to the 
division. In Well Intervention, the 22% decline in 
profit from operations to £7 .9m (2010 – £10.1m) 
was due to the slower trading environment within 
the subsea platform, referred to earlier.
Amortisation and Exceptional Items 
Intangible asset amortisation charges increased 
from £2.5m in 2010 to £12.2m in 201 1 due to 
the increased charge arising on intangible assets 
recognised on the four acquisitions completed in 
the year. The expected full year amortisation 
charge in 2012 is estimated to be £30m. 
The following exceptional charges arose in 
the year:
•	 Acquisition costs of £8.6m relating to the four 
acquisitions, which were completed in 201 1.
•	 Under IFRS, at acquisition, inventory values 
are adjusted from their carrying values 
(generally at cost of production) to a fair value, 
which includes profit attributable to the 
degree of completion of the inventory. This 
resulted in a fair value uplift totalling £23.6m 
for the four acquisitions. This uplift is charged 
to the income statement as the inventory is 
sold, thereby reducing reported operating 
profits. In 201 1, the charge was £12.9m and 
this has been treated as exceptional. The 
balance of £10.7m is expected to be charged 
to the income statement in 2012.
“  T h e fi n a n c i a l 
strength of the 
Group remains 
robust with 
strong support 
from our 
shareholders 
and banks.”

•	 A £1.6m charge relating to key employee 
retention was also recognised in 201 1, relating 
to the acquisitions completed during the year.
•	 Charges under onerous leases for properties 
have been assessed at £2.2m.
•	 The impairment of oil and gas capitalised 
expenditure of £1.0m arose largely as a result 
of declining forward gas commodity prices 
compared to 31 December 2010.
•	 Goodwill impairment reviews undertaken 
during the year have resulted in a £1.5m 
impairment charge.
•	 Unamortised loan facility fees of £1.0m were 
written off as a result of the acquisition. 
Profit from continuing operations, after 
amortisation and exceptional items, was £41.0m 
in 201 1 compared to £31.0m in 2010.
Net Finance Costs
Net finance costs before exceptional items in 
201 1 were £2.2m compared to a £1.0m net 
finance income in 2010. The change from net 
income to net expense is due to the Group 
moving into a net debt position in the second half 
of the year following the acquisition programme, 
together with an increased charge for bank loan 
facility fees.

Taxation
The Group tax rate before amortisation and 
exceptional items for 201 1 was 28% (2010 
– 30%) resulting in a tax charge of £22.5m 
(2010 – £14.0m). The lower tax rate reflects the 
weighting of profits in lower tax jurisdictions, 
together with a reduced UK corporate tax rate. 
The tax rate for 2012 is currently expected to 
remain at 28%, however, this is dependent on 
the mix of profits going forward. The exceptional 
charge in the year attracts a tax credit of £15.2m 
to give a net tax charge on continuing operations 
in 201 1 of £7 .3m (2010 – £9.9m).
Earnings per Share
Diluted earnings per share before amortisation 
and exceptional items for continuing operations 
increased 70% to 38.7p from 22.7p in 2010. 
Reported diluted earnings per share at 20.3p was 
32% above 2010. The weighted average number 
of shares used in calculating the diluted earnings 
per share in 201 1 was 140.1m compared to 
134.0m in 2010, with the increase mainly due 
to the 13.2m share placing completed in 
August 2011.

Cash Flow
The free cash flow generated in 201 1 of 
£38.9m is £29.4m ahead of 2010. The improved 
operating EBITDA of £102.5m (2010 – £62.6m) 
is a key component of this as described above. 
Working capital movements were £5.7m better 
year-on-year. There was a significant reversal on 
interest and bank fees with an inflow of £1.6m in 
2010 becoming an outflow of £7 .6m in 201 1, as a 
result of moving into a net debt position during 
201 1, together with fees related to the new bank 
facility. Tax paid in 201 1 was £12.3m higher than 
2010 due to low tax payments in 2010 which 
were shielded by brought-forward losses. 
Expansion capital expenditure in the year 
of £45.2m principally related to the internal 
investment programmes in Scotland, US and 
China. Capital expenditure on exploration and 
production was £2.3m (2010 – £7.1m). Total 
capital expenditure for 201 1 was £58.0m, an 
increase of £9.0m. 
Capital expenditure in 2012 is expected to 
increase to around £75m, as expansion projects 
at Houma, Louisiana, and Stafford, Texas, are 
completed, together with increased equipment 
requirements for the ongoing expansion of the 
Drilling Tools and Titan operations.
The total cash flow incurred in the purchase 
of subsidiaries, net of cash acquired and including 
expenses of £8.6m, was £581.1m. This includes 
Titan, Dearborn, Doffing and Specialty with 
Titan being the largest component at £506.6m. 
The acquisitions were partly funded by an equity 
placing which raised £83.5m.
Total dividends paid during the year were 
£18.0m (2010 – £15.6m). Dividends paid to 
equity shareholders of £16.8m were 19% ahead 
of 2010 and reflects the Board’s confidence in 
the strength of the Group.
Cash of £85.3m was received when the Gibson 
Energy warrant was repaid in June 201 1.

Due to the 201 1 acquisitions, the balance sheet 
profile has changed significantly. Goodwill has 
increased by £215.9m of which £180.7m arose 
on the acquisition of Titan. Other intangibles 
have increased by £198.2m and include 
customer relationships, technological know-how 
and trademarks. 
Property, plant and equipment has increased 
by £77 .1m largely due to £45.4m recognised as 
part of the acquisitions as well as gross capital 
expenditure of £58.0m during the year.
Other assets have fallen by £48.9m, primarily 
due to the repayment of the Gibson Energy 
warrant during 201 1. The £10.3m balance at 
31 December 201 1 includes a net pension 
surplus of £4.8m (2010 – £5.5m) based on the 
IAS 19 valuation of the Group’s UK defined 
benefit pension scheme.
Working capital has increased by £126.1m 
to £262.6m. The 201 1 acquisitions represent 
£100.2m of the increase, with inventory being 
£86.3m of this. Inventories at the year end

include £10.7m of fair value uplift expected to 
be charged to the income statement in 2012.
As a result of the above, capital employed 
has increased by £568.0m to £950.4m at 
31 December 201 1.
The cash outflow in 201 1 of £430.6m has put the 
Group into a net debt position at the year end 
of £218.4m, with cash and cash equivalents 
and investments of £73.2m and borrowings 
of £291.6m. 
Net assets at 31 December 201 1 were £732.0m 
which, after non-controlling interests of £16.8m, 
result in equity shareholders’ funds of £715.2m. 
This is an increase of £134.8m over 31 December 
2010, which reflects the retained result for the 
year of £79.1m, exchange gains of £5.9m, share 
placing of £83.5m, offset by £16.8m dividend 
payments together with other items of £16.9m.
Financial Capital Management
Since the sale of Gibson Energy in 2008, the 
strategic objective of the Group has been to focus 
on upstream energy services by expanding our 
proprietary technologies and geographic footprint. 
The acquisitions during 201 1 represent a further 
significant step in delivering this strategy. A priority 
for 2012 is to fully integrate the new businesses 
and leverage their potential within the Group. 
The expenditure on acquisitions of £597 .9m 
during 201 1 was funded by a combination of 
cash, an equity placing and new bank facilities. 
The Group’s financial position remains robust, 
with total credit facilities of £423.6m in place 
(2010 – £153.9m) of which £375.0m (2010 – 
£120.0m) is committed. The committed facility is 
a £375.0m multi-currency revolving credit facility 
from a syndicate of ten banks which extends to 
August 2016. Further details regarding the facility 
can be found in note 31. 
The level of net debt and related gearing ratio 
of 30% at 31 December 201 1 is considered 
comfortable, with adequate headroom remaining 
giving management ongoing flexibility. Our bank 
facility covenants require EBITDA to cover relevant 
finance charges by a minimum of 4 times and net 
debt to adjusted EBITDA has a maximum of 3.5 
times. Both key bank covenant metrics at year 
end were well covered.
Return on average capital employed is a 
KPI management use to assess business unit 
performance. The Group’s return on capital 
employed has fallen from 16% during 2010 
to 15% in 201 1 primarily due to the higher 
level of capital employed following the 
acquisition programme.
The Board considers each ordinary dividend 
proposed based on the merits of the information 
available to it at the time. Consideration is given to 
the financial projections of business performance 
and capital investment needs, together with 
feedback from shareholder discussions.
The Group operates a centralised treasury 
function with policies and procedures approved 
by the Board. These cover funding, banking 
relationships, foreign currency, interest rate 
exposures, cash management and the investment 
of surplus cash. Further detail on financial risks is 
provided within note 31.
The Group has significant foreign operations and 
hence results originate in a number of currencies, 
particularly in US dollars. As a result, the Group’s 
financial statements, which are reported in sterling, 
are subject to the effects of foreign exchange rate 
fluctuations with respect to currency conversions. 
Currency options are used to reduce currency risk 
movements on the Group’s results, by hedging 
approximately 50% of each year’s budgeted US 
dollar earnings into sterling. Currency exposure on 
the balance sheet is, where practical, reduced by 
financing assets with borrowings in the same 
currency. Spot and forward foreign exchange 
contracts are used to cover the net exposure of 
purchases and sales in non-domestic currencies.
Critical Accounting Policies
The Group accounts are prepared using 
accounting policies in accordance with IFRS. The 
principal accounting policies are set out on pages 
53 to 59.
The preparation of these accounts require the use 
of estimates, judgements and assumptions that 
affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, 
revenue and expenses and the disclosure of 
contingent assets and liabilities. Directors’ 
estimates are based on historical experience, 
consultation with experts and other methods 
that they believe are reasonable and appropriate.

Retirement Benefits
Actuarial Assumptions:

Rate of inflation 3.2% 3.6%
Discount rate 4.7% 5.4%
Expected future lifetime 
(years) – male 24.3 24.1
Expected future lifetime 
(years) – female 25.8 25.7
Expected future lifetime is the number of years a 
65 year old is expected to live based on current 
mortality tables.
The Group operates a defined benefit pension 
scheme in the UK, which was closed to new 
entrants with effect from 31 December 2002, 
as well as a number of defined contribution 
schemes within the Group. The defined benefit 
scheme is accounted for under IAS 19 and the 
main actuarial assumptions used are shown 
within note 33 and in the table above. 
Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations
The Group is currently in active negotiations to 
sell the Field Aviation business. The Directors 
took the view in preparing the June 201 1 half 
year financial statements that the business was 
available for sale in its current condition and that 
it was highly probable a sale would occur within 
12 months. The Directors remain of this opinion 
at 31 December 201 1.
Amortisation and Exceptional items
In presenting its income statement, the Group 
identifies the results before amortisation and 
exceptional items, which is the basis on which 
the Directors assess the business in internal 
reporting. In the Directors’ view this is necessary 
to get a clear understanding of the underlying 
performance of the business. More details on 
exceptional items can be found in note 5.
Property, Plant and Equipment and Other 
Intangible Assets
The Group’s property, plant and equipment and 
other intangible assets are subject to annual rates 
of depreciation intended to spread the cost of 
the assets over their estimated service life. These 
rates are regularly reviewed. The rates currently 
in use are set out on page 55. In addition if, 
in management’s judgement, events or 
circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
may have occurred, then a review of the carrying 
value of the asset will be carried out.
Goodwill
The carrying value of goodwill held on the 
balance sheet is reviewed for impairment at least 
annually. The review compares the carrying value 
with the estimated future cash flows from the 
business unit to which the goodwill relates. The 
cash flows are based on management’s view of 
future trading prospects. Any shortfall identified is 
treated as an impairment and written off.
Taxation 
The effective tax rate for the full year is 28% and 
is the combined rate arising from the regional mix 
of Group results. The rate also takes into account 
the estimated future utilisation of tax losses and 
the agreements with regional tax authorities of 
corporate tax computations.
Deferred Tax
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded 
within the financial statements at 31 December 
201 1 at £20.5m and £35.3m respectively. These 
balances are derived from assumptions which 
include the future utilisation of trading losses and 
provisions at assumed tax rates.
Share-based Payments
The estimated cost of grants and awards of 
equity instruments to Group employees is spread 
evenly over the vesting period. The actuarial 
assumptions used in determining the charge 
to income are set out in note 40.
 
Provisions
Provisions amounting to £60.5m are held on 
balance sheet at the year end. These are based 
on Directors’ estimates of the future cost of 
current obligations.

FinancialXreview_v33.indd   26 09/03/2012   19:57 COMPANY OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Hunting PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 27 
The Group has an established risk management 
monitoring and review process described in the 
Corporate Governance Report on pages 47 to 51. 
The process requires all businesses to identify, 
evaluate and monitor risks and take steps to 
reduce, eliminate or manage the risk. Group risks 
are formally reviewed by the Board at least three 
times a year and are discussed at every Board 
meeting. The principal risks identified through 
this process that Hunting is exposed to, which 
could have a material adverse impact are listed 
below, together with the steps the Group has 
taken to mitigate against these risks. Some arise 
from the specific activities undertaken by the 
Group whereas others are common to many 
international manufacturing companies.
Risks Specific to the Nature of Hunting 
Group Businesses
Product Quality and Reliability
Product quality and reliability is critical to the 
Group’s reputation with its customers.
Quality assurance standards are monitored, 
measured and regulated within the Group under 
the authority of a Quality Assurance Director, 
who reports directly to the Chief Executive.
Acquisitions and Capital Investment
Acquisitions are an integral part of the continuing 
Group’s strategy of expansion and development. 
While recent new acquisitions to the Group 
have integrated well, the Board is conscious of 
the potential disruption to both the Group 
and acquiree, of an acquisition process and 
subsequent integration.
The Board is actively involved in monitoring, 
approving and assessing acquisitions through post 
acquisition appraisals to mitigate the risk of poor 
investment decisions. All acquisitions require 
Board approval prior to commitment.
The Group continues to seek opportunities for 
organic growth and maintains an active capital 
investment programme. The programme 
encompasses investments in new territories, 
buildings, production equipment, rental 
equipment and IT systems. There is a range of 
risks involved in such programmes, including 
poor financial returns, management distraction, 
facility upheaval and risk of IT systems failure.
The Board and senior management follow a 
rigorous process of approving, managing and 
monitoring capital investments along with 
planning for contingencies. All capital 
expenditure above discretionary limits requires 
Board approval prior to commitment.
Shale Drilling
The Group is increasingly providing products 
that serve the oil and gas shale drilling industry, 
particularly following the recent acquisition 
of Titan. There may be considerable future 
resistance to further oil and gas shale exploration 
and development from significant sections of 
the public, and a drilling moratorium or new 
laws and regulations may unfavourably impact 
the industry.
The Board monitors public and political opinion 
and maintains an awareness of the potential for 
changes to legislation especially with regard to 
the US where the Group is mainly exposed.
Raw Material Commodity Prices
Although not under the Group’s control, a 
material movement in oil or gas commodity 
prices could impact demand for the Group’s 
products and services.
Working capital and in particular inventory levels 
are closely managed to mitigate against exposure 
to commodity price movement.
Relationships with Key Customers
The Group’s success is defined by relationships 
with its key customers. A material reduction in 
orders from a major customer, whether through 
competitive action, contractual dispute, business 
consolidation or change in strategy could impact 
the Group’s financial performance and prospects. 
The Group is also reliant upon the conduct of 
its customers, given its products are exported 
by those customers across the world and used 
in a range of environments, including deep sea 
exploration and production. Senior management 
maintain close relationships with key customers 
and seek to maintain the highest level of service 
to preserve Hunting’s reputation for quality.
Review of Principal Risks and Uncertainties

PrincipalXrisks_v11.indd   27 09/03/2012   20:00 Hunting PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 28 
Other Risks Common to International 
Manufacturing Businesses
Fluctuation in Currency Exchange Rates
The Group has significant overseas operations, 
hence results are denominated in a variety of 
currencies. As a result, the Group’s financial 
statements, which are reported in sterling, are 
subject to the effects of foreign exchange rate 
fluctuations with respect to currency conversions.
The Group maintains an active strategy of 
financial hedging to mitigate such risk, subject 
to the availability of suitable products at the 
right cost.
Effective Control Over Subsidiaries
Group subsidiaries operate within a control 
framework with a degree of autonomy vested in 
local management. The operations of subsidiaries 
are subject to regular checking by management 
through board and management meetings, 
regular reporting and contact together with 
external and internal audit.
Key Executives
The Group is highly reliant on the continued 
service of its key executives and senior 
management, who possess commercial, 
engineering, technical and financial skills 
that are critical to the success of the Group. 
Remuneration packages are regularly reviewed to 
ensure they are remunerated in line with market 
rates. External consultants are engaged to provide 
guidance on best practice. 
Failure to retain suitably qualified individuals, 
or to attract and retain strong management and 
technical staff in the future, could have an 
adverse effect upon the Group and the results 
of its operations. Senior management continually 
reviews the availability of the necessary skills 
within the Group and seeks to find suitable staff 
where they feel there is vulnerability.
Economics and Geopolitics
The economic and political environment in the 
geographic areas in which the Group operates 
impacts demand for energy and therefore the 
Group’s range of products and services.
Management and the Board closely monitor 
trading results, forecasts, political developments 
and projected economic trends in order to 
match capacity to demand and, where 
possible, minimise the impact of adverse 
trends on the Group. In addition overheads 
are monitored regularly to ensure the cost 
base is actively managed.
Health, Safety and Environmental (“HS&E”)
The Group is subject to a number of HS&E laws 
and regulations that affect its operations, facilities 
and products in each of the jurisdictions in which 
it operates. The Group is committed to operating 
in compliance with all HS&E laws and regulations 
relating to its products, operations and business 
activities. However, there is a risk that it may have 
to incur unforeseen expenditures to cover HS&E 
liabilities, to maintain compliance with current or 
future HS&E laws and regulations or to undertake 
any necessary remediation.
It is difficult to estimate with any reasonable 
certainty the future impact of HS&E matters, 
including potential liabilities, due to a number of 
factors and especially the lengthy time intervals 
often involved in resolving them. There is regular 
HS&E compliance reporting to the Board.

The Company is listed on the London Stock 
Exchange and is subject to regulation by the 
Financial Services Authority in the United Kingdom 
(UK) as well as compliance with UK Company 
Law. The Group is also subject to the laws and 
regulations of the jurisdictions in which it operates.
Employees
Our people are our most valuable asset and the 
Group recognises that its success and reputation 
depends upon their efforts and integrity. Our 
people create Hunting’s competitive edge and we 
aim to ensure that our customers’ expectations 
are met and exceeded. Responsibility for 
employees lies with local management, which 
allows local cultural issues to be appropriately 
managed and the necessary development 
programmes to be structured accordingly.
The location of our employees reflects the global 
nature of the oil and gas industry and the 
geographic diversity of the Group’s activities.
The Group has 3,453 employees (2010 – 2,233). 
In 201 1, there was a 55% increase in employee 
numbers, largely due to the acquisitions of Titan, 
Dearborn, Doffing and Specialty. The Group seeks 
to adhere to all relevant local and jurisdictional 
laws about employment equality and minimum 
wage legislation.
As a responsible employer, full and fair 
consideration is given to applications for positions 
from disabled persons and to their training and 
career advancement. Every effort is made to 
retain in employment those who become 
disabled while employed by the Group.
It is important for the Group to retain key 
employees, as well as attracting high quality 
individuals. This remains a major challenge for 
the oil and gas industry. Hunting has developed 
a supportive work environment that promotes 
development, learning and advancement to ensure 
that its employees realise their potential. Long 
service is a feature of the Group’s employees 
and recognition is given through service award 
programmes across the Group. Forty years’ 
service is not an uncommon attribute.
Hunting believes that employing the right 
people is only the start of the relationship 
between an employee and employer. The 
Group is committed to mutually developing an 
environment of honesty, integrity and respect for 
its staff and for those people and companies we 
work with daily. The Group is also committed to 
abiding by all international and local laws and 
regulations on employment and has a no child 
labour policy.
The Group encourages and promotes an 
awareness of the financial and economic factors 
affecting the performance of the Group and 
shares information on current activities through 
regular communication and consultation. 
Through the Group’s Code of Conduct, published 
on the Company’s website, the Group sets out its 
equal opportunities policies and zero tolerance 
approach to harassment within the workplace. 
In February 2012, Hunting issued its gender 
diversity policy, which seeks to promote fair 
and equal opportunities.
The Group believes that providing additional 
benefits to staff encourages the best performance 
from our people. Therefore, most employees are 
offered participation in schemes which provide 
healthcare and post-retirement benefits and, 
in certain instances, participation in bonus 
arrangements when outperformance in terms 
of operational excellence has been achieved. 
Hunting has share award schemes in place 
as a longer term incentive whereby staff can 
participate in the ownership of the Company.
The Board has an established “whistle-blowing” 
procedure in place for any employee wishing to 
raise, in confidence, any concerns they may have 
about possible financial improprieties, or other 
matters, with the Senior Independent Director. 
Details of the procedure have been 
communicated to all employees.
Corporate Social Responsibility Report continued

Health and Safety
The Group is committed to achieving and 
maintaining the highest standards of safety for 
its employees, customers, suppliers and the 
public. Hunting has a proven culture of aiming 
for best practice and employs rigorous health 
and safety practices. 
Health and Safety policies include:
•	 Regular audit and maintenance reviews of 
facilities, equipment, practices and procedures 
to ensure compliance with prevailing 
standards and legislation and a safe 
environment for all those who work within 
and around our facilities.
•	 Seeking accreditation and aligning long 
standing company programmes and 
procedures to internationally recognised 
Quality Assurance standards.
•	 Monitoring, which is a management task, 
is documented and reported at each 
Board meeting.
•	 Appropriate training and education of all staff.
The Group has published its combined policy on 
health, safety and environmental matters, which 
can be found on the Group’s website.
Hunting’s Head of Health, Safety and 
Environment reports directly to the Chief 
Executive and a report is considered by the Board 
of Directors at each meeting. 
The Group’s target is to achieve zero recordable 
incidents. Each local business is required to 
develop tailored policies to reflect its daily 
business. These incorporate the Group’s approach 
to putting safety first and, at a minimum, to comply 
with local regulatory requirements. Training is 
given to every employee, whether they are on the 
shop floor or working from a desk. 
During the year, there were no fatalities across 
the Group’s operations (2010 – nil) with 26 
recordable incidents (2010 – 35) a reduction of 
26%. The recorded number of hours worked for 
the Group’s primary operating unit, Hunting 
Energy Services, in the last five years and 
corresponding incident rates per million hours 
worked are shown in the accompanying chart. 
In 201 1, the Group continued its programme 
to introduce lean manufacturing processes into 
global operations. This resulted in efficiency 
gains in a number of key business units.
Environment
The Group is committed to the protection of 
the environment and developing manufacturing 
processes and procedures, which ensure that any 
adverse effects on the environment are kept to 
a practicable minimum. We take the view that 
sustainable development is in the interests of all 
our stakeholders and include environmental 
issues in our planning and decision-making. 
The Group’s environmental policy is to look for 
opportunities and adopt practices that create a 
safer and cleaner environment. It is particularly 
sensitive to the challenges for the industry in 
which it operates. The Group has programmes in 
place to monitor the environmental impact from 
its operational activities and remains focused on 
ensuring environmental consideration is at the 
forefront of its business practices. 
Key aspects of our environmental policies include:
•	 Keeping any adverse effects on the 
environment to a practicable minimum.
•	 Encouraging the reduction of waste and 
emissions and promoting awareness of 
recycled materials and use of renewable 
resources.
•	 Each operating unit developing and 
implementing their own procedures while 
conducting regular reviews to ensure that they 
are maintained and refined.
•	 Encouraging employees to pay special regard 
to environmental issues and requirements in 
the communities in which the Group operates.
•	 Incorporating health, safety and environment 
considerations into the design of new facilities.
Active participation in our 
community and environment are 
integral to our operations.

With the aim of maintaining standards a number 
of the Group’s operating facilities are ISO or API 
registered or subject to other similar registrations 
or industry qualifications. In 201 1, 6 facilities 
within the Group were ISO 14001 or ISO 18001 
compliant (2010 – 6), indicating a recognised 
Environmental Management System being in 
place. More facilities across the Group are working 
towards this accreditation, continuing the Group’s 
commitment to monitoring and reducing the 
environmental impact of its operations.
During the year, the Group completed the 
consolidation of its UK manufacturing operations 
from five sites down to two principal sites at 
Badentoy and Fordoun in Scotland. It is intended 
that this initiative will contribute to driving down 
utility costs and ultimately the release of 
greenhouse gas emissions. At Fordoun, the 
development work included a number of 
environmental considerations, including the 
extension of existing ditches and culverts to 
allow for a more natural habitat for local wildlife.
During 201 1, the expansion of our Stafford, 
Texas facility commenced. As part of the project, 
a storm water retention system was put in place 
across the whole facility, the insulation of the 
building was upgraded and energy efficient 
glazing used. ‘Smart’ energy distribution systems 
were also installed for daily and emergency 
power demands and energy efficient lighting with 
energy saving controls have also been installed.
During 201 1, the Group commenced an initiative 
to collect utility data from its operations. Data 
from the acquisitions completed in the year is 
included from the date of completion of the 
transaction. Usage of electricity and gas is 
presented in the accompanying chart.
Applying the respective emissions conversion 
factors to gas and electricity usage, the Group 
emitted a total of 25,700 tonnes of carbon 
dioxide equivalent (2010 – 19,600 tonnes) 
in 2011.
Mains water usage across the Group’s facilities 
is also shown in the accompanying chart. 
A number of the Group’s facilities in the US are 
supplied by on-site wells – water sourced from 
these wells is not included in the data presented.
Operational Excellence and Research
The Group continues to develop its relationships 
with academic institutions and during 201 1 
Hunting continued its collaboration with the 
University of Dundee in the UK by investing £0.1m 
to research ways of improving safety and reliability 
during ultra deepwater oil and gas extraction. 
The Group continuously strives to gain leadership 
in areas of technology relevant to the Group’s 
products and at the year-end had 316 active 
patents (2010 – 341).
In order for the Group to develop its engagement 
within its industry sector, the Group is a member 
of the following organisations:
•	 American Petroleum Institute (“API”)
•	 Society of Petroleum Engineers
•	 The Intervention and Coiled Tubing Association
•	 Leading Oil and Gas Industry Competitiveness
•	 Investors in People

The Community and Charitable Donations
Hunting’s commitment to the communities in 
which it operates extends on many fronts. The 
Group participates in a number of initiatives and in 
events which raise money for charities around the 
world. In 201 1, Hunting employees participated in 
local charitable events, including corporate 
support through sponsorship of a number of 
events, in Houston, Aberdeen and London.
The Group’s major charitable event, the Hunting 
Art Prize is an annual event which supports and 
recognises the local community in Houston, 
Texas. In 201 1, the Art Prize supported the charity 
‘Oil Helping Hands’ which assists people who 
have been injured by working in the wider 
industry. In Aberdeen, employees from Hunting 
Energy Services participated in the Aberdeen 
Corporate Decathlon which raises funds for local 
charities including CLAN, a cancer support 
charity based in Scotland.
The Group also makes donations to charities 
through the Chairman’s charitable trust 
committee, which comprises the Chairman and 
former Hunting employees. In 201 1, assistance 
was granted to 32 charities.
During 201 1, the Group donated £162,000 (2010 
– £164,000) to charities. In accordance with 
Group policy, no political donations were made 
in the year (2010 – £nil).
Business Ethics
The Group’s Directors and employees promote 
high standards of honesty and integrity in the way 
it goes about its business, recognising that the 
Group’s reputation is of critical importance in the 
industry in which we operate.
Through the Group’s Code of Conduct and in 
accordance with the recently implemented UK 
Bribery Act, the Group has policies and controls 
in place detailing procedures on how the Group 
interacts with customers, suppliers and 
governments around the world.
Customers and Suppliers
In February 201 1, the Group published its Code of 
Conduct to be adopted by the Group’s employees 
and agents, which is also sent to our customers and 
suppliers. The principles in the Code of Conduct 
lay out our responsibilities to all external associates 
and also incorporate anti-bribery and corruption 
policies addressed by the UK Bribery Act.

Hunting PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 37 
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting of the Company will take place 
on Wednesday 18 April 2012 at The Royal Automobile Club, 89 
Pall Mall, London, SW1Y 5HS, commencing at 10.30am. At the 
meeting, as well as routine matters, members will be asked to 
receive the Report of the Directors and Accounts, to approve 
the 201 1 Remuneration Committee Report and to give authority 
to the Directors to reappoint the Group’s external auditors and 
determine their remuneration.
Further details of the resolutions are set out in the letter 
concerning the Annual General Meeting, which accompanies 
the Notice of the Annual General Meeting.
Powers of the Directors
Subject to the Company’s Articles of Association, UK legislation 
and any directions prescribed by resolution of the Company in 
general meeting, the business of the Company is managed by 
the Board. The Directors have been authorised to allot and issue 
Ordinary shares and to make market purchases of the Company’s 
Ordinary shares. These powers are exercised under authority of 
resolutions of the Company passed at its Annual General Meeting. 
On 5 August 201 1, these powers were exercised when the 
Company issued 13,175,838 new Ordinary shares, in 
connection with the acquisition of Titan.
During the financial year ended 31 December 201 1 620,424 
Ordinary shares were also issued pursuant to the Company’s 
various share plans. 
Share Capital
The Company’s issued share capital comprises a single class, 
which is divided into Ordinary shares of 25p each, details of 
which are set out in note 34 of the financial statements. As at 
31 December 201 1, there were 146,316,186 Ordinary shares 
in issue. The rights and obligations attached to these shares 
are summarised on pages 37 and 38 and are detailed in the 
Articles of Association of the Company, copies of which can 
be obtained from Companies House in the UK, or by writing to 
the Company Secretary at the registered office of the Company. 
Subject to applicable statutes, shares may be issued with 
such rights and restrictions as the Company may, by ordinary 
resolution, decide, or (if there is no such resolution or so far as 
it does not make specific provision) as the Board may decide. 
The movements in share capital during the year are laid out in 
note 34 of this report.
The Directors have the authority to allot shares and to disapply 
statutory pre-emption rights. This authority is renewed annually 
at the Annual General Meeting. The Company has authority, 
renewed annually, to purchase up to 14.99% of the issued share 
capital, equating to 21,932,796 shares at 31 December 201 1. 
Any shares purchased will either be cancelled, and the number 
of Ordinary shares in issue reduced accordingly, or held in 
Treasury. The Directors will be seeking a new authority for 
the Company to purchase its Ordinary shares at its Annual 
General Meeting.
The Company holds 1,072,186 shares in Treasury (2010 – 
971,723), which are to satisfy a proportion of the shares under 
award to employees who participate in the share-based 
incentive schemes currently run by the Company. This number 
of shares is deducted from the Company’s equity. The Company 
has a policy to purchase shares in the market or issue new 
shares to ensure there are sufficient shares to meet 
future requirements.
The rights to such shares are restricted in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006 and, in particular, the voting and dividend 
rights attaching to these shares are automatically suspended.
During the year, to satisfy share options exercised by certain 
employees, the Company, through the Employee Share Trust, 
purchased 140,431 Treasury shares with an aggregate nominal 
value of £35,108. The total consideration was £1,108,171. 
Details of the employee share schemes can be found in the 
Remuneration Committee Report on page 41 and in note 40.
Voting Rights and Restrictions on Transfer of Shares
On a show of hands at a general meeting of the Company, 
every holder of Ordinary shares present in person or by proxy, 
and entitled to vote, has one vote, and, on a poll, every member 
present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote has one vote 
for every Ordinary share held. Further details regarding voting at 
the Annual General Meeting can be found in the notes to the 
Notice of the Annual General Meeting. None of the Ordinary 
shares carry any special rights with regard to control of the 
Company. Proxy appointments and voting instructions must be 
received by the Company’s Registrars not later than 48 hours 
before a general meeting.
Shareholders may submit votes electronically at 
www.sharevote.co.uk. A Voting ID, Task ID and Shareholder 
Reference Number will be required to complete this method of 
voting; these details are included on shareholders’ voting proxy 
cards. To be valid, an electronic proxy must be received by no 
later than 48 hours before a general meeting. Any shareholder 
having difficulty submitting their voting instructions electronically 
should contact the Company’s Registrars immediately.
A shareholder can lose his entitlement to vote at a general 
meeting where that shareholder has been served with a disclosure 
notice and has failed to provide the Company with information 
concerning interests in those shares. Shareholders rights to transfer 
shares are subject to the Company’s Articles of Association.
Transfers of uncertificated shares must be carried out using 
CREST and the Directors can refuse to register a transfer of an 
uncertificated share in accordance with the regulations 
governing the operation of CREST.
The Directors may decide to suspend the registration 
of transfers, for up to 30 days a year, by closing the register of 
shareholders. The Directors cannot suspend the registration 
of transfers of any uncertificated shares without obtaining 
consent from CREST.

laws and regulations, for example insider trading laws;
•	 pursuant to the Company’s share dealing code whereby the 
Directors and certain employees of the Company require 
approval to deal in the Company’s shares; and

was £0.6m (2010 – £0.9m).
Charitable and Political Contributions

to UK charitable organisations and £1 14,000 (2010 – £1 19,000) 
to overseas charities. It is the Group’s policy not to make

Property, Plant and Equipment 
Details of movements in property, plant and equipment are 
shown in note 15 to the financial statements. The Directors are 
of the opinion that the market value of Hunting’s properties at

Articles of Association
The Company’s Articles of Association may only be amended 
by special resolution at a general meeting of shareholders. 
Where class rights are varied, such amendments must be 
approved by the members of each class of share separately.
Significant Agreements
The Company is a party to a revolving credit facility in which 
the counterparties can determine whether or not to cancel 
the agreement where there has been a change of control of

provisions for compensation for loss of office or employment as 
a result of a change of control. Further details of the Directors’ 
service contracts can be found in the Remuneration Committee 
Report on pages 42 and 43.
Policy on the Payment of Creditors
The Company’s and Group’s policy is to pay all creditors in 
accordance with agreed terms of business. The Company itself 
has no substantial trade payables. The total amount of Group 
trade payables falling due within one year at 31 December 201 1 
represents 45 days’ worth (2010 – 44 days), as a proportion of 
the total amount invoiced by suppliers during the year ended 
on that date.
Statement of Disclosure of Information to Auditors
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006, all Directors in 
office as at the date of this report have confirmed, so far as they 
are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the 
Group’s auditors are unaware and each Director has taken all 
reasonable steps necessary in order to make himself aware of 
any relevant audit information and to establish that the Group’s 
auditors are aware of that information. This confirmation is given 
and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of 
Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.

Going Concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and position are 
set out in the Chief Executive’s Review and the Operating Review 
on pages 6 to 9 and pages 16 to 21. The financial position of the 
Group, its cash flows, liquidity position, borrowing facilities and 
financial capital management are described on pages 23 to 25 
and the principal risks and uncertainties facing the business are 
described on pages 27 and 28. The notes to the financial 
statements include the Group’s objectives, policies and processes 
for managing its capital (note 38), its financial risk management 
objectives (note 31), details of its financial instruments, hedging 
activities and sensitivity analysis (notes 30 and 31) and its 
exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk (note 31). 
The Group has considerable financial resources together with 
a broad range of products and services and a diverse, global 
customer and supplier base. As a consequence, the Directors 
believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business 
risks successfully in the current economic climate.
Accordingly, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future and consequently have 
adopted the going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
these financial statements.
Auditors
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has indicated its willingness to 
continue in office as auditors. A resolution to reappoint them as 
auditors to the Group will be proposed at the Annual General 
Meeting to be held on 18 April 2012.

Governance_v27.indd   39 09/03/2012   19:53 Hunting PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 40 
Introduction
Hunting PLC operates in the international energy arena, 
supplying to global companies. Recruiting, retaining and 
appropriately incentivising our senior management remains a 
clear focus for the work of the Remuneration Committee. The 
following report summarises the Committee’s work and outlines 
forward policies for remuneration.
Compliance
This report has been prepared in accordance with the relevant 
provisions of Schedule 8 to the Accounting Regulations under 
the Companies Act 2006 and has been approved by the Board. 
The report also satisfies the relevant requirements of the Listing 
Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how 
the Board has applied the principles relating to Directors’ 
remuneration in the UK Corporate Governance Code. It will be 
presented to shareholders for approval at the Annual General 
Meeting on 18 April 2012.
Remuneration Committee
Role and Composition
The Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”) is responsible 
for determining the remuneration of the Chairman and the 
executive Directors, including the setting of competitive salaries, 
annual performance targets and participation in the Company’s 
executive share-based incentive plans. The Committee also 
takes account of remuneration policy for the Group’s senior 
executives generally.
The constitution and operation of the Committee during the 
year has complied with the UK Corporate Governance Code’s 
guidance on Directors’ remuneration. The terms of reference of 
the Committee are published on the Group’s website and are 
available from the Company on request.
The Committee comprises the independent non-executive 
Directors of the Company Andrew Szescila (Committee 
Chairman), John Hofmeister and John Nicholas. Andrew Szescila 
was appointed to the Committee on 16 September 201 1 
following his appointment to the Board and became Chairman 
of the Committee on George Helland’s retirement from the 
Board on 1 October 201 1. David Barr joined the Committee on 
his appointment to the Board on 1 January 201 1 and resigned 
from the Committee on 8 April 201 1.
The Committee met four times in 201 1 with members attending 
all meetings held during their term in office, except David Barr 
who did not attend the meeting in February 201 1.
Work During the Year
The Committee’s principal activities during the year under 
review included:
•	 review of the remuneration structure vis-à-vis business needs;
•	 consideration and approval of executive Directors’ salaries, 
bonuses and awards under the Performance Share Plan (“PSP”);
•	 measurement of the performance conditions and 
determination of vesting levels in respect of awards under 
the Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) and the Executive 
Share Option Plan;
•	 approval of grant and vesting of awards under the LTIP and 
PSP; and
•	 approval of the Remuneration Committee Report.
On 1 August 201 1, Richard Hunting moved from an executive to 
a non-executive Director role. The Committee met in June 201 1 
to agree Mr Hunting’s remuneration, which is detailed in the 
section of the report concerning the non-executive Directors.
Advice
During the year, Hewitt New Bridge Street (“Hewitt”) and 
Towers Watson provided advice and assistance on remuneration 
for Hunting’s Directors, executive incentive plans and share 
scheme matters. Neither Hewitt nor Towers Watson provided 
any other service to the Group during 201 1. 
The Committee also consulted with and received information 
from the executives during the year but not in respect of their 
own remuneration.
Remuneration Policy
The Group aims to ensure that remuneration, generally, and 
incentives, in particular, provide a clear link between individual 
performance and shareholder interests. The policy is to provide 
competitive remuneration packages enabling the Group to 
attract, motivate and retain executives of high ability, experience 
and commitment.
The Committee believes an appropriate balance should be 
maintained between fixed and variable performance-related 
remuneration, with the current balance approximately 
35% deriving from salary and benefits and 65% from 
variable incentives.
The Committee’s on-going approach is to set base salaries 
within competitive market ranges, combined with realistic 
reward potential for performance that is outstanding. Executive 
Directors’ remuneration packages consist of an annual salary, 
health cover and where appropriate, car and fuel benefits, life 
and disability insurance, an annual performance-linked cash 
bonus plan, pension contributions, participation in performance 
linked share plans and a long-term incentive plan. Performance 
targets are established to achieve consistency with the interests 
of shareholders, with an appropriate balance between long and 
short-term goals.
In setting the remuneration of individual Directors, the 
Committee takes account of their role, responsibilities, skills, 
performance and references credible and established market 
pay studies. The Committee reviews such studies with caution 
in view of the risk of an upward ratchet in remuneration levels. 
The Committee also has the discretion to take account of social 
and corporate governance issues when setting the remuneration 
of the executive Directors.
Consistent with policy on service contracts, executive Directors’ 
service contracts are subject to termination on one year’s notice 
by the Company or the executive.
Set out below are the key elements of the policy, which will 
apply in 2012 and subsequent financial years. Whilst no major 
changes to policy are being implemented, the Committee

Hunting PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 41 
considers that an effective policy needs to be kept under review 
in order to reflect future changes to business needs and the 
environment in which the Company operates and, therefore, 
the policy may be amended in the future.
Base Salaries
Base salaries are reviewed annually. In considering 
appropriate salary levels, the Committee takes into account 
the remuneration paid by comparable companies in terms of 
asset size, revenues, profits, the number of employees, market 
capitalisation and the complexity and international spread of the 
Group’s operations, as well as applicable rates of inflation. The 
Company’s practice is to target base salaries at the mid-market 
level in the appropriate market for the executive position. In 
determining executive salaries, consideration is given to their 
experience and general personal performance. The Committee 
is also mindful of pay and conditions for the wider employee 
population when determining executive remuneration.
Annual Bonus
An annual performance-linked cash bonus scheme is in place for 
the executive Directors. The scheme, which is not pensionable, 
is designed to provide an incentive reward for performance and 
reflects the competitive markets in which the Group conducts 
its business.
Dennis Proctor and Peter Rose are eligible for a bonus under 
the scheme when 80% of the Group’s budgeted profit before 
tax and budgeted return on capital is achieved. Below this level 
no bonus is payable. The amount payable under the scheme, 
when the budgeted profit before tax and return on capital 
targets are achieved, is 100% of base salary for Dennis Proctor 
and 75% of base salary for Peter Rose. When actual results 
achieve 120% of these performance targets Dennis Proctor and 
Peter Rose are entitled to a maximum cash bonus of 200% and 
150% of base salary respectively. The amount of bonus payable 
accrues on a straight-line basis when actual results achieved are 
between 80% and 120% of performance targets.
Bonus schemes are in place for the majority of the 
Group’s employees.
Long-term Performance Related Incentives
The Group operates three long-term plans all of which target 
to align the incentive package of executives with that of the 
long-term interests of shareholders.
1. Performance Share Plan (“PSP”)
Awards under the PSP are granted annually and only vest 
if demanding performance conditions based on increased 
shareholder value are met. Awards granted under the PSP , 
which are subject to a three year vesting period, are based on 
the Group’s total shareholder return performance relative to the 
constituent members of the Dow Jones US Oil Equipment and 
Services and the DJ STOXX TM Oil Equipment and Services 
sector indices and if the Committee determines the Group’s 
financial performance to be satisfactory. These indices are 
considered by the Committee to be appropriate as they 
compare the Group’s performance against other companies 
in the oil and gas services sector. 
Awards vest subject to the schedule outlined below:
Group’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) against the TSR 
of the members of the Comparator Group
% of the award that vests
Upper quartile or above 100%
Between upper quartile 
and median
On a straight-line basis 
between 40% and 100%
Median 40%
Below median 0%
The plan allows for a maximum of share-based awards with a value 
equal to 200% of annual salary to be granted. In 201 1 , awards to 
the value of 100% and 80% of base salary were granted to Dennis 
Proctor and Peter Rose respectively.
2. Long-term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)
The LTIP is intended to link key executives’ remuneration to the 
long-term success and performance of the Group.
The LTIP is a performance-linked plan with an incentive pool, 
which is calculated using the sum of the Group’s after tax 
operating income after deducting a charge for the after tax cost of 
capital, which for 201 1 is a rate of 7% on average shareholders’ 
funds. Determination of the incentive pool incorporates two 
components, the first being 2% of the absolute value added, and 
the second being 5% of the incremental value added. These 
performance conditions align the interests of the executives with 
those of the Group and its shareholders and will only produce 
value to the participants if value is created for the Group.
Awards are determined for each participant at the beginning of a 
three year performance cycle and are settled at the end of each 
cycle either in shares or in cash. The award for each participant 
is calculated as a percentage of the incentive pool resulting from 
the performance of the business over the performance cycle, as 
determined by the Committee.
The pool available for distribution was £1.4m at 31 December 
201 1 compared to £0.2m at 31 December 2010. The aggregate 
amount of the pool distributed to participants for 201 1 was £1.3m.
Following vesting, the amount payable under any single award 
may not exceed a certain multiple of the base annual salary of 
each participant. The maximum award levels under the LTIP 
rules as a multiple of base salaries are 3.5 times annual salary 
for Dennis Proctor and 1.75 times annual salary for Peter Rose. 
3. Executive Share Option Plan
The Group operated an Executive Share Option Plan (“ESOP”) 
between 2001 and 2008 to provide long-term incentives for 
executive Directors and executives of the Group. From 2009, 
executive Directors were granted share-based awards under the 
PSP rather than grants under the option plan. In April 201 1, the 
final grants under the ESOP vested. No further grants will be 
made under this share option plan.

Directors’ Shareholding Requirements
In order to align the interests of the executive Directors with that of shareholders, each executive Director is required to build up and 
maintain a holding in the Company’s shares with a market value equivalent to not less than one times their annual salary.

In the opinion of the Directors, the FTSE Oil and Gas Index is the most appropriate index against which the shareholder return of the 
Company’s shares should be compared because this is the sector in which the Company is quoted.
Director Service Contracts
Executive Directors
The Company’s policy on executive Directors’ contracts is to comply with guidance contained in the UK Corporate Governance Code.
All Directors’ Service Contracts are rolling one year agreements and contain standard provisions allowing the Company to terminate 
summarily for cause, such as gross misconduct.
Dennis Proctor entered into an Employment Agreement with Hunting Energy Services Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group, 
on 7 February 2001. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, USA. Under the terms of the Agreement both 
Hunting Energy Services Inc. and Dennis Proctor are required to give one year’s notice of termination.
The Agreement contains a pay in lieu of notice clause, which provides for payment of base salary, performance bonus and vacation 
pay based on an annual entitlement of four weeks. There are special provisions on a change of control. These provide for payment 
of one year’s base salary together with an amount equal to the average performance bonus paid in the previous two years. In 
addition, Dennis Proctor would be entitled to continue to participate in the Group insurance programmes for one year following 
the change of control and, unless otherwise provided in the relevant option agreement, all share options and share-based awards 
granted to him will become exercisable at the date of the change of control.
Peter Rose entered into a Service Agreement with the Company on 23 April 2008. Under the terms of the Service Agreement for 
Peter Rose, both the Company and the Director are required to give one year’s notice of termination. The Company reserves the 
right to pay Peter Rose in lieu of notice (whether given by the Company or by him) which comprises his salary and bonus. The 
Company also has the option to put Peter Rose on paid leave of absence following payment of a sum equivalent to salary and bonus 
(based on the previous twelve month period), subject to him complying with the terms of his Service Agreement. These conditions 
also apply on termination following a change of control. In addition, Peter Rose would be entitled to an acceleration of all share 
options and share-based awards, which would become immediately exercisable and remain exercisable for a period of one year 
following termination.
The Company has authorised the executive Directors to undertake non-executive directorships outside of the Group provided these 
do not interfere with their primary duties. During the year neither Dennis Proctor nor Peter Rose held any external positions.

Pensions (audited)
Peter Rose and Richard Hunting are members of the Hunting Pension Scheme (the “Scheme”), which is a defined benefit pension 
scheme. The retirement age for the Directors under the Scheme is 60 and they are entitled to, subject to certain limits, a pension 
of up to two thirds of final salary. Pensionable salary is the annual salary less an amount equal to the State Lower Earnings Limit.

Governance_v27.indd   45 09/03/2012   19:53 Hunting PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 46 
Richard Hunting contributed 8.5% of his pensionable salary up until his Scheme retirement date of 31 July 2006. Peter Rose 
contributes a similar proportion of his salary to the Scheme. The Scheme provides all members a lump sum death in service benefit 
of four time’s base salary and a spouse’s pension of two thirds of the member’s pension on the member’s death. Bonuses and 
benefits do not qualify as pensionable salary. 
Dennis Proctor participates in a US 401K Tax Deferred Savings Plan and in 201 1 the Company contributed £9,162 (2010 – £9,484). 
In addition, the Company contributed £109,532 to money purchase arrangements (2010 – £94,838).

Notes
i. The total accrued pension shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement for life based on service to 31 December 2011. Peter Rose’s accrued pension at 31 December 2011 
includes a temporary pension of just over £9,000 per annum.
ii. The transfer values at 31 December 2011 have been based on estimated insurance company pricing terms, reflecting the fact that most of the benefits are covered by insurance policies.
iii. Richard Hunting’s normal retirement date was 31 July 2006. No further benefits have accrued to him since that date. The increase in Mr Hunting’s total accrued pension during 2011 is 
mainly due to him deferring part of his pension entitlement since reaching his normal retirement age. The year-end transfer value reflects only the value of the pension shown above and 
does not include the value of the pension he received during the year.
The information on pages 40 and ending half way on page 43 of this report is not audited and the information starting on page 43 to

Corporate Governance Report
“ Corporate Governance continues to be an important 
consideration of the Board of Hunting and so it is with 
great pleasure I introduce to you our report for 201 1. 
During the year the Company was compliant with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, with new initiatives being 
introduced to align the Board’s operation with the Code’s 
recommendations. With the appointment of Andrew 
Szescila in September 201 1, Hunting now has a full 
complement of independent non-executive Directors all 
having served for fewer than three years. Their challenge 
in the Boardroom, including input to the strategy and 
direction of the Company, has enabled Hunting to 
successfully execute four acquisitions in the year, 
while maintaining significant internal investment in our 
operations. Both elements of this strategy should mean that 
Hunting’s long-term future is built on a firm foundation.”
From Richard Hunting, Chairman of the Company
UK Corporate Governance Code
This statement, which has been approved by the Board, 
reports on the Company’s compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “Code”) as issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council (“FRC”) in May 2010 (available on its website 
www.frc.org.uk) and how the principles of the Code have been 
applied during 201 1. Compliance with the principles relating to 
Directors’ remuneration is reported within the Remuneration 
Committee Report on pages 40 to 46.
The Company was fully compliant with the Code’s provisions 
throughout the year.
Board Composition and Committee Membership
The Board of Directors currently comprises the non-executive 
Chairman, Chief Executive, Finance Director and three 
independent non-executive Directors. All independent non-
executive Directors are appointed to the Company’s Nomination, 
Audit and Remuneration Committees. Changes to the Board and 
its committees during the year are as follows:
•	 David Barr was appointed to the Board as an independent 
non-executive Director on 1 January 201 1. Following his 
appointment to an external executive role, Mr Barr stepped 
down from the Board on 8 April 201 1. 
•	 Andrew Szescila was appointed as an independent non-
executive Director on 16 September 201 1.
•	 George Helland retired from the Board after ten years’ 
service on 30 September 201 1 and following his retirement, 
Mr Szescila was appointed Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee.
On 1 August 201 1 , Richard Hunting moved from an executive to 
a non-executive role. Mr Hunting is not regarded as independent, 
given his former executive position since joining the Company 
in 1989. 
This composition, with a separate Chairman and Chief Executive, 
ensures a balance of responsibilities and authorities. Non-executive 
Directors’ letters of appointment include details of their duties and 
expected time commitments required. The Directors, together with 
brief biographical details, are identified on pages 34 and 35.
Excluding the Chairman, 60% of the Board is currently 
comprised of independent non-executive Directors.
Prior to the appointment of a non-executive Director, the 
Nomination Committee undertakes an evaluation of the Board’s 
requirements to ensure the balance of skill and experience is 
maintained to fulfil the Group’s strategy. In the case of a non-
executive Director being reappointed, the Code recommends 
a particularly rigorous evaluation with particular consideration 
being given to the need to regularly refresh the Board and to 
continued independence.
The Company has procedures in place to deal with potential 
conflicts of interest whereby actual and potential conflicts of 
interest are reviewed, and appropriate authorisation sought, prior 
to the appointment of any new Director or if a new conflict arises. 
In accordance with the Articles of Association, only non-conflicted 
Directors are involved in the authorisation process. The Board is of 
the view that these procedures operated effectively throughout the 
year. The Group operates a decentralised management structure to 
allow for rapid responses to customer requirements. A framework 
of controls with discretionary limits and powers for local 
management is contained within a group manual. 
Appointment and Replacement of Directors
Rules for the appointment and replacement of Directors are 
set out in the Company’s Articles of Association. Directors are 
appointed by the Company by ordinary resolution at a general 
meeting of holders of Ordinary shares or by the Board on the 
recommendation of the Nomination Committee. The Company 
may also remove a Director. Additional details of the workings 
of the Nomination Committee are set out on page 49.
Following the Code’s guidance on the election of Directors, at 
the Annual General Meeting of the Company held in April 201 1, 
all of the Board submitted themselves for re-election.
The non-executive Directors are initially appointed for a 
three year term with subsequent reappointment conditional 
upon an appraisal and review process described below. 
Letters of appointment for each of the independent non-
executive Directors are available from the Company upon 
request and their terms of appointment are summarised on page 
43. Details of the executive Directors’ service contracts are set 
out on page 42.
On appointment to the Board, each Director receives 
comprehensive induction tailored to their experience and 
needs. Andrew Szescila is receiving an induction to the Group, 
including site visits to subsidiaries and is also available to 
meet shareholders. All Directors have access to the Company 
Secretary and to independent professional advice, at the 
Company’s expense, in the furtherance of their duties. Directors 
are encouraged to maintain their skills and knowledge to best 
practice standards and, where appropriate, attend update 
training courses on relevant topics. During the year, the 
Chairman also met each individual Director to discuss training 
and development requirements. The Company Secretary, 
through the Chairman, is responsible for keeping the Board

informed of Corporate Governance developments and maintaining corporate awareness of legislative and regulatory changes. 
The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter reserved for the Board.
Board and Committee Meetings
The Board normally meets formally five times a year and convened ten times during 201 1, of which one meeting was held in North 
America. The additional Board meetings were convened to discuss and approve the acquisitions made during the year.
Meeting dates are set a year in advance. Attendance by each of the Directors at Board or committee meetings is detailed below 
(maximum possible number of meetings attended shown in brackets).

Corporate Governance Report continued
Board papers are always circulated in advance of meetings. 
These include detailed financial reports on the Group’s 
activities, reports on each operating division, health and safety, 
risk management and investor relations reports. In addition, the 
meetings held in February and August focus on the full and half 
year results respectively and the meeting in December focuses 
on the budget for the following financial year.
The duties and responsibilities of the Board and its committees 
are formally agreed by the Board in writing. In addition, the 
division of responsibilities between the Chairman and Chief 
Executive is set out in writing and agreed by the Board. Matters 
specifically reserved for the Board include, but are not limited 
to, the following:
•	 compliance with UK Company Law and the UKLA’s Listing 
Rules;
•	 review of the Group’s system of risk management, internal 
control and assess its effectiveness;
•	 approve all Stock Exchange announcements;
•	 approve the full and half year financial statements, including 
the approval of dividends;
•	 consider the Group’s commercial strategy and approval of 
the annual budget;
•	 consider recommendations of the Board subcommittees 
including Board remuneration, appointments and their terms 
of reference.
Board Performance Evaluation
The Board, its committees and each individual Director 
participate in an annual performance evaluation appraisal, 
the purpose of which is to confirm the continued effective 
contribution and performance of the individual or committee in 
line with the Code’s recommendations. Evaluation of the Board 
was undertaken by the non-executive Directors and took 
account of the Directors’ attendance and their contribution at 
meetings, financial performance of the Group against budget, 
compliance with corporate governance and best practice 
guidelines and market perception of the Group. The 
Nomination, Remuneration and Audit Committees were 
evaluated by the executive Directors and took account of 
communication with the Board and compliance with terms 
of reference. The evaluation of the Chairman was undertaken 
by the independent non-executive Directors, led by the Senior 
Independent Director, and included an assessment of his 
leadership and direction of the Board. The appraisal of the 
Chief Executive was completed by the non-executive Directors 
together with the Chairman. Evaluation of the other individual 
Directors took account of their contribution and, in the case of 
the Finance Director, the performance of his executive duties. 
The Board is also considering the use of external facilitators 
to evaluate its practices as recommended by the Code.

Hunting PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 49 
Board Committees
The Board has three main committees to which it delegates 
responsibility and authority:
Nomination Committee
Members of the committee are Richard Hunting (committee 
chairman), Dennis Proctor and the independent non-executive 
Directors. The committee convened twice during the year and 
has written terms of reference approved by the Board, which 
are published on the Group’s website. The role of the committee 
includes leading the process for Board appointments and 
determining the terms of new appointments. The committee 
also considers succession planning which takes into account 
the experience and skills required of Board members. 
In April 201 1, the committee commenced a process to appoint 
a new independent non-executive Director. The committee 
considered the balance of experience currently represented 
by the Board of Directors and the need to regularly refresh 
the Board and concluded that a Director with oil services 
knowledge would enhance its capabilities. The committee 
appointed Boyden Associates to assist the search process, and 
after reviewing the available candidates completed a formal 
interview process. The committee met on 23 August 201 1 and 
16 September 201 1 to consider the appointment of Andrew 
Szescila and recommended his appointment with effect from 
16 September 201 1. Mr Szescila has considerable experience in 
the global oil services sector and is a valuable addition to the 
Company as it continues its growth strategy.
In February 201 1, the Davies Report (Women on Boards) was 
published. The Board has considered the recommendations of 
the report and, in February 2012, issued its gender diversity policy 
for Board appointments. Given the current size and balance of 
experience of Hunting’s Board and the recent refreshing of the 
Board’s independent non-executive Directors it is unlikely that 
Hunting will be compliant with the recommendations of the 
Davies Report in the short term. However, in line with the Davies 
Report’s recommendations, Hunting’s diversity policy commits 
the Group to:
•	 An embedded culture of equal opportunities for all 
employees, regardless of gender;
•	 Require external recruitment consultants to submit their 
diversity policies to the Group prior to appointment;
•	 Ensure that external consultants appointed by Hunting submit 
candidate shortlists comprising at a minimum 25% of women 
for consideration by the Nomination Committee;
•	 A target of at least one female Director of the Company 
when practicable;
•	 An annual review by the Nomination Committee of 
its progress complying with the Davies Report’s 
recommendations.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises solely the independent 
non-executive Directors of the Company. Andrew Szescila was 
appointed to the Committee on 16 September 201 1 following 
his appointment to the Board and on 1 October 201 1 became 
the chairman of the Committee following the retirement of 
Mr Helland. Details of the Remuneration Committee’s activities 
are contained within its report on page 40. The Committee 
convened four times during the year and the attendance of 
Committee members during the year is noted on page 48. The 
Committee has written terms of reference approved by the Board 
which are published on the Group’s website. During the year, the 
Committee reviewed its effectiveness and the Chairman reported 
these findings to the Board. 
Audit Committee
Members of the committee, which is chaired by John Nicholas, 
comprise exclusively the independent non-executive Directors. 
The committee met four times during the year and operates 
under written terms of reference approved by the Board, which 
are published on the Company’s website. The committee 
normally meets in February, April (to coincide with the Annual 
General Meeting of the Company), August and December. The 
Chairman, Chief Executive, Finance Director and the external 
auditors are invited to attend all meetings. During the year, the 
committee reviewed its effectiveness and the Chairman 
reported these findings to the Board.
The auditors present an audit report at the March, April, 
August and December meetings for consideration by the 
committee. Their full year report includes a statement on their 
independence, their ability to remain objective and to undertake 
an effective audit. The committee considers and assesses this 
independence statement on behalf of the Board taking into 
account the level of fees paid particularly for non-audit services. 
The committee considers the effectiveness of the audit by 
reviewing and taking account of any Financial Reporting 
Council reports on the auditors, together with input from 
executive management. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and its 
predecessor firms have been the Group’s auditors for many 
years. The Audit Committee is satisfied with their effectiveness 
and their independence and has not considered it necessary to 
require an independent tender process. The Audit Committee 
considers the reappointment of the auditors annually and makes 
a recommendation to the Board. 
During 201 1, the committee continued to closely monitor fees 
paid to the auditors in respect of non-audit services, which are 
analysed within note 6 on page 74. In 201 1, fees for non-audit 
services exceeded the annual audit fee largely due to fees 
charged of £1.5m for due diligence support on the four 
acquisitions completed during the year. In addition, taxation 
advice amounted to £1.0m and other services £0.2m, bringing 
the total non-audit services fee to £2.7m. The scope and extent 
of non-audit work undertaken by the external auditor is 
monitored by, and, above certain thresholds, requires prior 
approval from the committee to ensure that the provision of 
such services does not impair their independence or objectivity. 
At the August meeting, which was held immediately prior to the 
announcement of the half year results, the auditors presented 
their interim report to the committee, which included audit 
scope and fee estimates for the annual audit. The committee 
normally meets with the auditors without executive Directors 
present at the end of each formal meeting.

Other responsibilities of the Audit Committee include:
•	 monitor and review of reports on the Group’s system 
of internal control;
•	 review of reports from the Group’s internal audit programme;
•	 review of internal audit scope;
•	 review of the external auditor’s independence and 
effectiveness of the audit process and assess the level and 
quality of service in relation to fees paid;
•	 monitor the Group’s financial statements and 
announcements; and
•	 monitor and approve engagements of the external auditor to 
provide non-audit services to the Group.
The Board received copies of all reports submitted to the 
Audit Committee.
The Senior Independent Director, John Hofmeister, is the primary 
point of contact for staff of the Company to raise in confidence, 
concerns they may have over possible improprieties, financial or 
otherwise. All employees have been notified of this arrangement 
through the corporate magazine, Group notice boards and the 
Group’s website. 
Institutional Shareholders
The Company uses a number of processes for communicating 
with shareholders, including stock exchange announcements, 
the annual and half year reports, interim management statements 
issued twice a year, and the Annual General Meeting to which 
all shareholders are invited. In addition, the Chief Executive and 
Finance Director meet on a one-to-one basis with all principal 
shareholders at least twice a year, following the Group’s half and 
full year results, or when requested to update them on Group 
performance and strategy. The Board is in turn briefed by 
the Chief Executive, when appropriate, on matters raised 
by shareholders. 
During the year, the Chairman and Senior Independent 
Director met with a number of shareholders to discuss strategy, 
governance and other matters. Their comments were passed on 
to the Board by the Chairman. The non-executive Directors are 
also available to meet shareholders. The Company’s major 
shareholders are listed, together with the information required 
under the Disclosure and Transparency Rules 7 .2.6, within the 
Report of the Directors on page 38.
Internal Controls
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for the Group’s 
system of internal control, for reviewing its effectiveness and 
for compliance with the Turnbull guidance. The internal control 
system, which has been in place throughout 201 1 and up to 
the date of approval of these accounts, is an on-going process 
designed to identify, evaluate and manage the significant risks to 
which the Group is exposed. These systems of internal control 
are designed to manage rather than eliminate risks, therefore 
they only provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement or loss in the financial statements 
and of meeting internal control objectives. The Directors have 
reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal 
control for the period covered by these financial statements, 
the key features of which are as follows:
Management Structure – within operational parameters set by 
the Board, management is delegated to the executive Directors. 
Subsidiaries operate within clearly defined policies and authorities 
contained within a group manual under a decentralised 
management structure. All senior management changes 
require the prior approval of the Chief Executive.
Reporting and Consolidation – all subsidiaries submit detailed 
financial information in accordance with a pre-set reporting 
timetable. This includes weekly, bi-monthly and quarterly treasury 
reports, monthly management accounts, annual budgets and 
two-year plans, together with half year and annual statutory 
reporting. The Group’s consolidation process is maintained and 
updated with regular communication, including distribution of a 
group manual to all reporting units. The Group monitors and 
reviews new UK Listing Rules, Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules, accounting standards, interpretations and amendments and 
legislation and other statutory requirements. Subsidiary reporting 
entities are supported by instruction from Group and structured 
training. All data is subject to review and assessment by 
management through the monitoring of key performance ratios 
and comparison to targets and budgets. The content and format 
of reporting is kept under review and periodically amended to 
ensure appropriate information is available.
Strategic Planning and Budgeting – strategic plans and annual 
budgets containing comprehensive financial projections are 
formally presented to the Board for adoption and approval 
and form the basis for monitoring performance. Clearly 
defined procedures exist for capital expenditure proposals 
and authorisation.
Quality Assurance – most of the business sectors within 
which the Group operates are highly regulated and subsidiaries 
are invariably required to be accredited, by the customer or 
an industry regulator, to national or international quality 
organisations. These organisations undertake regular audits 
and checks on subsidiary procedures and practices ensuring 
compliance with regulatory requirements.
Monitoring Process – in addition to reports from the external 
auditors, the Audit Committee receives reports from the internal 
auditor and monitors the internal audit process, as part of the 
Group’s internal audit and risk assessment programme. An 
annual programme of internal audit assignments is reviewed 
by the Audit Committee. All subsidiaries undertake formal 
self-assessment risk reviews a minimum of three times a year 
on their internal control environment. These reviews encompass 
the identification of the key business, financial, compliance 
and operational risks facing the business, together with an 
assessment of the controls in place for managing and mitigating 
these risks. Additionally, risks are evaluated for their potential 
impact on the business. The results of these reviews, together 
with a review of risks facing the Group as a whole, are reported 
to the Board.
Bribery Act Compliance – On 1 July 201 1, the UK’s Bribery Act 
became law. To comply with the Act, Hunting has implemented 
procedures including the publication of Bribery and Corruption 
policies and detailed guidelines on interacting with customers,

suppliers and agents, including specific policies for gifts, 
entertainment and hospitality. Senior managers across the 
Group are required to report their compliance activities 
including an evaluation of risk areas. The Group has completed 
a screening exercise to determine relevant employees who 
face a heightened risk of bribery with all relevant personnel 
completing a formal training and compliance course, in line 
with the Group’s procedures. 
Code of Conduct – The Group’s Code of Conduct contains 
policies and procedures covering how the Group conducts 
business and maintains its relationships with business partners. 
The Code of Conduct is available on the Group’s website. 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, 
the Remuneration Committee Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
Company Law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law, the Directors 
have elected to prepare the Group and parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European 
Union (“EU”). Under Company Law, the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for 
that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
•	 select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently;
•	 make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
•	 state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the EU have 
been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements; and
•	 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s and 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group 
and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements and 
the Remuneration Committee Report comply with the Companies 
Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation. The Directors are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group and the Company and for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
The Directors are also responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the Group’s website, www.huntingplc.com. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Pursuant to the Financial Service Authority’s Listing Rules and 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules, each of the Directors, 
whose names and responsibilities are listed on page 35, confirm 
that, to the best of their knowledge and belief:
•	 the financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group and the 
loss of the Company; and
•	 the Business Review on pages 6 to 35 includes a fair review 
of the development and performance of the Group’s 
operations and the position of the Group and the Company, 
together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties they face.

Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of Hunting PLC 
We have audited the financial statements of Hunting PLC for the 
year ended 31 December 201 1 which comprise the Consolidated 
Income Statement, Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, Consolidated Balance Sheet, Company Balance Sheet, 
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, Company 
Statement of Changes in Equity, Consolidated and Company 
Statement of Cash Flows, the Principal Accounting Policies and 
the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”), as adopted by the 
European Union and, as regards the parent company financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors 
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities set out on page 51, the Directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is 
to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and 
only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to 
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come 
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the Audit of the Financial Statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies 
are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent Company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read 
all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual 
Report and Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with 
the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any 
apparent misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Opinion on Financial Statements
In our opinion: 
•	 the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state 
of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at 
31 December 201 1 and of the Group’s profit and Group’s 
and parent Company’s cash flows for the year then ended; 
•	 the Group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; 
•	 the parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs, as adopted by the 
European Union and as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
•	 the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation.
Opinion on Other Matters Prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
•	 the part of the Remuneration Committee Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
•	 the information given in the Report of the Directors for the 
financial year for which the financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on Which we are Required to Report by Exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion: 
•	 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or 
•	 the parent Company financial statements and the part of the 
Remuneration Committee Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
•	 certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or 
•	 we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
•	 the Directors’ statement, set out on page 39, in relation to 
going concern;
•	 the parts of the Corporate Governance Report relating to the 
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code specified for our review; and
•	 certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board 
on Directors’ remuneration.

Principal Accounting Policies
Basis of Accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006 and those International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union 
and IFRIC Interpretations. The financial statements have been 
prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost 
convention as modified by the revaluation of available for sale 
financial assets and those financial assets and financial liabilities 
held for trading. The comparative amounts for the year ended 
31 December 2010 have been restated to reflect Field Aviation 
as a discontinued operation.
The presentation of the Group’s intangible asset amortisation 
charge has been changed such that the charge is separately 
presented with exceptional items in the income statement. 
The 2010 income statement has been re-presented to reflect 
this change.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of 
these financial statements are set out below. These policies have 
been consistently applied to all the years presented.
Adoption of New Standards, Amendments and Interpretations
The following new standards, amendments and interpretations 
became effective for and were adopted during the year ended 
31 December 201 1:
•	 IAS 24 (revised) Related Party Disclosures
•	 Amendment to IFRIC 14 – Prepayments of a Minimum 
Funding Requirement
•	 Improvements to IFRSs – May 2010
Although the adoption of these standards, amendments 
and interpretations represent a change in accounting policy, 
comparative figures for 2010 have not been restated for these, as 
the changes do not impact the financial performance or position 
of the Group.
Standards, Amendments and Interpretations Effective 
Subsequent to the Year End
•	 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments*
•	 IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements*
•	 IFRS 1 1 Joint Arrangements*
•	 IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities*
•	 IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement*
•	 IAS 27 (revised) Separate Financial Statements*
•	 IAS 28 (revised) Investments in Associates and 
Joint Ventures*
•	 Amendment to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures 
– Transfers of Financial Assets
•	 Amendment to IAS 12 – Deferred tax: Recovery of 
Underlying Assets*
•	 Amendment to IAS 1 – Presentation of Items of Other 
Comprehensive Income*
•	 Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits*
* Not yet endorsed by the European Union.
It is not anticipated that any of the new requirements will 
significantly impact the Group’s results or financial position.
Consolidation
The Group accounts include the results of the Company and its 
subsidiaries, together with its share of associates.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the 
power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally 
accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the 
voting rights, so as to obtain benefits from their activities. The 
group also assesses existence of control where it does not have 
more than 50% of the voting power but is able to govern the 
financial and operating policies by virtue of de-facto control.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which 
control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated 
from the date control ceases.
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to 
account for business combinations. The consideration transferred 
for a business acquisition represents the fair values of any assets 
transferred, liabilities incurred and/or equity interests issued by the 
Group. The consideration also includes the fair value of any asset 
or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. 
The subsequent movement in fair value of any contingent asset 
or liability is taken to the income statement. Identifiable assets 
acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a 
business combination are measured initially at their fair values 
at the acquisition date. 
Acquisition-related costs are expensed to the income statement 
as incurred.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are 
eliminated on consolidation. Uniform accounting policies have 
been adopted across the Group.
Non-controlling Interests
Non-controlling interests are those interests in the net assets and 
results of consolidated subsidiaries, which are not attributable, 
directly or indirectly, to the Group, and are identified separately 
in shareholders’ equity.
Associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant 
influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a 
joint venture. Generally, the Group regards an investment in the 
voting rights of between 20% and 50% as an associate. Under 
the equity method, the investment in the associate is initially 
recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or 
decreased to recognise the Group’s share of the profit or loss 
of the associate after the date of acquisition. The Group’s share 
of after tax results of associates is included separately in the 
income statement and the Group’s share of the net assets is 
included separately in the balance sheet.
Discontinued Operations
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group that 
has either been disposed of or that is classified as held-for-
sale, which represents a separate major line of business 
or geographical area of operations and is part of a single 
coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business 
or geographical area of operations. Discontinued operations are 
presented in the income statement as a separate line and are 
shown net of tax.

FinancialXstatements_v44.indd   53 09/03/2012   19:58 Hunting PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 54 
Revenue
Revenue is measured as the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable for the provision of goods or services 
in the ordinary course of business, taking into account trade 
discounts and volume rebates, and is stated net of sales taxes. 
Revenue is recognised when it is probable that the economic 
benefits associated with a transaction will flow to the Group 
and the amount of revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the 
significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred 
to the customer, which is normally on delivery of the products. 
Revenue on contracts for the supply of goods is recognised 
on completion of the contract when the significant risks and 
rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer. However, 
if control and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of 
the work in progress in its current state are transferred to the 
customer as construction progresses, then revenue is recognised 
by reference to the stage of completion.
Revenue from the sale of services is recognised as the services 
are rendered. Revenue on contracts for the supply of services is 
recognised according to the stage of completion reached in the 
contract by reference to the work done during the period as a 
proportion of the total amount of work to be done under the 
contract. An estimate of the profit attributable to work completed 
is only recognised once the outcome of the contract can be 
reliably measured. Expected losses are recognised in full as soon 
as losses are probable. The net amount of costs incurred to date 
plus recognised profits less the sum of recognised losses and 
progress billings is disclosed as trade receivables or payables.
Exceptional Items
Exceptional items are regarded as significant items of income and 
expense, which are separately disclosed by virtue of their size, 
incidence or nature to enable a full understanding of the Group’s 
financial performance. Exceptional items principally comprise 
profits or losses on the closure or disposal of subsidiaries, 
provision for warranties on the disposal of subsidiaries, the 
impairment of assets, provisions for onerous leases, acquisition 
costs, unamortised loan facility fees written off on early 
termination of the facility, retention bonuses for management of 
acquired businesses and the charge to the income statement for 
the fair value uplift to inventories as they are sold.
Interest
Interest income and expense is recognised in the income 
statement using the effective interest method, except for finance 
costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or 
production of qualifying assets, which are capitalised as part of 
the cost of those assets until such time as they are substantially 
ready for their intended use or sale.
Foreign Currencies
The financial statements for each of the Group’s subsidiaries 
and associates are prepared using their functional currency. 
The functional currency is the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which an entity operates. The 
presentation currency of the Group and functional currency 
of Hunting PLC is sterling.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of 
the entity are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of 
the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities, except borrowings designated as 
a hedging instrument in a net investment hedge, denoted in 
non-functional currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate 
ruling at the balance sheet date and any exchange differences 
arising are taken to the income statement. Borrowings 
designated as a hedging instrument in a net investment hedge 
are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet 
date and any exchange differences arising are taken direct 
to equity.
For consolidation purposes, the net assets of non-sterling 
denominated subsidiaries and associates are translated into 
sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. 
The income statements of these subsidiaries and associates are 
translated into sterling at the average rates of exchange for the 
year. Exchange differences are recognised directly in equity in 
the foreign currency translation reserve, together with exchange 
differences arising on foreign currency loans used to finance 
foreign currency net investments. The foreign currency 
translation reserve commenced on 1 January 2004 and all 
cumulative translation differences for foreign currency operations 
that existed on 1 January 2004 were deemed to be zero.
On the disposal of a business, the cumulative exchange 
differences previously recognised in the foreign currency 
translation reserve relating to that business are transferred to the 
income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Taxation
The taxation charge in the income statement comprises current 
tax and deferred tax arising on the current year’s profit before 
tax and adjustments to tax arising on prior years’ profits.
Current tax is the expected tax payable arising in the current year 
on the current year’s profit before tax, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, plus adjustments 
to tax payable in respect of prior years’ profits.
Deferred tax is the expected tax payable on the current year’s 
profit before tax arising in a future year, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date that are expected 
to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the 
deferred tax liability is settled.
Full provision is made for deferred taxation, using the liability 
method, on all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax 
assets and liabilities are recognised separately on the balance 
sheet and are reported as non-current assets in line with IAS 1. 
Consequently, deferred tax assets that are expected to be 
recovered within twelve months are recognised within non-
current assets. The same accounting treatment applies for 
deferred tax liabilities. Deferred tax assets are recognised only 
to the extent that they are expected to be recoverable. Deferred 
taxation on unremitted overseas earnings is provided for to the 
extent a tax charge is foreseeable.

Hunting PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 55 
If items of income and expense are recognised in other 
comprehensive income, then the current and deferred tax relating 
to those items is also recognised in other comprehensive income.
Segmental Reporting
Financial information on operating segments that corresponds 
with information regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating 
Decision Maker is disclosed in the accounts. Information on 
operating segments, which are components of the Group that are 
engaged in providing related products, is presented. Geographical 
information presented is based on the location of where the sale 
originated and where the non-current assets are located.
Research and Development
Research costs and development costs ineligible for capitalisation 
are written off to the income statement as incurred.
Exploration Expenditure
Oil and gas exploration and appraisal costs are initially 
capitalised to wells or fields as appropriate, pending 
determination of the existence of commercial reserves. 
Expenditures incurred during the exploration and appraisal 
phases are written off unless probable (“commercial”) reserves 
have been established or the determination process has not 
been completed. Drilling expenditure and directly attributable 
operational overheads associated with an exploratory dry hole 
are expensed immediately upon final determination that 
commercially viable quantities of hydrocarbons are not found.
When an oil or gas field has been approved for development, 
the accumulated exploration and appraisal costs are included in 
oil and gas development properties.
Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any impairment in value. Costs include 
expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition and 
installation of the items and finance costs directly attributable to 
the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other 
than land or assets under construction, to their residual value, over 
their estimated useful lives. All categories of asset are depreciated, 
using the straight-line method, using the following rates, with the 
exception of oil and gas exploration and production equipment, 
which is charged on a unit of production basis.
•	 Freehold buildings – 2% to 10%
•	 Leasehold buildings – life of lease
•	 Plant, machinery and motor vehicles – 6% to 33
1
⁄3%
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and 
adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
Freehold land and expenditure on the exploration for and 
evaluation of mineral resources are not depreciated.
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, less any 
impairment in value and are included in the relevant asset 
category. Depreciation of these assets commences when the 
assets are ready for their intended use. In the case of a new 
manufacturing facility this will be when the facility has been 
commissioned. For larger facilities, this may occur in phases.
Computer software integral to an item of machinery is 
capitalised as part of the hardware.
Property, plant and equipment are impaired if their recoverable 
amount falls below their carrying value. Impairment losses are 
charged to the income statement immediately.
Oil and gas development expenditure is stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. Where 
commercial production in an area of interest has commenced, 
the capitalised costs are depreciated using the unit of production 
method over the total proved reserves of the field concerned. 
Costs are depreciated only when commercial reserves associated 
with a development project can be determined with reasonable 
accuracy and commercial production has commenced.
Goodwill
On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the 
net assets acquired. Goodwill arises where the fair value of the 
consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the Group’s share 
of the net assets acquired.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is carried at cost less 
accumulated impairment losses. 
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose 
of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash-
generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are 
expected to benefit from the business combination in which 
the goodwill arose.
On the disposal of a business, goodwill relating to that business 
remaining on the balance sheet at the date of disposal is 
included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill written off to reserves prior to 1998 has not been 
reinstated and will not be included in determining any 
subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Other Intangible Assets
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment losses, where applicable. These 
assets have a finite life and are amortised in accordance with 
the pattern of expected future economic benefits, or when this 
cannot be reliably estimated, by using the straight-line method. 
Intangible assets are amortised over the following periods:
•	 Customer relationships – eight to ten years 
•	 Patents – ten to twelve years
•	 Unpatented technology – ten years
•	 Trademarks and domain names – one to five years
Impairments
The Group carries out impairment reviews in respect of 
goodwill at least annually. The Group also assesses at least 
annually whether there have been any events or changes in 
circumstances that indicate that property, plant and equipment 
and other intangible assets may be impaired and an impairment 
review is carried out whenever such an assessment indicates 
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For the

purposes of impairment testing, assets are grouped at the lowest 
levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
Where impairment exists, the asset is written down to its 
recoverable amount, which is the higher of the fair value less 
costs to sell and value in use, being the net present value of 
estimated future cash flows. Impairments are recognised 
immediately in the income statement.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. 
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if 
there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to 
the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed 
the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of 
depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been 
previously recognised.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost is determined using the first-in-first-out method and net 
realisable value is the estimated selling price less costs of disposal 
in the ordinary course of business. The cost of inventories includes 
direct costs plus production overheads.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash 
at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with a maturity of 
less than three months from the date of deposit that are readily 
convertible to a known amount of cash. Accrued interest is 
disclosed as part of the year-end balance.
For cash flow statement purposes, cash and cash equivalents 
include bank overdrafts and short-term deposits with a maturity 
of less than three months from the date of deposit. In the 
balance sheet, bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings 
in current liabilities.
Financial Assets
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following 
categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, 
loans and receivables, and available for sale financial assets. 
Management determines the classification of its investments 
at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at every 
reporting date. Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value 
at the trade date, which is normally the consideration paid, plus, 
in the case of financial assets that are not measured at fair value 
through profit or loss, transaction costs. The Group assesses at 
each balance sheet date whether a financial asset is impaired 
by comparing its carrying value with the present value of the 
estimated future cash flows discounted at a rate relevant to the 
nature of the financial asset. Management will however use an 
alternative method where this would result in a more accurate 
fair value. If the carrying amount is higher, it is reduced to the 
appropriate value and the loss is recognised immediately. 
Financial assets cease to be recognised when the right to receive 
cash flows has expired or has been transferred and the Group has 
transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
(a) Financial Assets at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value are 
included in the income statement in the period in which they 
arise. A financial asset is included in this category if acquired 
principally for the purpose of selling in the short-term and 
also includes derivatives that are not designated in a hedge 
relationship. Assets in this category are classified as current 
assets if they are expected to be settled within twelve months, 
otherwise they are classified as non-current assets.
(b) Loans and Receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets 
with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an 
active market. The Group’s loans and receivables comprise 
“trade and other receivables” and “cash and cash equivalents” 
in the balance sheet. Trade receivables are amounts due from 
customers for goods sold or services performed in the ordinary 
course of business. Loans and receivables are carried at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method. If collection 
is expected in one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle 
of the business if longer), they are classified as current assets. If 
not, they are presented as non-current assets. Interest accrued 
on loans carried at amortised cost is regarded as an integral part 
of the loan balance and therefore included within the carrying 
amount of those loans. Consequently, interest receivable within 
twelve months on loans due after more than one year is 
recognised within non-current assets.
(c) Available for Sale Financial Assets
Available for sale financial assets are held at fair value, with 
changes in fair value recognised directly in equity. On disposal 
or impairment, the accumulated gains and losses previously 
recognised in equity are recognised in the income statement. 
Available for sale financial assets are non-derivative assets that 
are either designated in this category or not classified in any 
other categories.
Financial Liabilities
Financial liabilities, including trade payables, are initially 
recognised at fair value at the trade date which is normally the 
consideration received less, in the case of financial liabilities that 
are not measured at fair value through profit or loss, transaction 
costs. The Group subsequently remeasures all of its non-
derivative financial liabilities, including trade payables, at 
amortised cost.
Payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due 
within one year (or in the normal operating cycle of the business 
if longer). If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Interest accrued on loans that are measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method is regarded as an integral part 
of the loan balance and therefore included within the carrying 
amount of those loans. Consequently, interest payable within 
twelve months on loans due after more than one year is 
recognised in non-current borrowings.

FinancialXstatements_v44.indd   56 09/03/2012   19:58 COMPANY OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Hunting PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 57 
Debt Issue Costs
When it is probable that some or all of the loan facility will 
be drawn down, transaction costs are capitalised and presented 
as a reduction to the borrowed amount and subsequently 
amortised through interest expense using an appropriate 
effective interest method. When it is not probable that some 
or all of the loan facility will be drawn down, the facility fee is 
capitalised as a prepayment for services and amortised over 
the period of the relevant facility on a straight-line basis. The 
amortisation charge is recognised in the income statement as 
an interest expense.
When a facility is terminated early , the unamortised debt issue costs 
carried at the time of termination are written off to the income 
statement immediately and recognised as an interest expense.
Derivatives and Financial Instruments
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value as net 
proceeds received or consideration paid at the trade date and 
are subsequently remeasured at their fair value at each balance 
sheet date. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that have not 
been designated in a hedge relationship are recognised 
immediately in the income statement.
Derivative and primary financial instruments that are designated 
in a hedge relationship are accounted for as cash flow hedges. 
Hedges of highly probable forecast transactions are cash flow 
hedges. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of 
derivatives designated in a cash flow hedge is recognised directly 
in equity. The gains and losses relating to the ineffective portion 
are recognised in the income statement. Amounts accumulated 
in equity are taken to the income statement at the same time 
the hedged item is recognised in the income statement. When a 
hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer 
meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or 
loss in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised 
when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the 
income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the cumulative gains and losses that were 
reported in equity are immediately transferred to the 
income statement.
All of the Group’s hedges to which hedge accounting is applied, 
are tested for effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively and 
are fully documented as hedges at the point of inception of the 
hedge relationship.
Embedded Derivatives
An embedded derivative is a feature in a contract that causes 
the cash flows of the contract to change whenever there is a 
change in a specified variable. The Group reviews its contracts 
when it first becomes a party to the contract in order to 
determine the existence of embedded derivatives within them.
Derivatives that are embedded within a host contract are 
separated from that contract and measured at fair value unless 
either (1) the host contract is measured at fair value, in which 
case the fair value of the derivative is subsumed within the fair 
value of the entire contract, or (2) the derivative is closely related 
to the host contract, in which case the derivative is measured at 
cost. An embedded derivative is regarded as not closely related 
to its host contract when the cash flows it modifies are 
associated with risks that are not inherent in the contract itself.
Subsequent reassessment of whether an embedded derivative is 
required to be separated from the host contract is prohibited 
unless there is a change in the contract’s terms.
Leases
A finance lease is a lease that transfers substantially all the 
risks and rewards of ownership of an asset to the lessee. Assets 
acquired under finance leases are recorded in the balance sheet 
as property, plant and equipment at the lower of their fair value 
and the present value of the minimum lease payments and 
depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives and 
their lease terms. The corresponding rental obligations are 
included in borrowings as finance lease liabilities, initially at a 
value equal to the fair value of the leased asset, or if lower, at a 
value equal to the present value of the minimum lease payments. 
Interest incurred on finance leases is charged to the income 
statement on an accruals basis.
All other leases are operating leases and the rental of these is 
charged to the income statement as incurred over the life of the 
lease on a straight-line basis. Operating lease income is recognised 
in the income statement within other income as it is earned.
Provisions
Provisions are liabilities where the amount or timing of future 
expenditure is uncertain. Provisions are recognised when the 
Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, it is 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle 
the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the 
obligation. If the time value of money is material, provisions are 
discounted to their present value. If an obligation is not capable 
of being reliably estimated it is classified as a contingent liability.
Employee Benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement schemes are 
charged to the income statement as they fall due.
For defined benefit retirement schemes, the expected cost of 
providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Method, 
with valuations updated annually by qualified independent 
actuaries at each balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses 
are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, in the 
statement of comprehensive income. The asset or liability 
recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of 
the defined benefit obligation, as offset by the fair value of plan 
assets. Interest arising on the present value of the defined 
benefit obligation and the expected return on the plan’s assets is 
recognised, as a net figure, within interest in the income statement.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the 
benefits are already vested and is otherwise amortised on a 
straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits 
become vested.

FinancialXstatements_v44.indd   57 09/03/2012   19:58 Hunting PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 58 
All cumulative actuarial gains and losses at 1 January 2004 have been recognised in reserves. The expected cost of post-employment 
benefit obligations is spread evenly over the period of service of the employees.
Share-based Payments
The Group issues share-based payments (LTIP awards), which can be settled in either cash or equity, to certain employees as 
consideration for services received from the employees. A liability equal to the portion of the services received is recognised at its 
current fair value, determined at each balance sheet date. The fair value of the liability is remeasured at each subsequent reporting 
date and at the date of settlement, with any changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. The fair value is measured as the 
present value of the future cash flows.
The Group also issues equity-settled share-based payments (PSP and RSP awards) to certain employees as consideration for services 
received from the employees. The fair value of the employees’ services is recognised as an expense in the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Group’s estimate of awards that will ultimately vest. 
The fair value of employees’ services is determined by an external valuer, using the Monte Carlo model for PSP awards and the 
Black-Scholes model for the RSP awards, with reference to the grant date fair value of the options granted. The fair value includes 
market performance conditions in respect of the performance based awards and excludes the impact of any service and non-market 
performance vesting conditions.
The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each balance sheet date and at the vesting date, where the 
estimate is adjusted to reflect current expectations. The adjustment is included as part of the underlying expense recognised in the 
income statement. No adjustment is made to the fair value after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised.
Share Capital
The Company’s share capital comprises a single class of Ordinary shares, which are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds, net of tax.
Treasury Shares
Treasury shares are stated at cost and presented as a deduction from equity attributable to owners of the parent. Consideration 
received for the sale of these shares is also recognised directly in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from the sale and 
the original cost being taken directly to retained earnings.
Merger Reserve
The merger reserve comprises the proceeds received, net of transaction costs, in excess of the nominal value of the Ordinary shares 
issued by way of the share placing on 5 August 201 1. In accordance with Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006, the premium was 
credited to the merger reserve (instead of to the share premium reserve) because the share placing was pursuant to the Company 
securing over 90% of another entity to support the funding arrangement for the acquisition of Titan. The reserve is transferred to 
retained earnings when the proceeds meet the definition of qualifying consideration and are considered distributable.
Dividend Distributions
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as liabilities in the Group’s financial statements in the period in 
which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders and are dealt with in the Statement of Changes in Equity. Interim 
dividends are recognised when paid.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements and assumptions about the future, resulting in the use 
of accounting estimates. These will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results and adjustments will consequently be necessary. 
Estimates are continually evaluated, based on experience, consultation with experts and reasonable expectations of future events.

Hunting PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 59 
Accounting estimates are applied in determining the carrying amounts of the following significant assets and liabilities:
Asset/liability Nature of Estimates
Post-employment benefits The Group’s accounting policy for defined benefit pension schemes requires management to 
make judgements as to the nature of benefits provided by each scheme and thereby determine the 
classification of each scheme. For defined benefit schemes, management is required to make annual 
estimates and assumptions about future returns on classes of scheme assets, future remuneration 
changes, administration costs, changes in benefits, inflation rates, exchange rates, life expectancy and 
expected remaining periods of service of employees. The assumptions are shown in note 33. In making 
these estimates and assumptions, management considers advice provided by external advisers, such as 
actuaries. Where actual experience differs to these estimates, actuarial gains and losses are recognised 
directly in equity.
Goodwill The Group has capitalised goodwill of £316.5m at 31 December 2011 (2010 – £100.6m), as shown 
in note 16. The Group uses the present value of future cash flows to determine implied fair value. In 
calculating the implied fair value, significant management judgement is required in forecasting relevant 
cash flows considering factors such as long-term growth rates, future margins, timing and quantum of 
future replacement capital expenditure, future tax rates and the selection of discount rates to reflect the 
risks involved. If alternative management judgements were adopted then different impairment outcomes 
could result.
A goodwill impairment of £1.5m has been recognised in 2011 relating to PT SMB Industri. Management 
believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would cause the carrying 
value of any CGU to materially exceed its recoverable amount.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets include the Group’s aggregate amounts spent on the acquisition of customer 
relationships, patented and unpatented technology, trademarks and other intangibles. At 31 December 
2011, intangible assets amounted to £220.8m (2010 – £22.6m), as shown in note 17 , and represented 30% 
(2010 – 4%) of the Group’s net assets. These assets have principally arisen from the Group’s acquisitions. 
The relative size of the Group’s other intangible assets, makes the judgements regarding the initial 
recognition, useful economic lives and potential impairments significant to the Group’s financial position 
and performance. The fair value of these assets is determined by discounting estimated future net cash 
flows generated by the asset. The use of different assumptions for the expectations of future cash flows 
and the discount rate could change the valuation of the intangible assets. Management also utilises 
judgement in estimating the lives of these assets and in considering whether any indicators of impairment 
have arisen.
Provisions The main components of the provisions relate to warranties, tax indemnities and onerous contracts, as 
shown in note 32.
On the sale of Gibson Energy in 2008, accounting estimates and judgements were applied in determining 
the amount of provisions held for tax indemnities. The timing and amounts payable in respect of these 
provisions remain uncertain. 
The Group has commitments in respect of leasehold properties, some of which are not used for Group 
trading purposes and are vacant or sub-let to third parties. The provision for onerous contracts reflects 
the uncertainty of future conditions in the sub-letting market.
Share-based payments A number of assumptions are made in determining the fair value of awards at the grant date and at each 
subsequent reporting date for LTIPs, as shown in note 40. Management is required to make annual 
estimates and assumptions about the number of shares that are expected to lapse for those participants 
who cease employment during the vesting period and forfeit a proportion of their award. In making these 
estimates and assumptions, management considers advice provided by external advisers.
Deferred tax Deferred tax balances are derived from assumptions, which include the future utilisation of trading losses 
and provisions at assumed tax rates.
Discontinued operations The Group is currently in active negotiations to sell the Field Aviation business. The Directors took 
the view in preparing the 2011 Half Year Report that the business was available for sale in its current 
condition and that a sale would occur within twelve months of 30 June 2011. The Directors remain of 
this opinion at 31 December 2011.

1. Segmental Reporting
The Group reports on eight operating segments, three of which are discontinued operations, in its internal management reports, 
which are used to make strategic decisions. The Group’s segments are strategic business units that offer different products and 
services to international oil and gas companies and the aviation and shipping sectors. 
The discontinued operations comprise Field Aviation, which was classified as held for sale on 30 June 201 1, Gibson Energy, which 
was sold in 2008, and Hunting Energy France, which was sold in 2009. Gibson Energy and Hunting Energy France continue to 
generate accounting entries due to sale related transactions and are required for reconciliation purposes.
The Well Construction segment provides products and services used by customers for the drilling phase of oil and gas wells, along 
with associated equipment used by the underground construction industry for telecommunication infrastructure build-out and 
precision machining services for the energy, aviation and power generation sectors.
The Well Completion segment provides products and services used by customers for the completion phase of oil and gas wells.
The Well Intervention segment provides products and services used by customers for the production, maintenance and restoration 
of existing oil and gas wells.
The Exploration and Production segment includes the Group’s oil and gas exploration and production activities in the Southern US 
and offshore Gulf of Mexico.
Gibson Shipbrokers is a global energy shipping broker headquartered in London. Crude oil, fuel oil and bio fuels are actively shipped 
along with dry bulk such as coal, iron ore and grain. Gibson Shipbrokers is also involved in the shipping of liquefied petroleum gas 
(“LPG”), petrochemicals and liquefied natural gas (“LNG”).
Field Aviation is an aircraft service organisation providing modification, installation, distribution, maintenance and manufacturing 
services for regional, business and government operators worldwide. Field Aviation has been presented as a discontinued operation 
and its results have been restated to exclude central costs previously allocated to the division. All central costs have been allocated to 
continuing operations.
The following tables present the results of the operating segments on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes to 
the Chief Operating Decision Maker. 
The Group measures the performance of its operating segments based on revenue and profit from operations, before any 
exceptional items and the amortisation of intangible assets. Accounting policies used for segment reporting reflect those used for 
the Group. Inter-segment sales are priced on an arm’s length basis. Costs and overheads incurred centrally are apportioned to the 
continuing operating segments on the basis of time attributed to those operations by senior executives.

The impairment charge of £1.0m (2010 – £5.3m) relates to the write down of oil and gas development expenditure, largely due a fall 
in forecast natural gas prices during the year. The recoverable amount of oil and gas development expenditure is based on value in 
use. These calculations use discounted pre-tax cash flow projections based on estimated oil and gas reserves, future production and 
income attributable to such reserves. Cash flows are based on reserve production lives varying from one to fifteen years. Cash flows 
are discounted using a pre-tax rate of 10% (2010 – 10%). The prices of oil and natural gas are derived from published futures prices, 
with the long-term average oil price assumed to be US$96.10 bbl. (2010 – US$90.97 bbl.) and the long-term average gas price at 
US$4.07 mcf (per 1,000 cubic feet). A decline in the long-term average gas price from US$5.10 mcf in 2010, together with a review 
of oil and gas reserves, resulted in an impairment impact of £1.0m in the year.
Under IFRS, at acquisition, inventory values are adjusted from their carrying values (generally at cost of production) to a fair value, 
which includes profit attributable to the degree of completion of the inventory. This resulted in a fair value uplift totalling £23.6m for 
the four acquisitions. This uplift is charged to the income statement as the inventory is sold, thereby reducing reported operating 
profits. In 201 1, the charge was £12.9m.
A £1.6m charge for bonuses for key employee retention, relating to the acquisitions, has been recognised.
Following a downturn of business activity levels in 201 1, a goodwill impairment charge of £1.5m (2010 – £nil) has been recognised 
in relation to PT SMB Industri.
Following a reassessment of its property provisions, the Group has recognised an additional provision of £2.2m for onerous lease 
obligations as a result of additional remediation and dilapidation costs and the impact of the economic downturn on the 
recoverability of rental income.
Unamortised loan facility fees of £1.0m (2010 – £nil) were written off to the income statement when the £120.0m revolving credit 
facility was terminated early and replaced with the £375.0m revolving credit facility, following the acquisition of Titan.

The weighted average applicable tax rate for continuing operations before amortisation and exceptional items is 28% (2010 – 30%). 
The lower rate in 201 1 is mainly due to the weighting of profits in lower tax jurisdictions and a reduced UK corporate tax rate.

A number of changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the March 201 1 Budget Statement, whereby from 1 April 
201 1 the main rate of corporation tax has been reduced to 26%. The impact of this change has been recognised in the year ended 
31 December 201 1. Further reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate by 1% per annum to 23% by 1 April 2014. 
The changes are not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s deferred tax balances.

12. Discontinued Operations
The Group continues to classify Field Aviation as held for sale, as sale negotiations are at an advanced stage such that it is highly 
probable that the company will be sold within twelve months of the initial classification of held for sale on 30 June 201 1. Field 
Aviation is considered to be a major operation of Hunting and as such the results have been presented as a discontinued operation.
The sale of Gibson Energy Inc., Hunting’s midstream services operation, was completed on 12 December 2008. On 22 December 
2009, the Group sold Hunting Energy France SA, its French-based business.

Additional provisions, together with foreign exchange gains, of £3.3m have been recognised on the Canadian dollar denominated tax 
indemnities given in respect of our former Canadian business, Gibson Energy. 
On 15 June 201 1, Gibson Energy Inc. redeemed in full the equity warrant issued to Hunting on 12 December 2008. On completion 
of the sale of Gibson Energy, Hunting agreed to defer payment of C$100.0m of the consideration in return for receipt of the warrant. 
Between 12 December 2008 and 12 December 2010, the warrant carried a cumulative and compounding annual dividend 
entitlement at a rate of 12%. Following the announcement to extend the maturity date of the warrant on 10 December 2010, the rate 
of dividend entitlement on the warrant increased to 13% from 13 December 2010. The total amount paid to Hunting was C$134.6m 
(£85.3m), which comprises the warrant value of C$100.0m (£63.4m) and the accrued dividend entitlement of C$34.6m (£21.9m). 
The pre-tax profit on redemption of the warrant is £58.3m. The tax charge of £5.1m relates to tax arising on the profit on redemption 
of the warrant. 
Foreign exchange gains of £0.1m have been recognised in respect of the Euro denominated bond received on the disposal of 
Hunting Energy France in 2009. The bond was repaid in full on 28 June 201 1.
13. Results for the Financial Year
In accordance with the exemption allowed by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own 
statement of comprehensive income. A loss of £4.1m (2010 – £44.3m profit) has been accounted for in the financial statements of 
the Company.

14. Earnings per Share 
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to Ordinary shareholders by the weighted average 
number of Ordinary shares outstanding during the year. 
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of outstanding Ordinary shares is adjusted to assume conversion of all 
dilutive potential Ordinary shares. The dilution in respect of share options applies where the exercise price is less than the average 
market price of the Company’s Ordinary shares during the year and the possible issue of shares under the Group’s long-term 
incentive plans.

* Included in the charge for the year is £0.2m for discontinued operations.
The impairment charge of £1.0m (2010 – £5.3m) relates to the write down of oil and gas development expenditure, largely due a fall 
in forecast natural gas prices during the year. The recoverable amount of oil and gas development expenditure is based on value in 
use. These calculations use discounted pre-tax cash flow projections based on estimated oil and gas reserves, future production and 
income attributable to such reserves. Cash flows are based on reserve production lives varying from one to fifteen years. Cash flows 
are discounted using a pre-tax rate of 10% (2010 – 10%). The prices of oil and natural gas are derived from published futures prices, 
with the long-term average oil price assumed to be US$96.10 bbl. (2010 – US$90.97 bbl.) and the long-term average gas price at 
US$4.07 mcf (per 1,000 cubic feet). A decline in the long-term average gas price from US$5.10 mcf in 2010, together with a review 
of oil and gas reserves, resulted in an impairment impact of £1.0m in the year.
Oil and gas exploration and development includes expenditure on the exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources, which 
is recognised at cost and is not depreciated. The amount recognised in cost at 31 December 201 1 is £0.1m (2010 – £nil), including 
additions during the year of £0.1m (2010 – £3.1m) and an impairment loss of £nil (2010 – £3.1m).
Plant, machinery and motor vehicles include £nil (2010 – £nil) being the net book amount of the capital element of assets held under 
finance leases after accumulated depreciation of £nil (2010 – £0.1m).
Included in the net book amount is expenditure relating to assets in the course of construction of £6.4m (2010 – £6.3m) for freehold 
land and buildings, £2.6m (2010 – £2.8m) for oil and gas exploration and development, £4.2m (2010 – £0.9m) for plant and 
machinery and £nil (2010 – £0.3m) for short leasehold buildings.

The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations. These calculations use discounted pre-tax cash 
flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a two year period and are based on past experience 
and order books. Cash flows beyond the two year period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates between 3% and 5%, which 
decline over time. The growth rate reflects the products, industries and countries in which the relevant CGU operates and will 
incorporate, where relevant, projected rig counts and the expected profile of drilling.
Cash flows are discounted using pre-tax rates between 8.6% and 14.5% (2010 – 8.9% and 12.3%), as shown in the above table. 
The discount rate best reflects the risks associated with the cash flows and the likely external rate of borrowing of the CGU. 
Consideration has also been given to other factors such as currency risk, operational risk and country risk.
Impairment of goodwill
Following a downturn of business activity levels in 201 1, a goodwill impairment charge of £1.5m (2010 – £nil) has been recognised 
in relation to PT SMB Industri.
Sensitivities
Having performed a sensitivity analysis, management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions 
would cause the carrying value of any CGU to materially exceed its recoverable amount.

On 15 June 201 1, Gibson Energy Inc. redeemed in full the equity warrant issued to Hunting on 12 December 2008. On completion 
of the sale of Gibson Energy, Hunting agreed to defer payment of C$100.0m of the consideration in return for receipt of the warrant. 
Between 12 December 2008 and 12 December 2010, the warrant carried a cumulative and compounding annual dividend 
entitlement at a rate of 12%. Following the announcement to extend the maturity date of the warrant on 10 December 2010, the rate 
of dividend entitlement on the warrant increased to 13% from 13 December 2010. The total amount paid to Hunting was C$134.6m 
(£85.3m), which comprises the warrant value of C$100.0m (£63.4m) and the accrued dividend entitlement of C$34.6m (£21.9m). 
The pre-tax profit on redemption of the warrant is £58.3m. The tax charge of £5.1m relates to tax arising on the profit on redemption 
of the warrant. 
The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 201 1 is the fair value of the financial assets of £0.2m (2010 – £45.1m),

Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost, which is the fair value of the consideration paid, less impairment.
The impairment charge of £0.6m (2010 – £nil) relates to a non-trading subsidiary that has incurred losses and which the Directors do 
not expect to be recovered in the foreseeable future. The investment has therefore been written down to the subsidiary’s net asset 
value, being the Directors’ estimate of the recoverable amount.

Trade receivables that are not overdue and not impaired are expected to be fully recovered as there is no recent history of default 
or any indications that the customers will not meet their payment obligations. At the year-end there are no trade receivables (2010 – 
none) whose terms have been renegotiated and would otherwise be past due or impaired.
At 31 December 201 1, trade receivables of £52.0m (2010 – £28.5m) were past due but not impaired. The ageing of these receivables 
at the year-end is as follows:

Receivables that are overdue but not impaired relate to customers for whom there is no recent history of default.
Impaired receivables mainly relate to debtors in financial difficulty where defaults in payments have occurred or concerns have been 
raised about the customer’s liquidity. Trade receivables are impaired when there is evidence that the Group will not be able to 
collect all amounts due according to the original terms of sale.

The Group does not hold any collateral as security and no assets have been acquired through the exercise of any collateral 
previously held.

26. Assets Held for Sale
Group
The assets and liabilities of Field Aviation continue to be presented as held for sale, as sale negotiations are at an advanced stage, 
such that it is highly probable that the company will be sold within twelve months of the initial classification of held for sale on
30 June 201 1. Field Aviation’s assets and liabilities are a disposal group and the business is considered to be a discontinued 
operation, as it represents a major line of business. The disposal of this business will enable Hunting to focus on its core operations. 
Field Aviation’s assets and liabilities are carried at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell at the date of held-for-
sale classification. The carrying values of Field Aviation’s assets and liabilities at 31 December 201 1 are:

30. Derivatives and Financial Instruments
Currency derivatives
The Group has used spot and forward foreign exchange contracts and average rate options to hedge its exposure to exchange rate 
movements during the year. 
At 31 December 201 1, the total notional amount of the Group’s outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts is £15.9m  
(2010 – £12.1m).
Gains and losses on contracts that are not designated in a hedge relationship are taken directly to the income statement. Changes in 
the fair value of currency derivatives not designated in a hedge relationship amounting to a £0.1m loss (2010 – £0.2m loss) have been 
recognised in the income statement during the year for continuing operations.
Certain highly probable forecast transactions have been designated in a cash flow hedge relationship and hedged using forward 
foreign exchange contracts. These forecast transactions are expected to occur at various dates during the next 18 months. Gains and 
losses recognised in the hedging reserve on forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 December 201 1 will be recognised in the 
income statement in the period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects the income statement. 
Gains of £5.4m (2010 – £0.6m gain) were recognised in the hedging reserve (note 35) during the year. Gains of £6.3m (2010 – £0.1m 
gains) were removed from equity during the year, with £0.8m gains (2010 – £0.1m gains) included in revenue in the income statement 
and gains of £5.5m (2010 – £nil) recognised as part of goodwill on acquisition of Titan (note 41). Ineffectiveness of £nil (2010 – £nil) 
arose on the cash flow hedges during the year.

The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined by the deviation in future expected cash flows calculated by 
reference to the movement in market quoted exchange rates. The carrying values of available for sale unlisted investments are based 
on the Directors’ best estimate of fair value as there is no active market in which these are traded. The fair values of non-sterling 
denominated financial instruments are translated into sterling using the year end exchange rate.

30. Derivatives and Financial Instruments continued
Hedge of Net Investments in Foreign Operations
The Group has US dollar denominated borrowings, which it has designated as a hedge of the net investment in its US subsidiaries. 
At 31 December 201 1, the carrying amount of US dollar borrowings was £244.1m.
At 31 December 201 1, foreign exchange losses of £4.7m (2010 – £nil) on translation of the borrowings into sterling has been 
recognised in the cumulative translation reserve.
31. Financial Risk Factors 
The Group’s activities expose it to certain financial risks, namely market risk (including currency risk, fair value interest risk and cash 
flow interest risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s risk management strategy seeks to mitigate potential adverse effects on its 
financial performance. As part of its strategy, both primary and derivative financial instruments are used to hedge its risk exposures.
There are clearly defined objectives and principles for managing financial risk established by the Board of Directors, with policies, 
parameters and procedures covering the specific areas of funding, banking relationships, foreign currency and interest rate 
exposures, cash management and the investment of surplus cash. 
The Group’s treasury function is responsible for implementing the policies and providing a centralised service to the Group for 
funding, the investment of surplus cash, foreign exchange, interest rate management and counterparty risk management. It is also 
responsible for identifying, evaluating and hedging financial risks in close co-operation with the Group’s operating companies.
(a) Foreign exchange risk
The Group’s international base is exposed to foreign exchange risk from its investing, financing and operating activities, particularly 
in respect of US dollars. Foreign exchange risks arise from future transactions and cash flows and from recognised monetary assets 
and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the Group’s local operations.
The Group’s material foreign exchange rates are:
US dollar Canadian dollar
2011 2010 2011 2010
Average exchange rate to sterling 1.60 1.55 1.59 1.59
Year-end exchange rate to sterling 1.55 1.57 1.58 1.56
(i) Transactional risk
The exposure to exchange rate movements in significant future transactions and cash flows is hedged by using forward foreign exchange 
contracts and currency options. Certain forward foreign exchange contracts have been designated as hedging instruments of highly 
probable forecast transactions. Operating companies prepare quarterly rolling twelve month cash flow forecasts to enable working 
capital currency exposures to be identified. Currency exposures arise where the cash flows are not in the functional currency of the 
entity. Exposures arising from committed long-term projects beyond a twelve month period are also identified. The currency flows to be 
hedged are committed foreign currency transactions greater than £250,000 equivalent per month and/or currency flows that in 
aggregate exceed £500,000 equivalent per annum.
No speculative positions are entered into by the Group.
The table below shows the carrying values of the Group’s financial instruments at 31 December, including derivative financial 
instruments, on which exchange differences would potentially be recognised in the income statement in the following year. The 
table excludes available for sale financial assets, derivatives designated in a cash flow hedge, borrowings designated in a hedge of 
the net investment in its US subsidiaries and loans to subsidiaries that are considered to be part of the net investment in a foreign 
operation, as exchange differences arising on these are recognised in other comprehensive income.

The US dollar denominated financial instruments consists mainly of cash and cash equivalents and receivables and the Canadian 
dollar denominated financial instruments consists mainly of warranty provisions and inter-group loans.
(ii) Translational risk
Foreign exchange risk also arises from the Group’s investments in foreign operations. Average rate options are used to reduce 
translation risk on the Group’s consolidated profit before tax by hedging the translation of approximately 50% of budgeted US dollar 
earnings into sterling. These derivatives are not designated as a hedge.
The foreign exposure to net investments in foreign operations is managed using borrowings denominated in the same functional 
currency as that of the hedged assets. The borrowings are designated as a hedge of the net investment in foreign operations. The 
foreign exchange exposure primarily arises from US dollar denominated net investments. 
(b) Interest rate risk
Variable interest rates on cash at bank, deposits, overdrafts and borrowings expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk and fixed 
interest rates on loans and deposits expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. The treasury function manages the Group’s 
exposure to interest rate risk and has used interest rate swaps and caps, when considered appropriate.
During the year, the Group needed to ensure that sufficient liquid funds were available to support its working capital and capital 
expenditure requirements and to fund acquisitions. Surplus cash was, therefore, invested by the treasury function in AAA rated, 
instant access Money Market Funds and in fixed-rate bank deposits, with terms of between overnight and three months. As the funds 
were invested for short periods of time, the interest yield on these was relatively low. However, the preservation of the Group’s net 
cash took priority over earning high interest yields.
(c) Credit risk
The Group’s credit risk arises from its available for sale financial assets, pension assets, cash and cash equivalents, investments, 
derivative financial instruments and outstanding receivables.
At the year end, the Group had credit risk exposures to a wide range of counterparties. Credit risk exposure is continually monitored 
and no individual exposure is considered to be significant in the context of the ordinary course of the Group’s activities. 
Surplus cash is only invested with financial institutions approved by the Board. The process of investing excess cash is conducted 
and monitored by the Group’s treasury function.
Exposure limits are set for each approved counterparty, as well as the types of transactions that may be entered into. Approved 
institutions that the treasury function can invest surplus cash with all must have a minimum of an A1, P1 or F1 short-term rating from 
Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s or Fitch rating agencies and AAA rating for Money Market Funds. 
The majority of cash and cash equivalents, which total £68.8m (2010 – £268.7m) at the year end, and investments of £2.4m (2010 
– £2.5m) have been deposited with banks with Fitch short-term ratings of F1 to F1+. All cash and cash equivalents and investments 
are expected to be fully recovered.
The credit risk of foreign exchange contracts is calculated before the contract is acquired and compared to the credit risk limit set for 
each counterparty. Credit risk is calculated as a fixed percentage of the nominal value of the instrument. 
Trade and other receivables are continuously monitored. Credit account limits are primarily based on the credit quality of the 
customer and past experience through trading relationships. To reduce credit risk exposure from outstanding receivables, the Group 
has taken out credit insurance with an external insurer, subject to certain conditions.

31. Financial Risk Factors continued
The Company operates a pension scheme, which includes a defined benefit section with pension plan assets of £4.8m (2010 – 
£5.5m). The majority of the Scheme’s defined benefits are now covered by insurance company annuity policies, meaning the 
pensions-related risks have largely been eliminated. The pension buy-in has been affected by using three insurers, so as to spread 
its credit risk. The credit rating of these insurers is monitored.
(d) Liquidity risk
The Group needs to ensure that it has sufficient liquid funds available to support its working capital and capital expenditure 
requirements and to fund acquisitions. All subsidiaries submit weekly and bi-monthly treasury reports to the treasury function to 
enable them to monitor the Group’s requirements.
The Group has sufficient credit facilities to meet both its long and short-term requirements.
A new bank facility agreement was signed on 5 August 201 1. The five-year, multi-currency revolving credit facility of £375.0m 
replaced Hunting’s existing £120.0m facility on completion of the acquisition of Titan on 16 September 201 1.
The Group’s credit facilities are provided by a variety of funding sources and total £423.6m (2010 – £153.9m) at the year end. The 
facilities comprise £375.0m (2010 – £120.0m) of committed facilities and £48.6m (2010 – £33.9m) of uncommitted facilities. Of the 
uncommitted facilities, £0.4m is secured on the machinery that the loan was used to purchase and £48.2m is unsecured. The 
£375.0m committed facility is unsecured. 
The committed facilities comprise the £375.0m multi-currency loan facility from a syndicate of ten banks. This facility expires on 
5 August 2016. A commitment fee is payable on the undrawn amount.
The Group’s treasury function maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining availability under committed credit facilities. The Group 
has the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities available at the year-end:

(e) Sensitivity analysis 
The following sensitivity analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables on the Group’s and Company’s 
financial instruments and show the impact on profit or loss and shareholders’ equity. Financial instruments affected by market risk 
include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments. The sensitivity analysis relates to the position as at 31 December 201 1.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the 
cash and derivatives and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies remain unchanged from the hedge 
designations in place at 31 December 201 1.
The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of pension and other post-retirement 
obligations, provisions (but including onerous leases) and on the non-financial assets and liabilities of foreign operations.
The following assumptions have been made in calculating the sensitivity analysis:
•	 Foreign exchange rate and interest rate sensitivities have an asymmetric impact on the Group’s results, that is, an increase in rates 
does not result in the same amount of movement as a decrease in rates.
•	 The carrying values of financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost do not change as interest rates change.

32. Provisions continued
The Group has commitments in respect of leasehold properties, some of which are not used for Group trading purposes and are 
vacant or sub-let to third parties. The provision for onerous contracts reflects the uncertainty of future conditions in the sub-letting 
market. It is expected that £2.5m of the provision will be utilised in 2012, £2.9m in 2013 and the remaining balance of £12.4m 
utilised from 2014 to 2023. Provision is made on a discounted basis, at a risk-free rate of between 0.33% and 2.12% pa, for the net 
rental deficit on these properties to the end of the lease term.
Asset decommissioning and remediation obligations relate to the Group’s obligation to dismantle, remove and restore items of 
property, plant and equipment. The provision reflects uncertainty in the timing and amounts of the costs expected to arise in 
meeting this obligation. Provision is made on a discounted basis, at a risk-free rate of 6%. The provision is expected to be utilised 
over a period of one to fifteen years.
Following the disposal of Gibson Energy in 2008, the Group recognised a provision for tax indemnities. These provisions are 
expected to be utilised in 2012.
33. Post-Employment Benefits
Pensions
Within the UK, the Group operates a funded pension scheme, which includes a defined benefit section with benefits linked to 
final salary and a defined contribution section with benefits dependant on future investment returns. With effect from 31 December 
2002, the defined benefit section was closed to new UK employees who are offered membership of the defined contribution 
section. The majority of UK employees are members of one of these arrangements.
The majority of the Scheme’s defined benefits are now covered by insurance policies, meaning that pensions-related risks 
have largely been eliminated. This is demonstrated by the stability of the pension asset from year to year. However, the obligation 
ultimately rests with the Group. During the year, the Trustees paid additional funds into the existing insurance policies to secure 
further benefits for members.
A valuation of the defined benefit section of the Scheme was produced and updated to 31 December 201 1 by independent 
qualified actuaries.
The present value of the defined benefit has been calculated on the basis that benefits continue to be linked to the RPI measure 
of inflation. 
The main assumptions used for IAS 19 purposes at 31 December were:
2011 2010
Annual rates
Rate of increase in salaries 5.2% 5.6%
Rate of increase in pensions 3.2% 3.6%
Discount rate 4.7% 5.4%
Inflation (RPI) 3.2% 3.6%
The post-employment mortality assumptions allow for future improvements in mortality. The mortality table implies that a 65 year old 
male currently has an expected future lifetime of 24.3 years (2010 – 24.1 years) and an expected future lifetime of 27 .4 years (2010 – 27 .3 
years) for a male reaching 65 in 20 years’ time. The mortality table implies that a 65 year old female currently has an expected future 
lifetime of 25.8 years (2010 – 25.7 years) and an expected future lifetime of 27 .7 years (2010 – 27 .6 years) for a female reaching 65 in 20 
years’ time. Based upon past experience, pension increases have been assumed to be in line with RPI inflation.
Long-term rates of return expected at 31 December:
2011 2010
Annual rates
Insurance annuity policies 4.7% 5.4%
Bonds n/a 4.2%
Cash 0.6% n/a
The expected rate of return on pension plan assets is determined as management’s best estimate of the long-term return on the major 
asset classes – insurance annuity policies, bonds and cash – weighted by the actual allocation of assets at the measurement date. The 
expected rate of return on the insurance policies has been set equal to the discount rate.

Other Information
The defined contribution section of the Scheme held assets, equal to its liabilities, of £6.6m as at 31 December 201 1 (2010 – £5.1m).
Scheme Assets
The proportions of the total assets in the defined benefit section of the Scheme for each asset class and the contributions made were:
2011 2010
Insurance annuity policies 98% 95%
Bonds 0% 5%
Cash 2% 0%
100% 100%
Employer contributions made during year (£m) 3.2 1.9
During the year to 31 December 201 1, contributions by the Group of £1.1m (2010 – £1.0m) were also made to the UK defined 
contribution section of the Scheme. For 2012, the Group will pay estimated contributions of £4.3m to the defined benefit section of 
the Scheme. Contributions to the defined contribution section of the Scheme are in addition.

For 201 1, the actual return on the plan’s assets amounted to a gain of £21.0m (2010 – £9.9m). The gain of £9.3m (2010 – £2.3m loss) 
principally arising as a result of the increase of the value placed on the insurance annuity policies is offset by a corresponding 
increase in the value placed on the corresponding liabilities. This is the principal component of the actuarial losses on the defined 
benefit obligations stated above.

Total equity 732.0 594.6
Net debt (cash) 218.4 (212.2) 
Capital employed 950.4 382.4
Gearing 30% n/a
Capital employed is managed with the aim of maintaining an appropriate level of financing available for the Group’s activities. The 
balance of debt and equity, as reflected in the gearing ratio, which is net debt expressed as a percentage of total equity, is managed 
having due regard to the respective cost of funds and their availability.
The Group’s net debt is monitored on a daily basis and is managed by the control of working capital, dividend and capital 
expenditure payments and the purchase and disposal of assets and businesses. The level of net debt and related gearing ratio of 30% 
at 31 December 201 1 is considered comfortable, with adequate headroom remaining, giving management ongoing flexibility.
For debt funding, the Group ensures that banking and other borrowing covenants are complied with, and that appropriate forecast 
headroom exists, to ensure that borrowing facilities remain in place. Our bank facility covenants require EBITDA to cover relevant 
finance charges by a minimum of 4 times and net debt to adjusted EBITDA has a maximum of 3.5 times. The covenants are 
monitored on a monthly basis and all external covenant requirements were met during the year. Both key bank covenant metrics 
at year end were well covered.
Return on average capital employed is a KPI management uses to assess business unit performance. The Group return on 
capital employed has fallen from 16% during 2010 to 15% in 201 1 primarily due to the higher level of capital employed following the 
acquisition programme.
Changes in equity arise from the retention of earnings and, from time to time, issues of share capital. The Board considers each 
ordinary dividend proposed based on the merits of the information available to it at the time. Consideration is given to the financial 
projections of business performance and capital investment needs, together with feedback from shareholder discussions.
The Group operates a centralised treasury function with policies and procedures approved by the Board. These cover funding, 
banking relationships, foreign currency, interest rate exposures, cash management and the investment of surplus cash. Further detail 
on financial risks is provided within note 31.
The Group has significant foreign operations and hence results originate in a number of currencies, particularly in US dollars. As a 
result, the Group’s financial statements, which are reported in sterling, are subject to the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
with respect to currency conversions. Currency options are used to reduce currency risk movements on the Group’s results, by 
hedging approximately 50% of each year’s budgeted US dollar earnings into sterling. Currency exposure on the balance sheet is, 
where practical, reduced by financing assets with borrowings in the same currency. Spot and forward foreign exchange contracts are 
used to cover the net exposure of purchases and sales in non-domestic currencies.

dividend is subject to approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 18 April 2012 and has not been 
provided for in these financial statements.
40. Share-based Payments
Executive Share Options
The Company operates an executive share option scheme, which granted options to eligible employees. Vesting of options granted 
was subject to the achievement of performance targets, as described in the Remuneration Committee Report, over a three year 
period. Thereafter the employee, subject to continued employment, has seven years in which to exercise the option. Under this 
scheme, the final vesting of options occurred on 4 March 201 1.
Options were valued using an option pricing model based on the binomial model, but adjusted to model the particular features 
of the options. The assumptions used in calculating the charge to the income statement, which only relates to options granted after 
November 2002 as permitted by IFRS 2, are as follows:
Date of grant 04.03.2008 06.03.2007
Exercise price (p) 784.5 640.0
Share price at grant (p) 784.5 640.0
Expected volatility (% pa) 32 36
Dividend yield (% pa) 1.1 1.17
Risk-free interest rate (% pa) 4.3 4.9
Turnover rates (% pa) 5 5
Fair value at grant (p) 294.9 248.4
Assumed likelihood of satisfying performance condition at:
31 December 2010 75% 100%
31 December 2011 100% 100%
The assumption for early exercise is 50% when options were 20% in the money.
The expected volatility is calculated as the historic volatility of the Hunting PLC share return over the five years prior to each grant date.
The charge to the income statement attributable to Executive Share Options is £0.2m (2010 – £0.6m) and is recognised as part of 
operating expenses.

Performance Share Plan (“PSP”)
The Company continues to operate and grant share awards and options under its performance share plan. Under the PSP , annual 
conditional awards of shares and options may be made to executive Directors and senior employees. Awards and options are subject to 
performance conditions and continued employment during the vesting period. The PSP is a share award scheme and as such there is no 
exercise price.
The PSP awards made in the year will vest subject to total shareholder return (“TSR”) performance over a three year period from date 
of grant, relative to comparator companies from the Dow Jones US Oil Equipment and Services sector index and the DJ STOXX TM 
Oil Equipment and Services sector index.
Details of the PSP awards and options movements during the year are set out below:

The fair value of the PSP awards and options granted in 201 1 was calculated using the Stochastic pricing model (also known as the 
“Monte Carlo” model), which incorporates the effect of the TSR performance condition.

The assumptions used in the model were as follows:
2011 2010
Assumptions:
Weighted average share price at grant 774.5p 587.5p
Expected volatility – Hunting PLC 50.7% 44.4%
Expected volatility – Comparator group 71.4% 58.3%
Risk free rate 1.9% 1.8%
Expected life 3 years 3 years
Fair value 525.89p 401.64p
The expected volatility was calculated using historic weekly volatility over three years prior to grant, equal in length to the 
performance period at the date of grant. The expected volatilities of each constituent of the comparator group are calculated on 
the same basis and input into the model individually and the average of these figures is shown in the table above.
The expected life of the award has been calculated as three years, commensurate with the vesting period. The risk free rate is based 
on the UK gilt rate commensurate with the vesting period prevailing at the date of grant.
Participants are entitled to a dividend equivalent over the number of shares that make up their award. It is accumulated over the 
vesting period and released subject to the achievement of the performance condition. This is factored into the fair value calculation 
and as a result the dividend yield assumption is set to zero.
The initial accounting charge of the PSP incorporates an estimate of the number of shares that are expected to lapse for those 
participants who cease employment during the vesting period. The estimate of the expected forfeiture rate is 2.5% per annum. The 
subsequent accounting charge for 201 1 includes an adjustment to the initial accounting charge to allow for actual lapses rather than 
estimated lapses.
The charge to the income statement attributable to the PSP is £0.8m (2010 – £0.4m), which is recognised in operating expenses.
Restricted Share Plan (“RSP”)
The Company continues to operate and grant share awards and options under its restricted share plan. Under the RSP , annual 
conditional awards of shares and options may be made to employees subject to continued employment during the vesting period. 
There are no performance conditions attached to these awards and options. The RSP is a share award scheme and as such there is 
no exercise price.
Details of the RSP awards and options movements during the year are set out below:

40. Share-based Payments continued
The fair value of the RSP award granted in 201 1 was calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The assumptions used in the 
model were as follows:
2011 2010
Assumptions:
Weighted average share price at grant 774.5p 587.5p
Expected volatility 50.7% 44.4%
Risk free rate 1.9% 1.8%
Expected life 3 years 3 years
Fair value 774.5p 587.5p
The expected volatility was calculated using historic weekly volatility over three years to grant, equal in length to the remaining 
portion of the performance period at the date of grant.
The expected life of the award has been calculated as three years, commensurate with the vesting period. The risk free rate is based 
on the UK gilt rate commensurate with the vesting period prevailing at the date of grant.
Participants are entitled to a dividend equivalent over the number of shares which make up their award. It is accumulated over the 
vesting period and released subject to the employee remaining in employment. This is factored into the fair value calculation and as 
a result the dividend yield assumption is set to zero.
The initial accounting charge of the RSP incorporates an estimate of the number of shares that are expected to lapse for those 
participants who cease employment during the vesting period. The estimate of the expected forfeiture rate is 2.5% per annum. The 
subsequent accounting charge for 201 1 includes an adjustment to the initial accounting charge to allow for actual lapses rather than 
estimated lapses.
The charge to the income statement attributable to the RSP is £1.2m (2010 – £0.6m), which is recognised in operating expenses.
Long-term Incentive Plan
The Group operates a Long-term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) for key executives. LTIP awards may be settled in shares or cash. Details of 
awards made under this plan are contained within the Remuneration Committee Report on page 41.
The fair value charge to the income statement attributable to the LTIP is £4.7m (2010 – £0.5m). 
The liability in relation to the LTIP at the year-end is £4.9m (2010 – £0.5m).

Titan
The Group acquired 100% of the share capital of TSI Acquisition Holdings LLC and its subsidiaries (“Titan”), for a consideration of 
£508.6m (US$81 1.9m) on 16 September 201 1. Titan is a leading provider of perforating gun systems, shaped charges, well logging 
instrumentation, perforating gun switches and other engineered hardware used throughout the drilling, completion and maintenance 
of a well. This business has been classified as part of the Well Completion segment.

specified in the agreement.
Goodwill on the acquisition of Titan represents the value of the assembled workforce at the time of acquisition, market share in 
perforating products, specific knowledge and technical skills that will enhance Hunting’s products and services and the prospective 
future economic benefits expected to accrue from the portfolio of products and services to the Group’s customers and increased 
exposure to high growth unconventional resource plays. The provisional amount of goodwill that is expected to be deductible for 
tax purposes is £180.7m.

contractual amount for trade receivables due is £26.7m, of which £0.6m is expected to be uncollectable.
The pre-acquisition carrying value of inventories was £53.6m and the fair value at acquisition was £73.8m. The uplift to inventories is 
charged to the income statement as the acquired inventories are sold. During 201 1, £10.3m was charged to the income statement as 
an exceptional item. The remaining uplift to inventories of £9.9m is expected to be charged to the income statement during 2012.
The fair values of the net assets acquired are provisional as work is continuing in respect of the fair value exercise.

Doffing
The Group acquired the business and assets of W L Doffing, L.P . (“Doffing”), for a consideration of £14.2m (US$23.0m) on 2 
September 201 1. Doffing is a company that provides high precision machining services to the energy industry. Doffing is a supplier 
of precision machined components to the global energy services industry focusing on equipment used for measurement-while 
drilling (“MWD”) and logging-while-drilling (“LWD”). The business provides critical tolerance machining, prototyping and first-pass 
specialist production services. The business also holds intellectual property for manufacturing other key components used in the oil 
and gas well bore. This business has been classified as part of the Well Construction segment.

Goodwill 5.7
Consideration 14.2
Consideration comprised £12.9m cash paid, £0.2m to be paid in 2012 for working capital adjustments and £1.1m 
contingent consideration.
The contingent consideration arrangement requires the Group to pay in cash the former owners of Doffing up to US$2.0m if 
agreed EBITDA targets are reached for the two years from 2 September 201 1. If the EBITDA target is not achieved, then no further 
consideration is due. The potential undiscounted amount of all future payments that the Group could be required to make under this 
arrangement is between US$nil and US$2.0m. The fair value of the contingent consideration arrangement of US$1.8m was estimated 
by applying the income approach and an appropriate discount rate.
Goodwill on the acquisition of Doffing represents the value of the assembled workforce at the time of acquisition, its machining 
expertise and technical skills that fit with Hunting’s existing manufacturing capabilities and complements Hunting’s technology 
offering to its customers. The ability to deliver products with exacting machining requirements and the ability to complete a 
machining job on a first-pass will enable Hunting to participate in increasingly complex well designs, with future economic benefits 
expected to accrue from opportunities to supply other products and services from Hunting’s portfolio. The provisional amount of 
goodwill that is expected to be deductible for tax purposes is £5.7m.

The pre-acquisition carrying value of inventories was £1.0m and the fair value at acquisition was £1.3m. The uplift to inventories is 
charged to the income statement as the acquired inventories are sold. During 201 1, £0.3m was charged to the income statement as 
an exceptional item.
The fair values of the net assets acquired are provisional as work is continuing in respect of the fair value exercise.
Acquisition related costs of £0.3m have been included in operating expenses in the income statement for the year ended 31 December 
201 1 (note 5).

Goodwill 10.5
Consideration 24.5
Consideration comprised £21.5m cash and £3.0m contingent consideration.
The contingent consideration entitles the former owners of Specialty additional consideration of up to US$5.0m if EBITDA targets are 
achieved in the two years ended 28 October 2013. If the EBITDA target is not reached, then no further payment is to be made. The 
potential undiscounted amount of all future payments that the Group could be required to make under this arrangement is between 
US$nil and US$5.0m. The fair value of the contingent consideration arrangement of US$4.8m was estimated by applying the income 
approach and appropriate discount rates. 
Goodwill on the acquisition of Specialty represents the value of the assembled workforce at the time of acquisition, its machining 
expertise, technical skills and the future economic benefits expected to accrue from Hunting’s strengthening portfolio of MWD/LWD 
products and its ability to provide specialist manufacturing for complex conventional and unconventional oil and gas wells that 
enable companies to drill in demanding environments. The provisional amount of goodwill that is expected to be deductible for tax 
purposes is £10.5m.

an exceptional item. The remaining uplift to inventories of £0.8m is expected to be charged to the income statement during 2012.
The fair values of the net assets acquired are provisional as work is continuing in respect of the fair value exercise.

31 December 201 1 (note 5).

The following pre-acquisition trading results, in relation to the acquisition of Titan, were released in published announcements. 
All results were based on unaudited management accounts prepared on a US GAAP basis. The Group does not believe any 
differences of more than 10% to the figures below have subsequently been identified.

It should, however, be noted that these results occurred prior to acquisition and therefore they do not form part of the reported 
results for 201 1. Consequently, the results have not been adjusted to be consistent with Hunting PLC’s accounting policies, and are 
not given on the same basis as Hunting PLC’s Group accounts which are prepared under IFRSs as adopted by the European Union

Financial and commercial highlights 02 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014
Overview
After a positive start to the year, the European economy 
faltered causing demand to weaken during the second half. 
In Asia, we saw the opposite, with a more intense competitive 
environment putting pressure on nitrile margins during the 
first half of the year, but an improving position during the 
second half. In the final two months, we saw a substantial 
decline in our raw material costs as the price of oil fell and 
these movements are expected to have some benefit on 
the performance of the Group in 2015.
In the context of this challenging macro-economic 
environment, the Group’s underlying volumes in 2014 
remained in line with 2013. As I wrote last year, Synthomer 
has continued to demonstrate its resilience, and focus on 
cost control, product innovation, research and development 
and capacity expansions in emerging markets.
Full year performance
Underlying Group total sales declined 6.1% to £990.5 million 
(2013 £1,054.9 million), although, on a constant currency 
basis, sales reduced by 2.0%, on underlying volume in line 
with the prior year. 
Underlying Group operating profit for the year was 
£96.5 million, down 7.9% (2013 £104.8 million). This was 
partly due to the weakening of the Euro that impacted 
operating profits in our European and North American (ENA) 
business by £3.4 million. On a constant currency basis, profit 
was down by 3.4%, mainly due to the lower margin issues 
we had in nitrile in our Asia and ROW business (ARW) in 
the first half.
Underlying Group profit before tax was £86.0 million 
(2013 £90.1 million), a decline of 4.6%, whilst earnings 
per share at 19.5p (2013 20.7p) were down by 5.8%. 
After deducting special items, IFRS profit before tax 
was £53.8 million (2013 £59.1 million).
Strategy
Our strategy remains unchanged and we continue to focus 
on delivering growth through geographic expansion in 
emerging markets, where mega-trends, such as population 
growth, urbanisation and increasing wealth, are driving 
demand for our products. In these high-growth regions, 
we are able to leverage our European ‘Centres of Excellence’ 
in leading technology, R&D and manufacturing capability 
to give us a strong competitive advantage. We have started 
to see the results of the operational efficiency programme 
we began during 2014 in Europe, and we anticipate this 
will be rolled out into key facilities in Asia later in 2015.
Additionally, as part of this strategy, we continue to look 
for further investment opportunities to expand our footprint 
in Asia.
Investment
Synthomer continues to be a highly cash generative business, 
giving us the means to invest in future growth. During the 
year, we commissioned a new 28 kte dispersion line in our 
Saudi Arabian plant, and we completed the upgrade of one 
of our German plants to allow us to produce our bio-latex 
products for the paper industry. Our investment in R&D 
continues to benefit the business, with 16% of 2014 sales 
coming from products developed in the last five years, and  
a further seven patent application filings during the year.
Balance sheet
Net debt, at £112.1 million, was £21.5 million lower than the 
start of the year. This represents a net borrowing to EBITDA 
ratio of less than one times, which the Board considers to 
be at the lower end of our target leverage position.
Dividend
The Board has recommended an increased final ordinary 
dividend of 4.8p per share, making a total ordinary dividend 
for the year of 7.8p. The full year ordinary dividend represents 
an increase of 30% over the previous year, and a dividend 
cover of 2.5 times, in line with the policy we announced with 
our interim results.
In the interim results, we also set out our new framework for 
balance sheet management, and consistent with that, I am 
also pleased to announce that the Board recommends a 
special dividend of 7.8p per share, bringing the total dividend 
for the year to 15.6p.
Chairman’s statement Overview
Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014 03
Safety, health and environment
The Group is committed to the continuous improvement 
of its performance in respect of safety, health and the 
environment. I am pleased that we have been able to improve 
our safety record yet again and reduce our greenhouse gas 
emissions. Continuous improvement of our safety, health 
and environmental performance remains a key priority for 
the Group going forward. 
Our people
One of the keys to our continuing success is our people. 
This year the Group introduced a ‘Core Values’ programme 
that defines the qualities and characteristics that we would 
like to see in ourselves, our colleagues and our business. 
These core values have at their foundation safety, health 
and environment and will be an important element in defining 
the Group and its ongoing success. I would like to thank 
our people for the positive way they have embraced this 
programme and for their support and hard work during 2014.
Board composition
I am delighted that Calum MacLean has joined as CEO 
just after the year end. He was previously at INEOS where 
he held a number of senior roles since 1998, most recently 
as Board Director INEOS Group and Chairman Styrolution 
& Petroineos. He has succeeded Adrian Whitfield who has, 
over the last eight years transformed the Group from a 
diverse chemical conglomerate into the focused aqueous 
polymer business that you see today. I would like to thank 
Adrian for his enormous contribution to the Group, and, on 
behalf of the Board and the Group, wish him every success 
for the future.
As previously announced, David Blackwood, Chief Financial 
Officer for the past seven years, advised the Board in 
December of his intention to retire from the Company during 
2015. Similarly, after eight years as a non-executive Director, 
Chairing the Audit Committee and more recently fulfilling the 
role of Senior Independent Director, Jez Maiden has 
indicated that he will not be standing for re-election at the 
2015 AGM. Searches for suitable successors for both 
positions are well advanced. There will be other opportunities 
to thank both David and Jez for their outstanding 
contributions to Synthomer but I would like to record my 
personal thanks to all three departing Board colleagues, 
Adrian, David and Jez, for their support and hard work over 
many years.
Outlook
We remain cautious on the European economy and its 
impact on demand, but some benefit from lower raw material 
prices may help offset any volume weakness. However, 
the weakness of the Euro, will affect the translation of our 
European business results. In Asia, we expect to see an 
improved performance from nitrile given the continuing 
tightening in the supply demand position and improving 
margins. Overall, the Board is confident the Group is well 
positioned for future growth.

We rely on every employee to help create our culture

The organisation has almost doubled in size over the 
past five years and we understand that it is important 
to maintain consistency in our approach and goals to 
ensure the continued success of our business and 
people. In 2014, we implemented our ‘Core Values’ 
programme which defines the qualities and 
characteristics that we would like to see in ourselves, 
our colleagues and our business. The values were 
created through consultation with staff from across 
the Group. A range of aspects and topics which were 
deemed important to a successful business were 
discussed and formulated into six values: leadership, 
decision making, communication, diversity, teamwork 
and performance. These values were seen as all 
contributing to and enforcing our commitment to 
Safety, Health and Environment (SHE). 
These values, when fully embedded, will create focus 
and empower our employees to develop their own 
skills and work together towards common goals 
across the business.

Sharing operational 
excellence
Excellence 
In 2014, Synthomer began a review of operational 
performance through the ‘Synthomer 2015’ 
programme across Europe. The aim was to challenge 
areas of reduced efficiency and share operational 
best practice throughout the European facilities. 
A team of Synthomer staff worked extensively with 
an external consultant visiting each of the European 
businesses to find areas where efficiency or 
production improvements could be made. The review 
highlighted a number of areas at each site where 
improvements could be made. The recommendations 
included streamlining procedures and workplace 
standards as well as defining competency models 
and training schemes to ensure our people have the 
right knowledge to manage our operations effectively. 
Although ‘quick-win’ changes have already been made, 
the Synthomer ‘Operational Excellence’ team is 
continuing to support local management teams in 
transforming their operations and implementing further 
improvements. The team has already spent time at our 
three sites in Germany and will be working with the 
management of the other European sites over 2015. 
In addition, the programme is now planned to be rolled 
out in Malaysia in 2015 and 2016.
Elsewhere in Europe, we are continuing the 
development of our staff with great successes 
through the Cogent Gold Standard programme 
in the UK at our Harlow and Stallingborough sites. 
The Cogent Gold Standard is a framework of 
continuous professional development which sets 
out the skills and competencies required for top level 
performance in key roles within the manufacturing 
and chemical industry. Within Synthomer, the 
framework is now used to ensure all manufacturing 
staff possess the level of skill and knowledge to carry 
out their roles to the high standards we expect in 
our business. 
Innovation
Excellence
Growth 12 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014
We continue to invest in our business, with the commissioning 
of a new 28 kte production line in our Saudi plant, which 
has taken the name plate capacity of the plant to 100 ktes. 
We also completed the upgrade of one of our German SBR 
plants to allow us to produce our bio-latex for the paper 
industry, which we had previously introduced into our Oulu 
plant in Finland. This will allow us to move almost half of our 
paper latex sales to the new bio-latex grade – and we expect 
to be at this run rate by the end of 2015.
Our Oulu plant in Finland was a 50/50 joint venture. In 
October 2014, we acquired the remaining 50 per cent to 
make the business a wholly-owned subsidiary.
We continue to invest in our people and, during 2014, we 
have engaged in a number of development programmes 
to support our staff and our business. These programmes 
include the introduction of Synthomer ‘Core Values’. 
These core values have at their foundation safety, health 
and environment and will be an important element in defining 
the Group and its ongoing success.
After a reasonably benign year for raw materials in 2013, 
2014 saw some substantial movements. Vinyl Acetate 
monomer spiked severely mid-year, and all monomers 
declined sharply towards the end of the year due to falling 
oil prices and deteriorating supply demand positions for the 
producers of our core monomers, such as Butadiene and 
Styrene. Overall, these movements, were actively managed 
in our selling prices to customers.
 
Divisional performance
We report the performance of the Group as two segments: 
‘Europe and North America’ (ENA) and ‘Asia and Rest of 
World’ (ARW). 
The reported results are on an ‘origination basis’, meaning 
the segmental sales and operating profits are reported based 
on where the product is manufactured. In 2014, ENA 
accounted for 69% of Group sales and ARW for 31% of 
Group sales. As we export many specialty products from 
Europe to Asia, looking at sales on a destination basis, ENA 
comprises 62% of Group sales with ARW accounting for 
38%. Within the two segments, we split our sales and 
marketing activities into six areas which we refer to as 
strategic business units (SBUs). These comprise: ‘Paper’; 
‘Carpet, Compounds and Foam’ (CCF); ‘Construction and 
Coatings’ (CC); ‘Functional Polymers’ (FP); ‘Performance 
Polymers’ (PP) and ‘Health and Protection’ (HP) – which 
includes our Asian nitrile latex business.

Having joined Synthomer as your Chief Executive Officer 
in January 2015, I have not led the business through the 
year under review. However, whilst the broader trading 
environment in both Europe and Asia has undoubtedly 
made it a difficult year, I believe that the Group’s robust 
performance in the current environment demonstrates 
its ongoing potential for future growth.
In my first few weeks, I have enjoyed exploring the business 
and listening to the views of my colleagues. I look forward 
to working closely with my new colleagues in the year ahead 
and taking Synthomer forward. 
Overview
2014 was another challenging year for the Group, with the 
absence of a sustained recovery in Europe and a tough 
competitive environment impacting margins in nitrile during 
the first half of the year. Underlying Group operating profit of 
£96.5 million was down 7.9% (3.4% on a constant currency 
basis) on prior year.
In the first half of 2014 we saw some encouraging signs 
in Europe with good underlying growth in our construction 
related markets, only to see the position reverse later in 
the year as the prospect of a European economic recovery 
fell away. In Asia, we had a disappointing start to the year 
as competitive pressure and overcapacity amongst our 
customers, the glove manufacturers, combined to put 
downward pressure on nitrile margins after we had seen 
improvements over the course of 2013. Encouragingly we 
saw nitrile margins improve again over the course of the 
second half of 2014 as the supply demand position for 
nitrile latex tightened.
Net of lower interest costs and a slightly higher tax rate, 
underlying earnings per share were down 5.8% at 19.5p 
(2013 20.7p).
Our rate of innovation is accelerating, with a total of seven 
patent filings in 2014. These patents covered not only 
extensions of our existing technology, but also included new 
processes and a new polymer composition patent. 
We have also had a record number of new product launches 
this year, with a total of 16 products coming to market. 
These include products designed to improve wood coatings 
and new nitrile latex grades for the thin walled glove market. 
We have a good pipeline of products in development for the 
coming years. New products launched in the last five years 
contributed over 16% of 2014 Group revenues, compared 
with 12% in 2013. We remain confident of being able to 
improve this percentage, and have a medium-term target 
for new products launched in the preceding five years to 
contribute 20% of annual group revenues.

Nitrile volumes were ahead some 3% on 2013, with a 
noticeable strengthening in demand towards the end of 2014. 
Nitrile was impacted significantly in the first half of the year by 
intense competition and customer pressure due to excess 
glove manufacturing capacity. We recovered our margins in 
the second half with margins progressively strengthening, 
exiting the year ahead of 2013 average levels.
The ARW non-nitrile business has seen good demand with 
volumes up, though margin was slightly lower due to the 
competitive effects of new manufacturing capacity coming 
on line in Malaysia.
There has been a big focus on product development for the 
Asian coatings market, with the launch of a new vinylic based 
binder that gives formulating flexibility to optimise the cost/
performance balance. We have also extended our alkyd 
product line, with a product offering improved gloss retention 
to extend the lifetime of interior and exterior paints gloss finish 
coatings. Additionally, a number of other coatings products 
are in the initial commercialisation phase, for example, for 
use as concrete primer systems, premium interior paints and 
exterior coatings.
We launched two new nitrile grades towards the end of the 
year, which could create up to 50 ktes of new capacity 
compared to older grades due to their shorter 
manufacturing times.
In the Middle East, our new 28 kte line was commissioned, 
taking the site’s capacity to 100 ktes. We still anticipate 
strong nitrile growth going forward and are considering 
carefully the timing of new nitrile capacity expansion over 
and above that created by our recent product launches.

Underlying operating profit in our ENA segment was down by 
4.6% year-on-year (0.7% down on a constant currency basis).
Aggregate volumes were 1.4% lower. This includes the full 
recognition of Synthomer Finland Oy (formerly Eka 
Synthomer Oy) from the acquisition date of our JV partner’s 
50% holding, and the effect of exiting 18 ktes of very low 
margin compound business during the year. Excluding these, 
volumes decreased by 0.8% in 2014 having been 2.6% 
ahead at the half year on the same basis.
The drop in demand in the second half reflected the general 
European economic climate and some destocking towards 
the end of the year, following a drop in the cost of raw 
materials and customers choosing to wait for prices to 
stabilise before rebuilding stocks. Overall, volumes in our 
main SBUs were broadly flat, other than Paper, where we 
are continuing to see a structural decline in this market.
We saw some margin erosion in 2013, reaching a low point 
as we exited that year. Margins recovered over the course 
of 2014, with average margins ahead of 2013, on a constant 
currency basis. Towards the end of 2014, margins were 
helped by declining raw material prices, though the benefit 
of this looking forward is likely to be modest. Margins were 
weaker in Paper, but improved in CCF, FP and CC.
There have been a number of product launches in ENA 
during the year. Our focus on high performance coatings 
applications has led to the introduction of binder systems for 
parquet flooring and exterior joinery applications. Also, the 
latest regulatory requirements have resulted in us launching 
new products into a number of markets, these include: a 
range of SBR latex for cement flexibilisation, a formaldehyde 
free non-woven binder and a flooring adhesive that meets 
the most stringent European regulations. We have also been 
able to use our proprietary acrylic technology in new cement 
membrane applications and introduce two new SBR 
products in the coated paper market, where we also saw 
further market uptake of our bio-polymer hybrid. The first 
half of the year saw the market introduction of our new 
Alcotex product for the PVC industry.
We have been progressing with our performance 
improvement programme for Europe, named ‘Synthomer 
2015’, which we announced with our 2013 results. This 
programme has reviewed aspects of our processes, energy 
efficiency and productivity, and established ways to optimise 
these across all functions. All the European plants have been 
reviewed during 2014 and areas for improvement have been 
identified. Our internal team is now spending time with each 
of the plants and working with them in order to implement 
planned improvements. We continue to expect efficiencies 
and savings of at least €10 million per annum, with some of 
those savings expected to crystallise in 2015. The costs of 
the project are still in line with our expectations of €15 million 
of which €5 million will be capital. We have recognised costs 
of €5.6 million (£4.5 million) in the year and these can be seen 
in the special items note of the 2014 financial statements. 14 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014

Never stay still
Since the commissioning of our first NBR latex plant 
in Malaysia in 2000, we have moved from strength to 
strength in this area and continuously expanded and 
upgraded our facilities. 
In particular, our plant in Pasir Gudang, originally 
commissioned in 2009 with a capacity of 100 ktes 
per year has been developed into a world class 
facility, through substantial expansion and investment 
in 2012 and 2013. The site now features two 
additional reactor lines and production capacity that 
has increased to 160 ktes per year. Also as part of 
this investment, the facility was upgraded in order to 
produce our XSBR grades. 
Our commitment to growth and innovation never 
stops and we began preparing for the next generation 
of latices for the manufacture of protective gloves in 
2015 and beyond. The two new grades produced, 
‘Synthomer 6330’ and ‘Synthomer 6338’ can be 
formulated to allow low glove weight, with excellent 
tensile strength and elongation. ‘Synthomer 6338’ 
is our new flag-ship offering for ‘disposable’ protective 
gloves and was introduced to the market at the end 
of 2014. This new synthetic NBR latex product shows 
superior elastomeric performance and is targeted at 
the medical glove market where gloves need to 
provide good touch and feel. 
In creating these new grades, we also invested in new 
technology to produce our grades more effectively 
whilst at the same time reducing production time 
which allows greater capacity from the same 
production facilities. 
With quality and customer service at the forefront of 
our business we believe that these and future planned 
investments in product innovations and new technology 
will allow us to remain at the forefront of the industry.  Strategic report

Global trends drive  
innovation in coatings 
Synthomer’s commercial and R&D teams continually 
monitor global trends and the impact that they may 
have on our markets. Two trends that have intersected 
that provided an opportunity for Synthomer to create 
new products are governmental regulations that 
require a move away from high emission solvent 
based paints and the growing use in building of 
wood, both as a construction material and in flooring. 
These trends are very noticeable in both Europe 
and Asia.
Synthomer has developed a new range of water-
based acrylic dispersions for use in interior and 
exterior wood coating products that combine high 
performance while meeting the latest emission 
regulations. Two products recently launched are:
•	 Plextol W 1078* which is designed as a stand-alone 
binder for parquet floor coatings. This pure acrylic 
emulsion helps achieve a high hardness and good 
chemical resistance for the final product whilst 
making it easier to apply, featuring faster drying 
time and reducing the level of solvent required. 
By using our innovative polymerisation technology, 
the binder can be formulated into high quality, 
speciality coatings, increasingly replacing solvent 
based ones; and 
•	 Plextol W 1080*, which is an acrylic emulsion for 
high performance exterior joinery coatings.  
This new polymer system allows a number of key 
performance criteria to be met simultaneously, 
notably allowing a coating to be flexible even in cold 
conditions and still providing good adhesion onto 
different types of woods. In addition, it is designed 
to provide a coating with the necessary properties 
to allow the coating to last for a long time even in 
challenging climatic conditions.

Income statement
Sales, operating profit and profit before tax – 
underlying performance
Total sales decreased by 6.1% to £990.5 million 
(2013 £1,054.9 million) with Group operating profit 7.9% 
lower at £96.5 million (2013 £104.8 million). This was due 
to weakening exchange rates, the generally difficult economic 
environment in Europe and continued challenging market 
conditions in Asia, primarily in the first half of the year. On 
a constant currency basis, sales and EBIT were 2.0% and 
3.4% down respectively.
With lower interest costs in 2014, the Group’s profit before 
tax at £86.0 million was down by 4.6%, and similar to 2013 
on a constant currency basis.
 
Tax and EPS – underlying performance
The Group’s underlying tax rate of 21.4% (2013 20%) remains 
low, reflecting the benefits of pioneer status (extended tax 
holiday) on one of our businesses in Malaysia, and a zero rate 
in the UK. The Group does not expect to pay tax in the UK 
for the foreseeable future due to brought forward losses and 
deficit contributions to the UK pension scheme, which are 
tax deductible.
Profit attributable to non-controlling interests was £1.4 million 
(2013 £1.8 million).
As a result, the underlying earnings per share for 2014 was 
19.5p, compared to 20.7p per share for 2013, a decrease 
of 5.8%.
Special items and IFRS
The Group reports its financial results according to 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). However, 
to provide a clearer indication of the Group’s underlying 
performance, a number of special items are split out and 
shown in a separate column of the consolidated income 
statement due to their one-off or non-economic nature, and 
are excluded from the comments on underlying performance 
above and throughout the Chief Executive’s review of 
business performance. Special items comprise:
•	 Net acquisition credit of £0.1 million.
•	 Restructuring costs associated with the ‘Synthomer 2015’ 
European programme of £4.5 million. There will be some 
additional costs associated with this programme during 
2015 and 2016 with the total cost for the project expected 
to be £8 million (€10 million). 
•	 Various cross-currency and interest rate swaps for 
hedging purposes, which involve maturities of up to three 
years. IFRS requires that where the strict requirements of 
IAS 39 are not met, changes in the market value should 
be recognised annually in the income statement. However, 
such financial instruments are maintained by the Group for 
the length of the contract and over their lifetime have a fair 
value of nil. Hence the notional annual adjustment, a loss 
of £0.8 million (2013 £1.2 million loss) is segregated from 
the underlying performance.
•	 Amortisation of intangibles of £27 .0 million (comprising 
£25.8 million in the Company and subsidiaries and 
£1.2 million in share of joint ventures). IFRS acquisition 
accounting requires an explicit number to be placed on 
certain intangibles and amortised through the consolidated 
income statement, with the balance of the excess of the 
purchase price over the physical assets being carried as 
goodwill, which is subject to annual impairment testing. 
The amortisation expense arising from this has been 
treated as a special item and will continue to be so until 
the associated intangible assets are fully amortised. 
After deducting special items from underlying performance 
the IFRS profit before tax was £53.8 million (2013 £59.1 million) 
and earnings per share were 13.3p (2013 14.2p).
Dividend
The Board proposes an increased final ordinary dividend of 
4.8p which, with the interim ordinary dividend of 3.0p, brings 
the total ordinary dividend for the year to 7.8p per share. 
This is 2.5 times covered (2013 3.5 times), and in line with 
the Group’s new capital management policy issued with 
the half year results.
In addition, a special dividend of 7.8p will be proposed 
in line with the Group’s updated policy on balance sheet 
management – issued with the half year results. This will 
be paid at the same time as Group’s final dividend payment.
Balance sheet
Goodwill decreased to £232.8 million at the end of 2014 
from £241.1 million at the end of 2013 due to foreign 
currency translation.
Acquired intangible assets decreased to £80.7 million at 
31 December 2014 from £109.5 million in the prior year. 
This movement reflects the intangible assets of £2.1 million 
acquired on the acquisition of Synthomer Finland Oy, regular 
annual amortisation of £25.8 million reported in special items, 
and currency translation.
Property, plant and equipment increased to £205.4 million 
at 31 December 2014 compared to £203.1 million at 
31 December 2013. Additions during the year were 
£21.6 million.
Following on from the Malaysian land sales announced with 
the 2013 results, further progress has been made. In January 
2015, contracts have been exchanged on a further plot of 
land. This has brought total sales proceeds for contracted 
land sales to MYR 232.8 million in the Group’s 70% owned 
subsidiary, Revertex (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd, of which proceeds 
due to the Group will amount to MYR 154.8 million (net of 
land taxes), approximately £28 million at year end rates. 
Some 440 acres, approximately one quarter of the total land 
originally offered for sale, remains, for which we continue to 
seek a buyer.
The deferred tax liability has decreased to £35.5 million from 
£43.8 million during the year, due mainly to the amortisation 
of intangible assets. 
Financial review Strategic report
Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014 17
This year we have disclosed separately provisions for other 
liabilities and charges to provide additional clarity to our 
financial statements, albeit that the amounts are not material. 
These have remained broadly unchanged year-on-year at 
£6.5 million (2013 £6.6 million). The largest element of this 
provision is £3.4 million relating to certain legal and customer 
claims against the Group.
Pensions 
In the main UK defined benefit pension scheme the majority 
of investments are in equities. All asset classes performed well 
over the course of 2014, with a total return on assets (excluding 
cash) of 10. 1%. The yield on high-quality corporate bonds 
decreased by 0.9% in the year which increased liabilities. 
The Company made cash contributions to the fund in the year 
of £9.0 million, which included a £4. 1 million prepayment of 
2015 contributions. The overall effect of these changes was 
that there was an increase in the deficit of the scheme, to 
£83.8 million at the end of 2014 (2013 £60.3 million). Due to 
the prepayment, cash contributions in 2015 are expected 
to be of the order of £9 million.
The UK scheme was closed to future accrual during 2009 
and there are no active members in the scheme.
Overseas net pension liabilities increased to £66.9 million 
(2013 £52.6 million), due to the impact of lower yields on high 
quality euro bonds. The non-UK schemes are primarily 
traditional German unfunded ‘on balance sheet’ arrangements.

This compares to a net borrowing position of £112.1 million.
The Group’s £210 million committed loan facility maturing 
July 2019 had £85.3 million undrawn at the end of the year.
Net cash held at the year end (cash and cash equivalents 
less short-term overdrafts) was £24.9 million.
The US private placements £14.1 million ($22.0 million) 
is repayable on 2 September 2016. Net of derivatives 
associated with this, and maturing at the same time, this 
is equivalent to a repayment of £12.1 million.
 
Underlying net borrowings to EBITDA, the Group’s key 
leverage metric, was just below 1.0 times at the end of 2014 
(2013 1.1 times).

Principal risks and uncertainties
Strategic risks Strategy for mitigation
Conditions in the global economy, economic fluctuations 
in customer industries and volatility and cyclicality of the 
global chemicals and polymers markets may adversely 
affect the results of the Group.
The Group maintains a balanced portfolio of products 
serving a wide range of end markets around the globe. 
Business performance at business unit and geographical 
level is closely monitored and corrective actions are taken 
as necessary. 
The markets in which the Group operates are highly 
competitive and the Group may lose market share to other 
producers of water-based polymers or to other products 
that can be substituted for the products of the Group.
The Group continues to invest in existing and new 
products and technologies through R&D. The Group 
continues to invest in new facilities to allow the Group to 
maintain its key market positions. As part of the Group’s 
strategic planning process it identifies and converts 
acquisition targets to enhance market positions and 
provide new technologies.
The ability of the Group to compete is highly dependent 
on its ability to develop technological innovations, to 
introduce new products and to protect its intellectual 
property, trade secrets and know-how. Failure to do 
so could have an adverse affect on the Group.
The Group continues to invest in existing and new 
products and technologies through R&D. As part of the 
Group’s strategic planning process it identifies and 
converts acquisition targets to enhance market positions 
and provide new technologies.
The failure of the Group to procure key raw materials may 
lead to production interruptions and volatility in the prices 
of such raw materials and energy prices may adversely 
affect the profitability of the Group and its working 
capital position.
Sourcing strategies are in place Group-wide to access 
multiple sources for key raw materials and the Group 
works closely with key suppliers to ensure availability. 
The Group looks to identify alternative raw materials 
where possible.
The Group actively manages margins and recovers input 
cost increases from customers.
Operational risks
The Group may be liable for damages based on 
product liability claims brought against its customers 
in end-use markets.
Technically qualified personnel and control systems are in 
place around the Group to ensure products meet quality 
requirements. All sites operate quality management 
systems (ISO etc).
The Group has a Group-wide product liability insurance 
which provides £50 million of cover. Strategic report
Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014 19
Operational risks continued Strategy for mitigation
Compliance with extensive environmental, health and 
safety laws and regulations could require material 
expenditure, changes in the operations of the Group 
or site remediation.
The manufacture, storage and transportation of chemicals 
is inherently dangerous and any incidents relating to the 
hazards which the Group faces may adversely affect its 
financial condition, results of operations and reputation.
Detailed safety, health and environmental processes are 
documented in operating guidance which is updated and 
communicated to staff on a regular basis. 
Robust maintenance programmes are undertaken in order 
to ensure that our facilities meet up to Group and local 
legal requirements.
The Group operates a central internal audit function 
dedicated to SHE issues and programmes for continuous 
improvement across all major SHE areas are in place 
Group-wide.
The ongoing success of the Group is dependent 
on attracting and retaining high quality senior 
management and staff who can effectively manage 
the Group’s operations.
The Group offers competitive compensation packages 
with annual bonus and long-term incentive arrangements 
for key employees. Appropriate notice periods and 
non-compete clauses are used to mitigate short-term 
risk for key employees. The Group is also developing 
a succession plan for key positions.
Financial risks
As a significant proportion of the Group’s turnover and 
assets are in currencies other than UK sterling fluctuations 
in currency exchange rates may significantly impact 
the results of the operations of the Group and may 
significantly affect the comparability of financial results 
between financial periods.
The Group has a policy of hedging all significant foreign 
exchange transactional exposure at operating company 
level and also holds debt facilities in several key currencies 
to offset fluctuations in overseas asset values.
The Group’s balance sheet and cash flow or credit market 
conditions and credit ratings may restrict the ability of the 
Group to obtain credit facilities or to refinance its existing 
debt facilities in the longer term. In addition, interest rate 
fluctuations and increases in bank lending margins may 
increase the Group’s costs of borrowing.
The Group closely monitors cash flow and working capital 
performance on a monthly basis and regularly reviews 
covenant compliance. 
The Group has a policy on leverage limits and has 
adequate headroom on a twelve month forecast basis 
through a range of facilities with varying expiry dates.
Interest rate risk is managed through the use of interest 
rate hedging.
The Group has funding risks relating to defined benefit 
pension schemes and any deterioration in the value of 
assets in which the pension scheme have invested as 
against the financial obligations to make payments to 
members of the schemes could have an adverse affect  
on the Group.
The UK scheme was closed to future accrual during 
2009. The risks are mitigated by paying appropriate 
contributions into the funds and through balanced 
investment strategies which are designed to avoid 
a material impact to the fund assets.  20 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014
Commitment to safety, health and  
environmental (SHE) performance
The Board, Chief Executive and Group Executive Committee 
are fully committed to improving SHE performance and the 
involvement of staff at all levels across our sites in our SHE 
programmes. SHE performance is a primary duty for 
management at all levels in the Group and is aligned to 
our three long-term goals:
1. To minimise any environmental burden created 
by our activities;
2. To have no accidents or incidents; and
3. To have no adverse impact on the health of those who 
work in, or live near our operations, nor on the health 
of those who use our products.
The Group adopts the following SHE management practices 
with the aim of continuously improving SHE performance:
•	 SHE performance is discussed in all management 
meetings as the first agenda item;
•	 The Group implemented in 2014 a ‘Core Values’ 
programme which has SHE performance as the 
foundation for all the other values (see page 10 for more 
details of the ‘Core Values’ programme);
•	 The Group conducts regular, in-depth SHE audits of all 
sites to assess performance and identify opportunities 
for improvement; 
•	 The Board monitors the Group’s process safety 
performance and progress with sites’ annual process 
safety improvement plans. This is supported by a 
continuing process safety training programme for 
technical, production and engineering staff;
•	 The Group Accident and Incident Management System 
(AIMS) is used to collect and analyse data on all 
accidents, incidents and ‘near misses’ on our sites; 
•	 Sites implement the Group’s Safety, Health and 
Environment Management System (SHEMS) or an 
equivalent system;
•	 Sites provide training for staff to ensure that they 
understand Group and site systems, both in SHE and 
more generally; 
•	 Key measures and SHE performance indicators are 
collected and reported to the Group Executive and to the 
Board. These include positive safety interactions – a 
programme of one to one and small group discussions on 
SHE issues and inspections and engineering performance;
•	 Senior managers have SHE targets as part of their annual 
objectives; and
•	 Central SHE staff regularly visit sites to carry out training 
and development of key staff. 
The Group publishes an annual Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) report which is available online.  
It discusses a wider range of safety, health and 
environmental measures of our performance as well 
as other CSR measures and activities. Please go to  
www.synthomer.com to find a copy of the most 
recent report.
Health, safety and accident performance
The Group’s accident performance improved in 2014 to 
give Synthomer its best ever performance. There were 
10 over three-day accidents during the year and a 
consequent frequency rate of 0.20 per 100,000 hours 
worked. This rate is almost five times better than we 
achieved in 2000 and close to the average for the UK 
Chemical Industries Association (CIA) member companies. 
It is notable that the Synthomer Finland Oy site has now 
achieved 13 years without a lost time accident.

In common with many other chemical companies, 
Synthomer also collects data on a wider range of accidents 
and incidents – essentially monitoring all accidents involving 
more than first aid treatment. This data is used to calculate 
a recordable accident rate. Our frequency rate for 2014 of 
0.52 per 100,000 hours worked was a 60% reduction on the 
rate in 2011 and is showing a falling trend. Our performance 
is now broadly in line with the figures reported by similar 
international chemical companies of our size and we remain 
committed to further improvements.

Employee health issues were a focus during 2014. There 
were two cases of disease attributed to occupational factors 
during the year, both dermatitis. 
The Group had a number of safety incidents which did not 
cause injury but which were either reportable to the local 
regulatory authorities, or would have been reportable under 
the proposed International Council of Chemical Associations 
(ICCA) reporting structure. None of these incidents caused 
injury, significant plant damage or detectable environmental 
damage. They are discussed in the full CSR report.

Environmental performance
Since 2000 we have reported significant reductions, 
year-on-year, in each of our main environmental targets: 
global warming burden; energy and water consumption 
per tonne of production; and waste disposal from our sites. 
The Group can report that our emissions of Greenhouse 
Gases (GHGs) reduced in 2014 by 7.4%. However, whilst 
the Group remains ahead of our long-term targets, our 
energy and water consumption targets have increased 
compared with 2013. The performance of each of the 
measures are discussed below. In 2014, we rebased our 
10 year target to 2005 actual levels, crystallizing the actual 
improvements we made between 2000 and 2005. 
Some data has been restated for 2012 and 2013 due to a 
review of performance reporting at three of our sites. Details 
can be found in notes 8 and 9 to the Environmental KPI table 
on page 23.

production) increased in 2014 by 3% compared with 2013. 
Despite this adverse movement, 2014 was the third best year 
in the Group’s history and we remain nearly 30% better than 
our rebased 2014 sustainable development target.
The increase in consumption was spread across the Group’s 
sites and can be attributed to smaller production volumes in 
a number of cases. Consumption was also impacted by a 
new boiler installed in our site in Kluang, Malaysia which was 
needed to destroy Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). 
However, there was a 23% improvement in energy efficiency 
in Stallingborough following the move of production to the 
site from closed sites at Mouscron and Batley.

Water use
Water consumption increased by 5% in 2014, up from a 
record low in 2013. Our products contain a significant quantity 
of water, however, we have managed over the 10 year period 
since 2005 to halve our specific water consumption. The 
strategy is to reduce our consumption further. In addition, 
a number of sites face significant water constraints and we 
have ongoing projects to use on-site water capture not only 
to avoid production problems but as an environmentally 
preferable way of obtaining the water we use.

Waste disposal
During the year, the closed site in Batley was cleared and 
a number of sites removed significant quantities of legacy 
waste. Despite this activity, we have been able to maintain 
the amount of hazardous waste going to landfill at 700 grams 
per tonne of production.

Greenhouse gas emissions
The Company has reported environmental KPIs in the format 
recommended by the Department of Environment, Food and 
Rural Affairs (Defra) since the Annual Report for 2007. The 
suggested format includes: energy, water, waste and GHG 
emissions. This data is available for each year since 2005 on 
a three year rolling basis. Last year, the format was revised to 
comply with Defra’s 2013 guidance which takes account of 
the GHG emission reporting requirements under the 
Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report) Regulations 2013. Internal data collection was also 
revised for the 2013 financial year to give improved 
compliance with the revised guidance. 
Reporting parameters
The 2014 financial year reporting includes all manufacturing 
operations, all office locations co-located with manufacturing 
and those listed as contact locations in the Annual Report or 
on the Company’s website. It does not include some very 
small locations such as home offices. These locations will 
have no material effect on the Group’s overall GHG 
emissions, being estimated at considerably less than 0.1% 
of the Group total. 22 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014
Corporate social responsibility report
continued
All known emissions from manufacturing process have been 
included, specifically energy directly used and the indirect 
energy costs of heating, cooling and other site services 
where these are provided by a third party. They include 
estimates for the effects of the release of VOCs and 
refrigerant gases. The only known emissions which have 
not been included are direct emissions of CO 2 from on-site 
waste treatment; this has not currently been quantified.
The Group has no known uses or releases of 
perfluorocarbons or sulphur hexafluoride. All releases 
of nitrous oxide or methane are associated with energy 
production and are not separately quantified. The Group 
continues to report scope 1 and 2 emissions. No estimate 
has been made of scope 3 emissions. The Group continues 
to use emissions per production tonne as its intensity ratio. 
The data source for all emissions factors (CO 2 equivalent 
(CO 2e)) is Defra: May 2014.
Calculation methods
All direct energy production from fossil fuels has been 
aggregated on a Group-wide basis and converted to CO 2e 
by using the appropriate Defra emissions factors. No 
allowance has been made for possible country to country 
variation in calorific value or CO 2 emission factors. Electricity 
has been converted to CO 2e on a country by country basis, 
using the conversion factors given by Defra for 2014 and 
previous years. (It should be noted that these generally refer 
to actual country performance two years earlier than the 
quoted date, i.e. 2014 factors relate to 2012 performance.)
Synthomer’s site in Stallingborough, UK takes most of its 
electricity from an exclusive contract with an adjacent waste 
incinerator. This electricity is certified as ‘Green’ by the UK 
government and has an emission factor of 0.33. This figure 
has been used for the proportion of Stallingborough’s 
electricity which comes from the incinerator. Our site in Oss, 
Netherlands signed a contract to buy only green electricity 
from 1 January 2014 and has Dutch governmental 
certification to confirm this. This electricity has been given 
an emission factor of 0.00. The site in Marl, Germany 
signed a contract to purchase 100% green electricity 
from 1 October 2014 and has German certification for 
this contract. This proportion of Marl’s electricity has also 
been given an emission factor of 0.00. 
VOCs have been aggregated on a Group basis and 
converted to CO 2e using a factor of 11. This figure has been 
used by UK CIA member companies since 2005 and is at the 
upper end of the range for VOCs. Information on the release 
of refrigerant gases has been collected for 2011 to 2014. 
The releases for each individual gas has been aggregated 
in each year to give a Group release and then converted 
to CO 2e using the equivalence factors given by Defra for 
each gas.
Performance in 2014
Although we have seen increases in our energy and water 
consumption, the Group reduced its overall emissions of 
greenhouse gases by 7.4% in 2014 to give the Group’s best 
ever performance, on a per tonne basis. The inclusion of 
refrigerant gases and the calculation of CO 2e for electricity 
on a country by country basis had a significant impact on 
the Group’s calculated greenhouse gas emissions in 2013. 
However, in 2014 the Group achieved a 22% reduction 
in the global warming impact of refrigerant gas losses, an 
area where we expect significant improvement over the next 
few years. The changes in the emissions factors for electricity 
generation in different countries also have a significant 
impact over which the Company has no control. This year, 
the emission factor for the UK increased by 10.9% and it 
increased by 3.5% for Germany. These increases largely 
offset the reduction of 5.4% seen in Malaysia, although 
emissions there remain 40% higher per unit of electricity 
than in Europe. 
The Group did achieve very significant reductions in VOC 
releases in 2014. A new boiler which burns residual VOC with 
full heat recovery at the Kluang, Malaysia NBR plant came 
on stream early in 2014. This reduced the plant’s VOC losses 
from over 1,100 tonnes to below 50 tonnes. The Harlow 
cryogenic VOC recovery unit, which came on-line towards 
the end of 2013 has proved very effective in reducing site 
losses by nearly 70%. The combined effect of these changes 
reduced the GHG equivalent of the Group’s VOC losses by 
15,000 tonnes CO 2e, an 88% reduction. 
The combined effect of the Group’s efforts produced an 
absolute reduction of some 19,000 tonnes (expressed as 
CO 2e) in the Group’s GHG emissions in 2014 despite the 
rise in energy consumption.

Notes
1. Data relates to site usage of all fuels, excluding transport of goods to and from site and the movement of these vehicles on site. Internal transport on site 
is included.
2. Emissions to air have been calculated from the usage of all fuels, excluding transport fuel. They therefore include both direct emissions and indirect 
emissions related to bought-in electricity, steam, compressed air, cooling water etc., with the exception of transmission and distribution losses for electricity. 
(These losses are in scope 3, this report is for scope 1 and 2.)
3. CO2e emissions include contributions from CH4 and N2O associated with combustion.
4. NOx emissions are predominantly those from combustion processes. The CO2e global warming potential contribution from these releases is already 
included in the CO2 from energy figure above.
5. Data on refrigerant gas losses has been collected for 2014 and 2013 and was collected for 2012 wherever possible. Where site data was not available for 
2012, losses have been assumed to be the same as in 2013. Annual losses of refrigerant have been converted to the CO2e figures using the substance by 
substance figures published by Defra, based on the materials consumed within the Group.
6. The total CO2e figure is the total of the CO2e from energy and the VOC contribution (assuming an average factor of 11kg CO2e per kg VOC) and the 
refrigerant contribution.
7. Percentage changes are calculated from the base data and may differ slightly from changes calculated from the data in the tables because of rounding.
8. The energy consumption data for 2012 and 2013 has been restated following a review of the data assumptions at two of our Malaysian sites. This has also 
impacted the greenhouse emissions reporting for 2012 and 2013.
9. The water consumption numbers for 2013 have been revised following the acquisition of Synthomer Finland Oy and the alignment of water consumption 
on that site. 24 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014

Statement of compliance
The Company considers that it has complied throughout the 
financial year ended 31 December 2014 with the provisions 
set out in the Code except in relation to the composition of 
the Board and its Committees in that:
•	 the Audit Committee comprised two independent 
non-executive directors instead of three until March 2014;
•	 the Remuneration Committee comprised two independent 
non-executive directors instead of three until 23 January 
2014 and the Chairman of the Board was Chairman of that 
Committee until 1 March 2014;
•	 the Nomination Committee was not composed of a 
majority of independent non-executive directors until 
August 2014.
Further details on these matters and how they have been 
addressed are set out in this report.
Application of the Code
The main principles of the Code were applied as follows:
Leadership and effectiveness
Operation of the Board
The activities of the Company are controlled by the Board 
which, during 2014, comprised two executive directors 
and seven non-executive directors. The roles of Chairman 
and Chief Executive Officer are clearly divided between  
Mr N A Johnson who heads the Board in his capacity as 
non-executive Chairman and Mr C G MacLean who has  
from 22 January 2015 responsibility for the running of the 
Company’s business as Chief Executive Officer prior to 
which Mr A M Whitfield was the Chief Executive Officer. The 
non-executive directors all have wide business and boardroom 
experience gained in a broad range of business sectors.
The Board has reserved to itself a schedule of matters which 
includes setting long-term objectives for the Group and the 
strategies to be employed in achieving them, setting policies 
in the areas of safety, health and the environment, recruitment 
and employment, risk management and treasury and, 
subject to materiality thresholds, decisions on the raising 
of capital, financial commitments, capital expenditure, 
acquisitions and disposals and the prosecution, defence 
and settlement of litigation.
During 2014 the Board held six scheduled meetings to 
review current and projected performance and to determine 
strategic issues with a half day dedicated to an annual 
strategy development review. In addition three meetings 
were held at short notice to deal with specified matters. The 
directors receive in advance full information on all matters to 
be discussed at Board meetings as well as a detailed review 
of performance prepared by the Chief Executive Officer. The 
Board has established Audit, Nomination and Remuneration 
Committees which are discussed on page 26.
Corporate governance
Report from the Chairman
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to report on a year of good progress 
in the development of our corporate governance 
practices against a background of the significant 
change that has been announced in the composition 
of your Board over the last several months.
I handed over the chair of the Remuneration Committee 
to Brendan Connolly in March 2014 who oversaw the 
implementation of our new remuneration policy which 
received a high level of support at the Company’s 2014 
AGM. The composition of your Board and its 
committees was brought into compliance with best 
practice during 2014 and an externally facilitated Board 
and Committee performance evaluation process has 
been carried out with the results reviewed by the Board 
in February 2015. As a result the Company entered 2015 
having eliminated all areas of non-compliance with the 
2012 UK Corporate Governance Code reported on in 
our 2013 Corporate Governance Report. For 2015 I will 
lead a process for implementing the suggestions for 
improving your Board’s effectiveness arising from the 
evaluation process with a focus on boardroom dynamics 
and culture.
The Nomination Committee, which I also chair, has  
had an intense period of activity since June 2014 when 
Adrian Whitfield notified his decision to step down as 
Chief Executive Officer. The successful recruitment of 
Calum MacLean has been followed by the Nomination 
Committee initiating the ongoing recruitment exercise 
for a Chief Financial Officer to replace David 
Blackwood whose retirement was announced in 
December 2014. As announced on 26 February 2015 
Jez Maiden has decided to retire from his position as 
an independent non-executive director, chair of the 
Audit Committee and the Board’s Senior Independent 
Director. The Nomination Committee will also lead the 
search exercise for a successor and is approaching 
both Board vacancies in full recognition of the need 
to address gender diversity.
The full report on our corporate governance compliance 
in 2014 is set out in the rest of this report which I hope 
confirms your Board’s commitment to achieving best 
practice in all areas.
Neil Johnson
Chairman 26 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014
In addition arrangements are made each year for the Board 
to visit up to two of the Group’s operational sites and meet 
local management. Ad hoc site visits are facilitated for 
individual non-executive directors on request. During 2014 
the Board held a meeting in Marl, Germany and in Kluang, 
Malaysia at the offices of its businesses. In conjunction with 
those Board meetings presentations were given by local 
senior management and the directors were given the 
opportunity to visit the Group’s plants.
The Board has delegated to the Chief Executive Officer 
responsibility for the development and preparation of the 
business plan for the Group and the annual Group budget 
for recommendation to the Board. As the senior executive 
director, the Chief Executive Officer is responsible for all 
aspects of day-to-day operational control of the Group and 
execution of the Group strategy. The Chief Executive Officer 
has established and chairs an Executive Committee (whose 
other members are the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief 
Counsel and Company Secretary, and the operational vice 
presidents for the Group) to assist him in the performance 
of his duties and which meets once a month. The Chairman 
has available to him the minutes of the Executive Committee 
and all directors receive a monthly trading summary and 
commentary from the Chief Financial Officer.
Board membership and balance
The Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Senior 
Independent Director are identified on page 24. The 
Chairmen and members of the Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees are identified below. The Board 
considers Mr J K Maiden, Dr J J C Jansz, Mr J Chen and 
Mr B W D Connolly are independent in accordance with the 
provisions of the Code.
The Board held a total of nine meetings in 2014. In addition 
the non-executive directors also met once without the 
Chairman to appraise his performance.
The table opposite shows the number of meetings of the 
Board, Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees 
held during the year and the number of meetings attended by 
each director. Where a director is unable to attend a Board 
or Committee meeting his views on agenda items are 
canvassed in advance of the meeting and incorporated 
into the discussions.

Induction and training
Induction arrangements are in place in order to ensure new 
directors receive a full formal and tailored induction on 
appointment. The Chairman reviews and agrees the training 
and development needs of the directors and the skills and 
knowledge of the Board as a whole are updated by briefings 
provided by the Company’s internal resources and materials 
and seminars offered by external advisers.
Performance evaluation
Performance evaluations of the Board, its committees and 
its directors were carried out in the last year by the following 
internal and external processes:
•	 an assessment of the performance of individual non-
executive directors is carried out by the Chairman through 
a rolling programme of one-to-one discussions using 
performance evaluation questions as the centrepiece 
for those discussions. Every non-executive director is 
assessed in this way once a year;
•	 the performance of the executive directors was reviewed 
against their personal objectives for 2014;
•	 a meeting of the non-executive directors (in the absence 
of the Chairman) chaired by the Senior Independent 
Director was held in November 2014 to evaluate the 
performance of the Chairman, taking into account the 
views of the executive directors; and
•	 the effectiveness of the Board and its Committees 
(Audit, Nomination, Remuneration) was evaluated for the 
first time by way of an externally facilitated process using 
Independent Board Review, a division of Independent 
Audit Limited (who have no other connection with the 
Company) and their online assessment service Thinking 
Board. This facilitation helped ensure a rigorous review 
was carried out covering the important influences on the 
Board’s effectiveness. The focus and coverage of the 
Board and committee questionnaires was discussed in 
advance with Independent Audit who then administered 
the questionnaires on a confidential basis, analysed the 
results independently from the Board and management, 
and presented the findings and their suggestions in a 
paper which was discussed with the Chairman and 
subsequently provided to all directors.
Corporate governance
continued Governance
Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014 27
Non-executive directors are appointed for one-year terms. 
All directors submit themselves for annual election at each 
Annual General Meeting.
Board committees
The Board has formally established Nomination, Audit, 
and Remuneration Committees, each with their own terms 
of reference which set out their respective roles and the 
authority delegated to them by the Board. Copies of the 
terms of reference are available upon request from the 
Company Secretary and can also be downloaded from 
the Company’s website. All non-executive directors have 
a standing invitation to attend Committee meetings unless 
they are notified otherwise.
Audit Committee
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to report on the work of the Audit 
Committee during 2014 which was strengthened by 
the appointment of Brendan Connolly in March 2014 
returning its composition to three independent 
non-executive directors.
The Committee fulfilled its primary responsibilities 
during the year and in addition had detailed 
presentations from the Chief Financial Officer on 
recently completed significant capital expenditure 
projects, the refinancing of the Group’s main credit 
facility, the Group’s ERP systems and associated 
disaster recovery and security processes and 
approved a new cash management policy. Following 
on from our audit tender process in 2012 the 
implications of the reform of the auditor appointment 
and audit tender processes and associated obligations 
and reporting requirements on Audit Committees is 
being considered and will be incorporated into the 
Committee’s policies, procedures and remit in 2015.
The final year of our three year work plan relating to 
co-sourced internal audit services was successfully 
concluded at the end of 2014. A new three year plan 
proposed by the Chief Financial Officer and involving 
a continuation of the co-sourced approach, focused 
on annual reviews of the Group’s largest entities with 
an extension of scope to include a review of IT 
systems was considered and approved.
As I shall be retiring from the Board at the forthcoming 
AGM this will be my last report and I would like to thank 
the Committee members for their support and the 
Chief Financial Officer and his team for their assistance 
over the last seven years.

Jez Maiden  Chairman
Just Jansz 
Brendan Connolly   from 1 March 2014
Alex Catto  until 1 March 2014
The role of the Audit Committee
In 2014 the Audit Committee was chaired by Mr J K Maiden 
and comprised two independent non-executive directors 
together with one non-independent non-executive director 
until 1 March 2014. Following the appointment of  
Mr B W D Connolly to the Committee with effect from 
1 March 2014, the Committee comprised three independent 
non-executive directors. Mr Maiden is considered by the 
Board to have ‘recent and relevant financial experience’ 
for the purposes of Provision C.3.1 of the Code due to his 
current financial role outside the Group. 
The Committee has established a detailed remit regarding 
the application of financial reporting and internal control 
principles, which covers:
•	 monitoring the integrity of the financial statements 
of the Group and any formal announcements 
relating to the Group’s financial performance and 
reviewing significant financial reporting judgements 
contained in them;
•	 reviewing the Group’s internal financial controls 
and the Group’s internal control and risk 
management systems;
•	 monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the 
Group’s internal audit function;
•	 making recommendations to the Board regarding 
the selection and appointment of the external 
auditor and approving their remuneration and terms 
of engagement;
•	 reviewing and monitoring the external auditor’s 
independence and objectivity and the effectiveness 
of the audit process; 
•	 developing and implementing policy on the 
engagement of the external auditor to supply 
non-audit services;
•	 advising the Board, in connection with its obligation 
under Section C.1.1 of the Code, on whether the 
Annual Report and accounts, taken as a whole, is 
fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the performance of the Group, along with its 
business model and strategy;
•	 ensuring that the external audit services contract is 
put out to tender at least once every ten years; and
•	 reporting on the significant issues that it considered 
in relation to the financial statements and how these 
were addressed. 28 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014
The Chief Financial Officer and senior members of his 
department attend meetings of the Committee as part of the 
review of the Group’s interim and annual financial statements 
prior to their submission to the Board and as part of the 
internal audit process. The Committee meets periodically 
with the Company’s auditor without management present to 
discuss the adequacy of the Group’s financial management, 
internal controls and information systems and to review the 
terms of the auditor’s engagement, effectiveness, 
independence and objectivity.
Activities during the year
The Committee met formally four times during 2014 and 
carried out the following main activities in addition to the 
items mentioned in the Chairman’s overview:
•	 Reviewed the financial statements in the 2013 Annual 
Report and the 2014 interim statement in conjunction with 
papers prepared by the Chief Financial Officer regarding 
accounting policies and basis of preparation and a 
number of disclosure considerations;
•	 Advised the Board in connection with its obligation under 
Section C.1.1 of the Code;
•	 Reviewed the scope and effectiveness of the external audit;
•	 Agreed changes to the half year and year end processes 
to improve reporting effectiveness and reviewed the 
Financial Reporting Council’s (FRC) periodic routine 
review of the external auditors work;
•	 Received reports from the external auditor on the major 
findings of its work;
•	 Approved the annual external audit plan and the basis 
on which the auditor assesses materiality;
•	 Reviewed the provision of non-audit services by the 
external auditor;
•	 Approved a new policy on cash management;
•	 Reviewed the remit and effectiveness of the Committee; 
•	 Reviewed the Group’s whistleblowing arrangements; 
•	 Reviewed the Group’s Risk Register;
•	 Monitored the effectiveness of internal controls and 
risk management;
•	 Reviewed the Group’s internal audit plan; and
•	 Received detailed reports and presentations from 
KPMG, the co-sourced internal auditor, and the 
reviews undertaken by the Group Corporate Controller. 
Reviewed reports relating to the implementation of 
recommendations from internal audit visits to enable the 
Committee to assess the improvements in the Group’s 
controls and reporting and where further actions are 
required. Considered and approved the new scope and 
plan for co-sourced internal audit reviews for a three year 
cycle commencing in 2015.
In addition the Chairman of the Committee had regular 
dialogue with the external auditor, Chief Financial Officer and 
other senior members of the head office finance team during 
the course of the year.
Auditor objectivity and independence
With regard to seeking to ensure the independence and 
objectivity of the auditor, the Audit Committee’s policy is to 
ensure that the auditor’s integrity is not compromised, by 
restricting their involvement in the provision of non-audit 
services where a conflict of interest, real or perceived, may 
exist. The policy splits the approval of non-audit work into 
three categories:
•	 services which are prohibited;
•	 services which are pre-approved subject to limits; and
•	 services which require specific approval on a  
case-by-case basis.
Prohibited services include:
•	 maintaining or preparing accounting records and  
financial statements;
•	 the design and implementation of financial information 
systems or financial controls;
•	 secondments to the Group;
•	 recruitment and remuneration related services for key 
management positions;
•	 appraisal, valuation and actuarial services;
•	 tax services which require interpretation of tax law or 
reliance on accounting treatments;
•	 legal services unrelated to the audit.
A full copy of the policy on the provision of non-audit services 
by the external auditor is available on the Company website.
In addition the auditor has been requested not to provide 
services to executive directors or senior executives except 
where approved by the Audit Committee. Non-executive 
directors are required to disclose any relationship they have 
with the auditor. Prior to appointment in July 2012 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP were providing and continued 
to provide during 2014 personal tax advice to the former 
Chief Executive Officer, Mr A M Whitfield, and expatriate tax 
services to the Group’s senior managers who are required 
to work outside their home country. The Committee does 
not consider that the provision of these services creates 
any conflict of interest as they are of a minor nature and are 
provided by individuals and teams who are not involved in 
the audit and accordingly have approved their continuation.
Details of audit and non-audit fees paid to the auditor in 2014 
are set out in note 6 on page 71. Non-audit fees principally 
relate to tax compliance and other tax advisory services and 
related to services which were approved within the terms 
of the Committee’s policy.
Assessment of effectiveness of the external audit
During the year the Committee evaluated the performance, 
independence and effectiveness of the external auditors. 
As part of this process feedback was obtained from head 
office and operating company staff involved with the external 
audit together with the Committee’s meetings with the 
external auditors. The Committee assessed the robustness 
Corporate governance
continued Governance
Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014 29
of the audit, the quality of delivery of the audit against the 
agreed plan and the competence with which the auditors 
handle key accounting and audit adjustments. Considering 
all of these factors the Committee concluded that the 
external auditors were effective.
Re-appointment of the auditor
As a result of an external audit tender process in 2012 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP was appointed in July that 
year. Following the assessment of the effectiveness of the 
external audit referred to above the Committee is pleased to 
recommend the re-appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP at the 2015 Annual General Meeting. The Committee will 
consider its policy on audit tendering during 2015.
Financial reporting and significant judgements
As part of their monitoring of the integrity of the financial 
statements, the Committee reviews whether suitable 
accounting policies have been adopted, whether 
management has made appropriate estimates and 
judgements and also seeks support from the external 
auditors to assess these outcomes.
The main issues reviewed in the year ended 31 December 
2014 are set out below:
•	 Impairment of goodwill and intangibles:
The Group holds £313.5 million of goodwill and acquired 
intangible assets as set out in notes 13 and 14. Annually, 
management performs impairment assessments on these 
balances to ensure there in no evidence of impairment. 
The review is done using management’s specialised 
knowledge of the underlying businesses and the markets 
in which they operate. As part of their audit the external 
auditor reviewed the impairment assessment calculation 
for reasonableness of the growth rate assumptions and 
discount rates used and compared the assumptions with 
related external market data. The Committee reviewed the 
assessments by management and the external auditors 
and considered the related disclosure. 
•	 Provisions for uncertain taxation positions:
Significant judgement is exercised by management, 
with advice from appropriate tax advisors, to arrive at the 
amounts provided for tax as the final tax outcome of 
several transactions is uncertain and may not be known 
for several years. As part of their audit, the external auditor 
reviewed the judgements that had been made, using tax 
specialists as appropriate, and provided the Committee 
with an assessment of the appropriateness of 
management judgements. The Committee reviewed the 
provisions and judgements taken by management and 
also the auditor’s conclusions. 
•	 Defined benefit pension accounting:
The Group operates a number of defined benefit 
schemes which have significant liabilities as outlined in 
note 25 to the Group financial statements. Although the 
UK schemes are closed to future accrual, they are 
sensitive to changes in actuarial assumptions. During their 
audit, the external auditor evaluated the assumptions and 
methodologies used by the Group’s actuarial advisors 
and management and assessed whether the assumptions 
made were appropriate and not materially different from 
external benchmarks. The external auditors reported to 
us that they were satisfied with the assumptions used and 
with the way that the schemes had been accounted for. 
The Committee reviewed the assumptions used by the 
management, methodology and conclusions.
Priorities for 2015
In addition to its routine business the Committee will consider 
the appropriateness of a new chair, the new audit tendering 
requirements, the FRC’s guidance on Risk Management, 
Internal Control and Related Financial and Business 
Reporting, and will work with a new Chief Financial Officer 
to ensure a seamless handover from David Blackwood.
Nomination Committee
Nomination Committee membership since 1 January 2014:
Neil Johnson  Chairman
Jez Maiden 
Brendan Connolly   from 7 August 2014
Adrian Whitfield until 7 August 2014
The Committee is responsible for: the regular review of 
the structure, size and composition of the Board and the 
making of recommendations with regard to any changes; 
leading the process for Board appointments and nominating 
candidates for non-executive positions; and considering 
succession planning.
Until 7 August 2014 the Nomination Committee did not 
comply with the composition requirements of Code Provision 
B.2.1 in that a majority of its members were not independent 
non-executive directors. Following the appointment of 
Brendan Connolly to the Committee and the retirement of 
Adrian Whitfield on 7 August 2014 the Committee has been 
in compliance with this Code Provision. 
The Committee led the process for nominating Calum 
MacLean for appointment as Chief Executive Officer. This 
process involved a thorough review of a range of candidates 
put forward by an independent recruitment consultancy, 
Korn Ferry (with which the Company has no other 
connection) which conducted an extensive search process. 
The diversity (including gender) of the Board was taken into 
account by the Committee when making this nomination. 30 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014
The Committee also reviewed senior management succession 
planning within the Group during the course of the year.
The Nomination Committee held one formal meeting during 
2014 and a number of informal meetings and telephone calls 
as well as several interviews in connection with the 
nomination process referred to above.
The Board adopted a policy on diversity in March 2013. 
This policy seeks to ensure that diversity in its broadest 
sense is taken into account in the process of making 
appointments on merit against objective selection criteria. 
The Committee has put in hand search processes for the 
recruitment of a Chief Financial Officer to succeed David 
Blackwood and of a replacement for Jez Maiden, the chair 
of the Audit Committee and the Senior Independent Director, 
who announced their retirement from the Board on 
18 December 2014 and 26 February 2015 respectively. 
Russell Reynolds Associates, an independent recruitment 
consultancy with no connection to the Company, has 
been appointed to conduct both search processes. 
The Committee will lead the nomination processes in full 
recognition of the need to address the gender diversity  
of the Board.
A copy of the diversity policy is available at  
www.synthomer.com. Further details on the Company’s 
approach to diversity is contained within the Strategic report.
Remuneration Committee
All matters relating to the Remuneration Committee and 
remuneration are covered in the Directors’ remuneration 
report, set out on pages 33 to 45.
Relations with shareholders
Dialogue with institutional investors is conducted on a regular 
basis by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial 
Officer and meetings take place following the announcement 
of interim and full year results and at other times according 
to circumstances.
The Board has adopted a set of shareholder communication 
principles in order to ensure that Board members develop an 
understanding of the views of the Group’s major shareholders. 
These principles require the Chairman to be present with the 
Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer at 
sufficient shareholder presentations and meetings that he fully 
understands the issues and concerns of major shareholders. 
Alternatively the Chairman is also available for meetings with 
major shareholders at their request.
The Chief Executive Officer reports on shareholder relations 
at each Board meeting. Communications with shareholders 
relating to corporate governance matters are conducted by 
the Chairman with the assistance of the Chairmen of the 
Audit and Remuneration Committees. Written reports on all 
meetings between non-executive directors and institutional 
shareholders and their representative bodies are presented 
to the Board at the first opportunity following such meetings 
as is all correspondence with them.
The Senior Independent Director is available to shareholders 
if they have concerns which contact through the normal 
channels of the Chairman or the Chief Executive Officer has 
failed to resolve or for which such contact is inappropriate.
The Board seeks to encourage participation of all 
shareholders, and in particular private investors, at the 
Company’s Annual General Meeting and endeavours to 
ensure all Board members are in attendance. In particular, 
the Chairmen of the Remuneration, Audit and Nomination 
Committees are available to answer questions.
The Company makes use of its website  
www.synthomer.com to communicate with its shareholders 
where it publishes interim and full year results, Company 
announcements, share price and corporate governance 
and other investor information.
Accountability
An explanation of the directors’ responsibility for preparing 
the financial statements, their report that the business is 
a going concern, a responsibility statement and their 
statement as to disclosure of information to the auditor are 
set out on pages 47 to 48 and 49 respectively. Statements 
by the auditor about its reporting responsibilities are set out 
on pages 51 to 55 and 97 to 98 respectively.
A report on the approach to internal control is set out 
below. The directors endeavour to make the Annual Report 
and financial statements as informative and understandable 
as possible.
Risk management and internal control
The Board of Directors has ultimate responsibility for the 
Group’s system of internal control and sets appropriate 
policies to ensure that the Code requirements on internal 
control are met. The system of internal control deployed 
within the Group is designed to reduce the risks of failure 
to meet business objectives, but these risks cannot be 
eliminated. The internal control system adopted can 
therefore only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance 
about meeting such business objectives or against material 
mis-statement or loss.
Corporate governance
continued Governance
Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014 31
The Group’s internal controls over the financial reporting and 
consolidation processes are designed under the supervision 
of the Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the 
preparation and fair presentation of the Group’s published 
financial statements for external reporting purposes in 
accordance with IFRS.
An ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing 
significant business risks faced by the Group has been in 
place since 2000. This has since been built upon so as to 
embed further the process into the businesses and to 
enhance the usefulness of the relevant processes and 
information, and has been operated throughout 2014 and 
up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and 
accounts, and accords with the Financial Reporting Council 
Guidance on internal control.
The system is applied across the Group on a functional and 
regional basis and a ‘bottom up’ risk profile is created by 
evaluating the information at an operational and Group level. 
Individual senior managers within Synthomer’s businesses 
identify and assess key risks associated within their area of 
responsibility based on formal management information 
and interaction with colleagues, customers, suppliers and 
other parties.
The individual submissions are consolidated, reviewed and 
agreed by the Executive Committee. A business risk report 
is prepared that is closely linked to business strategy and 
takes account of key internal and external factors. Risks are 
prioritised using a common risk matrix, which forms the 
basis of a single corporate risk report that is reviewed and 
discussed by the Audit Committee.
The individual business risk reports are formally reviewed 
every six months, out of which a revised report is submitted 
which identifies changes in the risk environment.
The process was last reviewed by the Synthomer Board of 
Directors in February 2015. The nature of the risks identified 
as a result of this process during the year primarily relate to 
matters of an operational and financial nature and the most 
significant of those which faced the Group in 2014 are 
reviewed in the Strategic report.
Risks associated with safety, health and the environment are, 
by the nature of the Group’s business, always of the utmost 
concern and the Corporate Social Responsibility report on 
pages 20 to 23 reviews the Group’s performance in this 
connection in 2014.
The processes which are used by the Board either directly 
or, where appropriate, through the Audit Committee to review 
the effectiveness of the internal control and risk management 
systems (including in relation to the financial reporting process 
and the process for preparing consolidated accounts) include 
the following:
•	 a review of the external audit work plan;
•	 consideration of reports from management and external 
parties, including the internal and external auditor, on the 
system of internal financial control and any material 
control weaknesses;
•	 a quarterly review of safety, health and environmental 
performance; 
•	 discussion with management of the actions taken on any 
possible problem areas for the business identified by 
Board members or in the audit report;
•	 consideration of a consolidated risk management report 
setting out the main conclusions from the internal control 
process; and
•	 a biannual report from the internal audit function.
In addition, the Board:
•	 receives copies of the minutes from all Audit Committee 
meetings;
•	 considers the role of the Group insurance programme;
•	 receives regular written and oral reports from 
management on all aspects of production, operations, 
financial and risk management matters; and
•	 in compliance with Provision C.2.1 of the Combined Code 
the Board regularly reviews and approves the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls.
The Board confirms that a review of the effectiveness of the 
Company’s risk management and internal control systems 
was carried out in 2014.
Environmental matters
The maintenance of high standards of environmental 
(together with health and safety) protection is central to the 
Company’s business. A separate statement on safety, health 
and environmental (SHE) matters has been a feature of the 
Annual Report for a number of years. The Corporate Social 
Responsibility report on pages 20 to 23 includes a report on 
the initiatives the Company has adopted regarding 
sustainable development. 32 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014
Social, community and human rights matters
The Board takes account of social and ethical matters as 
part of its review of internal control which, by virtue of its 
approach to risk identification, covers areas which 
encompass social and ethical matters.
The Board is conscious of its responsibility to the communities 
in which the Group’s businesses operate and encourages 
local engagement by management which includes supporting 
environmental, health and education initiatives.
The Board is also aware of the reputational and legal risks 
associated with social and ethical issues and has a Group-
wide code of business conduct on corruption and anti-
competitive activities, which is available on the Company’s 
website and upon request from the Company Secretary. 
The purpose of this code is to ensure that the Group’s 
employees have a clear understanding of the principles that 
are important in these areas when conducting the Group’s 
business. The application of the code is explained to senior 
management at regular intervals and they are charged with 
its communication throughout their businesses supported 
by internal and external training. A compliance procedure 
involving annual certification by senior management and 
a procedure for maintaining a register of, and where 
appropriate gaining prior approval for, gifts, entertainment 
and corporate hospitality operates throughout the Group. 
A report is made to the Audit Committee annually on the 
code and the Company’s whistleblowing procedure.
The Group’s operating activities are highly regulated in 
all territories and largely carried out in countries that have 
established legislation on human rights issues. As such 
information on human rights issues is not considered to 
be necessary for an understanding of the development, 
performance or position of the Group’s business. The Group 
has nonetheless adopted a policy on equal opportunities, 
diversity and human rights which is available at  
www.synthomer.com.
The Company is a member of the FTSE4Good Index.

Directors’ remuneration report
Remuneration Committee Chairman’s statement 
Dear Shareholder
Directors’ Remuneration Policy
I am pleased to present the Company’s Directors’ remuneration report for the financial year ended 31 December 2014. 
I was delighted to join the Committee in January 2014, assume the role of Chairman in March and follow through on the 
policy work put in place by my predecessor, Neil Johnson, our Board Chairman.
Our new Remuneration Policy and annual report on Remuneration received overwhelming approval at the Company’s 
2014 Annual General Meeting and I would like to thank our shareholders for this support. The policy has been in force 
since 1 May 2014 and following a review toward the end of the year the Committee considers that it remains 
appropriate and therefore no changes are being proposed for shareholder approval in 2015. For convenience the Policy 
principles and a table summarising the main elements of the Policy have been re-produced on pages 34 to 37.
Committee activities during the year
During 2014 the Committee worked closely with the Nomination Committee and the Board in: 
•	 defining the termination arrangements for Adrian Whitfield following his decision to step down as Chief Executive 
Officer in July 2014 and in setting the remuneration terms for Calum MacLean who joined as Chief Executive Officer 
in January 2015.
•	 agreeing terms with David Blackwood for his retirement as Chief Financial Officer which was announced in 
December 2014.
The remuneration arrangements in 2015 for Mr MacLean and Mr Blackwood are set out on page 39 and the 
termination arrangements agreed with Mr Whitfield and Mr Blackwood are set out on page 43.
The Committee also considered the new requirements for the recovery or withholding of variable pay contained in 
the updated UK Corporate Governance Code published in September 2014. As the Committee already has wide 
discretionary powers in relation to the operation of the annual bonus plan it has been decided to implement explicit 
malus and clawback arrangements in that plan from 2015 in line with those already contained in the Company’s 
Performance Share Plan.
The Committee is already giving consideration to future policy changes to be implemented in 2017 when a new vote 
on policy will be required. Accordingly the Committee has decided that in the light of emerging best practice it will 
introduce a two year holding requirement for vested awards under the Performance Share Plan following the three year 
performance period from 2017 onwards.
Out-turns from 2014
For 2015 base salaries have been increased by 2.4% which is in line with the average across the senior 
management population. 
Under the annual bonus plan the Group profit before tax performance of £90.9 million on a constant currency basis 
resulted in 49.1% of the profit before tax element of the 2014 plan being awarded which together with health and safety 
and personal objective performance led to the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer each receiving a 
bonus of 57.3% and 56.8% of their 2014 annual basic salary respectively. Details of the performance targets are set out 
on pages 39 to 40.
The relative total shareholder return and earnings per share conditions attached to the awards made in 2012 under the 
Performance Share Plan were not met and accordingly these awards will lapse in March 2015.
Performance measures linked to strategy
The Board and the Committee seek to align our strategy, namely investing in innovation, driving growth and creating 
excellence (see page 5) to both the Performance Share Plan and the annual bonus plan. Performance Share Plan 
strategic goals include Asian growth and expansion and an increase in revenue from new products reflecting expansion 
in emerging markets and innovation. The Performance Share Plan also includes a cash generation goal from the 
mature European operations which funds both product development and innovation and international growth. Safety, 
health and environmental goals in the annual bonus plan promote excellence in our ways of working. Our strategy is 
intended to deliver value for our shareholders. Accordingly, a significant portion of the long term incentive plan is linked 
to EPS growth (with targets which are stretching but do not encourage undue risk-taking) and TSR performance 
relative to the FTSE 250. The Committee believes therefore that there is good alignment between our strategy and the 
remuneration of the executive directors.  34 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014

Directors’ Remuneration – Policy principles
The key principles for executive directors’ remuneration at Synthomer are as follows:
•	 Sufficient to attract and retain executive directors of the ability and expertise necessary to achieve the strategic goals 
of the Company.
•	 Incentivise executive directors by rewarding performance and driving the right behaviours.
•	 Align executive director reward with the experience of shareholders. 
In setting executive directors’ remuneration, the Committee takes account of pay and conditions throughout the Company. 
The Committee also considers corporate governance requirements and best practice in terms of remuneration structures 
and the process of setting executive remuneration. 
The Committee reviews performance targets regularly to ensure that they do not encourage or motivate inappropriate risk 
taking. Furthermore, the Committee, when necessary, will take into account any environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) events and the Audit Committee’s risk assessment when assessing performance.
The following diagram provides an overview of the key elements of reward for executive directors and the performance 
measures used.

As our Directors’ Remuneration Policy was subject to a binding vote at our 2014 Annual General Meeting and is 
effective for three years from 1 May 2014 it will not be subject to a vote at our 2015 AGM however the annual report 
on Remuneration will be subject to an advisory vote. We hope we will have the support of our shareholders for the

Shareholding 
guidelines
The Company operates shareholding guidelines for executive directors. The current guidelines are detailed 
in the annual report on Remuneration (page 38).
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office (including exercising 
any discretions available to it in connection with such payment) notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy set 
out below where the terms of the payment were agreed (i) before the policy came into effect or (ii) at a time when the relevant 
individual was not a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for 
the individual becoming a director of the Company. For these purposes ‘payments’ includes the Committee satisfying awards 
of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment were ‘agreed’ at the time the 
award is granted. 
Provisions to withhold or recover sums paid under the annual bonus plan will be introduced into that plan in 2015 in line 
with those already contained in the 2011 Performance Share Plan. No other elements of remuneration are subject to 
recovery provisions.
The Committee may make minor amendments to the Policy (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes 
or to take account of a change in legislation) without obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment.

Performance 
share plan
For awards made in 2015, performance will be measured on the same basis as for awards made in 2014 
as follows:
•	 40% based on relative TSR performance versus FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts and financial 
services companies:
 − 25% of this element will vest for median performance.
 − 100% vesting for upper quartile performance. 
 − Vesting on a straight-line basis between these points.
•	 40% based on underlying EPS growth:
 − 25% of this element will vest for EPS growth of 4.5% per annum.
 − 100% vesting for EPS growth of 10% per annum. 
 − Vesting on a straight-line basis between these points. 
 − This target range was set following consideration of the long-term strategy and the outlook for the 
markets in which we operate.
•	 20% based on performance against three equally weighted measures directly linked to the delivery of 
the business strategy: 
 − Proportion of sales from new products, measured over the 5 years to the end of the performance  
period – incentivising greater innovation through new product development.
 − Growth in Asia EBIT – incentivising growing the scale and profitability of operations in 
emerging markets.
 − Cumulative Europe EBITDA – incentivising the delivery of stable cash flows from our more mature 
European business to fund this international growth.
 − For each of these measures, 25% will vest for threshold performance.
 − The targets for these measures, and the level of performance achieved, will be disclosed following 
the end of the performance period.
2015 maximum award opportunity:
•	 C G MacLean: 125% of salary 
•	 D C Blackwood: 110% of salary

Annual bonus
2014 award
For 2014 the Company operated a cash bonus plan for the executive directors related to the achievement of profit before 
tax targets, health & safety targets and individual strategic and operational goals.
The achievement of the profit before tax target represented up to 80% of the maximum bonus opportunity achievable of 
100% of annual basic salary. This was set by reference to the Board approved internal budget for the Group with the 2014 
result adjusted such that it is on a constant currency basis.
The health & safety targets were given a 10% weighting of the maximum achievable with the balance of 10% relating 
to individual strategic and operational goals.
Overall bonuses for the year ended 31 December 2014.

3. Executive directors are required to hold 100% of their annual salary in the Company’s shares. Until this requirement is met no sales of shares that 
vest under long-term incentive plans are permitted other than to satisfy tax liabilities that arise on the exercise of share awards under such plans. The 
Committee considers that unfettered unexercised vested nil-cost awards are economically equivalent to shares and as such that they should count 
(on a net of tax basis) toward compliance with the 100% salary guideline. The Committee will keep the guideline level of share interest under review.
Payments to past directors
No payments were made to past directors during the year.
Arrangements for A M Whitfield and D C Blackwood
A M Whitfield
On 1 July 2014, Adrian Whitfield announced his intention to step down from his role as Chief Executive Officer and director 
of the Company. He agreed to give 12 months’ notice and to continue as Chief Executive Officer to allow sufficient time for 
a replacement to be found and an orderly transition to take place. 
As a result of the appointment of Calum MacLean as Mr Whitfield’s successor on 22 January 2015, Mr Whitfield agreed 
with the Board to step down as Chief Executive Officer, but to remain an employee of the Company until the end of his 
notice period on 30 June 2015. During his notice period, Mr Whitfield continues to be paid in line with the terms of his 
service agreement and is entitled to receive his normal salary, benefits and pension arrangements. 
It was agreed, at the time of his giving notice, that he would receive neither a bonus nor an award under the Performance 
Share Plan in 2015. He remained eligible for a bonus in respect of performance in 2014 as detailed on pages 39 and 40. 
The Remuneration Committee determined that, taking into account the circumstances of the departure, the transition 
between the leadership of the Company and Mr Whitfield’s contribution to the business during his tenure, his unvested 
awards under the Performance Share Plan would continue. In line with the approved policy the awards will be reduced on a 
time-apportioned basis, which will be calculated to 31 March 2015 (i.e. prior to ceasing employment). Awards will be subject 
to the relevant performance conditions which will be measured at the normal time. Vesting of awards will also be subject to 
mitigation, to the extent that Mr Whitfield subsequently takes up employment with a competitor of the Company. 
D C Blackwood
David Blackwood gave notice of his intention to retire from his role as Chief Financial Officer on 18 December 2014, and 
agreed to remain with the Company until 31 December 2015 in order for his successor to be recruited and a handover to  
take place. During 2015, Mr Blackwood will continue to be paid in line with the terms of his service agreement and is entitled 
to receive his normal salary, benefits and pension arrangements. It was agreed that Mr Blackwood would not be required to 
work for six weeks during this period in addition to his normal holiday entitlement.
Mr Blackwood will participate in the 2015 annual bonus scheme and receive an award under the Performance Share Plan 
in 2015. 
On retirement, in line with the approved policy, Mr Blackwood’s unvested awards under the Performance Share Plan will 
continue but will be reduced on a time-apportioned basis calculated to 31 December 2015. Awards will be subject to the 
relevant performance conditions which will be measured at the normal time.

Executive directors are permitted to accept external appointments with the prior approval of the Board provided that there is 
no adverse impact to their role and duties to the Company. Any fees arising from such appointments may be retained by the 
executive directors where the appointment is unrelated to the Group’s business.

1. Brendan Connolly joined the Committee on 23 January 2014 and became Chairman of the Committee on 1 March 2014. 
2. Neil Johnson was Chairman of the Committee until 1 March 2014 on which date he retired from the Committee.
The Committee’s composition was non-compliant with the requirements of Code Provision D.2.1 (i) for some 3 weeks in 
January 2014 when it was comprised of only two Independent non-executive directors and (ii) until 1 March 2014 as the 
chairman of the Board was also chairman of the Committee.
Attendance at Committee meetings is set out on page 26.
Key duties of the Committee
The Committee is responsible for determining, in agreement with the Board, the Company’s policy on executive remuneration 
and the specific remuneration for the chairman and each of the executive directors, including pension rights, within the terms of 
the agreed policy. The Committee is also responsible for reviewing the remuneration of senior executives throughout the Group. 
Advisers
The Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Company Secretary are invited to attend Committee meetings to 
contribute to the Committee in its deliberations. However, no individual is involved in discussions, or is part of any decisions, 
relating to their own remuneration.
The Committee received independent advice from Deloitte LLP who were appointed as the Committee’s independent 
remuneration advisors in April 2013. 
During the year, Deloitte provided advice on new reporting regulations, market data and other remuneration matters that 
materially assisted the Committee. The fees paid to Deloitte in respect of this work were charged on a time and expenses 
basis and totalled £22,900 for advice in 2014. Deloitte also provided tax services to the Company in the year. The Committee 
was satisfied that this did not compromise the independence of the advice received.
Deloitte is a founding member of the Remuneration Consultants Group, and adhere to its code of conduct. Deloitte was 
appointed directly by the Committee, and the Committee is satisfied that the advice received was objective and independent.

of the Company have the benefit of a qualifying third-party 
indemnity provision which provides that they shall be 
indemnified by the Company against certain liabilities as 
permitted by Sections 232 and 234 of the Companies Act 
2006 and against costs incurred by them in relation to any 
liability for which they are indemnified. The Company has 
purchased and maintains insurance against directors’ and 
officers’ liabilities in relation to the Company.
Share capital and control
During 2014 no shares were issued or repurchased. A total of 
70,122 shares were purchased on the open market on behalf 
of the shareholders who elected to participate in the dividend 
reinvestment plan.
The rights and obligations attaching to the Company’s 
ordinary shares, being the only class of issued share capital, 
as well as the powers of the Company’s directors, are set 
out in the Company’s Articles of Association, copies of 
which can be obtained from Companies House or can be 
downloaded from the Company’s website. There are no 
restrictions on the voting rights attaching to the Company’s 
ordinary shares or on the transfer of securities in the 
Company. No person holds securities in the Company 
carrying special rights with regard to the control of the 
Company. The Company is not aware of any agreements 
between holders of securities that may result in restrictions 
on the transfer of securities or on voting rights. Unless 
expressly specified to the contrary in the Articles of 
Association of the Company, the Company’s Articles of 
Association may be amended by special resolution of the 
Company’s shareholders.
Other than in relation to its borrowings which, unless certain 
conditions are satisfied, become repayable on a takeover, 
the Company is not party to any significant agreements that 
would take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control 
following a takeover bid. The Company does not have 
agreements with any director or employee that would provide 
compensation for loss of office or employment resulting from 
a takeover.
All of the Company’s share schemes contain provisions 
relating to a change of control. Outstanding options and 
awards would normally vest and become exercisable on 
a change of control, subject to the satisfaction of any 
performance conditions at that time.

Going concern
The Directors have acknowledged the latest guidance on 
going concern and in reaching their conclusions have taken 
into account factors including:
•	 the refinancing of the Group’s main credit facility in 
July 2014 which involved the putting in place of a new 
£210 million multicurrency revolving loan for a term of 
five years. 
•	 the final repayment under the 2004 series private 
placement notes of US$22 million due in September 2016.
After making enquiries and taking account of reasonably 
possible changes in trading performance, the Directors have 
concluded that the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the Annual Report and accounts.
Cautionary statement
The purpose of this report is to provide information to the 
members of the Company. It contains certain forward-
looking statements with respect to the operations, 
performance and financial condition of the Group. By their 
nature, these statements involve uncertainty since future 
events and circumstances can cause results and 
developments to differ materially from those anticipated. 
The forward-looking statements reflect knowledge and 
information available at the date of preparation of this report 
and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these 
forward-looking statements. Nothing in this report should 
be construed as a profit forecast.

accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company 
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements

responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Other matters

Financial statements, including adoption  
of going concern basis
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
Directors are required to prepare the Group financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected 
to prepare the parent company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable law). Under company law the 
Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the 
Company for that period.
In preparing the parent company financial statements, 
the directors are required to:
•	 select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
•	 make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
•	 state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have 
been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
•	 prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
•	 properly select and apply accounting policies;
•	 present information, including accounting policies, in 
a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable 
and understandable information;
•	 provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable 
users to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s 
financial position and financial performance; and
•	 make an assessment of the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. Financial Statements

Our audit approach
Overview
Materiality •	 Overall Group materiality: £3.8 million which represents 4.5% of underlying profit before tax.
Audit scope •	 We conducted audit work over the complete financial information of the operating companies 
in Germany, Malaysia and the UK together with various head office companies, which were also 
subject to audits of their complete financial information.
•	 The companies within our scope accounted for 82% of the Group’s revenue, 82% of the Group’s 
operating profit and 79% of the Group’s underlying operating profit.
Areas of focus •	 Impairment of goodwill and intangibles
•	 Provisions for uncertain tax positions
•	 Defined benefit pension accounting
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (ISAs (UK and Ireland)).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial
statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant
accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in
all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there
was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and
effort, are identified as ‘areas of focus’ in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these
specific areas in order to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the 
results of our procedures should be read in this context. This is not a complete list of all the risks identified by our audit.
Independent auditor’s report
to the members of Synthomer plc 52 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Impairment of goodwill and intangibles
The Group holds £313.5 million of goodwill and acquired 
intangible assets as set out in notes 13 and 14 to the 
financial statements.
Management identifies the following two cash generating 
units (CGUs) for the purposes of its impairment review, and 
performs separate annual impairment assessments over 
goodwill and intangible asset balances in each:
•	 Europe and North America; and
•	 Asia and Rest of World.
We focused on this area because of the size of the balances 
involved in the context of the Group’s balance sheet and 
the fact that determining whether these assets are impaired 
involves a number of significant judgements. As disclosed 
in note 13 to the financial statements, the principal 
assumptions underpinning management’s impairment 
assessment are:
•	 Annual revenue growth of 2% for Europe and North 
America, and 5% for Asia and Rest of World;
•	 Discount rates of 11% for Europe and North America and 
12% for Asia and Rest of World; and
•	 The sustainability of year 10 profitability into perpetuity.
Our audit work has focused on these key assumptions 
as we regard them as subject to the most judgement and 
as being those assumptions to which the impairment 
assessment is most sensitive.
We evaluated the directors’ future cash flow forecasts, and 
the process by which they were drawn up and tested the 
mathematical accuracy of calculations within the forecasts.
We used our own knowledge and external market data in 
relation to items such as market and country risk premium 
to independently derive a weighted average cost of capital 
for each of the CGUs subject to impairment reviews to 
assess the appropriateness of the discount rates applied 
by management.
We considered the reasonableness of management’s 
growth rate assumptions in the context of the recent 
performance of the business in each of the CGUs and by 
comparison with external market data on growth rates within 
the geographic areas where the CGUs operate.
We performed sensitivity testing on the forecasts, by 
sensitising key assumptions in relation to growth rates and 
discount rates, to assess the extent to which a change in 
any one or more of the key assumptions could indicate the 
risk of an impairment.
We also assessed management’s historic forecasting 
accuracy by comparing the 2014 results with the Group’s 
budget for 2014, considering the implications of this on 
our assessment of the reliability of forecasts for 2015 and 
future years.
Based on the audit evidence obtained we did not identify  
any indicators of impairment relation to goodwill or intangible 
assets held.
Defined benefit pension accounting 
As set out in note 25 on pages 88 to 91 the Group has 
significant defined benefit pension schemes. These primarily 
represent the Yule Catto Group retirement benefits scheme 
in the UK and two unfunded schemes in Germany, which 
account for £147 .4 million of the net pension deficit of 
£150.7 million recorded on the Group balance sheet at 
the year end.
We focused on the pension liabilities in particular, as the 
determination of the amounts reflected in the financial 
statements for defined benefits schemes is impacted to a 
large degree by various assumptions as set out on page 89, 
with the amount being sensitive to relatively small changes 
in a few key assumptions, most notably the discount 
rate applied.
We also had regard to the fact that the Group uses 
third-party actuaries to calculate the amounts to reflect 
in the financial statements in respect of these schemes. 
Our focus was therefore to assess the competency and 
objectivity of management’s experts, the appropriateness of 
the scope of their work for the purposes of our audit and the 
appropriateness of the assumptions used in calculating the 
net pension deficit.
We obtained detailed external actuarial reports of the UK
and German schemes at the year end which set out the
calculations and assumptions underpinning the year end 
pension scheme valuation.
We assessed the competency and objectivity of the 
external actuaries commissioned by the Group to perform 
the year end calculations by considering their technical 
expertise and independence from the Group. We identified 
no concerns over their competency or objectivity.
We read the actuaries’ reports and were satisfied that the 
scope of their work was such that we could use this work 
to provide evidence for the purpose of our audit.
We used our own actuarial knowledge to evaluate all 
the key assumptions used in each of the three schemes 
by comparing these assumptions to our expectations 
for similar schemes as at the year end. We found 
management’s assumptions to be consistent with 
our expectations and within an acceptable range.

Provisions for uncertain tax positions
The Group has a wide geographic footprint and is 
subject to a range of tax laws in a number of different tax 
jurisdictions. In determining the amount to record at the 
year end for tax liabilities there is an element of judgement 
as to what amounts will ultimately be payable for assessed 
tax exposures.
As set out in note 8 at 31 December 2014, the Group 
has recorded current tax liabilities totalling £32.7 million. 
A significant element of this tax liability relates to uncertain 
tax positions.
We focused on this area due to the size of the amounts 
involved and level of judgement needed to determine the 
estimated provisions.
We used our tax knowledge to assess the level of provisions 
held against various tax exposures and to consider their 
appropriateness having regard to the nature of the individual 
exposures and any developments in the year.
As part of this work we inspected correspondence with 
tax authorities and the Group’s tax advisors. We challenged 
the judgements made by assessing individual provisions 
against our expectations of potential exposures, having 
regard to the facts of each case, and where deemed 
necessary, we involved PwC component auditors in the 
relevant overseas territory.
No significant matters arose from this work to suggest 
that the judgements made and amounts recorded 
were inappropriate.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, 
and the industry in which the Group operates.
As set out on page 12 the Group reports its results as two businesses: ‘Europe and North America’ and ‘Asia and Rest  
of World’. The Group financial statements are a consolidation of reporting units, being holding companies, intermediate
holding companies and nineteen operating companies, across thirteen countries. Three countries – the UK, Germany and
Malaysia – account for the majority for the Group’s results. We accordingly focused our work on the six key reporting units
in these countries which were subject to audits of their complete financial information. These components accounted for
82% of the Group’s revenue, 82% of the Group’s operating profit and 79% of the Group’s underlying operating profit. 
In addition to the work at the six key reporting units we performed local statutory audit work in relation to the year ended  
31 December 2014 at a number of other operating companies accounting for a further 14% of the Group’s underlying 
operating profit with these teams reporting to the Group team any unadjusted items in excess of £200,000 from their work 
which was substantially completed as at the date of this opinion.
Where work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit
work at those reporting units to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a
basis for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole. The Group team also attended the closing audit meetings 
in the largest overseas territories.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. 
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent 
of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall group materiality £3.8 million (2013 £4.1 million).
How we determined it 4.5% of underlying profit before tax.
Rationale for benchmark applied We have used underlying profit, being profit before tax adjusted for special items, 
because it is the principal metric against which the Group’s financial performance 
is measured.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £200,000 
(2013 £200,000) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons. 54 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ statement, set out on page 49, in relation to going concern.
We have nothing to report having performed our review.
As noted in the Directors’ statement, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements 
using the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis presumes that the Group has adequate resources 
to remain in operation, and that the directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements 
were signed. As part of our audit we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation  
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs
(UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept
or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it
may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of:
•	 whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed;
•	 the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and
•	 the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming 
our own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary 
to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness 
of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report 2014 (the ‘Annual Report’) to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially 
incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.  
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Synthomer plc for the year ended  
31 December 2014 and on the information in the Directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited.

1 General information
Synthomer plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act. The address of the registered 
office is given on page 24.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
New and amended standards adopted by the Group
The following standards have been adopted by the Group for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after 
1 January 2014 and have a material impact on the Group: 
 
IFRS 12, ‘Disclosures of interests in other entities’, includes the disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other 
entities, including joint arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles and other off balance sheet vehicles. The adoption 
of this standard will have no impact on the primary statements. The only significant impact will be an increase in the disclosure 
relating to the investment in joint ventures.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted 
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 
1 January 2014, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. None of these is expected 
to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group, except the following set out below: 
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ is a converged standard from the IASB and FASB on revenue recognition. 
The standard will improve the financial reporting of revenue and improve comparability of the top line in financial statements 
globally. This new standard is not expected to impact on the accounting of revenue in the Group, however increased 
disclosure requirements are expected.
IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’, this standard replaces the guidance in IAS 39. It includes requirements on the classification 
and measurement of financial assets and liabilities; it also includes an expected credit losses model that replaces the current 
incurred loss impairment model.
This new standard is not expected to impact on the accounting, however an increase in disclosure is expected.
2 Significant accounting policies 
Basis of accounting
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU), IFRIC Interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to 
companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the 
revaluation of financial instruments. As discussed in the Report of the Directors on page 48, the financial statements have 
been prepared on a going concern basis. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the 
Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved where the Company is exposed, or has 
rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power 
over the investee.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from 
the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are 
made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
The results of joint ventures are accounted for using equity accounting.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity 
therein. Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination 
(see below) and the non-controlling interest’s share of changes in equity since the date of combination.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of 
the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recognised 
as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually at the cash generating unit level. Any impairment is recognised 
immediately in the consolidated income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Should the fair value of the identifiable assets exceed the cost of acquisition, a ‘Bargain Purchase’, the excess is credited 
to the income statement immediately on acquisition.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
31 December 2014 Group financial statements
Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014 61
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units expected to benefit 
from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment 
annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the 
cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying 
amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying 
amount of each asset in the unit.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the 
determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts 
subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not 
been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Business combinations 
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each 
acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or 
assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are 
recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 
(2008) are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that: 
•	 deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and 
measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively; and
•	 assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held For Sale 
and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that standard.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination 
occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional 
amounts are adjusted during the measurement period (see below), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect 
new information obtained about facts and circumstance that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have 
affected the amounts as of that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about 
facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held 
investment is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date; any gains or losses from such re-measurment are recognised 
in the income statement.
Acquired intangible assets 
Intangible assets acquired through acquisition are measured at their fair value and are amortised on a straight-line basis over 
their estimated useful lives, on the following bases: 
Customer relationships – between 5 and 8 years 
Technology – 10 years 
Where necessary the fair value at acquisition and estimated useful lives for these intangible assets are based on independent 
valuation reports.
 
Other intangible assets 
Software development resulting in development of a long-term intangible asset are measured initially at cost and are 
amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: 
Software  – between 3 and 5 years  62 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014
2 Significant accounting policies continued
An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s product development is recognised only if all of the following 
conditions in IAS 38 are met: 
•	 an asset is created that can be separately identified (such as software and new processes); 
•	 it is technically feasible to complete the asset; 
•	 management intends to complete the development; 
•	 there is an ability to use or sell the asset once development has been completed; 
•	 it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits; 
•	 adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development are available; and 
•	 the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
No research or development costs met the criteria for required capitalisation under IAS 38 during the year.
Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense 
in the period in which it is incurred.
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost (original purchase price and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its 
working condition for its intended use), net of accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment. Except for freehold 
land and land grants in Malaysia, which are not depreciated, the cost of property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a 
straight-line basis over its expected useful life as follows: 
Freehold buildings   – 50 years 
Leasehold land and buildings  – the lesser of 50 years and the period of the lease 
Plant and equipment   – between 3 and 10 years 
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets excluding goodwill 
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its plant, property and equipment and intangible 
assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication 
exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where 
the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount 
of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments 
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not 
been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an 
expense immediately.
When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased 
to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years. A reversal of an impairment 
loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Operating leases 
Operating lease payments are expensed on a straight-line basis to the income statement over the term of the relevant lease. 
Any benefits received as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term.
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, 
direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and 
condition. Cost is calculated using the weighted average method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price 
less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Provision is made for 
obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where appropriate.
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party  
to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014 63
Loans and receivables 
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest rate method. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or 
loss where there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
All trade receivables that are factored by third parties are done so on a non-recourse basis. At the point of factoring, the 
Group forfeits the right to future cash flows from these receivables and those amounts are derecognised. The cost of 
factoring receivables is recognised as a finance cost in the period in which the receivable is factored.
Amortised costs 
Bank borrowings 
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, 
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to 
the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the 
extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables 
Trade payables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method.
Derivative financial instruments 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risk and interest rate movements. 
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written 
principles on the use of financial derivatives, as set out in note 22.
Impairment of financial assets 
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its financial assets to determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the 
asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any).
Finance costs 
Finance costs of debt are recognised in the income statement over the term of such instruments at an effective interest rate 
on the carrying amount. Finance costs that are directly attributable to the construction of property, plant and equipment are 
capitalised as part of the cost of those assets in accordance with IAS 23.
Foreign currencies 
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional 
currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, 
monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the 
balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in 
terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts and options (see 
below for details of the Group’s accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments).
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing 
on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless 
exchange rates fluctuate significantly. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the 
Group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which 
the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the 
foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. The Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising 
on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs as sterling-denominated assets and liabilities.
Derivative financial instruments 
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange 
rate risk, including foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and foreign currency options. 64 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014
2 Significant accounting policies continued
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date. A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial 
asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a financial liability. The resulting gain or loss is 
recognised in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which 
event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. The Group designates 
certain derivatives as either hedges of highly probable forecast transactions or hedges of foreign currency risk of firm 
commitments (cash flow hedges), or hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
Hedge accounting 
The Group designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives, embedded derivatives and non-derivatives 
in respect of foreign currency risk, as either cash flow hedges, or hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the 
hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. 
Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument 
that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item.
Cash flow hedges 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are 
deferred in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the consolidated 
income statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss, in 
the same line of the income statement as the recognised hedged item. However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged 
results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity 
are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is 
sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at 
that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When 
a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations 
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the 
hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity in the foreign currency translation 
reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss, and is included in the 
‘other gains and losses’ line of the income statement.
 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, restricted cash balances which become 
fully liquid within three months or less and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months 
or less.
 
Taxation 
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the 
consolidated income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years 
and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax 
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is 
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be 
available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, 
and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is 
probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
continued Group financial statements
Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014 65
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset 
is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited 
directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the 
same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the 
balances on a net basis.
Retirement benefit costs 
The costs of defined benefit contributions to the Group’s pension schemes and of augmenting existing pensions are charged 
to the consolidated income statement on a systematic basis over the expected period of benefits from employees’ service.
 
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Actuarial gains on the defined benefit schemes are recognised in full in each period in which they occur. They are recognised 
outside of the consolidated income statement and are presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
 
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined 
benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is 
calculated annually using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined 
by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated 
in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related 
pension obligation.
 
The UK defined benefit scheme is funded, with the assets of the scheme held separately from those of the Group, in separate 
trustee-administered funds.
For the German schemes, the assets are included within the assets of the respective companies, as permitted under local 
laws. The assets of the other overseas schemes are held separately from those of the Group.
Provisions 
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has 
been communicated to affected parties.
Revenue recognition 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for 
goods provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed, where delivery is defined in accordance with 
Incoterms 2010.
Share-based payments 
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are 
measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based 
payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The Group will on occasion, at its own discretion, 
settle the share-based payments in cash rather than equity.

Critical judgements in applying accounting policies 
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (see below), that the Group has made 
in the process of applying the accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised 
in the financial statements.
 
Recognition of deferred tax assets 
The Group activities give rise to significant potential deferred tax assets, particularly in respect of the UK pension liability, 
tax losses and accelerated capital allowances. Determination of whether these assets should be recognised requires a high 
degree of management judgement and is dependent on management’s ability to project future earnings from activities that 
may apply loss positions carried forward against future income taxes.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on 
historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the result of which 
form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other 
sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis taking the current and expected future market conditions into consideration.
Impairment/reversal of impairment 
The Group has significant investments in property, plant and equipment, acquired intangibles and goodwill. Changes in the 
circumstances or expectations of future performance of an individual asset may be an indicator that the asset is impaired 
requiring the book value to be written down to its recoverable amount. Impairments, excluding goodwill, are reversed if the 
conditions for impairment are no longer present. Evaluating whether an asset is impaired or if an impairment should be 
reversed requires a high degree of judgement and may depend to a large extent on the selection of key assumptions about 
the future.
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which 
goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to 
arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. The growth rates used 
within the forecast future cash flows are developed with reference to external sources but are subject to estimation 
uncertainty. See note 13 for more details.
Post retirement benefit obligations 
Included in the actuaries’ calculation of the post retirement benefit obligations are a number of assumptions. Any changes 
in these assumptions will impact the carrying value of the obligations. These are shown in detail in note 25.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
continued Group financial statements
Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014 67
Current tax liability and deferred tax 
The Group annually incurs significant amounts of income taxes payable to various jurisdictions around the world, 
and it also recognises significant changes in deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, all of which are based on 
management’s interpretations of applicable laws, regulations and relevant court decisions. The quality of these estimates 
is highly dependent upon management’s ability to properly apply what can be very complex sets of rules and to recognise 
changes in applicable rules.

earnings of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures. As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is 
expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities (prior to offset) are shown below.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment at the balance sheet date, or more frequently if there are indications that 
goodwill might be impaired.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the Cash Generating Units (CGUs) that are 
expected to benefit from that business combination.

The recoverable amounts for CGUs are determined from value in use calculations, based upon discounted cash flows. The 
key assumptions for those discounted cash flow calculations are the discount rate, profitability and growth rate. The discount 
rate is based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital adjusted, where appropriate, for the risk premium attributable 
to the particular CGU’s activities and geography of operation. Profitability and growth rates are based on past experience 
combined with management’s expectations for future business performance, which is informed by a number of factors 
including economic growth, internal plans and competitor and customer activity.
Discount rates of 11% (2013 11%) and 12% (2013 12%) have been used in the above calculations for Europe and North 
America and Asia and Rest of World respectively.
The profit used in the cash flows for the first year is derived from management forecasts; for years 2 to 10 a growth rate is 
applied. The profit for year 10 is then assumed to apply without further growth into perpetuity. Growth rates of 2% (2013 2%) 
and 5% (2013 5%) have been used for Europe and North America and Asia and Rest of World respectively, representing 
management’s best estimate of each CGU’s circumstances, and these do not exceed the long-term growth rates for the 
markets concerned.
There is no reasonably possible change in key assumptions that would lead to an impairment.
Of the net book value of goodwill at 31 December 2014, £70.5 million (2013 £70.5 million) is located in the UK. 76 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014

The cost of inventory recognised as an expense and included in cost of sales amounted to £712.0 million (2013 £763.7 million).
There is no material difference between the balance sheet value of inventories and their net realisable value.
The nature of the chemical reaction necessary to produce finished goods from raw materials is such that ‘work in progress’ 
is not a material part of the Group’s inventory at any given point of time.

Credit risk
Amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s 
management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment. The Group has 
no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
Before accepting a new customer, the Group uses appropriate procedures to assess the potential customer’s credit quality 
in order to set a credit limit.

The special item fair value adjustment represents the revaluation of US dollar loan notes from the rate of the related cross 
currency swaps to the year end rate, together with the transitional adjustment required to reflect movements in fair value 
caused by variations in interest rates, and subsequent amortisation thereof, to the extent that these constituted effective 
hedges prior to the adoption of IFRS.
Cash and cash equivalents are deposited with financial institutions with a credit rating of A or higher.
22 Financial instruments
The Group’s treasury function operates procedures designed to reduce or eliminate financial risk and ensure that funds 
are available for current and future needs. The policies are approved by the Board and the use of financial instruments 
is strictly controlled. 
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while 
maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of 
the Group consists of debt, which includes the cash and borrowings disclosed in note 21, and equity attributable to equity 
holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings. It is management’s intention to maintain 
the underlying net borrowings to EBITDA metric to between one and two times:

Fair values have been obtained from the relevant institutions where appropriate. Where market values are not available, fair values 
of financial assets and financial liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flow at prevailing interest 
rates and by applying year end exchange rates. The carrying amount of short-term borrowings approximates to book value.
The fair value of the Group’s financial instruments are measured using inputs other than quoted prices that are directly or 
indirectly observable. Level 2 as defined by IFRS 13.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are market risk and liquidity risk. The Board reviews and agrees 
policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below, together with related disclosure required by IFRS. 
Market risk
The Group’s main exposure to market risk is in the form of interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The policies adopted 
to address these risks are as follows:
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, loan notes and bank borrowings. The Group borrows 
at both fixed and floating rates of interest and uses interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest profile in order to 
manage the Group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Foreign currency risk
The Group uses currency borrowings, forward contracts and currency swaps to hedge overseas net assets, which are 
predominantly denominated in Euros. Profit translation exposures are not hedged.
 
The Group hedges currency transaction exposures at the point of confirmed order, using forward foreign exchange contracts. 
The Group’s policy is, where practicable, to hedge all exposures on monetary assets and liabilities. Consequently, there are 
no material currency exposures to disclose (2013 none).
Impact on income statement
Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts amounting to £0.8 million have been debited to the income statement in the 
year (2013 debit of £1.2 million). These changes are shown separately as a special item in the consolidated income statement.
Hedge accounting
The Group has a number of cross currency swaps that are used to reduce the exposure to interest rate and currency risk.
These swaps are fully effective at eliminating the risks they address. The Group has reviewed the requirements necessary 
to permit the application of hedge accounting under IAS 39. It has concluded that the costs involved in meeting these 
requirements cannot be justified and therefore IAS 39 hedge accounting will not be applied.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments to which hedge accounting is not applied are recognised in 
the income statement as they arise.
In addition, the Group has taken out forward foreign exchange contracts to fix the sterling value of its net investments in 
certain foreign operations, which have a Euro functional currency. These contracts, together with €160.0 million drawn on 
the multicurrency term loan facility have been accounted for as net investment hedges as permitted by IAS 39.

The interest rate sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and 
non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount 
of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
The foreign currency sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts 
their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates. The sensitivity analysis includes external loans 
as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the 
functional currency of the lender or borrower.
Liquidity risk
The objective of the Group is to meet financial commitments as and when they fall due. The Board closely monitors liquidity 
through monthly management accounts.
At the year end, Synthomer plc had the following principal facilities:
•	 A new five year, £210 million committed revolving credit facility. This facility replaced the Group’s main debt facility which 
comprised of a €178 million term loan combined with the undrawn £60 million revolving credit line maturing March 2015. 
Both the introduction and cancellation of the respective facilities took place at the end of July 2014.
•	 Unsecured loan notes totalling approximately £14.1 million raised from the US private placement market in 2004 with 
a maturity date of September 2016. $70.0 million of private placements was repaid in September 2014. Please see

UK pension schemes
The Group’s UK defined benefit scheme was closed to future accrual in 2009. All pension benefits since that time are 
provided by way of a defined contribution scheme.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the companies concerned.
Defined benefit scheme
The defined benefit scheme is administered by a separate fund that is legally separated from the Company.
The trustees of the pension fund are required by law to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the 
scheme. The trustees of the pension are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 6 April 2012 and updated to 31 December 2014 by a qualified actuary.
The Group has agreed that it will aim to eliminate the pension plan deficit over the next seven years.
The scheme is exposed to a number of risks the most significant of which are detailed below:
Asset return risk  The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond 
yields; if plan assets underperform this yield, this will increase the deficit. The scheme holds 
a significant proportion of equities which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the 
long-term while providing volatility and risk in the short-term.
Interest rate risk  A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially 
offset by an increase in the value of the plans’ bond holdings.
Longevity risk  The majority of the plans’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so 
increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans’ liabilities. 
The risk relating to benefits to be paid to the dependants of scheme members (widow and orphan benefits) is re-insured 
by an external insurance company.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
continued Group financial statements
Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014 89
The major assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were as follows:
2014 2013
Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.00% 3.30%
Rate of increase in pensions in deferment 2.00% 2.30%
Discount rate 3.65% 4.55%
Inflation assumption 3.00% 3.30%
Assumptions regarding future mortality are based on actuarial advice in accordance with published statistics. 
These assumptions translate into an average life expectancy in years for a pensioner retiring at 65 as follows:
2014 2013
Retiring today:
Males 87.5 87.5
Females 90.0 89.9
Retiring in 20 years:
Males 89.3 89.2
Females 92.0 91.9
Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate and mortality. 
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the assumptions occurring 
at the end of the reporting period assuming that all other assumptions are held constant:
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities
Discount rate Increase/decrease by 1% Decrease/increase by £54 million
Rate of mortality Increase by 1 year Increase by £12 million
The above sensitivities are based on a change of assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is 
unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may have some correlation. When calculating the sensitivity of the 
defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation 
calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the 
pension liability recognised within the balance sheet.

Contributions from the sponsoring companies are expected to be £10.3 million in 2015.
Overseas pension schemes
The Group operates a number of smaller overseas pension and post-retirement schemes. The assets of these schemes 
are held separately from those of the Group, with the exception of the unfunded German schemes (net liability £66.2 million, 
2013 £51.3 million), where in line with common practice, the assets are held within the respective companies.
Defined benefit schemes
The aggregated pension disclosure below for the overseas defined benefit schemes has been compiled from a number 
of actuarial valuations at 31 December 2014.
The largest of these schemes accounts for £45.4 million (2013 £38.3 million) of the deficit at 31 December 2014. The major 
assumptions used in the actuarial valuation of this scheme are:
2014 2013
Rate of increase in salaries 3.00% 3.00%
Rate of increase in pensions 2.00% 2.00%
Discount rate 2.20% 3.80%
Mortality assumptions
Investigations have been carried out within the past three years into the mortality experience of the Group’s defined benefit 
scheme. These investigations concluded that the current mortality assumptions include sufficient allowance for future 
improvements in mortality rates. The assumed life expectations on retirement at age 65 are:
2014 2013
Retiring today:
Males 83.9 83.7
Females 87.9 87.8
Retiring in 20 years:
Males 86.5 86.4
Females 90.5 90.3
The major assumption used in the valuation of the other overseas schemes do not differ significantly from the above.

The Group underwent a significant restructuring following the acquisition of PolymerLatex in 2011. The cost of these 
restructuring programs is charged to special items in the income statement when permitted by IAS 37. The provision reflects 
the amount that has been charged but not yet spent.
Liability arising on a business combination
As part of the acquisition of PolymerLatex in 2011, the Group acquired a leasehold interest in an empty property. The provision 
reflects this onerous contract.

The Group has held 50% of the issued share capital of Eka Synthomer Oy since 1 April 2011 and has accounted for this 
investment as a joint venture. On 22 October 2014, the Group acquired the other 50% of the share capital thereby obtaining 
control. As required by IFRS 3, this transaction is accounted for as the deemed disposal of the 50% joint venture followed by 
the immediate acquisition of a 100% subsidiary.
Eka Synthomer Oy is a Finnish company with a plant in Oulu, Finland, where it manufactures styrene butadiene latex for sale 
to the paper and board industries with customers mainly in the Nordic region.
The amounts recognised in respect of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed (100%) are summarised as follows:
£m
Intangible assets – customer relationships 2.1 
Property, plant and equipment 6.5 
Inventories 3.7 
Trade and other receivables 11.6 
Trade and other payables (8.2)
Cash and cash equivalents –
Current borrowings – factoring with recourse (4.7)
Current tax liability –
Deferred tax liability (0.8)
Total identifiable net assets 10.2 
The fair value of the identifiable net assets was reviewed and was agreed to be consistent with the book values used for the 
equity accounting of the 50% joint venture immediately prior to acquisition. 94 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014

Excess of net assets acquired over consideration paid – ‘Bargain Purchase’ (1.2)
The ‘Bargain Purchase’ reflects the fact that the vendor was prepared to accept a consideration below fair value to ensure the 
quick disposal of an unwanted investment to avoid complicating a much larger transaction with another third party.

Acquisition related costs of £0.1 million have been charged to operating profit in the special items column of the consolidated 
income statement, see note 3.
The revenue included in the consolidated income statement since 22 October 2014 was £15.8 million. The increase in holding 
from 50% to 100% contributed an additional operating profit of £0.5 million over the same period.

Yule Catto Employee Benefit Trust
The Company established a trust, the Yule Catto Employee Benefit Trust, on 17 July 1996 to distribute shares to employees 
enabling the obligations under the Yule Catto Longer-Term Performance Share Plan and the Yule Catto Longer-Term Deferred 
Bonus Plan to be met. The Trust is managed by the RBC Trustees (Guernsey) Limited, an independent company located 
in Guernsey.
At 31 December 2014, the Trust held 82,425 (2013 331,502) ordinary shares in the Company with a market value of 
£0.2 million (2013 £0.8 million).
The dividends on these shares have been waived. All of the shares are under option. Costs are amortised over the life 
of the plans.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise was £2.62 (2013 £2.07).
The weighted average fair value of the options at the measurement date granted during the period was £0.32 (2013 £0.47). 
The valuation was based on the following inputs and assumptions:
2014 2013
Weighted average share price (£) 2.65 1.87
Option price (£) – –
Value of optionality nil nil
Vesting assumption 12% 25%
Given the option price is £nil, the only circumstance in which a vested option will not be exercised is if the current share price 
is £nil. There is some value associated with the timing of when the exercise would be made but this is considered to be 
minimal and therefore this has not been modelled.
The vesting assumption is the estimate at the measurement date of the percentage of the options that will ultimately vest and 
is based on management’s assessment of the likelihood of achievement of the performance criteria.
35 Share price information
The middle market value of the listed ordinary shares at 31 December 2014 was 237.0 pence. During the year, the market 
price ranged between 189.1 pence and 291.6 pence. The latest ordinary share price is available on the Financial Times 
Cityline service, telephone 09058 171690.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation  
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs 
(UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance 
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept 
or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it 
may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:
•	 whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed;
•	 the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and
•	 the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our
own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to 
provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, 
substantive procedures or a combination of both.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report 2014 (the ‘Annual Report’) to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially 
incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Synthomer plc for the year ended 31 December 2014.

1 Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and 
the preceding year.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a Cash Flow Statement under the terms of FRS 1 
‘Cash Flow Statement’. The cash flows of the Company are included in the Synthomer plc group financial statements.
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis under the historical cost convention as modified by 
the revaluation of certain fixed assets, and comply with applicable UK accounting standards and the Companies Act 2006.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction or, if hedged, at the 
forward contract rate. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported 
at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date or, if appropriate, at the forward contract rate.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost or valuation, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment. Cost includes the 
original purchase price of the asset plus the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended 
use. Except for freehold land, which is not depreciated, the cost or valuation of tangible fixed assets is depreciated on a 
straight-line basis over their expected useful lives as follows:
Freehold buildings  – 50 years
Leasehold land and buildings – the lesser of 50 years and the period of the lease
Plant and equipment  – between 3 and 10 years
Revaluation of properties
Where depreciation charges are increased following a revaluation, an amount equal to the increase is transferred annually 
from the revaluation reserve to the profit and loss account as a movement on reserves. On the disposal or recognition of a 
provision for impairment of a revalued fixed asset, any related balance remaining in the revaluation reserve is also transferred 
to the profit and loss account as a movement on reserves.
Investments
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Intercompany
Intercompany balances are shown gross unless a right of set off exists.
Borrowings
Borrowings are initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using 
the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date 
where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future 
have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the Company’s taxable profits and its 
results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods 
different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, 
it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the 
underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are 
expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.  
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Notes to the Company financial statements
31 December 2014 Company financial statements
Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014 101
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) are recognised on the Company balance sheet 
when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade debtors
Trade debtors do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for 
estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, 
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis 
to the profit and loss account using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument 
to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade creditors
Trade creditors are not interest-bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments
The Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate 
risk, including cross currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts. The Company does not hold 
or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date. A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial 
asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a financial liability. The resulting gain or loss is 
recognised in the profit and loss account immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging 
instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the profit and loss account depends on the nature of the hedge 
relationship. The Company designates certain derivatives as fair value hedges.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written 
principles on the use of financial derivatives.
Fair value hedge accounting
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the profit and loss 
account, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. 
The Company only applies fair value hedge accounting for foreign currency exposure associated with the underlying hedged 
item. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is also recognised in the profit and loss account.
Net borrowings
Net borrowings represents cash and cash equivalents together with short and long-term borrowings, as adjusted for the 
effect of related derivative instruments irrespective of whether they qualify for hedge accounting.
Pension funding
In accordance with FRS 17 , the Company accounts for its contributions to the defined benefit scheme as if it were a defined 
contribution scheme because it is not an employer making the pension payments.
The UK defined benefit scheme is funded, with the assets of the scheme held separately from those of the Group, in separate 
trustee-administered funds.
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.

The Company has designated its Euro denominated £140 million (2013 £150 million) multicurrency revolving credit facility 
of ¤160.0 million (2013 ¤177.8 million) (see note 8) and a forward contract of ¤40.0 million (2013 nil) as a FRS 26 fair value 
hedge against the designated Euro portion of its investment in Ennismore Limited of ¤200.0 million (2013 €177.8 million). 
Under FRS 26, the hedged portion of this investment is re-translated at the year end spot rate with the resulting gain or loss 
being taken to the profit and loss account, where it is fully offset by the exchange gain or loss resulting from the re-translation 
of the revolving credit facility and the forward contract at the same date.
Directors consider the value of investments to be supported by underlying assets.

Coal was used to generate 
34.7% 
of the UK’s electricity in 2003.
ATH Resources plc is one of
the largest producers of coal
in the UK and produced
1.3
million
tonnes
in the period to
26 September 2004. ATH Resources plc Annual report and financial statements 2004 1
ATH Resources plc (“ATH”) is an operator of
opencast coal mines and is currently the third
largest producer of coal in the UK. Through its
two operational sites situated in East Ayrshire
in Scotland, ATH provides coal principally to the
electricity supply industry and also the industrial
and house coal markets.
Throughout the development and mining process,
ATH focuses on the restoration and rehabilitation
of the sites and land is returned to various uses
including agriculture, forestry, nature conservation
and other forms of development.
ATH Resources plc became a public company
in June 2004 when the Company was listed on
AIM. The Company intends to grow organically,
particularly in Scotland where the Company’s UK
operations are presently concentrated. It will also
pursue suitable complementary acquisitions which
meet strict, pre determined criteria.
Highlights
• November 2003: Purchase of Garleffan opencast coal site.
• June 2004: Successful fund raising and listing on AIM.
•August 2004: Disposal of part (18 acres) of a former opencast
coal site in Scotland for house building.
•September 2004: Appointment of Michel Guy as Director of
SRMMC, the Company’s French opencast mining subsidiary.
• September 2004: New sales contract signed with Drax Power
for the supply of 250,000 tonnes of coal from a further
extension at Skares Road.
 Chairman’s statement
2 ATH Resources plc Annual report and financial statements 2004
This year has seen a massive step change 
in both the size of the Group and its public
profile. Commencing operations in 1998 as
a one site, venture capital backed, opencast
coal mine with ambitions then limited to the
successful development of the Skares Road
site, it is particularly pleasing to report on a
year that has seen the continuing profitable
operation of the Group’s original mine, the
doubling of the Group’s operations through
the acquisition from LAW Mining of a second
site at Garleffan and the successful listing on
the Alternative Investment Market (“AIM”).
Taken individually, any one of these events
could be judged as constituting a successful
year. To have achieved all three demonstrates
not only ATH’s ambition to become a major
player in the UK coal mining industry, but
also the ability of a young and committed
management team to deliver complex and
strategically demanding targets.
Business progress
Profitability, after allowing for all of the
exceptional costs associated with the
acquisition and the float, is in line with the
Board’s expectations and plans are in place
to further improve performance in the coming
year. Extensions are planned at both of the
Group’s existing sites and new planning
applications will shortly be made to extend
ATH’s operations to other parts of Scotland.
In France, progress continues to be made
towards developing new opencast sites which
will provide coal for French coal consumers.
Board changes
During the year the Board has been strengthened
by the addition of two Non-executive Directors.
Vaughan Williams, recently retired from BHP
Billiton, is widely experienced in the coal
industry and brings industry knowledge and
considerable management experience to the
Board. Ivana Slade, an Executive with Alchemy
Partners, is widely experienced in all aspects of
M&A and fund raising. These two appointments
ensure that the Board has all the skills necessary
to take it forward. 
In France the Group is particularly pleased to
have secured the services of Michel Guy as a
Director of its French subsidiary. Michel has
a coal importation business in France and is
well placed to ensure that the output from the
two French mines will have a smooth path
to market.
Strategy
There is no doubt that the coal industry,
which currently is responsible for producing
some 35% of this country’s electricity, faces
some significant political and fiscal challenges.
Whilst the country has failed to evolve a credible
and balanced long-term energy policy, the
demand for electricity continues to increase and
the older nuclear power stations are reaching the
end of their useful lives. Current policy places too
much reliance upon renewables, imported gas
from Russia and Liquified Natural Gas from the
Middle East and South America. This means that
coal will continue to have to play a significant part
in this country’s electricity generation.
ATH’s strategy will be to maintain a relatively
small but stable share of that market. Its low
cost of operation and its access to low sulphur
Scottish coal should ensure the success of
that strategy. There also remains a significant
market for domestic fuel in which ATH is already
established as a major supplier and in which
it will continue to operate. 
Worldwide demand for coal continues to rise
with the economic growth of China and this,
together with high freight costs, means that the
selling price for coal will remain high for the
foreseeable future. The vast majority of ATH’s
sales contracts are at selling prices significantly
below current market levels, therefore revenues
should increase as these contracts are renewed.
Against this, the high cost of oil has significantly
increased the Group’s operating costs as it is
a major consumer of gas oil. 
The listing of ATH on AIM has strategically
placed the Group to take advantage of the
many opportunities that will become available
in the near future, and the Board looks forward
to reporting on further developments in the
coming year.
David Port
Non-executive Chairman
“It is with great pleasure that I present the first
annual report of the Group following its listing
and am pleased to be able to report on a
momentous and yet profitable period of
enlargement and development.”
 ATH Resources plc Annual report and financial statements 2004 3
This financial period has been the most eventful
in the Group’s development. It has seen two
major structural changes to the Group. First,
the acquisition of the Garleffan opencast coal
site from LAW Mining Ltd on 28 November 2003,
assisted by new funding from Alchemy Partners
and Bank of Scotland, effectively doubling
the size of the Group. Second, the listing of
the Group on AIM on 11 June 2004 has
positioned the Group exceptionally well for
future development.
Operational review
The Skares Road mine has performed very well
through the period. Coal production has been
scaled back, during the second half, as the
mine switched operational areas into higher
stripping ratios. The mine produced and sold
800,000 tonnes of coal and its products
continued to perform strongly in the household
and industrial coal markets.
Following its acquisition, the Garleffan mine
was subject to a turnaround through the year.
The mine required deepening, in order that the
reserve was maximised and the excavation
cuts needed to be realigned for efficient
operation. This process has been completed
along with the reorganisation and relocation
of many of the coal preparation and support
services areas. In addition, this mine has
benefited from significant investment in new
overburden excavation and transportation
equipment and is now set to operate to its
maximum efficiency for the remainder of its life.
Despite these major changes to the operations, 
the mine produced 640,000 tonnes of coal
over the ten month period of ATH control.
In addition, in August, the Group successfully
concluded the disposal of a parcel of its
development land at Hannahston in Ayrshire,
for which planning permission for 36 houses
had been granted on a restored opencast site.
Development projects
The development of new business opportunities
has received constant attention since the listing.
In Fife, the Muir Dean project, is moving towards
a planning application with terms agreed on
the final major land parcel. Two other Ayrshire
sites are also being prepared for planning
application early in 2005. These developments
will see planning permission being sought
for more than three million tonnes this winter.
Additionally, prospecting is ongoing at other
new projects in Scotland in advance of further
applications for planning permission.
The Société des Ressources Minières du
Massif Central (“SRMMC”) projects are also
developing steadily, with an application for
a mining permit for the Commentry project
progressing through the planning system and
the transfer of the Bertholene Concession
completed. During this coming winter, both
sites will have exploration works; Commentry
for quality analysis and Bertholene for scheme
design. Both projects will also be the subject
of environmental assessments as part of the
application process and it is planned to have
both mines available for commencement in 
2006, although only one at a time will be brought
into production.
Market
The market for coal in the UK remains buoyant.
International coal prices remain very high on the
back of worldwide growth in demand driven by
China and the Far East. Infrastructure limitations
will slow any pricing falls as production tries to
catch up with demand. Consequently, as we
renew coal sales contracts from 2006 we expect
to see some uplift in pricing to the benefit of
the business.
Finally, this has been an extraordinary year for
our business, which has only been made
possible by the commitment and dedication
of the employees over several years and in
particular the last twelve months. I would like
to thank each of them for their support and
effort that has collectively developed this
business to the strong position it now holds.
Thomas Allchurch
Chief Executive
Chief executive’s statement
“Coal mining still plays a vital part in the economy
of the UK through the generation of a third of our
electricity, without which the lights would go out
this winter. On a local scale the well paid jobs
and investment that the industry brings to the
former deep mining towns in Ayrshire, is welcomed
by all concerned.”
 4 ATH Resources plc Annual report and financial statements 2004
Turnover
Turnover for the period was £31.4m on sales of
1.3 million tonnes, with an average price of £24
per tonne. Sales by product comprised:
T’m £’m
Electricity Supply Industry (“ESI”) 1.1 25.2
Domestic 0.1 3.4
Industrial 0.1 2.8
Total 1.3 31.4
ESI customers supplied in the period were E.On,
Drax Power, EDF Energy and British Energy.
With the increase in world coal prices, which
have risen by over 40% during the last year, 
the Group will be able to capitalise on improved
domestic and industrial prices this winter and
as the Group’s portfolio of ESI contracts come
up for renewal over the coming years.
Profit before interest and tax
Profit before interest and tax was £1.4m.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortisation was £6.4m reflecting the
high upfront costs of acquiring mining assets
and the capital intensive nature of operating
the business.
Overall, this is considered a satisfactory result
as the Skares Road site has performed in line
with expectations and the Group’s Garleffan
site has been substantially improved. Following
the purchase of Garleffan the plant fleet has
been renewed and the site re-engineered.
This turnaround is now complete and the site
is now operating efficiently.
The cost of gas oil, which accounts for some
10% of direct costs, has risen recently in
response to the well publicised rise in crude
oil prices. As the majority of sales are at
formulated prices, there is limited opportunity
to pass through this increase to our customers.
The Group is investigating mechanisms,
both financially and operationally, to manage
this short-term cost increase as we currently
believe that over the coming financial year oil
prices will return to around $35 per barrel.
Interest
Interest charges of £1.1m were incurred in the
period. Of these charges £0.5m were in respect
of the repayment of loan stock interest and
will not be incurred again. Following the listing,
the Group has been cash positive and so
the main ongoing interest charge will be in
respect of finance leases and hire purchase
contracts and the unwinding of the discount
on the restoration provision, which is not a
cash flow item.
The Group manages its exposure to interest
rates by acquiring plant and machinery on
fixed rate hire purchase agreements.
Financial review
“Trading for the period was in line with the Directors’
expectations at the time of the listing on AIM, which
raised some £11.5m after costs, and has enabled
the balance sheet to be de-geared, leaving the
Group cash positive in order that it may pursue
its development programme.”
Summary of the Financial Review
• Turnover: £31.4m
• Earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortisation: £6.4m
• Profit before interest and tax: £1.4m
• Final dividend: £1.0m (3.36p per share)
• Earnings per share: 0.44p
 The RH120 excavator is the workhorse of the
opencast coal industry. This 265 tonne machine is
capable of moving 15m
3
of overburden in each
bucket, loading 100 tonne dump trucks in four
passes. The Group operates seven of these
machines together with a fleet of 30 large dump
trucks all supported by the manufacturer under
repair and maintenance contract to ensure
maximum availability.
Coal for power station customers is blended on
site from the different coal seams to meet strict
contract specifications. Quality control is ensured
by a complex sampling regime from coal face,
through the process yard to final dispatch by train
in order to meet the quality standards required
by the six different power stations supplied in
the period.
Hannahston was an abandoned opencast coal
site in Ayrshire which the Group restored and
developed into mixed housing, community access
and nature conservation uses. The Group has
disposed of 18 acres of the site with planning
consent for 36 houses during the period.
ATH Resources plc Annual report and financial statements 2004 5
Tax
The effective rate of tax was 66% compared
with a standard rate of tax of 30%. The primary
cause for this variation in effective rate was the
effect of depreciation charges being in excess
of capital allowances.
Dividends and earnings per share
The Board is recommending a final dividend 
of £1.0m, equivalent to 3.36p per share,
subject to approval by the members at the
Annual General Meeting (“AGM”). As there
was not an obligation to pay the proposed
dividend at 26 September 2004 it has not
been accrued for in the financial statements.
Earnings per share for the period was 0.44p.
Cash flow
Net cash inflow from operating activities was
£8.7m and the Group was cash positive at
£2.5m as at 26 September 2004, whilst net debt
was £3.2m. £5.3m of this difference is in respect
of finance leases and hire purchase contracts
outstanding on the plant fleet and the balancing
£0.4m is in respect of commercial mortgages
on properties acquired at the Muir Dean site.
Capital expenditure
During the period the Group acquired capital
equipment with a value of £2.8m comprising an
RH120 excavator and four TR100 dumptrucks.
At 26 September 2004 the Group had placed
orders worth £2.5m for a further five TR100
dumptrucks and two Caterpillar D9 bulldozers
as part of its ongoing policy of renewing plant
to ensure that the Group operates a modern
and cost effective plant fleet.
International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”)
The London Stock Exchange has now confirmed
that companies listed on AIM will not have
to apply IFRS until accounting periods
commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
Consequently, the first set of fully compliant
IFRS financial statements will not be required
until the year ending September 2008.
In the meantime, the Group will be 
appraising the impact of adopting IFRS 
and briefing accordingly.

The Directors submit their report and the audited financial statements of ATH Resources plc for the period ended 26 September 2004.
Principal activities
The principal activity of the Company is that of a holding company. The principal activity of the Group is the operation of opencast coal sites and
subsequent sale to UK electricity generators, industrial and domestic customers. The Group operates under the title of ATH Resources.
Review of developments and future prospects
The Company was incorporated on 10 October 2003 as Ever 2206 Limited and changed its name to ATH Resources Limited on 13 November 2003.
On 14 November 2003 the authorised share capital was increased to £100,000 consisting of 100,000 ordinary shares of £1 each. These were
reclassified as 75,720 ‘A’ ordinary shares and 24,280 ‘B’ ordinary shares.
On 28 November 2003 19,470 ‘A’ ordinary shares and 24,280 ‘B’ ordinary shares were issued at par for cash.
On 28 November 2003 the Company acquired the whole of the issued share capital of Aardvark TMC Limited for a total consideration of £5,907,000.
The consideration was satisfied by means of a loan note being granted to the members of Aardvark TMC Limited, which attracted interest at the rate
of 12% per annum, and the issue of 56,250 ‘A’ ordinary shares. The loan notes were redeemed on the listing of the Company.
On the same day the Company acquired the whole of the issued share capital of ATH Garleffan Limited at par. On 28 November 2003
ATH Garleffan Limited acquired the Garleffan opencast coal mine from LAW Mining Limited.
On 1 April 2004 the share capital was further increased to £102,895 by the creation of 2,895 ‘B’ ordinary shares of £1 each which were issued at
par for cash.
On 26 May 2004 the Company was re-registered as a public limited company and its name changed to ATH Resources plc.
On 7 June 2004 the authorised and issued ordinary shares were reclassified as ordinary shares of £1 each, the authorised share capital was
increased from £102,895 to £1,000,000, the authorised and issued ordinary shares were subdivided by 200 into ordinary shares of 0.5p each.
On 11 June 2004 the Company issued a further 9,191,176 ordinary shares to the general public via an initial public offering when the Company listed
on the Alternative Investment Market (“AIM”) of the London Stock Exchange at an issue price of £1.36 per ordinary share.
The Group’s trading performance for the period was in line with Directors’ expectations which was influenced by the planned re-engineering of the
recently acquired Garleffan site in order to improve operational efficiencies supported by a strong performance at the Skares Road site.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to:
•
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
•
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
•
state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial
statements; and
•
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the
Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible
for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

Group’s strategy, budgets, major items of expenditure and acquisitions.
Board Committees
The Board has established three committees; Audit, Remuneration and Nominations, all having written terms of delegated responsibilities.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises the three Non-executive Directors and is scheduled to meet twice a year. It is the Audit Committee’s role to provide
formal and transparent arrangements for considering how to apply the financial reporting and internal control requirements of the Code, whilst
maintaining an appropriate relationship with the independent auditors of the Group. In order to comply with the requirement of the Code that at least
one member has relevant financial experience, the Chairman of the Board sits on the Audit Committee. 
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises the three Non-executive Directors and the Chief Executive, and meets at least once a year, normally in June.
It is the Remuneration Committee’s role to establish a formal and transparent policy on Executive remuneration and to set remuneration packages for
individual Directors.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee comprises the three Non-executive Directors and the Chief Executive, and meets as required to consider and make
recommendations on the appointment of Directors to the Board.
Shareholder relations
The Company meets with its institutional shareholders and analysts as appropriate and will use the AGM to encourage communication with private
shareholders. In addition, the Company intends to use the annual report and accounts, interim statement and web site (www.ath.co.uk) to provide
further information to shareholders.
The Board considers Vaughan Williams to be the Senior Independent Director.
Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for the system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such systems are designed to manage rather than
eliminate risks and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. Each year, on behalf of the Board,
the Audit Committee reviews the effectiveness of these systems. This is achieved primarily by considering the risks potentially affecting the Group and
from discussions with the external auditors. 
The Group does not currently have an internal audit function due to the small size of the administrative function, which amounts to six people, and the
high level of Director review and authorisation of transactions.
A comprehensive budgeting process is completed once a year and is reviewed and approved by the Board. The Group’s results, as compared
against budget, are reported to the Board on a monthly basis and discussed in detail at each meeting of the Board.
The Group maintains appropriate insurance cover in respect of legal actions against the Directors as well as against material loss or claims against
the Group and reviews the adequacy of the cover regularly.

Introduction
Companies trading on AIM are not required to provide a formal remuneration report. However, in line with current best practice this report provides
information to enable a greater level of understanding as to how Directors’ remuneration is determined.
The Remuneration Committee of the Board is responsible for considering Directors’ remuneration packages and makes its recommendations to the
Board. The Committee comprises the three Non-executive Directors and meets at least once a year, normally in June.
Remuneration policy
Remuneration packages are designed to be competitive and to reward above average performance. Executive Directors receive salary, fully financed
company car, death in service benefit, critical illness and medical cover, pension contribution, annual bonuses and share options.
Service contracts
The Executive Directors have service agreements with the Company dated 28 November 2003 for an initial twelve months, thereafter subject to
termination upon twelve months’ notice being given by either party.
Pensions
The Group does not have a pension scheme, instead makes contributions to Executive Directors’ personal pension schemes of 12.5% of annual salary.
Performance incentives
The Group operates an annual cash bonus scheme and grants share options.
The annual bonus scheme provides for a maximum bonus of 30% of salary to be paid by reference to: achievement of a Group earnings target (10%);
surpassing the earnings target (10%) and individual personal targets (10%).
The Company has the following share incentive arrangements:
•
an Inland Revenue Approved Executive Share Option Scheme (“Approved Scheme”);
•
an Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme (“Unapproved Scheme”); and
•
a Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) (together “the Schemes”).
Under the Approved Scheme an option may only be exercised during the period commencing 2 November 2007 and ending on 31 October 2014
provided that the Group’s earnings pre-tax in the three year period from 1 October 2003 to 30 September 2006 is at least 38.68p. The exercise price
per share is £1.49.
Under the Unapproved Scheme an option may only be exercised during the period commencing 12 June 2007 and ending on 10 June 2014 provided
that the Group’s earnings pre-tax in the three year period from 1 October 2003 to 30 September 2006 is at least 38.68p. The exercise price per share
is £1.36.
Under the LTIP an award will only vest (allowing the Award Holder to call for the shares subject to the Award) if earnings per share of the Company in
the three year period from 1 October 2003 to 30 September 2006 is at least 64.42p. No consideration is to be paid by award holders on vesting.
None of the option shares or LTIP require payment to be made by participants to receive the benefit of an option.
The options and awards have been granted pursuant to the Schemes to the following Directors:
Approved Unapproved LTIP
T J Allchurch 20,134 335,000 335,000
M T W Tod 20,134 220,000 240,000

R A Croston 20,134 150,000 170,000
A Black 20,134 150,000 170,000
The LTIP awards and the Unapproved Scheme share options were granted on 11 June 2004 and the Approved Scheme share options were granted
on 1 November 2004 following the approval for the scheme by the Inland Revenue.

 ATH Resources plc Annual report and financial statements 2004 13
We have audited the financial statements on pages 14 to 30.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has
been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no
other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom
Accounting Standards are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the Company
has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information
specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and transactions with the Company is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. This other
information comprises only the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Statement, the Financial Review and the Directors’ Report. We consider
the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements.
Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test
basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates
and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the
Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with
sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Company and Group’s affairs at 26 September 2004 and of the
Group profit for the period then ended and have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
Accounting period
The Company has drawn up its accounts for the period from incorporation to 26 September 2004.
Consolidation
The accounts consolidate the accounts of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings other than as stated below. The results of subsidiaries
acquired during the period are included from the effective date of acquisition.
The accounts do not consolidate the results of the French subsidiary, Société des Ressources Minières du Massif Central (“SRMMC”), as it is not
material for the purposes of giving a true and fair view (note 11).
The accounts do not consolidate the results of Aardvark (ESOP) Limited as it is considered dormant for the period and is not material for the purposes
of giving a true and fair view. The Trustees intend to wind up the ESOP as it has no further interest in the shares of Aardvark TMC Limited, a subsidiary
of the Group.
Aardvark TMC Limited (“Aardvark”) has 20,000 ‘B’ ordinary shares, subscribed at nominal value of 1p each, in addition to the ordinary shares wholly
owned by ATH Resources plc.
The ‘B’ ordinary shares only carry the rights to receive a one off dividend in the event that Aardvark TFC Limited or SRMMC (Aardvark’s subsidiary and
sub-subsidiary) are awarded damages in respect of existing and future litigation against the French State. The ‘B’ ordinary shares carry no voting rights
or rights to receive any other dividend. As a result the ‘B’ ordinary shares are not accounted for as a minority interest.
The Company has not presented its own profit and loss account, as permitted by Section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985.
Site development expenditure costs
The costs of prospecting and identifying new sites are expensed until such time that a prospective site is considered by the Board to be economically
viable and that there is a high degree of probability and commitment that the site will be worked. Costs then incurred in preparing and developing
sites are capitalised up to the start of production. Upon commencement of production, depreciation is charged on a tonnage basis.
Goodwill
Consolidated goodwill, being the excess consideration over the fair values of the assets acquired on the purchase of subsidiary undertakings,
is capitalised and charged to profit over ten years. Goodwill in respect of the asset purchase of the Garleffan site is charged to profit on a tonnage
basis over the estimated total recoverable reserves.
Tangible fixed assets
Depreciation is provided on cost in annual instalments over the estimated useful life of assets which are reviewed annually. The rates of depreciation
are as follows:
Freehold land – production sites Tonnage basis over the estimated total recoverable reserve
– non-production Not depreciated
Plant and machinery 20 – 50%
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 20 – 25%
Motor vehicles 20 – 33.3%
Accounting policies
 ATH Resources plc Annual report and financial statements 2004 19
Stocks and work in progress
Stocks and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Finance leases and hire purchase contracts
Tangible assets acquired under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised at the estimated fair value at the date of inception of each
lease or contract. The total finance charges are allocated over the period of the lease in such a way as to give a reasonably constant charge on the
outstanding liability.
Operating lease agreements
Rentals applicable to operating leases where substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership remain with the lessor are charged against profits
on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or
events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing
differences are differences between the Group’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of
gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are expected to reverse, based
on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Pension contributions
The Group does not operate a pension scheme for the benefit of its employees but instead makes contributions to their personal pension policies.
The contributions due for the period are charged to the profit and loss account.
Capital instruments
Capital instruments are accounted for and classified as equity or non-equity share capital according to their form.
Final void provisions
Following the conclusion of coal extraction the final working void of an opencast coal site must be back filled. The total cost of this operation is
recognised as a provision on site commissioning when the obligation arises. The amount provided represents the present value of the expected costs.
Costs are charged to the provision as incurred and the unwinding of the discount, being the difference between the present value and the total cost of
the provision, is included in the interest charge for the period. An asset is created for an amount equivalent to the initial provision. This is charged to
the profit and loss account on a tonnage basis over the estimated life of the recoverable reserves.
Turnover
Turnover represents the invoiced value, net of Value Added Tax, of goods sold to customers. 
Employee share schemes
The Company operates a number of share based incentives as outlined in the Remuneration Committee’s Report. The cost of awards to employees,
being the difference between the market price at the date of award and the amount of consideration due, is recognised over the period of the
employee’s related performance where there is a reasonable expectation that the performance criteria will be met.
Financial instruments
Income and expenditure arising on financial instruments are recognised on an accruals basis and credited or charged to the profit and loss account 
in the financial period to which they relate.

(“ESOP”) registered with the Inland Revenue, and holds shares in and for the benefit of the employees of Aardvark TMC Limited. All entries in the
financial records of the Company were in the capacity as Corporate Trustee to the ESOP and as such the Company is considered dormant.
SRMMC share capital and reserves at 31 December 2003 were €65,335 and the Company incurred a loss of €46,940 during that year. The Group

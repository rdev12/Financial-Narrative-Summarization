CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Our markets remain 
dynamic and fast paced.
Our task is to grow 
shareholder value by 
allocating resources 
to compete effectively 
in our current markets 
whilst prioritising rapid 
entry into new and 
complementary ones. It has been a challenging year for the Company given the 
declining UK console market. The business anticipated the 
likelihood of the slow down some time ago and has been busy 
developing its activities in some of the new markets that have 
been emerging. This has included an ongoing programme of 
small acquisitions that bring with them the technology and 
expertise to exploit these opportunities.
Markets
Our markets remain dynamic and fast-paced, impacted 
by well-established and rapidly emerging industry trends. 
Competition remains fierce. Our business is still largely driven 
by the games console cycle. This, however, appears to be 
changing to a more evolutionary model rather than the peaks 
and troughs of previous cycles. The outlook for new technology 
products such as Virtual Reality remains positive. But the 
transition to current console technology gave rise to tough 
market conditions in the UK in 2015-16, where UK hardware 
revenues were down 29% and software revenues were down 9%. 
Digital products have continued to gain in popularity and the 
pace of change is accelerating as developers and publishers 
seek to extend player engagement with major franchises 
through additional digital content. We are seeing, however, 
continued technology innovation, with new console hardware 
upgrades and the gradual introduction of Virtual Reality into 
viable consumer products.
Other key structural changes are happening across the 
market, including the rapid growth of online multiplayer 
gaming, esports and live gaming events. Each of these is 
further impacting our markets in some way, and whilst 
presenting some short-term challenges, represent major 
opportunities for the future.
Strategy
As markets change, we need to change with them. The rapid 
growth of esports around the world into a major stand-alone 
business is something we are focused upon. To this end 
we have made important strategic decisions over the past 
12 months, investing across all areas of the business. Our task 
is to grow shareholder value by allocating resources to compete 
effectively in our current markets whilst prioritising rapid entry 
into new and complementary ones. We have therefore spent 
considerable time developing and implementing our plans 
to grow our esports, events and digital businesses. 
Our retail diversification strategy around preowned phones and 
tablets and other new gaming lifestyle products is progressing 
well, with growth from these areas up over 30% in the year. 
Alongside this we have invested further in our digital and 
multichannel capabilities, helping to drive growth, both in our 
share of the online channel, and in our sales of digital products. 
In the year we have acquired two small digital businesses. 
First, in February 2016 we acquired SocialNAT – a leading 
esports platform in Spain, which is helping us accelerate our 
esports activities in the region. In addition, the Group acquired 
Ads Reality in May 2016 – an Augmented Reality technology 
business, which is helping the business to develop differentiated 
digital engagement tools for its customers and suppliers. 
Financial results for the 53 weeks ended 30 July 2016
Overall, Group revenues were down on the previous year, with 
Gross Transaction Values down 4.1%. The Group continues to 
focus upon strong cost control, however further investment in 
our strategic growth initiatives across the business resulted 
in a rise in continuing costs. As a result the Group’s Adjusted 
EBITDA fell to £28.0 million (2015: £46.9 million) and the Group’s 
profit before tax was £4.9 million (2015: £25.8 million).
The Group continues to maintain a strong balance sheet, 
ending the year with a cash position (net of overdrafts) of 
over £43 million (2015: £63.1 million). In July 2016, we agreed 
a new four and a half year financing facility, providing us with 
up to £75 million borrowing capacity in the UK, and renewed 
and enlarged our facilities in Spain.
We understand the importance of the dividend to our 
shareholders and reflecting our confidence in the Group’s 
strategic direction, but mindful of the wider market conditions, 
the Board proposes a final dividend of 1.75p per share (2015: 7.35p). 
This will result in full year ordinary dividends of 3.42p per share 
(2015: 14.7p).
Board
This year saw Mark Gifford, our new Chief Financial Officer, 
join the Board on 1 October 2015. With over 20 years of retail 
experience, Mark has already made a significant positive impact 
on the Group, bringing invaluable retail sector knowledge, 
financial management and strategic thinking.
People
Once again I would like pay tribute to our people. I want to 
recognise how hard our colleagues have worked during the 
past year and thank them for their dedication and contribution 
over the last 12 months and during my time as Chairman. There 
is no doubt that our future success lies in those people and the 
culture that binds them together. GAME Digital is a remarkable 
place to work and employs remarkable people. 
I will be stepping down as Chairman after the Annual General 
Meeting in January 2017, and I am delighted that John Jackson 
will be appointed as the new Chairman. It has been a privilege 
to serve the Group as Chairman for the last four and a half years 
and I want to thank all our shareholders, colleagues and 
partners for their commitment and support over that period. 
John, Martyn, the Board and the GAME Digital teams are 
committed to growing the Group and delivering significant 
value for our shareholders, and I wish them every success.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S Q&A
The video games 
industry is changing 
rapidly, driven by the 
continued evolution of 
customer and gaming 
behaviours. 
This Q&A with Martyn 
Gibbs, Chief Executive 
Officer, explains how 
these changes continue 
to provide challenges 
and opportunities for 
GAME Digital. Q
A
GAME CHANGING
Q
A
GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2016
11 Our industry is changing rapidly, 
driven by the continued evolution 
of customer and gaming behaviours. 
Consumers have never had more 
choice in the way they are able to 
access and engage in gaming and 
this is reflected in the development 
and diversity within our markets. 
The global video games industry is 
set to surpass $100 billion this year, 
with growth driven by the continued 
rise of digital content, whilst sales 
of physical software are expected to 
decline. At the same time, the number 
of people engaged in esports is now 
estimated to total over 250 million 
people globally, with that figure set 
to grow by another 100 million over 
the next three years.
As evidenced by the tough UK market 
environment, these changes continue 
to provide challenges to our business, 
but they also provide significant 
opportunities, and as our markets 
are developing, so is our business. 
We are on a journey to build a 
company which, through a unique 
combination of multichannel retail, 
live gaming and digital services, 
delivers a compelling proposition – 
providing gamers with the opportunity 
to discover, buy, socialise, watch, 
compete and play in both physical 
locations and virtually. Today, no 
other business does this for the 
gamer. We plan to be the first.
At the same time we are focused 
on leveraging our core capabilities 
to drive the development of new 
business opportunities both within, 
and outside, of retail. Through this 
we aim to broaden and deepen our 
customer and business relationships, 
generate incremental revenue streams 
and effect the transition to consistent, 
sustainable earnings growth.
We are positioning our business 
in this changing world to ensure 
that what we do is relevant for 
our customers and our suppliers. 
We, like many other companies, 
have to constantly adapt and 
change in order to grow and we 
have developed plans to achieve this.
 Q.
What caused the 
material decline in 
profitability this year, 
and how has the 
Group responded?
 Q.
What do those market 
dynamics mean for 
the business going 
forwards? Is this the 
beginning of the end 
of the current console 
hardware cycle?
 Q.
What caused the 
material decline in 
profitability this year, 
and how has the 
Group responded?
A.
Both our UK and Spanish retail 
businesses outperformed their 
respective markets this year. 
However, the positive market growth 
we benefited from in Spain was more 
than offset by challenging conditions in 
our larger UK market, which declined 
by 12.7% over the year, to £1.8 billion.
Against this backdrop, our UK GTV 
fell by 11.0%, predominantly driven 
by a reduction in console hardware 
sales versus a year ago and a faster 
drop-off in software sales for older 
console formats, notably the Xbox 360 
and PlayStation 3. 
As a result, Group GTV fell 5.2% 
and when combined with the Group’s 
operational leverage and the planned 
strategic investment made during the 
year, this decline in sales drove the 
consequential impact on our profits.
In response to these market dynamics, 
in January, we rapidly implemented 
a comprehensive programme of 
actions to drive improved business 
performance in our core UK business 
and across the Group. The programme 
covered a wide range of areas designed 
to realise commercial opportunities, 
cost savings, and drive business 
optimisation. There has been 
considerable progress achieved on 
improving supplier arrangements that 
have and will improve future margins; 
reducing property costs through 
landlord discussions and realising 
other cost savings through an 
organisation re-design, cost review 
activities and other efficiency initiatives. 
This programme of work is ongoing 
and remains a key focus and priority 
for the senior management team and 
we expect to deliver future benefits.
 Q.
What do those market 
dynamics mean for 
the business going 
forwards? Is this the 
beginning of the end 
of the current console 
hardware cycle?
A.
First, I think it’s important to stress 
that managing cycles is a fact of life for 
our business. What I am focused on is 
how we best manage the business and 
our finances through those cycles, to 
ensure we are best positioned to grow 
and maximise our market potential.
Though we remain cautious in our 
outlook given prevailing conditions, 
we are entering an exciting time with 
a number of new significant consoles 
launches expected over the next 
12 months and other gaming hardware 
developments across the industry.
As well as the customary ‘mid-cycle’ 
console upgrades, there are signs 
the long-established 5-8 year console 
lifecycle appears to be changing, 
with both Sony and Microsoft 
announcing plans to launch more 
powerful consoles in the next year.

In addition, the third of the ‘big 3’ console 
manufacturers, Nintendo, are due to 
launch their latest console in 2017. 
Finally, Virtual Reality represents a 
new and exciting market opportunity 
for us, with the PlayStation VR, Oculus 
Rift and HTC Vive launching in 2016. 
Whilst it remains difficult to accurately 
predict the potential of each of these 
new products, as the leading specialist 
in our markets we are well positioned 
to both support, and benefit from, 
the success of these new products.

 Q.
Two years ago you 
said the rise of digital 
content presented 
both opportunities and 
risks to the Company. 
Do you maintain that 
view given direct 
digital distribution 
would appear to be 
diminishing a core 
revenue stream? 
A.
Without a doubt digital content will 
continue to grow as a proportion of the 
overall market and as a proportion of 
our business. 
In fact, our digital business surpassed 
£100 million of GTV for the first time 
this year, a significant milestone for 
the Group. We also continued to grow 
our digital market share by leveraging 
our store base, where a significant 
proportion of our digital sales occur. 
The expertise of our knowledgeable 
teams is a key strength in driving 
discovery and sales of digital products.
We expect the proportion of full-games 
purchased digitally to continue to 
increase, however, we believe this 
market will remain a predominantly 
physical one for major titles for the 
foreseeable future. At the same time 
we see downloadable ‘add-on’ content 
becoming a bigger part of the total 
content market.
As our digital performance this year 
demonstrates, this doesn’t mean there 
aren’t opportunities. Across our teams 
and with the support of our partners 
we are working on innovative solutions 
to unlock future opportunities by 
improving the digital customer journey.
RELATED INFORMATION 
41 RISK MANAGEMENT
 Q.
Given these market 
developments, 
how is the business 
changing to ensure 
it delivers sustainable 
growth over the 
longer term?
A.
We have set out our strategic pillars 
and priorities which I believe will 
ensure we continue to effectively 
compete in our core markets, 
and provide a roadmap to the 
transformation of our business and 
the transition to sustainable earnings 
growth. Our market opportunities are 
great enough, the value of the brand is 
strong enough and the things we do for 
customers have value. We will continue 
to focus our efforts on the contributions 
we can make to creating shareholder 
value and target our investments in 
the areas that will make a difference.
Across the Group our teams are 
working relentlessly to drive progress 
against our four key pillars: improving 
our core multichannel retail businesses 
to maximise existing and new market 
potential based around the needs of our 
customers; rapidly expanding our live 
and online gaming services for gamers 
and publishers; developing our digital 
enterprise businesses; and optimising 
the Group’s efficiency to drive 
shareholder returns. 
RELATED INFORMATION 
29 OUR STRATEGY
 Q.
What would you 
highlight as the 
most important 
accomplishments 
against these 
plans within  
the year?
A.
First, across our core retail businesses, 
we maintained our leading market 
positions in both the UK and Spain, 
and in Spain we achieved our highest 
market share ever, at 40%. This 
provides us with a strong foundation 
from which to drive forward our plans.
Our retail diversification efforts are 
developing rapidly, with sales from 
digital products and product ranges 
outside of our core console gaming 
markets up 30%, and contributing 
over a fifth of our total sales. 
Across our growing gaming services 
division, we have made considerable 
progress developing and executing 
detailed plans for esports and 
competitive gaming activities in 
both the UK and Spain. In Spain this 
included the acquisition of SocialNAT. 
Implementation of these plans 
continues to accelerate, with the 
trial of our first 12 ‘gaming arenas’ 
underway and the first two arenas 
opened and successfully trading. 
In addition, footfall for our annual 
series of Insomnia Gaming Festivals 
was up over 50% in the year, to more 
than 100,000 people, and we have plans to 
grow this significantly in the coming year.
We made two significant strategic 
developments within our digital 
business during the year. First, the 
signing of a major global server hosting 
contract for an upcoming ‘AAA’ title. 
Second, we completed the acquisition 
of Ads Reality, a software company 
focused on visual recognition and 
augmented reality. We believe this 
acquisition has the potential to both 
support our core business and open 
up significant, adjacent markets for us.

 Q.
The scale of your 
new businesses are 
currently dwarfed by 
your retail operations. 
What gives you 
confidence these 
areas can be material 
contributors to the 
Group in a reasonable 
timeframe? Isn’t the 
success of the business 
still down to retail?
A.
Retail absolutely remains critical to 
our business and we have strong plans 
in place to develop and strengthen 
each of our core retail businesses 
to maximise their profitability.
Though the revenue from each of our 
new, non-retail, businesses is small 
today relative to the Group, each is 
positioned within existing, adjacent 
or, in the case of local competitive 
gaming, new markets that we believe 
hold significant revenue potential. 
We believe these businesses will also 
deliver attractive margins, particularly 
as they reach scale, supporting an 
improvement to the Group’s overall 
financial profile.
Whilst these businesses are being 
reported separately within the 
Group, our events, esports and local 
competitive gaming activities are 
highly complementary to retail and 
can be combined to create unique and 
sustainable competitive advantages 
in our core retail markets. 
 Q.
What are the risks to 
delivering your vision?
A.
As with any opportunity in business 
there are associated risks. However, we 
operate an organisation-wide risk 
management process which ensures 
the Group is positioned to assess and 
react to these accordingly.
The Group actively monitors and 
manages risks and uncertainties. 
These include continued changes to 
our markets – both structural changes 
and changes from the competitive 
landscape – IT disruption and ensuring 
we have the right people with the right 
skills to execute our plans.
We are entering new markets and this 
brings additional complexity and risk 
– we have established clear plans to 
ensure we deliver value-added services 
and solutions in those markets that 
meet the needs of our customers.
Looking to the year ahead, our key 
strategic execution risks include 
delivering the targeted progress against 
our retail diversification plans and 
successfully realising our plans for our 
gaming services and digital divisions.

 Q.
Does the business 
have sufficient 
financial resources 
to deliver the 
transformational 
plans you have 
set out?
A.
The Group ended the year with a 
substantial cash balance (net of 
overdrafts) of over £43 million and 
with new and enlarged facilities in 
both the UK and Spain of an aggregate 
of c.£128 million. In addition, following 
the recent sale and leaseback of our UK 
head office and distribution centre we 
have strengthened our cash reserves 
with the cash consideration received 
of £13.5 million.
In 2016, we invested almost £15 million 
across the Group (including capital 
expenditure and acquisitions) to 
support further business development 
and our growth strategy. I believe 
that by concentrating our efforts on 
implementing our strategy with a 
clear focus on cash generation; making 
carefully selected and well timed 
investment decisions and maintaining 
a sensibly balanced approach and 
commitment to controlling costs, 
we will be able to adequately finance 
our plans to achieve our goals.
 Q.
What are your key 
priorities for the next 
12 months?
A.
The management team remains 
fully engaged and focused on ensuring 
that we continue to drive forward 
operational improvements, we 
execute on our strategy and we 
deliver a compelling proposition for 
our customers that earns their loyalty. 
By doing this we will ensure that we 
fully realise the market opportunities 
available to us.
Most importantly, in the coming year we 
plan to progress a number of key strategic 
initiatives across the business that will 
positively impact our Group. We see it as 
a critical year because the successful 
execution of these plans will not only 
ensure we maximise market potential, 
it will further establish and validate 
the roadmap for the transformation 
of our business and ensure we are well 
positioned for the future.
Finally, I am focused on ensuring that 
the business continues to support and 
strengthen the core foundations on 
which it is built: our people and culture; 
our supplier relationships; our brand; 
our insight; and our infrastructure 
and technology.

OUR MARKETS INTRODUCTION
GAME Digital operates in the global 
interactive entertainment and video 
games industry. The foundation of the 
Group’s business is its position as the 
leading retailer of video games in the 
UK and Spain, where the majority of 
the Group’s sales originate. These 
markets, comprising mint and preowned 
hardware, software and accessories, 
and mint digital content, are core to 
the business.
More recently, a focus on the diversification of the Group’s 
operations through business development and acquisition 
has facilitated our entry into new markets, encompassing 
both new retail categories (for example the retailing of 
preowned mobile phones and tablets) and new gaming 
verticals, including esports and competitive gaming activities, 
major consumer gaming events and managed game server 
hosting. In addition, Ads Reality, the Augmented Reality ('AR') 
software business the Group acquired in May 2016 to support 
its customer engagement and marketing strategies, has 
provided a gateway into the Augmented Reality industry.
Below we provide an overview of our core markets and 
the markets we have recently entered and are focused on 
developing as a business.
The interactive entertainment industry
With an estimated retail value of over $100 billion, up 7% 
on 2015, the global video games industry is large and growing. 
According to research consultants International Development 
Group, the industry will reach over $130 billion by 2020, 
maintaining its position as the most valuable form of 
entertainment globally. The industry continues to evolve 
rapidly, driven by significant investment and innovation 
and increasing broadband connectivity. All parts of the 
gaming ecosystem are evolving – the places and ways 
people participate in or watch gaming, the hardware and 
accessories they use to play, and the way they access and 
pay for the content.
A summary of the key events and trends likely to impact our 
markets and business in some way over the next 12 months 
is shown in the table below.
We are focused on positioning the business to benefit from 
these developments, in order to ensure we remain as relevant 
to our customers and suppliers in the future, as we are today.

 RETAIL
Across our UK and Spanish retail 
markets, console gaming (comprising 
hardware, content (physical and digital) 
and accessories) remains the most 
popular form of gaming, with an 
estimated value of approximately 
£3.5 billion (2015, source: OC&C) and 
represents approximately two thirds 
of the total spent on gaming across 
all major formats (console, PC and 
mobile/tablet). This figure includes 
all digital content and digital 
subscriptions purchased through 
retailers such as GAME and directly 
via the manufacturers’ own console 
platforms (i.e. PlayStation Network, 
Xbox Live, Nintendo eShop).
Six drivers in the retail market
1. Console innovation
2.  Virtual Reality
3. Esports
4. Physical vs. Digital content
5. Competitive environment
6. Multichannel retailing
1. Console innovation
Our markets in the UK and Spain remain dynamic, driven 
by i) the periodical release of new console launches and 
technological innovations from the major manufacturers Sony, 
Microsoft and Nintendo; ii) the release of major new games 
titles; and iii) console price reductions aimed at stimulating 
demand, particularly from the more casual player base.

Following the successful launches of both the Xbox One and 
the PlayStation 4 in November 2013, both the UK and Spanish 
markets entered a period of growth, and this has continued in 
Spain this year. However, as widely reported, the last 12 months 
have seen a contraction in the UK market, caused by the rapid 
fall off in sales of software for the prior generation of consoles 
(PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360), which more than offset the growth 
in new generation software.
Looking ahead, the market is anticipating significant console 
developments from all three of the major console manufacturers 
over the next 12-18 months.
In addition to the Xbox One S, which launched in August 2016, 
Microsoft announced in June 2016 that they are working on the 
development of a significantly more powerful version of the 
Xbox One, codenamed Project Scorpio, to be launched in 2017.

A new

Nintendo announced in April 
2016 that they are planning 
to launch their next console, 
codenamed the NX, in March 
2017. Though the Wii U 
underperformed expectations 
following its release in 2012, 
anticipation for the NX 
remains high given the 
success of the original Wii, 
which achieved combined 
hardware and software sales 
of more than £2 billion in 
the three years post launch. 
Nintendo’s affiliation with 
the recent ‘Pokémon Go!’ 
phenomenon has also 
raised expectations for 
the console’s prospects.

4. Physical vs. Digital Content
Both physical software and digital sales are influenced by the 
development and release of new games titles and new add-on 
content by third-party publishers and developers, the size of 
the total installed base of console owners and the number 
of engaged players for any particular game franchise.
Across the UK and Spain, physical software sales totalled 
£1.05 billion in 2015-16 (2014-15: £1.1 billion) (source: GfK 
Chart-Track), a modest decline on the prior year due to the 
impact of the decline in prior generation sales in the UK as 
discussed previously. Physical sales are expected to persist, 
and remain a substantial market for the foreseeable future.

At the same time, the growth in the consumption of digitally 
delivered content is expected to continue, with sales in the 
UK forecast to increase from approximately £700 million in 
2015 to approximately £1 billion by 2018, for all console formats, 
representing a compound annual growth rate of c.10%.
Sony have also recently announced several significant product 
developments including their virtual reality headset, PlayStation 
VR, launching in October 2016, the PlayStation 4 Slim, which 
launched in September 2016, and the PlayStation 4 ‘Pro’, which 
launches in November 2016. The PlayStation 4 'Pro' will deliver 
a significant upgrade on processing and graphics power to 
support 4K gaming and a superior gaming experience, 
particularly for Virtual Reality.
2. Virtual Reality ('VR')
The arrival of a number of major virtual reality devices, 
launching over the next six months, represents a significant 
new development within our markets. Notable products 
with announced launch dates include the Oculus Rift, Sony’s 
PlayStation VR and HTC’s Vive. Though it is too early to fully 
predict the market impact, industry analysts believe the global 
VR market will be worth several billion dollars in 2017. 
GAME is a retail launch partner for each of the major devices 
coming to market in 2016-17 and will also stock associated 
accessories and related products.
Industry analysts believe the global VR market 
will be worth several billion dollars in 2017. 
3. Esports
The dynamics of the overall esports market is discussed in 
more detail in the 'Esports' section on page 24. From a retail 
perspective, the growth in the esports and competitive gaming 
market is expected to drive increased demand within the high 
end peripherals markets across both PC and console gaming 
categories. In addition, the market for licensed merchandise, 
related to esports teams, tournaments and games is also 
expected to grow markedly. You can read about how we are 
developing the business to target both esports and new growth 
markets such as PC accessories in the CEO’s Q&A on pages 
10 to 15.

2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020
Digital sales include downloadable content (DLC), subscriptions 
and full-game downloads. DLC refers to additional in-game 
content, for example additional levels, maps, characters, online 
functionality and season passes. Subscriptions refer to access 
fees for online content, either purchased at retail or directly 
at the console platform. 
Approximately one-fifth of all digital sales in the UK were 
transacted through a retailer in 2015, and this remains an 
important market for the Group. Our increasing range of digital 
content, novel ways to pay for products such as trade-in and 
GAME Wallet, and focus on educating and assisting customers 
with their digital purchases, continues to drive our leading 
share of the retail market, with over 60% of this market in 
2015-16 in both territories.
5. Competitive environment
Our core retail markets remain competitive, being served by a 
wide range of participants including supermarkets, department 
stores, electrical retailers, online retailers and a number of 
smaller independents, as well as by digital distributors, including 
the manufacturers’ own platforms, within the digital market. 
We compete on a multitude of factors including customer service, 
product variety and range, price and value, trade-in, innovation 
and technology, availability of products and content, delivery 
methods and speed of fulfilment, promotional activities, brand 
recognition and affinity, convenience and store locations, 
customer insight, community events, and customer support.

position in our core markets in the CEO’s Q&A on page 10.
6. Multichannel retailing 
Today’s customers expect a seamless integration of online and 
offline retail channels, greater convenience and a consistent 
experience. Stores remain the retail touch point with the highest 
frequency of contact but online channels have grown and will 
continue to grow in their importance as a channel. As online 
shopping continues to grow, retailers increasingly need to 
deliver a unique, differentiated in-store offer that excites, 
engages and keeps customers coming back. Similarly, as 
online shopping grows and competitors invest in and develop 
their own websites and services, customers expect their 
shopping experience to develop and become more exciting, 
more convenient and easier to use.
Across gaming, it is estimated that approximately 34% of all UK 
retail sales (mint hardware, software, accessories and digital) 
were transacted online in the year, up from approximately 
32% from last year. The online channel in Spain is less well 
developed, accounting for 11% of the market. Again, from 
a lower base, this is also expected to grow. 
A key driver of the dynamic between offline and online retail 
is the growing adoption and usage of smartphones and tablets. 
Conversion rates on smartphones and tablets are rising quickly 
as a result of website improvements, enhanced delivery options, 
greater personalisation and better product information and are 
rapidly becoming a key shopping tool, both at home, in store and 
on the move. In 2016, 45% of our UK web traffic was accessed 
via a smartphone, up from 35% a year earlier. As a retailer 
we know we must continue to develop an integrated consumer 
proposition that delivers a consistent brand and customer 
experience regardless of touch point or channel and a strong 
multichannel strategy. You can read how we are doing this on 
pages 29 to 37 of this report.

GAMING CONVENTIONS
GAME has recently entered the gaming 
conventions market through its 
consumer gaming show, Insomnia. 
Insomnia is the largest event of its kind 
in the UK, attracting footfall of over 
100,000 people a year across five events. 
The event is a diversified consumer show 
catering for two main audiences – core 
gamers and families. The key elements 
of the show comprise a Local Area 
Network (‘LAN’) gaming hall where 
gamers bring their own PCs or consoles 
to play on, main stage entertainment, 
YouTuber ‘meet and greets’, esports 
tournaments and a consumer exposition. 
More recently the Group has expanded 
the show to include adjacent interests, 
such as consumer technology and live 
music to broaden the show's appeal. 
Through Multiplay, GAME also produces and manages major 
conventions and events on behalf of third parties, most 
significantly working with Mojang and Microsoft to produce 
MINECON and the July 2015 event was the world’s largest 
single title gaming convention. 
The gaming conventions market is part of the ‘recreational 
activities’ sector of the leisure industry. In the UK this sector 
was worth £4.8 billion in 2015 (source: Oliver Wyman) and forms 
part of the UK’s £117 billion total leisure market. The leisure 
industry has experienced positive dynamics in recent years, 
having delivered an average annual growth rate of 5% since 
2010. The gaming conventions sub-sector has significantly 
outperformed overall industry growth rates over this time, 
driven by:
 — growth in the gaming sector and a rise in the total number of 
gamers, which now totals 18.8 million 6-64 year olds playing 
games in the UK, or 40% (source: GameTrack (ISFE/Ipsos))
 — increasing interest in gaming events boosted by the growth 
in esports participation
 — the rise in YouTubers and other social media ‘personalities’ 
who are using festivals as opportunities to meet their fans 
and promote their sites
 — the success of Minecraft, which has a large and growing 
population of highly engaged players, predominantly across 
a younger demographic.

Competition for Insomnia 
attendees differs, depending 
on the type of visitor. 
Competition for core 
gamers is with other local 
LAN-based events, online 
gaming events and other 
types of leisure activity 
targeted at this demographic 
such as live sporting 
events and music festivals. 
Competition for family 
attendees spans a very wide 
range of areas, all targeting 
the ‘leisure pound’, including 
other family oriented shows

parks and live sporting events.
We compete on a wide 
range of factors including 
price and value, consumer 
experience, convenience, 
novelty, uniqueness, breadth

Insomnia’s position within the leisure market  ESPORTS
GAME entered the esports market 
in 2015 through its acquisition of 
Multiplay, which organises esports 
tournaments and activities at its 
consumer gaming events.
The esports market, defined as 
competitive video gaming, continues to 
experience strong growth in viewership 
and interest. In 2016, industry analysts 
estimate that over 250 million people will 
watch or participate in esports globally, 
a 13% year-on-year increase. This figure 
is expected to reach approximately 
350 million by 2019, driven by material 
investment into the industry and the 
continued growth in internet-connected 
gaming devices.
Like mainstream sports, the esports value chain is multi-
layered, with participants comprising games developers and 
publishers, amateur and professional players, tournament 
and league organisers, broadcast platforms, consumers 
and brands. The esports market has direct money inflows 
(e.g. ticket sales at events, sponsorship, merchandise, online 
ads, media rights, and publishers' investments), in addition 
to supporting adjacencies (such as game and digital content 
sales, hardware and peripheral sales and sportsbook betting). 
According to Newzoo, the total value of direct esports revenue 
totalled $463 million in 2016 and is expect to grow at an annual 
rate of 41% to 2019, reaching over $1 billion.

The esports market can be further segmented by the type of 
activity below – ranging from organised casual gaming activities 
through to the top tier of global professional events. Dynamics of 
the viewer/participant relationship share an inverse relationship, 
with the bottom of the pyramid characterised by a higher 
number of participants and lower viewership and the top by 
a lower number of participants and far greater viewership, 
reaching the tens of millions for the most prestigious events.

competitive gaming events and organised play activities. 
This leverages the experience of the teams at Multiplay in 
the UK and SocialNAT in Spain, the Group’s relationships with 
the key publishers and influences, together with the local 
community scale and mainstream reach that GAME brings 
through its stores, online traffic and brand.

OUR MARKETS
CONTINUED  DIGITAL
Through its acquisitions of Multiplay and 
Ads Reality the Group has recently entered 
two digitally-based markets – managed 
game server hosting and Augmented 
Reality-based visual marketing. 
Enterprise game server hosting 
The increased prevalence of online gaming has resulted 
in the huge growth in multiplayer gaming and this is driving 
a corresponding requirement for managed server hosting 
solutions. Managing the global server hosting requirements 
for multiplayer gaming is a complex process. In order to ensure 
a high quality gaming experience, servers must respond 
dynamically and instantaneously according to regional activity 
spikes and technological disruptions around the world. 
Multiplay is leveraging the significant expertise it has 
accumulated within this specialist field of hosting over the 
last decade, together with an end-to-end proposition and global 
infrastructure to provide services to third parties looking for 
a cost effective hosting solution for their multiplayer gaming 
titles. Multiplay already provides managed hosting services 
to a number of major international publishers and has a strong 
pipeline of future opportunities. 
Our current focus is on delivering growth within the gaming 
industry, though the technology has wider application. 
Competition in this space includes the major cloud hosting 
companies, a small number of other specialist providers and, 
in a number of cases the larger publishers and developers 
themselves, where they have built and run their own in-house 
infrastructure and teams. We compete in this market across 
several factors including specialist expertise and consultancy, 
reliability and speed (including normal peak use and periods of 
potential 'denial of service' attacks), superior flexibility through 
access to multiple cloud solutions, geographic coverage, price, 
reputation, service and marketing.
You can read about the latest developments within our server 
hosting business in the CEO’s Q&A on page 10.
Augmented Reality ('AR')
AR technology blends the virtual and real world objects, 
allowing users to interact with virtual objects whilst being 
able to distinguish between real and virtual contents. 
Proliferation of mobile devices such as smartphones and 
tablets combined with the growing number of AR software 
applications is expected to drive rapid growth of the mobile 
AR market by enhancing the user experience of games and 
other consumer applications. 
For example, in 2016, Pokémon Go! was downloaded 500 million 
times and generated more than $500 million in revenue in 
63 days, making it the fastest growing mobile game in history 
(as measured by this benchmark). 
AR technology has wide-reaching application across many 
industries, including gaming and entertainment, consumer 
goods and services, healthcare, education, logistics, automotive 
and manufacturing. Overall, the technology analyst group, IDC, 
forecast that the combined AR and VR markets will grow at a 
compound annual growth rate of over 180% from 2015 to 2020, 
reaching a value of more than $162 billion across all forms of 
hardware, software and services sales.
GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2016

Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information Our model is structured to enable us to provide these 
services directly to consumers (B2C) as well as to third-party 
businesses (B2B).
We expect the newer areas of the business (Esports, Events 
& Digital) to develop substantially over the next three years, 
recognising that it will take time for these areas to mature 
and contribute at similar levels to our core retail businesses.
1. Our multiple resources
Our model utilises the Group’s six key resources and 
relationships:
Financial resources
The Group’s balance sheet strength and access to financing 
allow us to support the necessary investment to deliver our 
plans and strategic ambitions. As discussed in more detail in 
the Financial Review on page 48, our financing facilities have 
been renewed and increased during the year in both the UK 
and Spain. We also carefully manage our working capital and 
wider balance sheet position to ensure we are well stocked to 
service our customer needs but without tying up excess cash 
unnecessarily. Furthermore, there is a strong focus across our 
businesses on operational rigour, efficiency and cost control.
People and culture
Our business is currently supported by over 4,700 colleagues 
across the UK and Spain. We continue to ensure we have the 
right people with the individual skills, competencies and 
experience who can create value and deliver our business 
objectives. The Group employs many talented, creative and 
experienced individuals that can lead the way in a fast-evolving 
market. We give them the tools, training and support they need, 
and empower them to unleash their passion, be innovative and 
to collaborate to earn the loyalty of customers.
Brand
The GAME brand is highly recognisable in its markets and 
well known across a wide demographic. Our Insomnia brand 
is recognisable amongst a smaller, but key demographic of 
intense gamers and gaming influencers. 
Infrastructure, logistics and technology
We serve millions of customers every week across the UK and 
Spain through our nationwide store networks and eCommerce 
platforms. Our distribution and logistics infrastructure is built 
for our business needs today and for future multichannel growth.
We continue to invest in technological innovation to deliver 
leading solutions to our customers and to differentiate our 
propositions from those of our peers – for both our B2B and 
B2C customers.
Insight
We collect, analyse and interpret large amounts of data to 
better understand the needs and interests of customers and 
gamers. We use the insight gained to empower our business 
decisions, improve our customer offer and benefit our suppliers. 
OUR BUSINESS MODEL
CREATING VALUE FOR ALL  
OUR STAKEHOLDERS
The Group’s core business activity 
remains the retailing of video games. 
However, through the execution of 
the Group’s strategy we are adopting 
a diversified retail and gaming services-
based business model. Although this 
development is in its early stages there 
is significant focus in increasing the 
pace of change in the coming year.
These changes are being implemented 
so that our business model continues  
to maximise value creation across the 
Group and benefit all our stakeholders.

Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information Partners
We have strong, long-standing relationships with our business 
partners, from suppliers to distributors, who help strengthen 
our offering and support our business. We collaborate with our 
partners to deliver an unrivalled specialist gaming retail offer 
and provide other services to enhance their product and brand 
reach.
 
2. Delivered with discipline
Our Group is structured to ensure that each area of the 
business remains focused on the needs of its customers; 
whether those customers are individual consumers shopping 
for themselves or for someone else; individuals or groups of 
individuals wanting to participate in, or watch, live gaming 
activities, or publishers and other corporate customers wishing 
to access our enterprise services. We will continue to innovate 
to deliver consumer and enterprise products, services and 
solutions that meet their evolving needs. 
Knowing what our customers want is important for us to ensure 
we innovate to offer services and products which are appealing 
and offer good value. 
Through this we endeavour to build strong, long-term customer, 
community and supplier relationships, resulting in high levels of 
engagement and loyalty.
Our activities support our strategic priorities
Our business model is built around a number of key operating 
activities which support our strategic priorities. 
These activities comprise:
 — multichannel retailing and merchandising
 — efficient sourcing and procurement from major suppliers 
as well as thousands of individual customers through our 
trade-in model
 — dynamic pricing
 — supply chain management and distribution
 — major and local event management and production
 — national and local esports organisation
 — software and technology development
 — marketing and CRM
 — training, development and employee engagement.
These activities are focused on building upon our leading 
market positions in our retail markets, maximising the potential 
of our core console markets whilst diversifying into new retail 
categories by offering exciting products and services based 
on the evolving needs and behaviours of customers.
We are rapidly expanding the Group’s provision of live and online 
gaming services for gamers and publishers in order to build 
customer and gamer engagement and generate incremental 
income streams for the business. These activities include major 
gaming events, centrally organised national esports tournaments, 
locally managed competitive gaming events and live gaming 
activities at stores and other physical venues.
These areas (retail events, esports and local competitive 
gaming) are complementary and can be combined to create 
unique and sustainable competitive advantages and 
sustainable, profitable growth.
In addition, on the enterprise side of the business we are 
developing our digital capabilities to deliver innovative, 
ground-breaking new services. 
Finally, we will constantly focus on improving our operational 
efficiency to maximise the profitability of the Group and 
associated value creation for the business.
3. Creating value for our stakeholders
Shareholders
Our business model operates to create value for shareholders 
through dividends and capital growth as well as continuing 
to grow the business through acquisitions and reinvestment.
Suppliers and partners
As well as acting as a key retail distribution and marketing 
partner for our suppliers and partners, supporting the 
promotion and sale of their products, we are focused on 
creating additional value in a number of key areas. We provide 
ongoing community interaction with gamers to increase 
demand and product engagement, we collect and analyse 
consumer insight to support improved business planning, 
and we provide complementary enterprise services such as 
contract event management and multiplayer game server 
hosting. We aim to facilitate both an enhanced product 
experience and to provide greater service and relevance to 
our business partners.
Customers
We provide customers with a valuable and unrivalled 
differentiated proposition by delivering customers a specialist 
proposition including exclusive products available only at GAME, 
engaging ways to purchase such as through trade-in, the ability 
to access products through multiple channels and convenient 
locations, a growing range of live gaming services and one of 
the most generous reward programmes in our markets. 
Employees
We reward our employees through investment in their training 
and development, competitive salaries with good career 
development opportunities and, where relevant, bonuses, 
for delivering positive results.
Creative and gaming communities
Our commitment to responsible gaming and investment in 
new gaming experiences supports the creation of positive, 
safe and inclusive environments in which gamers can socialise 
and thrive.

OUR BUSINESS MODEL
CONTINUED  
In spite of these changes and this complexity, the core needs of 
our customers, gaming communities and suppliers remain the 
same as they always have been:
 — Gamers want to enjoy the very best gaming experiences and 
the opportunity to share their experiences and enjoyment 
with others 
 — Shoppers want the best products, choice, value, convenience 
and experience for their gaming purchases
 — Developers and publishers want to create the best games, 
reach the widest audiences possible and sustain and 
increase engagement with those games.
During the year we have reviewed our strategy to ensure 
it is aligned with the needs of our key stakeholders, whilst 
positioning our business to respond to the challenges and 
realise the opportunities in the changing industry landscape.
Each element of our strategy is underpinned by the Group’s 
key strengths and competencies, identified as:
 — a deep understanding of our customers and gaming 
communities delivered through our data and insight 
programmes 
 — national scale and reach and a highly recognisable 
and trusted brand in our markets
 — close, collaborative relationships with the key publishers, 
developers and influencers
 — a diversified, complementary range of business assets and 
expertise spanning multichannel retail, event management 
and production, esports organisation and digital technologies.
Our efforts are focused on leveraging these strengths and 
capabilities to provide competitive advantage, both within, 
and outside of our core retail markets. Through this we aim 
to deepen customer relationships, build on the Group’s leading 
positions and pivot the business from one predominantly selling 
products to one selling both products and services to its 
customers, effecting the transition to consistent, sustainable 
earnings growth. 
Accordingly, our refocused strategic pillars and objectives are:
1.  Continue to improve our core multichannel retail businesses, 
based around the needs and behaviours of customers, 
in order to maximise market potential and profitability
2.  Expand the Group’s live and online gaming services for 
gamers and publishers in order to build customer and gamer 
engagement and generate incremental revenues
3.  Develop and grow the Group’s digital enterprise businesses
4.  Optimise organisational efficiency while investing for 
the future.
A FOCUSED STRATEGY 
DEVELOPED FOR A CHANGING 
GAMING WORLD
The dynamics of our industry are 
changing, driven by the continued 
evolution of customer and gaming 
behaviours. Consumers have never had 
more choice in the way they are able to 
access and engage in gaming and this is 
reflected in the development, diversity 
and growing complexity of our industry.

Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information  
Our loyalty reward programmes in the UK and Spain are 
not only a core pillar of our differentiated proposition, they 
also provide the Group with valuable insight which helps 
us to continuously refine and improve our offer. Total reward 
scheme members numbered over 4.5 million at year end, 
with 4.5 million active members in the last 12 months 
(2015: 4.5 million) and almost 1.2 million new members 
added across the UK and Spain over the past 12 months. 
In the UK approximately 61% of transactions by value were 
linked to a reward account in the last 12 months whilst in Spain 
the penetration was 79%. A key focus of the Group is increasing 
reward sign-ups and usage. Next year we plan to launch an 
enhanced reward programme for our most valuable customers 
to drive increased loyalty and sales.
New category and service development
We continue to develop and promote new gaming and other 
complementary product ranges in order to increase our 
relevance with our core customers and attract new ones, 
both growing and diversifying our sources of revenue. Our 
focus includes preowned mobile phones and tablets, PC gaming 
hardware and accessories, digital content and collectables, 
clothing and other licensed products. Initiatives to grow these 
categories includes the increased allocation of in-store space, 
significantly expanding our in-store and online ranges, 
improved visual merchandising and increased marketing 
support. In addition to these areas, we are also focused on 
growing our online Marketplace in the UK, which lists over 
100,000 products across a broad range of categories.
In aggregate, GTV from these areas was up 30% across the UK 
and Spain in the year, and contributed over 20% of the Group’s 
GTV (2015: 15%).
In the year ahead there will be several major virtual reality 
launches. Our preparations mean that our businesses will 
be well positioned for the launch of each of these exciting new 
products which will provide further opportunities to engage 
with both existing and new customers.
Finally, alongside these range developments, the Group is also 
broadening the range of retail services it offers to consumers. 
These services include online trade-in, consumer finance, 
the UK gift card programme, product repairs and product 
protection plans. The Group is also planning to launch a 
subscription service in 2017. 
Multichannel improvements
Our customers include digitally-enabled millennials who 
increasingly want to browse and shop across a range of 
channels – in-store and on their mobiles, at home and on the 
go. Helping them to discover content and shop with us whenever 
and however they want is a key driver of engagement and 
loyalty, with those customers shopping in more than one 
channel spending over twice as much as single-channel 
customers. 
1.  
IMPROVE
Continue to improve our core 
multichannel retail businesses, 
based around the needs and behaviours 
of customers, in order to maximise 
market potential and profitability 
Strategy in action
Our retail markets are innovating and evolving, driven by the 
dual impacts of the continued transition to digitally delivered 
content and the proliferation and use of mobile and online 
technologies, both of which are profoundly impacting consumer 
behaviour. We are focused on maximising the profitability of our 
UK and Spanish retail businesses by realising the full potential 
of our core console markets, expanding into new markets, 
delivering an improving multichannel customer experience 
(to drive both in-store and online sales) and optimising our 
store base.
Differentiated customer offer
The core retail markets in which we operate are highly 
competitive, and so we continue to focus our efforts on 
improving all elements of our differentiated customer 
proposition. Key elements include the continued development 
of our exclusive proposition, maintaining an authoritative range 
of physical and digital products across mint and preowned, 
promoting and enhancing our trade-in service and building 
on our popular loyalty programmes – all of which is built 
upon our local store base, passionate store teams and 
omni-channel capabilities.
We continued to work closely with our supplier partners 
during the year which included securing exclusives on over 
30 of the year’s top-selling titles in both territories. We continue 
to focus on extending this proposition to cover more hardware, 
accessories and licensed products, with over 100 exclusive 
products ranged during the year.
Our ongoing focus on digital sales helped to extend our market 
leadership in this category, with our share of the console digital 
retail market rising to over 60% in the UK and 64% in Spain. In 
the UK, almost two-thirds of our Xbox One and PlayStation 4 
customers have now purchased digital content from us. 
Promoting and retailing a growing range of digital products 
remains a key priority for the business.
Our trade-in and preowned capabilities continue to support 
both our specialist and value proposition, with over half our 
customer base either using the trade-in service or purchasing 
a preowned product in the year. Our plans for next year include 
the introduction of an online trade-in service and a focus on 
promotional activity to drive increased trade-ins ahead of major 
new hardware and software releases.

33 Accordingly, across our multichannel platforms in the UK 
and Spain our efforts are focused on delivering a seamless, 
connected and engaging experience whenever our customers 
need us, in order to drive both in-store and online sales.
eCommerce and mCommerce
Our eCommerce and mCommerce sites in the UK underwent 
significant upgrades during the year and these improvements 
helped to drive an 80 bpts increase in our online share of the 
video games market (source: GfK Chart-Track). 
Mobile in particular is seeing strong growth, with traffic 
increasing over 20% in the UK and 30% in Spain. Mobile traffic 
now accounts for 45% of all UK online traffic (2015: 35%) and 
26% of UK online sales (2015: 19%). 
We launched our UK Click & Collect proposition during the year 
and combined with our ‘Endless Range’ in-store proposition, 
means customers can now order online or in-store, for delivery 
to home, or to store. These services are becoming increasingly 
important delivery options for our customers, particularly 
around major sales events. 
Looking forward we plan to prioritise improvements in our 
online content and customer journeys to support increased 
traffic and conversion rates.
App and social media
Our mobile apps and social channels are becoming increasingly 
popular channels for customer communication and 
engagement. 
As with our other digital platforms, we are focused on continuing 
to increase the relevance and richness of the content delivered 
through these channels to increase engagement across each 
stage of the customer journey.
We are currently working on a major upgrade to the UK app, 
which will provide users with enriched content, an enhanced 
consumer experience and superior functionality. This forms 
part of the Group’s rolling programme of app improvements. 
In addition to the Group’s national social media accounts, 
the Group’s policy is for each store to promote its own social 
channels. This approach has proved successful in ensuring the 
relevance of content and communication is maximised, helping 
to foster better customer relationships in each community. 
Overall, the Group’s social audience across its national and 
store accounts now totals over 1.6 million in the UK and almost 
400,000 in Spain.
Customer service
We remain committed to enhancing customer service levels 
across every channel in which we operate. In March 2016 
we took the decision to outsource our contact centre to a 
third-party provider in order to further improve service levels 
in this channel. 
Store estate optimisation
Our stores remain a key strategic asset of the Group, acting as 
the central hub of customer engagement and a vital part of our 
omni-channel strategy. They also represent a major cost of the 
business. Our strategy is focused on ensuring we proactively 
manage our store estate, both the location of stores and the 
space within each store, to ensure the contribution of each store 
is maximised.
During the year the Group renewed 28 UK store leases, 
reducing rents on average across those renewals by 
approximately a quarter. The Group has a highly flexible 
lease profile, with 120 lease events due in the UK in the next 
12 months and an overall average break clause of 1.5 years 
in the UK and 1.0 year in Spain. 
Furthermore, during the year we have trialled both larger and 
smaller store formats in the UK, having opened a 672 square 
foot store in Aberystwyth and a 4,273 square foot store in The 
Metro Centre, Gateshead. The information gained from these 
trials is being used to identify further rationalisation and growth 
opportunities across the estate.
Within our stores, plans for next year include further 
refurbishment and refreshment of the estate where we 
believe it will generate a good return on investment. Our 
stores are relatively small, with an average store footprint 
of 1,254 square foot in the UK and just 804 square foot in Spain. 
Space is therefore at a premium, and as a result we closely 
monitor category contribution, reallocate space and refresh 
merchandising to ensure sales densities are optimised.

OUR STRATEGY
CONTINUED  
Esports and local competitive gaming
We have recently initiated a number of trials in the UK and have 
recently launched our in-store ‘gaming arena’ concept in two 
UK stores. The trial of at least another ten additional arenas 
is planned for the first half of our new financial year, including 
three stand-alone gaming venues. Though these initiatives 
remain at an early stage, results have been encouraging and 
feedback from customers, store teams, supplier partners and 
gaming communities has been positive. Dependent on the 
performance of these initial trials, the Group may look to 
accelerate the roll-out of this initiative in 2017.
The Group ran its first professional-tier esports event at 
Insomnia 56 in December 2015. The tournament was broadcast 
in 26 territories and surpassed its targeted global online 
viewing figures. The Group hosted further similar tournaments 
at Insomnia 57 and Insomnia 58 and has begun to sign new 
sponsorship deals as its reputation and audience grows. 
In February, the Group announced the acquisition of SocialNAT 
in Spain to support its esports plans in the territory. The business 
has since been integrated into GAME Spain’s operations with 
the establishment of GAME Esports. Developments in the year 
included the creation of a new broadcast studio to support high 
quality content creation and successful partnerships with 
Madrid Games Week and other similar festivals in Barcelona 
and Bilbao, where GAME acted as the official esports partner. 
Future priorities include the continued development of the 
Group’s professional and amateur esports tournaments and 
locally-based gaming activities. In the UK and Spain, we are 
also developing an online tournament platform and associated 
online systems, and creating content and programming from 
our newly established broadcast studios. Although this activity 
remains in the early stages of development, we believe both 
the direct sales opportunities and indirect benefits to the core 
business are significant. 
2.  
EXPAND
Expand the Group’s live and online 
gaming services for gamers and 
publishers in order to build customer 
and gamer engagement and generate 
incremental revenues 
Strategy in action
As discussed previously, our industry is developing rapidly, with 
the huge growth in esports, live streaming, social gaming and 
social media changing the way games are played and gaming 
communities interact. These changes are opening up significant 
opportunities for the Group to develop new initiatives, providing 
the means for people to come together to watch, socialise, play 
and compete, both online and in physical venues.
We are planning significant investment over the next three years 
to drive increased engagement with our brand and generate 
material incremental revenues through the introduction and 
expansion of new consumer gaming services. These services 
are currently focused on national and local gaming activities 
and events, local competitive gaming and esports tournaments. 
Direct revenue streams include ticket sales, in-store gaming 
services such as ‘pay-to-play’, advertising and sponsorship 
deals, and we expect to derive further sales benefits from a 
growing audience of engaged and loyal gamers. 
Major gaming events
The most recent Insomnia gaming festival, ‘i58’, held at the 
National Exhibition Centre (NEC) in Birmingham in August 2016 
was the largest event ever held, with footfall reaching over 
67,000. This followed record attendances for both the winter 
and Easter shows. Successful Insomnia events were also 
held in Scotland and Ireland during the year. In total, attendance 
for Insomnia shows was up over 50% year-on-year. New 
partnerships to extend the Insomnia festival activities beyond 
gaming included the Drone Show and Robot Wars at i58, and 
a further partnership has been agreed with Universal Music 
for next year.
Future plans include a focus on the continued expansion of the 
number and size of Insomnia Gaming Festivals hosted in the UK 
and internationally. In addition, the Group is focused on growing 
the number of white label events it organises on behalf of the 
publishers, building on the Group’s track record of successfully 
producing the world’s largest convention for a single video 
game (MINECON 2015).

OUR STRATEGY
CONTINUED   3.  
DEVELOP
Develop and grow the Group’s digital 
enterprise services
Strategy in action
The further development and growth of Multiplay’s digital 
server hosting business, providing scalable and cost-effective 
consumer and enterprise server hosting solutions for online 
gaming, is a key strategic priority for the Group. 
The Group had significant contract success during the year, 
signing the global hosting for Titanfall 2, a forthcoming AAA title. 
Publisher interest in the technology remains high, with a number 
of contract discussions underway. The Group is investing 
appropriately in the required resource and infrastructure 
to support the significant future growth anticipated.
Visual recognition, augmented reality and digital marketing 
In May 2016, the Group acquired Ads Reality, a digital marketing 
and technology company focused on visual recognition and 
augmented reality. The acquisition was the culmination of 
over two years’ collaboration between the two companies after 
the company developed the Group’s AR functionality within its 
consumer app (‘Scan It!'). The Group is focused on the roll-out 
of further key developments for the technology for use both 
within Scan It!, and for licensing to a variety of businesses for 
their own applications. Following the recent success of 
Pokémon Go! the Group is also developing AR services to 
support third-party gaming applications. 
4.  
OPTIMISE
Optimise organisational efficiency while 
investing for the future
Strategy in action
We are passionate about customer service and will continue 
to invest appropriately to meet the standards our customers 
expect from us. Within our retail businesses, including 
customer services, we carefully manage our costs and adjust 
resourcing levels as demand fluctuates. 
Given the need for further investment in areas of the business 
with a high growth potential, we maintain a disciplined approach 
to capital expenditure. Similarly, we have a relentless focus on 
improving operational efficiency and reducing costs where 
appropriate. 
During the year, we have given considerable attention to 
the rationalisation of our store footprint and reduction of our 
property costs, where possible. Many recent lease renewals 
have been renegotiated on improved terms, and where 
proposed new lease terms have not been acceptable, the 
Group has relocated to lower cost premises. We are also 
exploring opportunities to open in new locations and with 
new retail formats, including concession arrangements, 
where lower cost of occupation and more flexible terms 
can be agreed.
In addition, our focus on our operational processes and cost 
reduction extends to efficiency initiatives including productivity 
improvements in our distribution centres and store locations, 
as well as contract reviews of service arrangements.

OUR KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
CONTINUED Assessing our principal risks and risk appetite
A top-down and bottom-up approach has been used to deliver a 
robust assessment of the Company’s principal risks as follows: 
 — Board members were initially asked, individually, to perform 
a gross and net risk assessment for the existing principal 
risks and to raise any new risks. The results were collated 
and presented back to the Audit and Risk Committee. 
Any significant differences of opinion were debated until 
a provisional risk profile was agreed
 — divisional risk workshops, attended by the relevant 
leadership team and facilitated by the Head of Internal 
Audit, were then undertaken in the second half of the year. 
The outputs were collated in a risk register and the most 
significant risks plotted on a heat map for presentation to 
the Audit and Risk Committee
Our approach to risk management
The Committee and the Board have spent considerable time in the second half of the year overseeing the design and development 
of a new risk management framework. This framework ensures that risk management is embedded in the day-to-day operations 
of the business, integrated with strategic planning and execution and provides effective oversight for the Audit and Risk Committee 
and Board. See also Audit and Risk Committee Report on page 82.
 — a consolidated Group risk register was created allowing 
similar risks to be grouped into themes. The Head of Internal 
Audit then met individually with the Board members to 
present the key risk themes, discuss any potential changes 
to the Group’s principal risks and agree risk appetite
 — the Head of Internal Audit collated the Board members’ 
responses and presented the proposed list of principal risks 
and accompanying risk appetite statements to the Audit and 
Risk Committee and Board for review and approval
 — work is ongoing to ensure the Board’s risk appetite is 
cascaded through the organisation and reflected in business 
policies to guide appropriate management decision-making.

Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information
RISK MANAGEMENT Principal risk 1: Strategy and business model (VA)
Specific risks
The Company must develop strategies to sustain and 
grow profitability in its core retail markets and to 
generate new revenue streams in new markets. Failure to 
correctly anticipate significant shifts in supplier strategy, 
technological advancements, and consumer behaviour, 
or the failure to respond and invest for change quickly 
enough, could lead to poor or untimely strategic choices 
and missed opportunities. 
The increase indicated in gross risk reflects our current 
strategy to enter relatively new and rapidly evolving 
markets and the challenges that this may present. As we 
enter these markets we will need to carefully balance the 
potential for downside risk with the opportunities and 
rewards we seek. 
Finally, successful execution of our strategy to enter new 
markets is reliant on sufficient re-investment of profits 
from our retail businesses and potentially securing any 
necessary funding.
Mitigating actions
 — Clearly defined strategy and risk appetite.
 — Reorganisation and strengthening of the UK 
management structure to increase focus and 
discipline in our core retail business and expedite 
the execution of our new strategic objectives. 
 — Significant executive level focus on strengthening 
supplier relationships and improving commercial 
terms.
 — Formal executive and Board level oversight of 
strategic execution.
 — Robust planning, consumer research, testing and 
trials as we enter new markets and evolve our 
business model.
 — Use of alternative financing solutions where possible 
to strengthen the balance sheet and grow the 
business, e.g. sale and leaseback of property.

Principal risk 2: Competition (VA)
Specific risks
There is a risk of significant loss of market share in 
our UK and/or Spanish retail markets due to intense 
competition from large, well-established corporates. 
Furthermore, intense competition from established 
corporates and new entrants could lead to losses as the 
Company enters relatively new markets particularly in 
esports and events. 
Mitigating actions
 — Ongoing monitoring of our competitive position.
 — Working with our strategic suppliers to secure the 
best commercial terms and exclusive deals.
 — Continued investment and development of our 
multichannel proposition including in-store 
environments and online development.
 — Broadening the range of products and services.
 — Further developing a differentiated, specialist 
multichannel retail experience.
 — Building consumer loyalty through our reward 
scheme. 
 — Harnessing our insight to offer tailored propositions 
to our customers.

Principal risk 3: People and organisational capability 
Specific risks
As the business enters a period of transformation and 
growth, the ability to attract and retain the right talent 
and resources is becoming increasingly important. 
Failure to deliver our strategy successfully could lead to 
significant underperformance in our core business and 
as we expand into new markets.
Mitigating actions
 — Reorganisation and strengthening of the UK business.
 — New senior management appointments, including a 
UK Chief Operating Officer, and ongoing development 
of retained talent.
 — HR programme addressing rewards and benefits, 
performance management and employee engagement.
 — Executive and senior management succession

Principal risks and uncertainties
The table below sets out the risks identified as having 
the biggest potential impact on our strategic objectives. 
The strategic objectives impacted by each risk and the change 
in the gross risk assessment are indicated in the table.
The gross risk assessment has increased for four of the 
principal risks since the prior year. This reflects the Company’s 
commitment to entering new markets and further developing 
our business model, which could increase exposure to new 
risks or to heightened levels of existing risks.
GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2016

RISK MANAGEMENT
CONTINUED Principal risk 4: Key supplier dependency 
Specific risks
Our business model is predicated on close working 
relationships with, and continued support from, our 
publisher partners. In our core retail markets this helps us 
secure the most compelling and competitive propositions in 
the market place for gamers and gifters. It is also essential 
as we look to grow relatively new product categories such 
as 'licensed merchandise' and enter new markets in 
esports, events and game hosting. A change in the 
dynamics of our key supplier relationships, or a change in 
their strategic direction (for example, driving digital more 
aggressively or engaging directly with customers) could 
lead to a reduction in, or withdrawal of, commercial and 
financial support. Similarly, the impact of Brexit could 
increase our costs which may lead to higher selling prices 
or lower margins. 
Mitigating actions
 — Significant executive level focus on strengthening 
supplier relationships.
 — Continued investment and development of our 
multichannel proposition including investment in 
store environments and website development.
 — Development of value-added B2B digital services 
such as game hosting and augmented reality 
marketing and advertising.
 — Provision of valuable consumer insight to help our 
suppliers improve their products and target their 
marketing more effectively.

Principal risk 5: Peak trading and consumer confidence (NR, VA)
Specific risks
In common with many retailers, the Company is subject to 
significant and somewhat unpredictable spikes in trading 
over Black Friday and the Christmas period. This can be 
challenging from a supply chain and logistics perspective 
and in terms of operational capacity and resilience. In 
addition, there can be considerable uncertainty around 
the timing, features and ultimate success of new title and 
product launches and in the evolution of console gaming 
cycles. Failure to plan effectively and sufficiently in 
advance could materially impact the Group's profitability.
As with many retailers, the Company’s trading and 
liquidity are subject to fluctuations in consumer 
confidence and changing patterns of shopping behaviour. 
External factors such as Brexit or a banking crisis could 
adversely affect consumer confidence and shopping 
habits.
Mitigating actions
 — Robust planning across sales, marketing, supply 
chain, IT and operations.
 — Timely engagement of suppliers on new releases 
and stock forecasts.
 — Continued investment in the multichannel proposition 
across store and online, plus greater actual and 
future planned IT investment.
 — Operational contingency planning including additional 
warehouse capacity. 
 — Risk assessment and optimisation of critical systems 
to ensure they can manage peaks in system demand 
appropriately.
 — Close monitoring of pre-orders, deposits and stock 
forecasts in the build-up to Black Friday and 
Christmas trading.

Principal risk 6: Data protection and cyber security 
Specific risks
There is a risk of a major cyber-attack or other customer 
data breach potentially resulting in; partial cessation of 
trading (e.g. online); interruption/cancellation of a live 
event, or hosting of the launch of a new game; theft of 
commercially sensitive data, or personal identifiable 
information with the need for customer or supplier 
compensation; exposure to adverse national media 
coverage and/or reputational damage and regulatory fines.
The increase in gross risk reflects the development and 
growth of new business areas such as major events 
hosting and enterprise digital services which could be 
susceptible to a high-profile cyber-attack. 
Mitigating actions
 — Strengthening of the senior management team with 
the appointment of a new Head of Corporate Security.
 — Information security programme and governance 
structure including regular Board and Audit and Risk 
Committee updates.
 — Cyber insurance cover put in place during late 2015 
and extended in summer 2016.
 — Training and awareness campaign across the UK 
business including a security handbook, e-learning 
modules, and unannounced testing. 
 — Regular programme of vulnerability scanning and 
penetration testing established in the UK.
 — Ongoing improvements to physical security at the 
UK head office.

Principal risk 8: Business disruption and crisis management 
Specific risks
Failure to respond effectively to a major incident such as: 
a fire at our head office or distribution centre; power or 
network outage; or critical infrastructure failure, could 
cause significant business disruption during peak 
trading, at a headline gaming event or during the 
hosting of the launch of a major new gaming title. 
The increase in gross risk reflects the expansion of the 
Group’s gaming events business and entry into enterprise 
digital services. These new business areas increase 
potential exposure to disruptive incidents and crises 
which could adversely affect the Group’s profit and 
reputation.
Mitigating actions
 — Disaster recovery plans in place for core 
IT infrastructure.
 — Ongoing programme of work in place to review 
and strengthen business continuity and crisis 
management policies, plans and procedures. 
 — Insurance protection increased.

gaming event or during the live hosting of a new 
gaming title. 
Mitigating actions
 — Ongoing strategic review of core infrastructure.

is not unduly delayed.

Specific risks
The Company operated 580 stores across the UK 
and Spain at the end of 2015-16 and is advancing new 
strategies which utilise this space increasingly for local 
competitive gaming and esports tournaments. The Group 
also operates large distribution and online fulfilment 
centres in the UK and Spain. 
In addition, following its acquisition of Multiplay in FY15, 
the business will be looking to host a growing number of 
major gaming and contract events attracting attendances 
in the thousands. 
A failure to maintain well-controlled, safe environments 
for employees, gifters and gamers across all of our 
locations and operations or to comply with relevant 
regulations could result in injuries to our employees and 
customers, potential fines and damage to our reputation.
Mitigating actions
 — Ongoing review and communication of health and 
safety policies.
 — Appropriately skilled and experienced health and 
safety managers representing each business division 
and providing training for others.
 — Formal governance and oversight via the quarterly 
health and safety executive committee and bi-annual 
Board level updates.

key areas of the business and monitoring of action 
plans by the committee.

RISK MANAGEMENT
CONTINUED  GROUP PERFORMANCE 
OVERVIEW
The FY2015-16 accounting period 
represents the 53 week period from 
26 July 2015 to 30 July 2016. The 
comparative FY2014-15 period 
represents the 52 week period from 
27 July 2014 to 25 July 2015. Throughout 
the Business Review, unless otherwise 
stated, FY2015-16 commentary will 
refer to the unaudited 52 week period 
to 23 July 2016, to better reflect the 
underlying performance of the Group.
Group performance overview
The last 12 months have seen continued developments within 
our markets, with a challenging UK trading environment set 
against good growth in Spain. These dynamics resulted in the 
Group delivering revenues of £813.1 million (2015: £866.6 million), 
a decline of 6.2%. The Group’s Gross Transaction Value (GTV), 
a better measure of underlying retail activity as it includes 
the gross value of digital receipts, was £912.6 million (2015: 
£962.4 million), down 5.2%, predominantly driven by the 
decline in lower margin console hardware sales. GTV excluding 
Hardware grew by £6.1 million or 0.9%, with the robust growth

offsetting the decline in Content.
Group gross margins (as a percentage of revenue) increased 
by 80 basis points to 25.5%, resulting in a 3.1% decline in gross 
profit to £207.1 million (2015: £213.7 million). Gross margins 
benefited from the shift in sales mix to higher margin categories 
including preowned gaming and technology products, gaming 
accessories and licensed merchandise. Total underlying 
operating costs for the Group (excluding exceptional and 
adjusting items and excluding depreciation and amortisation) 
rose by £13.1 million or 7.9% to £179.9 million, reflecting a 
combination of the net investment after cost savings of 
£9.7 million across our core UK and Spanish retail operations, 
together with an increase in costs from newly acquired 
businesses of £3.4 million.
The Group delivered an Adjusted EBITDA of £27.2 million 
(2015: £46.9 million), reflecting a 35% decline in core retail 
to £30.3 million and EBITDA loss of £3.1 million (2015 EBITDA 
profit: £0.1 million) within Events, Esports & Digital as we 
continue to scale up these business areas. Profit before tax, 
adjusting and exceptional items was £15.6 million (2015: 
£38.0 million), with earnings per share before non-recurring 
items being 8.5p (2015: 18.7p). 
Cash generated from operating activities was £4.5 million (2015: 
£43.3 million) and our balance sheet remains strong with a cash 
balance (net of overdrafts) of £43.1 million (2015: £63.1 million) 
after investing £14.8 million in the business (including cash 
payments for acquisitions of £1.5 million). With new UK banking 
facilities of up to £75 million and new and enlarged facilities in 
Spain of €59.7 million we have the necessary resources and 
facilities in place to support the growth plans of the business.
The Board has approved a final dividend of 1.75p per 
share (2015: 7.35p). This will be paid on 10 February 2017 
to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 
30 December 2016, with the ex-dividend date of 29 December 2016.

BUSINESS REVIEW Following the December trading statement, store 
management and structures in central functions 
were redesigned to ensure that future growth 
opportunities and savings could be realised.
Core Retail: UK
Trading conditions in the UK video games market have remained 
challenging throughout the year. The transition from older 
gaming formats to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One ('New Format') 
impacted profitability across the market and the effect of this 
transition was further compounded by both lower footfall over 
our key Christmas trading weeks and a quieter schedule of major 
new games releases in our second half. Overall, the UK retail 
market (Console Hardware, Software, Accessories and Digital) 
fell 12.7% in the year, with hardware sales falling 28.5% and 
boxed software sales down 9.0%.

Against this backdrop our UK retail business delivered GTV 
of £648.7 million, an 11.0% decline on the prior year. UK retail 
gross profit was £149.5 million (2015: £160.9 million). Console 
sales of £144.8 million were down 30.5%, but given the low 
margin of this category the impact on gross profit was just 
£1 million. Overall, our share of the mint console market was 
broadly stable at 31.8% (2015: 33.1%).
Although sales declined in the year, our UK business has 
continued to deliver positive growth in several areas, including: 
New Format software (up 11% across mint and preowned 
combined); Digital GTV up 5%; GAMEtronics (preowned phones 
and tablets) up 61%; PC accessories up over 300%; and licensed 
merchandise up 70%. Whilst we are encouraged by the strong 
growth in our newer product categories, this was not sufficient 
to offset the margin decline from sales of Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 
and other older format software during the year. 
The increased contribution from higher margin categories and 
digital content sales resulted in a 120 basis point improvement 
in our UK Gross Margin rate in the period, to 25.9% (calculated 
as a % of revenues). Following the December trading statement, 
a comprehensive process of supplier engagement was planned 
and completed helping to provide additional support to improve 
our margins in the year under review and the year ahead. 
Our underlying operating costs (before depreciation and 
amortisation and adjusting and exceptional items) increased by 
£5.8 million or 4.7%, reflecting higher distribution costs together 
with the investments we are making to support multichannel and 
customer service improvements and the continued development 
of our growth categories. Following the December trading 
statement, store management and structures in central 
functions were redesigned to ensure that future growth 
opportunities and savings could be realised. Similarly, numerous 
other cost-saving opportunities were pursued including store 
estate savings. Rent costs were reduced by £0.6 million in 
the period, reflecting the part year savings for renegotiations 
completed in the period. In total, savings of approximately 
£4.0 million were achieved during the period, partially mitigating 
the overall increase. However, lower sales combined with higher

BUSINESS REVIEW
CONTINUED overall costs resulted in a decline in the Adjusted EBITDA to 
£19.3 million (2015: £36.5 million) in the period.
We ended the year with 313 stores (2015: 319) in the UK, having 
opened three stores, closed nine stores and relocated eight 
stores in the year. We had one loss-making store in the UK in the 
year (2015: nil) (calculated as annual store EBITDA contribution 
before the allocation of central overheads, excluding new stores).
Core Retail: Spain
Our Spanish business delivered a strong performance in 
the year, with total GTV up 14.1% on a local currency basis, 
outperforming the wider Spanish market which grew 9.9%.
We grew both sales and market share in all categories 
(Hardware, Software, Accessories and Digital), with our 
share of the Spanish retail market rising by 1.7 percentage 
points to 39.9%.
In local currency terms, we delivered Content GTV growth of 
12.7%. Within this, New Format software sales were up 65% 
and digital sales were up 63%. Preowned sales grew 10.0%, 
also driven by New Format software sales, which rose 76%, as 
well as good growth in preowned technology sales, which grew 
47.5%. Sales of Accessories & Other rose 20.4% and Hardware 
sales rose 17.4%.
Preowned sales grew 10.0%, also driven by New 
Format software sales, which rose 76%, as well 
as good growth in preowned technology sales, 
which grew 47.5%.
In total, after the effects of a modestly weaker Euro, which 
depreciated approximately 1.5% against Sterling, our Spanish 
GTV rose 12.5% and gross profit increased £4.6 million to 
£56.3 million, up 8.9%, due to mix effect resulting from the 
strong growth in lower margin hardware sales.
Higher variable costs, including the full year impact of the 
44 stores transferred from GameStop in November 2014 and 
higher distribution and central costs following the planned 
expansion into new activities including a repair centre 
operation, resulted in a £3.9 million or 9.4% increase in 
underlying operating costs (before depreciation, amortisation 
and adjusting and exceptional items) and an Adjusted EBITDA 
of £11.0 million (2015: £10.3 million).
We opened one new store and closed nine stores in Spain in the 
year and ended the period with 267 stores (2015: 275) of which 
three were loss making (2015: 3).
Events, Esports & Digital
Our Events, Esports & Digital businesses include Multiplay, 
acquired in March 2015, SocialNAT, acquired in February 2016 
and Ads Reality, acquired in May 2016.
In aggregate these businesses delivered sales of £6.1 million 
in the year (2015: £4.2 million) and Gross Profit of £1.3 million 
(2015: £1.1 million), with the vast majority of these sales 
attributable to Multiplay.
We have continued to invest in Multiplay during the year to 
support our plans to grow the business rapidly. New Directors 
of both the Events and Digital divisions were hired, together 
with a further 32 new colleagues recruited across all teams, 
taking the total number of employees to 99. Other cost 
investment was made ahead of significant growth activities. 
This included the largest ever Insomnia event, held after the 
end of the financial period in August 2016, and bringing into 
service a significant upgrade to Multiplay’s server management 
platform to start to host major AAA titles from autumn 2016.
As a result, underlying operating costs (before depreciation, 
amortisation and adjusting and exceptional items) for our 
Esports, Events & Digital businesses increased to £4.4 million 
(2015: £1.0 million), resulting in an Adjusted EBITDA loss of 
£3.1 million (2015: Adjusted EBITDA £0.1 million).

Group revenue declined by 6.2% in the period to £813.1 million 
(2015: £866.6 million) with strong sales growth in Spain more 
than offset by a challenging period for the UK retail market. 
The Group’s Gross Transaction Value (GTV), a better measure of 
underlying retail activity as it includes the gross value of digital 
receipts, fell by £49.8 million or 5.2% to £912.6 million (2015: 
£962.4 million), predominantly driven by the decline in lower 
margin console hardware sales, which fell by £55.9 million. 
GTV excluding Hardware grew by £6.1 million or 0.9%, with the 
robust growth in Accessories & Other more than offsetting the 
decline in Content. 
Group gross margins (as a percentage of revenue) increased 
by 80 basis points to 25.5%, resulting in a 3.1% decline in gross 
profit to £207.1 million (2015: £213.7 million). Gross margins 
benefited from the shift in sales mix to higher margin categories 
including preowned gaming and technology products, gaming 
accessories and licensed merchandise.
The increase in underlying operating costs (excluding 
exceptional and adjusting items and excluding depreciation and 
amortisation) was a result of cost increases in the core UK and 
Spanish retail businesses of £9.7 million and higher costs from 
newly acquired businesses up £3.4 million. Core UK Retail 
operating costs increased by 4.7% in the period reflecting a 
balance of investment to drive future growth and the delivery 
of cost-saving initiatives across the retail estate and through a 
central organisation re-design. Core Spanish Retail operating 
costs represent an increase of 9.4% reflecting cost increases 
linked to greater sales activity and investment in initiatives 
to drive future ongoing sales growth. Acquired businesses, 
comprising the first full year of Multiplay (acquired in March 
2015), SocialNAT (acquired in February 2016) and Ads Reality 
(acquired in May 2016) added a further £3.4 million, in 
aggregate, of underlying operating costs in the year.
Group operating profit was £5.2 million (2014: £26.2 million), 
explained by lower gross profit generation, higher operating 
expenses, including a £2.6 million increase in depreciation 
and amortisation, and exceptional income of £0.9 million in the 
year (2015: £nil). The Group delivered an Adjusted EBITDA of 
£27.2 million (2015: £46.9 million), reflecting a 35.3% decline 
in core retail to £30.3 million and the EBITDA loss of £3.1 million 
(2015 EBITDA profit: £0.1 million) within Events, Esports & Digital 
incurred as the new business activities were being expanded.
Adjusted profit before tax in the year was £15.6 million 
(2015: £38.0 million). Tax on adjusted earnings was £1.2 million 
(2015: £6.5 million) with the decrease in effective tax rate to 8% 
(2015: 17%) explained by the impact of one-off tax adjustments 
relating to prior years and a tax adjustment relating to the sale 
of the freehold property in the new financial year. Adjusted basic 
earnings per share was 8.5p (2015: 18.7p). 
On a statutory basis profit before tax fell to £4.1 million 
(2015: £25.8 million) and basic earning per share was 2.9p 
(2015: 12.7p).

The UK retail market declined 12.7% in the period. Against this 
backdrop, GAME’s UK Retail GTV (excluding Multiplay and Ads 
Reality) declined by 11.0% and revenue by 11.2%. 
UK Retail GTV excluding Hardware fell 3.2% or £16.9 million 
to £503.9 million (2015: £520.8 million). A strong performance 
in the Accessories & Other category, which grew 17.1% or 
£12.3 million to £84.4 million, was more than offset by an 8.0% 
or £24.7 million fall in Content sales, to £284.8 million. The fall 
in Content sales was explained by a 64.4% year-on-year decline 
in Old Format (PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360) software. New 
Format (PlayStation 4 and Xbox One) software sales rose 8.5% 
in the year to £166.5 million, whilst sales of digital content also 
increased, rising 5.4% to £83.4 million.
Preowned category GTV of £134.7 million was down 3.2% or 
£4.5 million. Preowned technology sales performed strongly, 
up 61.4% to £38.1 million and New Format sales were also up 
22.9% to £42.4 million. A stronger preowned performance was 
held back by the 46.8% decline in Old Format sales.
In line with the UK market, Hardware GTV was down 30.5% over 
the year, with sales impacted by the reduction in average selling 
prices of the latest generation of consoles versus a year ago and 
lower volumes.
The increased sales mix of higher margin categories resulted 
in a 1.2 percentage point improvement in the UK Gross Margin 
rate, to 25.9%, giving rise to a cash margin of £149.5 million 
(2015: £160.9 million). UK operating costs excluding depreciation, 
amortisation and adjusting and exceptional items rose 4.7% 
to £130.2 million (20.0% of GTV) (2015: £124.4 million, 17.1% of 
GTV) explained by increased delivery costs as a result of higher 
online sales and investment to support the Group’s growth 
initiatives. This increase in costs, together with the decline 
in sales, resulted in a 47.1% decline in Adjusted EBITDA to 
£19.3 million (2015: £36.5 million).
The number of stores in the UK at 30 July 2016 was 313 (2015: 319). 
Core Retail: Spain
GAME’s Spanish retail business (excluding SocialNAT) delivered 
GTV growth of 14.1% over the period on a local currency basis, 
outperforming the market which grew by 9.9%. On a reported 
basis, after the effects of a weaker Euro during the year, 
Spanish GTV rose 12.5%. On a reported basis, Spanish revenue 
grew 8.7% to £229.1 million.
Gross Margin rates in the territory remained broadly stable 
at 24.6% (2015: 24.5%). Spanish operating costs excluding 
depreciation, amortisation and adjusting and exceptional items 
increased to £45.3 million (2015: £41.4 million), representing 
17.6% of GTV (2015: 18.1%). The cost increases are explained 
by higher variable retail operating costs (including store payroll 
costs) which incorporated the full year impact of the 44 stores 
transferred from GameStop in November 2014; higher 
distribution and central costs following the planned expansion 
into new activities including a repair centre operation.
The Adjusted EBITDA for the period was £11.0 million (2015: 
£10.3 million). In local currency terms Adjusted EBITDA 
increased 15.8% to €15.1 million (2015: €13.1 million). 
The Group ended the year with 267 stores in Spain (2015: 275).

Revenue from acquired businesses, comprising Multiplay and 
Ads Reality in the UK and SocialNAT in Spain, grew 45.2% to 
£6.1 million (2015: £4.2 million).
Core underlying operating costs attributable to acquired 
businesses increased £3.4 million to £4.4 million in the year 
(2015: £1.0 million), predominantly as a result of the cost 
investment in Multiplay’s gaming events and digital teams. 
This cost investment was made ahead of significant growth 
activities including the largest ever Insomnia event held after the 
end of the financial period in August 2016, and the bringing into 
service of new digital solutions including a significant upgrade to 
the Group’s server management platform to enable it to run the 
global hosting requirements for major AAA titles such as Titanfall 
2 (with planned launch in October 2016). The Adjusted EBITDA loss 
for the year was £3.1 million (2015: EBITDA profit £0.1 million).
Gross Transaction Value (GTV) and Revenue 
Group Gross Transaction Value (GTV) fell 5.2% to £912.6 million 
(2015: £962.4 million) mainly explained by the decline in low 
margin hardware sales, which fell by £55.9 million. GTV excluding 
Hardware grew by £6.1 million or 0.9%, with the robust growth in 
Accessories & Other more than offsetting the decline in Content. 
Content GTV, which includes both boxed and digital game content, 
fell by 3.3% in the year. GTV of physical content for Xbox One and 
PlayStation 4 formats delivered good growth, increasing by 
17.8%. Within Content GTV, total digital sales continued to grow, 
rising 15.5% to £110.2 million. Underlying this improvement, 
console digital sales increased by 9.7% whilst non-console digital 
sales rose 33.8%. After adjusting for the impact of one-off digital 
bundling activity in 2015, amounting to approximately £5 million, 
which was not repeated in 2016, underlying digital sales growth 
was approximately 22%. However, this new format and digital 
growth was more than offset by the decline in physical sales for 
older formats (in particular PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Nintendo 
3DS) which fell 46.3%. 
GTV from preowned products decreased by 0.1% to £185.8 million. 
GTV growth was driven by an increase in sales of preowned 
PlayStation 4 and Xbox One software products, up 31.1%, 
as well as further strong growth in the value of preowned 
GAMEtronics sales (mobile phones and tablets), which grew 
59.9% to £43.0 million. Stronger overall GTV growth was held 
back by the 32.7% decline in Old Format sales.
GTV from the Accessories & Other category increased by 
£19.8 million or 19.1% to £123.5 million. The increase in GTV 
was explained both by the first full year sales contribution from 
Multiplay following the company’s acquisition in March 2015, 
together with the strong growth from the accessories and 
licensed product sub-categories. 
Average selling prices of Hardware were lower than in the same 
period last year and when combined with lower volumes resulted 
in a decline in Hardware GTV of 21.6%.
On a statutory basis, Group revenue declined 6.2% to £813.1 million 
(2015: £866.6 million).

Note:
Gross profit calculated as a % of revenue.
The Content margin rate remained broadly stable compared 
with last year, at 30.1% (2015: 30.5%). 
Hardware margin rates declined by 0.7 percentage points to 
3.4%, reflecting lower average selling prices and continued 
competition across the marketplace.
Preowned margin rates fell 2.4 percentage points mainly as a 
result of the increasing mix of technology product sales, which 
achieve a lower margin than core preowned sales. Underlying 
margins on both New and Old Format preowned software 
improved during the year in both the UK and Spain, although the 
mix of higher margin Old Format had an adverse effect.
The gross margin of the Accessories & Other category rose 
1.4 percentage points to 34.0%.

Core UK retail costs for the comparable 52 week period reflect 
an increase of 4.7% with higher distribution costs related to 
online growth, modestly higher store payroll costs and higher 
central costs given the investment made in developing the 
newer growth categories and higher IT and on line costs.
Core Spanish retail costs for the comparable 52 week period 
reflect an increase of 9.4% with higher distribution costs and 
store variable costs mainly linked to greater sales activity and 
further investment in central costs to similarly drive the new 
growth initiatives including costs associated with the repair 
centre and the greater focus on developing the PC category.

Across core retail, cost increases were experienced within 
distribution, selling and administrative costs as summarised 
below.
1.  Distribution costs increased by £2.0 million to £17.9 million 
related to higher online sales and higher store delivery costs 
in Spain.
2.  Selling costs increased by £2.4 million, or 2.0%, to 
£124.9 million. The increase in store payroll costs includes 
inflationary factors and is also partially explained by the full 
year impact of the staff costs associated with the 44 Spanish 
GameStop stores transferred to the Group in November 
2014. Following the December trading statement the store 
management structures in the UK were redesigned realising 
efficiencies and significant focus was placed on other saving 
opportunities across store estate. Rent costs in the UK were 
£0.6 million lower reflecting the part year saving delivered 
from renegotiations completed during the period.
3.  Administrative costs increased by £5.3 million to £32.7 million. 
The major reason for the increases were the planned 
increased central costs in the UK and Spain resulting from 
investments in our online, customer service, IT and digital 
capabilities to support the Group’s retail growth initiatives. 
An organisation redesign was also completed in the UK 
during spring to adjust structures to further develop future 
growth opportunities and realise savings.
Operating expenses included costs of £4.4 million for acquired 
businesses (2015: £1.0 million), comprising the first full year’s 
contribution from Multiplay (acquired in March 2015), together 
with SocialNAT (acquired in February 2016) and Ads Reality 
(acquired in May 2016).

Total adjusting items 12.4 12.2
Amortisation charges increased by £0.6 million in the period 
as a result of the full year impact of the Multiplay acquisition 
and the acquisition of Ads Reality in May. The post-acquisition 
remuneration of £2.7 million relates to a full year’s charge 
of the cash and shares payable to certain former Multiplay 
shareholders of £2.5 million (2015: £1.0 million) and additional 
amounts of £0.2 million for the Ads Reality acquisition. Other 
adjusting costs in the year of £0.5 million and £0.1 million 
comprise the legal and professional fees incurred in relation 
to the acquisition of Ads Reality and an impairment to the 
original 3% investment held in the company. The decrease in 
IPO-related share-based payment compensation to £nil (2015: 
£2.2 million) reflects the current probability of certain awards 
vesting and the adjustments to cumulative charges as a result 
of this reassessment. Costs of £0.5 million in the prior year 
related to legal and professional fees for the transfer of Spanish 
stores from GameStop and the acquisition of Multiplay. 
Adjusted EBITDA 
Group Adjusted EBITDA (EBITDA less exceptional and adjusting 
items) of £27.2 million (2015: £46.9 million) fell by a total of 
£19.7 million in the year. Core Retail performance reflects a 
£17.2 million decline related to the UK retail operation whilst 
the Spanish retail operations delivered an Adjusted EBITDA of 
£11.0 million, up £0.7 million. The Adjusted EBITDA loss from 
acquired businesses totalled £3.1 million (2015: EBITDA profit 
£0.1 million) reflects the scaling of operations ahead of the 
delivery of the planned growth initiatives.

Gift card expiries relating to prior periods and other similar 
items relating to prior periods have been presented as 
exceptional due to the size and nature of this amount. 
New information has been obtained relating to the level of 
unredeemed and expired gift card balances which had not 
been recognised in the statement of comprehensive income 
in previous periods and have been recorded as an exceptional 
item in the current year. Other prior period items reflect 
additional costs arising from the recalculation of amounts 
presented in previous periods for the Virtual Loyalty Share 
Plan, reductions in provisions for liabilities recognised at the 
time of the acquisition of the former GAME Group, together with 
IPO-related items and additional provisions in relation to other 
prior year items.
Redundancy and reorganisation costs are associated with 
the implementation of the organisational redesign for the 
UK businesses to ensure they are structured and resourced 
to drive future growth opportunities and to realise saving 
opportunities. The 2015-16 redesign was part of an ongoing 
process of repositioning the business for growth and involved 
significant reorganisation of functions and roles across the 
UK activities.
No exceptional items were incurred in the previous period.

The Group delivered Adjusted basic earnings per share of 
8.9p (2015: 18.7p). In order to give a better view of underlying 
earnings, adjustments to earnings per share have been made 
to remove exceptional and adjusting items. 
Financing costs 
Net financing costs totalled £1.1 million (2015: £0.4 million). 
The increase in the charge for the year has been impacted by the 
new facilities put in place during the year and the arrangement 
fees associated with these new borrowing arrangements, as 
detailed in the Cash Resources and Financing section. 
Net financing costs also include higher charges reflecting more 
frequent drawings in UK and Spain over the period.
Net financing costs in the previous year related to the HSBC 
ABL facility, the RCF facility and the overdraft in Spain, net of  
the interest received on bank deposits. 
Profit before tax
Profit before tax for the 53 weeks ended 30 July 2016 amounted 
to £4.9 million (2015: £25.8 million). Profit before tax for Core 
Retail was £12.4 million (2015: £27.5 million) and Events, 
Esports & Digital incurred a loss before tax of £7.5 million 
(2015: £1.7 million).
Taxation 
The effective tax rate (defined as the accounting tax charge 
divided by the accounting profits before tax) was -14% (2015: 
17%). The rate has been impacted by a number of one-off credit 
adjustments to the tax charge including amounts relating to 
previous periods, previously unrecognised losses and changes 
to the deferred tax provision arising from the sale of the 
property in the new financial year. In the prior year the Group 
had utilised previously unrecognised deferred tax assets in 
the UK, resulting in the low effective rate for the year.

Cash generated from operations
Cash generated from operations amounted to £10.1 million, 
£36.8 million lower than the previous year. This decrease has 
been impacted by the fall in EBITDA of £17.6 million and the 
adverse movement in working capital and other items of 
£19.2 million impacted in part by the timing of the year end 
in terms of certain payments including payroll. The working 
capital outflow is explained by the 53 week period and this 
outflow is expected to reverse during the next financial year. 
For instance, during the year under review and because of the 
53rd week this meant that 13 payroll payments were captured 
in the period whereas in the period ending 29 July 2017 there 
will be 11 monthly payroll payments. After finance costs and 
corporation tax payments, cash generated from operating 
activities was £4.5 million (2015: £43.3 million).

(2015: 24%) and 1.6% of revenue (2015: 1.3%). 
Capital expenditure was incurred on investment in the UK and 
Spanish operations (expenditure on a small number of new 
stores and relocations and further upgrade and maintenance 
capital expenditure particularly focused on upgrading existing 
store environments and investment on core IT systems and in 
distribution and repair centres). In addition, capital expenditure 
was deployed on the Group’s online and digital infrastructure, 
comprising further developments to the Group’s eCommerce 
sites, the GAME App, GAME Wallet, Codebank (the Group’s 
platform for digital code distribution), Clanforge
®
 (the Group’s 
server hosting technology), and new servers for Clanforge
®
.
Future capital expenditure is planned for further development 
of the Group’s online, IT and digital infrastructure initiatives. 
Further investment in the existing physical estate is also 
planned, focused on the development of new, experiential 
gaming zones within, and outside, of the core store estate in 
the UK. Capital expenditure plans also include a small number 
of new stores and relocations plus further focus on new 
merchandise opportunities and initiatives to improve sales 
densities in stores in both UK and Spain. Furthermore, 
additional capital expenditure, particularly focused on core 
IT systems, is also planned.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
CONTINUED Dividends 
The Group is proposing a final dividend of 1.75p per share 
(£3.0 million). Together with the interim dividend of 1.67p per 
share (£2.8 million) declared in March, ordinary dividends in 
respect of the financial year total 3.42p per share (£5.8 million). 
The final dividend will be proposed by the Directors at the 2016 
AGM. The ex-dividend date will be 29 December 2016 and, if 
approved at the Company’s forthcoming AGM, will be paid to 
shareholders on 10 February 2017 to those shareholders on 
the register at the close of business on 30 December 2016.
The Board remains committed to a dividend level which reflects 
the long-term earnings and cash generation potential of the 
Group, after retaining sufficient capital to fund the required 
investment to support future business growth. 
Acquisition of businesses
The Group acquired the trade and assets of SocialNAT (a small 
esports and events business) in February 2016 for a cash 
consideration of £0.5 million. The Group acquired the trade 
and assets of Ads Reality (a specialist visual recognition and 
augmented reality technology business) in May 2016 for an 
initial consideration comprising £1.0 million of cash and 
£1.0 million of shares in GAME Digital plc. Further payments 
of up to £18.0 million may be made based on the achievement 
of performance conditions over specified timeframes and the 
Group has the ability to settle these payments in cash or the 
issue of shares in GAME Digital plc.
Cash resources and financing
On 14 October 2015, the UK business terminated the existing 
£25 million asset-based facility with HSBC Invoice Finance (UK) 
Limited and arranged a short-term secured revolving credit 
facility agreement with Barclays Bank PLC and HSBC Bank plc 
for an aggregate amount of £30 million. 
Well ahead of the peak season and prior to the significant new 
console launches and the major launches of new virtual reality 
devices, the Group investigated securing significantly larger 
and more relevant facilities. On 20 April 2016 the Company and 
certain other UK subsidiaries entered into the Lajedosa Facility 
Agreement for an aggregate amount of up to £100 million under 
an asset-based facility. This facility provided by a related party 
was approved by shareholders on 19 May 2016 and became 
effective on 15 July 2016.
The Group continued to explore complementary or alternative 
similar financing arrangements from other third-party 
providers which resulted in the Company and certain UK group 
companies entering into an asset-backed revolving loan facility 
agreement with PNC Business Credit and Wells Fargo Capital 
Finance (UK) Limited in an aggregate amount of up to £75 million 
on 15 July 2016. The cost to the Group of this facility is a 
commitment fee of 0.5% per annum on £50 million of the facility, 
interest on drawn funds of 2.5% per annum plus LIBOR and 
a fee of 0.25% per annum on £25 million should this seasonal 
top-up facility be activated and drawn. When the facility 
arrangement was completed the £30 million RCF was 
cancelled. The PNC & Wells Fargo ABL will be primary source 
of working capital funding for the Group’s UK activities. Under 
the terms of the PNC & Wells Fargo Inter-Creditor Agreement 
the Company would not have access to the Lajedosa facility 
unless the PNC & Wells Fargo facility was repaid and cancelled.
On 20 April 2016 and on 8 June 2016 Game Spain renewed its 
short-term financing facilities with Spanish banks BBVA, Banco 
Santander, Ibercaja and CaixaBank in an aggregate amount of 
€49.65 million, made up of €29.0 million as overdraft facilities 
and €20.65 million of commercial credit guarantees available to 
suppliers via the banks. The cost to the Group of these facilities 
is an arrangement fee of between 0.15% and 0.30%, a quarterly 
commitment fee of 0.10% and interest on drawn funds of 
between 2.0% and 3.0% per annum above Euribor90 in respect 
of overdraft facilities and a maximum of 1.0% per annum in 
respect of bank guarantees. Subsequent to the period end on 
4 October 2016, Game Spain agreed a further €10.0 million 
overdraft facility with BBVA bringing the aggregate facilities 
to €59.65 million. The Group’s Spanish subsidiary previously 
renewed short-term financing facilities with Spanish banks 
BBVA and Banco Santander amounting to €38.5 million on 
30 July 2015 and 10 September 2015 respectively.
The Group currently has aggregate available facilities of 
approximately £101 million (2015: £52 million) which can 
be increased annually over the peak season by a further 
£25 million.
After the end of the financial year (see note 32 to the financial 
statements) the Group has entered into a sale and leaseback 
of its freehold property interests in Basingstoke, UK. The sale 
proceeds of £13.5 million will further strengthen the cash position 
of the business and provide further funds for re-investment. 
The combination of these facilities, the sale and leaseback 
proceeds and the level of positive cash resources means 
that the Group has further strengthened its financial position 
as it enters the period of peak trading and the peak working 
capital requirement.

The Group is carrying higher stock balances of £76.1 million at 
the end of the financial year, up 14% on last year because of the 
growth of GAMEtronics and Accessories as well as the impact 
of foreign exchange rates on the Spanish balance. GAMEtronics 
stock is largely acquired from customers trading in their 
devices for cash, thereby increasing the Group’s working capital 
balance. Weeks’ inventories on hand (defined as year-end 
inventory divided by cost of sales per week for the last 26 weeks) 
has increased by 20% from 8.4 weeks to 10.3 weeks. 
The trade receivables balance has increased to £9.5 million 
compared to £7.0 million in 2015 with an increase of £1.8 million 
in Multiplay trade receivables due to the growth of this business. 
The impact of the 53rd week on the trade payables balance has 
brought in an additional supplier payment run at the calendar 
month end which has reduced the overall trade payables 
balance to £31.6 million, £6.2 million lower than 2015.
Current trading and outlook 
Trading for the first 10 weeks of the year has been in line 
with Group plans. Looking forward, we remain encouraged 
by the line-up of new games as well as exciting console and 
VR launches scheduled for release over our peak period and 
the next 12 months. These developments will provide impetus 
to our markets and fresh opportunities to engage with both 
existing and new customers. 
Nevertheless, the Group needs to balance these positive 
future market events with the prevailing trading conditions. 
Accordingly, at this stage the Board retains a cautious outlook 
and reaffirms its previous guidance for the year. The Board 
expects Adjusted EBITDA for FY16-17 to be broadly level to the 
current year (on a 52 week basis), before the financial impact 
of its planned new live gaming activities and the impact of the 
property sale and leaseback announced on 28 September 2016. 
Based on the roll-out of the new stand-alone gaming venues 
and in-store gaming arenas currently planned, the Group 
expects to incur a small loss across these activities in the first 
year. Dependent on the success of these initial trials, the Group 
may decide to accelerate the roll-out and increase investment 
to support the development of this opportunity.
Going concern
The Directors have considered the activities and performance 
of the Group together with factors which could potentially affect 
future developments as set out more fully in the Strategic 
report. After careful consideration the Directors believe that the 
Group has sufficient cash resources and appropriate financing 
facilities to ensure payments can be made as they fall due.
In making their assessment the Directors have reviewed the 
Group’s latest budget and forecasts and considered reasonably 
possible downside sensitivities in performance and mitigating 
actions. These indicate that the Group will operate within its 
cash resources, financing facilities and covenants. Accordingly 
the financial statements have been prepared on the going 
concern basis.
Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 2014 revision of the 
Code, the Directors have assessed the viability of the Company 
and Group over a longer period than the 12 months required 
by the Going Concern reporting requirements. The Directors 
concluded that an assessment period of three years to July 2019 
is appropriate as this is consistent with the Group’s three year 
plan process. The three year plan takes into consideration the 
current and expected future market conditions and latest and 
projected trading performance, the Group’s strategy, plans and 
the principal risks outlined in the Strategic report.
In assessing viability, the Directors have considered the 
principal risks facing the Group and modelled reasonable 
downside scenarios to analyse the cash and debt balances and 
headroom available. This modelling included the potential for 
and effectiveness of mitigating actions. Various scenarios were 
modelled, some of which took account of the impact of plausible 
multiple risks occurring and these included faster declines in 
the console market including lower sales of physical software; 
slower growth in profits from its newly acquired businesses of 
Multiplay and Ads Reality; and higher capital investment to help 
deliver faster future diversification. The results of this scenario 
testing showed positive headroom on the debt facilities 
available against reasonable sensitivities taking account of 
mitigating actions over the three year assessment period.
Based on this assessment and after careful consideration, the 
Directors believe that it is reasonable to expect that the Group 
will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due over the period to 31 July 2019.
The Strategic report has been approved by the Board of 
Directors on 12 October 2016 and is signed on its behalf by:

Our people 
OVERVIEW
At GAME we recognise that operating 
responsibly is crucial in underpinning the 
foundations on which our strategy is built 
upon. We are committed to building the 
most valuable community of gamers 
and that commitment goes beyond our 
customers and colleagues to include 
suppliers, stakeholders and partners. 
This section discusses how GAME 
operates as a responsible business and 
focuses on, amongst other things, the 
way we treat our employees and our 
approach to health and safety and the 
environment.

OPERATING RESPONSIBLY We employ more than 4,700 members of staff across the UK 
and Spain and we recognise that our people are key to the 
success of the business. We are committed to supporting our 
staff and we continue to offer a number of initiatives to attract, 
engage and retain a motivated workforce. 
Career development and training 
We are dedicated to recruiting and retaining a skilled, passionate 
and motivated workforce and providing a clear career path to as 
many of our team as possible. We have a number of programmes 
in place across both the UK and Spain to ensure we support skills 
development and career progression.
During the year much of the focus of our training and 
development within our retail stores has been around the 
importance of the customer. We’ve looked to improve our 
customer service by ensuring that our teams are equipped to 
have engaging conversations with each customer, and can deliver 
a high level of product knowledge. The key development in our 
training approach has been ‘Pass it on training’ where we develop 
our Store Managers by giving them the base knowledge of how to 
cascade training through their store teams. This in turn instils in 
store managers the understanding of ‘how’ to deliver key areas of 
the business, such as GAMEtronics or new product launches. 
We’ve looked to improve our customer service 
by ensuring that our teams are equipped to have 
engaging conversations with each customer.
Many of our store managers are offered opportunities to fulfil 
secondments in exciting new roles, whether that be to ‘acting 
regional manager’ or project style work in our head office. We 
also have many successful examples of people from our retail 
stores who have progressed their careers and have brought all 
of their great knowledge and enthusiasm to fulfil permanent 
vacancies in our central teams, or in the wider Group, for 
example in Multiplay.

Rewards and benefits 
We recognise that rewarding employees is key to maintaining 
a motivated workforce so in the last year we have implemented 
a number of initiatives to offer real benefits.
We offer employee discounts 
and employee borrowing to all 
members of staff and we run a 
defined contribution Company 
pension scheme in the UK. We 
also offer a range of incentives 
and management bonuses 
related to both Company and 
individual performance to 
encourage active engagement 
with the success of the business. 
Our approved benefits scheme 
‘GAME Benefits You’, provides 
employees access to wide-
ranging benefits such as our 
cycle-to-work scheme, as well 
as hundreds of offers from 
other high street retailers, 
supermarkets and more. The 
Company will again this year 
be able to share the Group’s 
success with our employees 
by paying a dividend to all 
employees who were gifted 
with free shares during 
GAME’s IPO process.
Our award-winning e-learning site, GAME Learning Zone, has 
enhanced the training and development we’ve been able to offer 
since it was launched in April 2015. The site has nearly 450,000 
pieces of content completed by employees, with an average of 
around 150 pieces of content being completed on an annual 
basis per learner. It is constantly evolving and there is continued 
development with publishers to ensure that content is up to date 
and delivered in a timely manner for our employees to become 
true specialists.

60 In our distribution centre we’ve focused on the training of core 
skills to our operatives to ensure a solid base of knowledge 
and understanding enabling them to fully maximise the career 
opportunities GAME can offer. Additionally, we have focused 
on developing the management and leadership skills of our 
Team Leaders and Managers to drive greater efficiency 
and performance. 
In 2016 we launched a new Performance Management System 
to ensure employees understand both the objectives of the 
Company and how they can individually contribute to this. 
As part of this launch we’ll be ensuring that achievement and 
development is tracked throughout the year through regular 
conversations between managers and their teams, as well 
as a formal performance review each year.
Equal opportunities 
GAME is an equal opportunities employer and believes that 
equality and diversity are key to a positive working environment. 
We positively encourage job applications from any suitably 
qualified, eligible candidates regardless of the individual’s 
gender, race, disability, age, sexual preference, religion 
or belief, marital or parental status. We also ensure that 
necessary arrangements are made to support the continued 
employment of employees who become disabled during their 
time with the Group. We believe that employees should be 
treated with dignity and respect and everyone is given an equal 
opportunity to reach their potential. It is GAME’s firm intention 
to create a climate free from bullying and harassment and 
in which all employees feel confident in raising concerns of 
this kind and have them dealt with quickly, sensitively and 
effectively. We do not tolerate any acts of discrimination at any 
level and we have a Diversity and Respect Policy to detail this. 
This policy is communicated to all employees, and managers 
receive training to ensure that they understand its requirements 
in relation to their own teams. We take disciplinary action 
against any employee found to be in breach of this policy and 
we track and audit any such action to ensure it is consistent 
across our business. 
Health and safety 
We are committed to providing a safe and healthy work 
environment for our employees and customers. Minimising 
risk, preventing accidents and maintaining welfare is essential, 
and we regularly review and make improvements to our policy 
and procedures. We promote a positive safety culture by 
maintaining high standards of health and safety in the 
workplace, training and educating our managers and 
employees, effective communication and implementation 
of improvements through our health and safety committees 
across the Group with three committees in Game Spain, three 
in Game UK and one for Multiplay. 
All senior health and safety management are NEBOSH (The 
National Examination Board in Occupational Safety and Health) 
qualified practitioners and we will be training all our Risk 
investigators to IOSH (Institute of Occupational Safety and 
Health) standard this year to strengthen the physical presence 
of health and safety experts across all our trading locations. 
We have also appointed a new NEBOSH qualified health and 
safety manager as an additional resource in order to support 
the distribution centre, head office and stores' health and safety 
teams. The continuation of our proactive approach has delivered 
completion of legionella risk assessments in all our UK 
locations and we have commenced a complete refresh of the 
Health & Safety management standard in the Distribution 
Centre (UK). In Multiplay, the health and safety resource has 
been strengthened from a third-party advisory capacity to a 
NEBOSH qualified dedicated internal resource to support a 
safe growth in activities.
In Game Spain we completed a voluntary audit of the health 
and safety management system to identify opportunities to 
implement improvements along with completion of the 
mandatory four-yearly regulatory audit. We are also evaluating 
employee well-being through a survey and will follow up with 
any corrective actions to reduce workplace risks.
Employee communication 
Keeping employees engaged with what is happening around 
the business and excited about the future is key to our success. 
We update employees regularly through a number of events 
throughout the year, as well as encouraging ongoing 
communication within the Group. This proactive approach 
to communication aids employee awareness of the development 
of the business, financial performance, key priorities and future 
plans as well as providing updates on market developments and 
activities that can affect the performance of the Group such as 
new console launches. 
So that we can tap into the passion, expertise and enthusiasm 
we have in our business, we’ve been looking at ways to regularly 
discuss a number of different topics with our teams including 
career paths available to our people, new business ventures 
we have undertaken, product launches, peak planning and the 
future strategy of our business. In 2016 we launched a GAME 
voice forum made up of elected individuals from across the 
business. This forum will provide a powerful platform for 
representatives to come together and voice opinion across 
a host of important discussions. This new voice forum will 
complement the DC Employee Council for our Distribution 
Centre and the M.A.D. (Make a Difference) Team for our Head 
Office who have been making GAME a great place to work since 
being launched in 2014.

At Group level our comprehensive intranet sites contain detailed 
information available to all employees. Our main UK intranet 
site, The Grid, also has a social element enabling employees 
to easily communicate and engage with each other. In addition 
we hold regular business briefings and share written 
communications across the entire Group. Last year we carried 
out an employee engagement survey where each department 
met to discuss the outcomes in their area and compiled an 
action plan of how to improve engagement. Throughout the year 
we’ve carried out pulse surveys to assess the impact changes 
in the business have had on engagement. 
In retail we hold two events for Store Managers annually – 
a conference and a roadshow. The conference brings together 
more than 350 managers over four days to hear from suppliers 
and senior leaders ahead of our peak trading period, whilst the 
roadshows bring together managers in smaller regional groups 
allowing for focus on strategic and operational aims and the 
opportunity to feed back information to senior leaders. These 
events allow us to give strategic updates on the business, 
highlight key business initiatives, product launches and other 
important business opportunities.
Towards the end of 2016 we are launching an all new induction 
module, using the GAME Learning Zone, that will ensure all new 
employees across the Group have the opportunity to start to 
connect with the GAME culture before their start day. New 
starters will have information about their role and the wider 
business in the first weeks of their employment so they get up to 
speed as quickly as possible and are engaged with the business.
Our community
Protecting our younger customers 
We take the issue of age-related video games and the potential 
risk of a sale to underage children very seriously. As such, we 
have a three-pronged approach aimed at preventing the sale 
of inappropriate products: 
1.  Commitment and adherence to the Pan European Game 
Information (PEGI) system 
2.  Rigorous staff training on age-related sales policies 
and procedures 
3.  Monitoring store compliance with Age Related Sales 
guidelines set by the Video Standards Council.
Age-related sales training is completed on every employee’s 
first day working in-store, and then regularly throughout the 
year. This focuses our staff on compliance to all processes and 
helps to ensure they understand the importance of, and risks 
associated with, the sale of age-related products. Further to 
this, we also introduced our GAME Junior initiative where we 
have areas within our stores and website dedicated to younger 
gamers. We use GAME Junior to guide parents, gift givers and 
children to appropriate age-related games and products.
Ethical trading and human rights 
GAME is committed to the protection of the environment as 
well as the personal rights of individuals. When sourcing 
quality products for our business, we endeavour to partner 
with suppliers that share our core principles. We look to ensure 
that our suppliers maintain satisfactory working conditions 
and comply with all legal requirements and labour, health and 
safety, human rights and environmental protection standards 
of those countries in which their businesses operate. To ensure 
this high standard is met, we will only trade with suppliers who 
share our principles. In the event of non-compliance, GAME 
will work with our suppliers to move towards compliance with 
our principles. We have been updating our procedures and 
processes in light of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and a detailed 
description of the activities undertaken in this area will be 
included in our Slavery and Human Trafficking statement which 
will be available to view on our website from January 2017 at 
www.gamedigitalplc.com

CONTINUED Social media 
GAME’s social communities are incredibly important to the 
business. We have national Facebook, Twitter and YouTube 
accounts and, in addition, each store has their own Twitter and 
Facebook page. We see social media as an important tool to 
interact and engage with our customers so we encourage our 
employees to participate. Our Social Media Team work closely 
with all teams to raise awareness and understanding of social 
media, this includes a dedicated resource to help store teams 
with their efforts. 
We clearly communicate our expectations and standards 
of conduct through a Social Media Policy which covers an 
employee’s personal, non-work use of social media as well 
as use in an official capacity when acting on behalf of GAME.
Data protection 
GAME’s Data Protection Policy sets out rules on data protection 
and the legal conditions that must be satisfied in relation to the 
obtaining, handling, processing, storage, transportation and 
destruction of personal information. The Policy covers details of 
current, past and prospective employees, suppliers, customers 
and any others we communicate with. GAME complies with its 
applicable statutory requirements surrounding customer data 
protection, including the Data Protection Acts of 1998 and 1999 
in the UK and Spain respectively. Anyone processing personal 
data must comply with strict principles of good practice. 
We ensure that appropriate security measures are taken 
against the unlawful or unauthorised processing of personal 
data and against the accidental loss of or damage to personal 
data. We do not transfer data unless adequate protections are in 
place, both within and outside of the UK. Several improvements 
have been made to our Data Protection processes following the 
results of a Data Protection Audit conducted during late 2015. 
We will continue to monitor and develop to ensure we achieve 
consistently high levels of data protection. We have already 
started work to ensure we will be fully compliant with the EU 
General Data Protection Regulation when it comes into force 
on 25 May 2018.
Community projects and charitable causes
As part of GAME’s commitment to community projects and 
charitable causes, both the business and its employees have 
worked extensively to raise awareness and funds for a number 
of national and local campaigns. Following a company-wide 
survey inviting employees to choose a charity they would most 
like to support, GAME UK will be partnering with the gamers' 
charity SpecialEffect throughout the coming year to help raise
funds for their work. SpecialEffect is a UK-based charity which 
uses video games and technology to enhance the quality of life 
of people with disabilities. An initial donation of over £80,000 
was presented in August and was raised in GAME stores around 
the country through plastic bag sales and money collection pots 
at the tills.

Our environment
GAME is committed to fulfilling its statutory obligations and 
minimising the impact of its activities on the environment. 
We comply with the EU Energy Efficiency Directive 2012 (EED) 
and this year we have completed the rollout of smart meters 
which allow us to measure our total energy consumption from 
buildings. We have also undertaken an energy audit of at least 
90% of our energy consumption and identify cost-effective 
opportunities to improve energy efficiency. All new and re-fitted 
stores have energy-saving LED lighting installed and 20 stores 
have had energy-saving control systems installed.
WEEE and recycling 
As an electrical retailer the Group fulfils all statutory 
obligations in respects of WEEE (Waste Electrical & Electronic 
Equipment Regulations 2013) and the EU Directive on Packaging 
and Packaging Waste (94/62/EC). We actively promote WEEE 
to customers as a means of disposing of their old redundant 
consoles, peripherals and electronic devices when they 
purchase a like-for-like item from any GAME store. In addition 
to this we also provide a battery service for customers, any 
used batteries can be brought in to store irrespective of where 
purchased for recycling.
Last year alone we collected and disposed of c.41.6 tonnes of 
WEEE waste including batteries through the distribution centre. 
In addition we collected a further quantity of batteries through 
our store network that is returned directly to our processing 
partner for recycling. Waste card packaging is collated at all 
stores and distribution centres for recycling and last year we 
recycled 394.8 tonnes of cardboard from our UK distribution 
centre alone. Various initiatives are also in place at head office 
in the UK and Spain including the recycling of paper, cardboard 
and plastic. 
Greenhouse Gas emissions 
This report details GAME Digital plc’s Greenhouse Gas 
emissions for the period ended 30 July 2016.
Applying an operational control approach we have identified 
relevant activity data for Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions with 
the support of an independent consultant, Carbon Clear. 
Data from all emission sources has been collected and the 
validity and completeness of the data set has been checked 
by Carbon Clear. Our total Greenhouse Gas emissions 
have been calculated following the requirements of the 
ISO 14064-1:2006 standard for carbon reporting and using 
DEFRA 2016 emission factors. 
Our baseline year is 2014-15. In accordance with The Companies 
Act 2006 (Strategic report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 
2013, we report an intensity ratio of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions 
in tonnes of CO 2e per £million revenue. We also report on some 
Scope 3 categories, as this data is being used internally to drive 
emission and cost reductions. 
The results for Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions are presented below, 
along with our intensity ratio for the period ended 30 July 2016. 
The total emissions this year were 12,718 tCO 2e, compared to 
14,022 tCO 2e for the previous year. This is an overall reduction 
of 9.3%. The main reason for this shift was a decrease of over 
10% from purchased electricity, the Company’s single biggest 
source of carbon emissions.

CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION TO  
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  I am pleased to present our Corporate Governance Statement 
on behalf of the Board. My principal role is to lead the Board 
and ensure that it operates effectively to help deliver 
shareholder value and promote the long-term success of 
the Company. Good corporate governance underpins this role 
and the Board aims to ensure that good standards of corporate 
governance are upheld throughout the Group. The Group has 
developed a corporate governance framework designed to 
ensure that the business operates with integrity and in 
compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code. Equally, 
governance is organised so that it does not detract from the 
entrepreneurial spirit of the management of the Group’s 
activities. I believe that the Group has maintained sufficient 
systems of internal control and open communication that gives 
Board members access to the correct level of information 
required for them to challenge and fulfil their role.
Last year I reported that Mark Gifford would be taking on the role 
of Chief Financial Officer and I am pleased to report that Mark 
joined the Board on 1 October 2015. Mark has over 20 years 
of experience in the retail and consumer sector. Following a 
successful induction to the Board we are already seeing that 
his skills and experience have strengthened the executive team 
in helping to support and deliver the business strategy.
Towards the end of the financial year, the Board carried out 
an informal review of the Board composition and effectiveness. 
This confirmed the Board’s view that the Non-Executive Directors 
offer the right mix of skills and experience to assist in the 
development of the strategic direction and the implementation 
of the necessary changes to the business given the challenges 
in our sector of the retail market. I am therefore satisfied that 
the Board operates effectively. Further details regarding the 
findings from the annual internal Board review are set out in 
this statement.
As part of my announcement on 9 September 2016 of my 
decision to step down from the Board we announced John 
Jackson, our current Senior Independent Director, as Chairman 
designate. Subject to shareholder approval, John Jackson will 
assume the role of Chairman of the Board at the conclusion 
of the Annual General Meeting in January 2017. Succession 
planning to ensure that we have an effective Board has been an 
important process this year. I believe that in John Jackson the 
Board has selected a seasoned Non-Executive Chairman who 
will be a great asset as the business moves forward. Under his 
leadership the Board will endeavour to ensure that adequate 
and effective corporate governance structures within the Group 
remain in the best interests of stakeholders whilst promoting 
shareholder value and the long-term success of the Company.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS
CONTINUED Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code
Throughout the year including up to the date of this Annual 
Report, the Company has been in compliance with the 
provisions set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code 
as revised in September 2014 (the ‘Code’) which is publicly 
available to view at www.frc.org.uk. The Code sets out 
standards of practice in relation to Board leadership and 
effectiveness, accountability, remuneration and relations 
with shareholders.
The Company acknowledges that revisions were made to the 
Code in April 2016 and, in line with reporting requirements, will 
report to shareholders on its compliance with the revised code 
in next year’s Corporate Governance Statement.
The requirement under the Listing Rules to produce a statement 
of how the ‘Main Principles’ set out in the Code have been applied 
is set out on our corporate website at www.gamedigitalplc.com. 
Detail needed in line with the specific provisions of the Code is 
set out in this Corporate Governance Statement.
Share Dealing Code
The Company approved a new Share Dealing Code towards 
the end of the financial year, to take account of Regulation (EU) 
No. 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council on 
Market Abuse which came into force on 3 July 2016, and applies 
to companies listed on the main market of the London Stock 
Exchange. The Company’s new Share Dealing Code applies to 
Board Directors, any additional identified individuals with senior 
managerial responsibility, together categorised as Persons 
Discharging Managerial Responsibility (‘PDMR’) and to certain 
employees of Group companies. All PDMR’s are responsible 
for ensuring compliance of those individuals to whom they are 
closely associated in line with the Company’s Share Dealing 
Code. Although the Model Code has now been removed, the 
Company will continue to follow best practice guidance 
published by the Financial Conduct Authority. 
Relations with shareholders
The Board recognises the importance of creating a clear flow 
of communication with all of the Company’s stakeholders, 
including shareholders, particularly with regard to business 
developments and financial results. The Board aims to 
communicate on a regular basis through news releases, 
investor presentations and Company publications. As part 
of an active investor relations programme, the Company met 
with all its major shareholders and a number of prospective 
investors over the course of the year.
Regular updates are given to the Board by the Investor Relations 
Director, who also provides an immediate point of contact for 
the Non-Executive Directors to develop an understanding of the 
views major shareholders hold about the Company. The AGM 
provides an opportunity for the Chairman to explain the 
Company’s progress and, along with other members of the 
Board, to answer any questions raised by shareholders. All 
Directors attended the 2015 AGM.
In line with the Code, the Board has appointed John Jackson 
as the current Senior Independent Director. In his role as 
Senior Independent Director, John is available to shareholders 
throughout the year if they have concerns that contact through 
the normal channels of the Chairman or other Executive 
Directors have failed to resolve, or in circumstances where 
such channels of communication are inappropriate.
Leadership
Board structure 
The Code recommends that the board of directors of FTSE 
350 UK public listed companies includes an appropriate 
combination of Executive and Non-Executive Directors, with 
independent Non-Executive Directors comprising at least half 
the Board (excluding the Chairman). The Board comprises 
a Non-Executive Chairman, two Executive Directors, three 
independent Non-Executive Directors and one other Non-
Executive Director. The Company regards John Jackson, Lesley 
Watkins and Caspar Woolley as independent Non-Executive 
Directors for the purposes of the Code and believe the Board 
structure is in the best interests of shareholders.
Division of responsibilities
For the Board to remain effective, the Code requires a clear 
division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive Officer. These positions are currently held by David 
Hamid as Chairman and Martyn Gibbs as Chief Executive 
Officer. The division of responsibilities between the Chairman 
and the Chief Executive Officer is set out as a statement and 
available to view on the Company’s corporate website at 
www.gamedigitalplc.com.
The Chairman reports to the Board and is the guardian of the 
Board’s decision-making processes. He is responsible for the 
effective running of the Board, and provides information on the 
Company’s financial performance as well as corporate issues 
requiring attention for discussion by the Board. 
The Chief Executive Officer, assisted by senior management, 
is responsible for proposing and developing the Company’s 
strategy and commercial objectives for consideration by the 
Board, and for implementing the decisions of the Board into 
the day-to-day functions of the business.
The Non-Executives’ key responsibilities are to bring strong 
advice, judgement and independent challenge to the Executive 
Directors. Papers are distributed on a timely basis in advance of 
meetings and are of a quality appropriate to enable the Board to 
discharge its responsibilities.

Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT Decision-making and conflicts of interest
No individual or group of individuals dominates the Board’s 
decision-making process. In accordance with the Company’s 
articles of association, procedures are in place for the 
disclosure by Directors, in advance, of any situational conflicts 
and for the consideration and authorisation of these conflicts 
by the Board. As at the date of this report, none of the Directors 
have any potential conflict of interest between their duties to the 
Company and their private interests and/or duties owed to third 
parties, save that Franck Tuil represents Duodi Investments 
S.à r.l. (the ‘Major Shareholder’), which has been recognised 
and approved by the Board as a potential general conflict.
On 6 June 2014 the Company, the Major Shareholder and Baker 
Partners LP entered into a relationship agreement which 
regulates the ongoing relationship between the Company and 
the Major Shareholder (the ‘Duodi Relationship Agreement’). 
In addition, on 10 March 2015 the Company and the Chairman 
entered into a relationship agreement in recognition of the 
historic connection between the Chairman and the Major 
Shareholder (the ‘Hamid Relationship Agreement’, and 
together with the Duodi Relationship Agreement the 
‘Relationship Agreements’).
The Duodi Relationship Agreement will remain in place until 
the Duodi Associates (as defined in the Duodi Relationship 
Agreement), together with any person(s) with whom they are 
acting in concert, cease individually or in aggregate to hold a 
direct or indirect interest in 10 per cent or more of the ordinary 
shares. The Hamid Relationship Agreement will remain in place 
until the Chairman, together with any person(s) with whom he 
is acting in concert, ceases individually or in aggregate to be 
a Controlling Shareholder(s) (as defined by the Listing Rules) 
in the Company. In addition, both Relationship Agreements will 
terminate upon the Company ceasing to maintain a listing on 
the premium segment of the Official List.
The Company has, during the period under review, complied 
with the independence provisions included in the Relationship 
Agreements and, so far as the Company is aware, the Major 
Shareholder, Baker Partners LP and David Hamid (and each 
of their respective associates) have complied with the 
independence provisions included in the Duodi Relationship 
Agreement and the Hamid Relationship Agreement, respectively, 
during the period under review.
Appointment of Non-Executive Director and observer by the 
major shareholder
Under the Duodi Relationship Agreement, for so long as the 
Major Shareholder and its associates, together with any person 
with whom they are acting in concert, hold in aggregate, either 
directly or indirectly, an interest in 10 per cent or more in the 
aggregate voting rights in the Company, the Major Shareholder 
will be entitled to nominate one person to be a Non-Executive 
Director on the Board and one observer. Franck Tuil is the 
appointed representative of the Major Shareholder and a 
Non-Executive Director. Franck is also an employee of Elliott 
Advisors (UK) Limited, the sub-adviser to the investment 
services provider to the funds which have a majority interest 
in the Major Shareholder. Franck’s appointment letter requires 
him to act in the best interest of the Company notwithstanding 
his connection with the Major Shareholder. Franck is not 
considered to be independent for the purposes of the Code. 
The appointed observer is entitled to receive notice of Board 
meetings, including all Board papers, and to attend and speak 
at Board meetings, but is not entitled to vote.
Board responsibilities and procedures
The Board is responsible for overseeing the Group, and 
is therefore ultimately responsible for the success and 
performance of the business. The Board’s responsibilities, 
as set out in its schedule of matters reserved for the Board, 
include:
 — developing and approving business strategy and policies
 — approving the annual operating plan, the Annual Report and 
financial statements, and major acquisitions and disposals
 — consideration of funding and capital structure
 — ensuring high standards of corporate governance
 — assessing systems of internal control including risk 
management
 — approving Board and Board committee composition and 
changes to executive and senior management.
The types of decisions deferred to management revolve around 
the day-to-day running of the business, execution of strategy 
and approved capital expenditure projects with the financial 
delegated authorities in place as a control mechanism.

Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information Board committees
There are three main committees of the Board: an Audit and 
Risk Committee, a Nomination Committee and a Remuneration 
Committee. A Share Plans Committee was also established 
during the year, with a specific remit to administer the Company’s 
share plans. Each committee has formally delegated duties and 
responsibilities set out in its written terms of reference. If the 
need should arise, the Board may establish additional committees 
to consider specific issues as appropriate.
In line with each of the committees’ terms of reference, only 
members of the relevant committee have the right to attend and 
vote at its meetings. Committee meetings are also attended by 
the Company Secretary, who also acts as the secretary to each 
of the committees. When appropriate, non-committee members 
on the Board including the Executive Directors can be invited to 
attend all or part of any committee meeting.
The matters reserved for the Board and the terms of reference 
of each of the Board committees are available on the Company’s 
corporate website at www.gamedigitalplc.com.
Details of each of the main Board-appointed committees and 
their activities during the year are set out in the separate 
committee reports on pages 79 to 102, which are incorporated 
into the Corporate Governance Statement by reference.
Health and Safety Committee
The Board is committed to providing a safe working 
environment for all employees, contractors and partners across 
the Group. The Chief Executive receives and reviews a health 
and safety report on a monthly basis and where health and 
safety matters need to be brought to the Board’s attention, 
these are included as part of the Chief Executive’s monthly 
report. The Board also receives a more structured in-depth 
health and safety report and presentation bi-annually. The 
management of health and safety is supported by a committee 
in the UK, although this is not a formally adopted sub-
committee of the Board. This committee meets quarterly 
to ensure that health and safety is managed effectively 
and proactively. Duties of the Health and Safety Committee 
include reviewing the health and safety policy; compliance 
with applicable health and safety directives and legislation; 
monitoring health and safety statistics, including incident rates 
and near misses and health and safety audit findings. In Spain, 
health and safety is managed through existing reporting lines 
that feed up through the Chief Executive Officer to the Board; 
this is seen as more appropriate for the size of the Company.
Effectiveness
Board evaluation
The Board conducted an internal review during the year to 
evaluate the effectiveness of the Board and its committees. 
A questionnaire-based approach was adopted with input 
from the Company Secretary and the Chairman to ensure 
the questions were appropriately tailored to the Group. Board 
members were invited to respond via an external portal, to 
preserve confidentiality and anonymity. The Chairman reviewed 
the collated responses before presenting to the Board in full 
for discussion. 
Follow-up action was agreed to address certain areas highlighted 
for improvement in relation to succession planning. The Board 
concluded that in the majority of areas it operated effectively 
and that it had made good progress in the development of the 
Board’s approach to risk management and setting its risk 
appetite. It is envisaged that another internal review be 
conducted during the forthcoming year in line with the Code 
requirements for smaller listed companies. 
Meetings between the Chairman and the independent 
Non-Executive Directors in the absence of the Executive 
Directors were held twice during the year. The Senior 
Independent Director also met with the independent 
Non-Executive Directors in the absence of the Chairman 
to appraise his performance during the year.
Development and advice
The Directors of all Group companies, as well as the Board, 
also have access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary. Independent external legal and professional advice 
can also be taken when it is necessary to do so. Furthermore, 
each committee of the Board has access to sufficient and 
tailored resources to carry out its duties. A personalised 
induction and subsequent training is provided to new members 
of the Board and its committees.
Meetings and attendance
The Board intends to meet approximately 10 times a year and 
may meet at other times as required or otherwise at the request 
of one or more of the Directors. During the year the Board met 
on 12 occasions. Where urgent decisions are required on 
matters specifically reserved for the Board between meetings, 
there is a process in place to facilitate discussion and decision-
making. The Directors regularly communicate and exchange 
information irrespective of the timing of meetings.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
CONTINUED External directorships
With reference to the external commitments of the Chairman, 
these are set out in his Biography on page 70. The Chairman 
stepped down from his role as Chairman of Ideal Shopping 
Direct Limited and Music for Youth during the year. The Board 
is comfortable with the level of external directorships of its 
independent Non-Executive Directors on the basis that it sees 
the Company benefiting from their current appointments due 
to the additional experience and expertise which they can bring 
to the Board. None of the Executive Directors hold external 
directorships which the Board considers to be of significance; 
Mark Gifford is a Non-Executive Director of a private investment 
fund for which he receives a fee of £7,500 p.a. and Martyn Gibbs 
is a Director of one dormant company for which he receives 
no fee.
Confirmation of the number of meetings of the Board and the attendance by the Directors for the financial year is set out in the

Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information Accountability
Board remit, governance and internal controls 
The Board remains ultimately accountable for matters that are 
clearly defined and are contained in its ‘Matters Reserved for 
the Board’. The Board as a whole will discuss, challenge and 
give approval on the financial statements. 
The Board also retains its responsibility to approve the annual 
budget. Monitoring of the annual budget, following approval, 
is carried out through regular updates circulated as part of the 
Chief Financial Officer’s report to the Board. In addition, the 
Board will review all significant capital expenditure requests 
individually, after a general approval for the capital expenditure 
budget has been granted. Measures such as these maintain 
adequate levels of control and scrutiny over the budget and 
capital expenditure at Board level. In relation to the Board’s 
responsibility to approve the financial statements, the Board 
sets out its Directors’ Responsibility Statement on page 109.
The Board recognises that its committees are only empowered 
to make recommendations to the Board for their approval, 
unless a specific authorisation to approve certain matters is 
granted. To facilitate information flows, a verbal update is given 
by the Chairman of the relevant committee in the subsequent 
Board meeting following a committee meeting.
Assessment of risk management and internal control
The Board is responsible for the Company’s overall approach 
to risk management and for identifying and managing the 
Group’s principal risks. This is discussed further under the 
Risk Management section on page 41. The risk management 
framework and processes have been the subject of 
considerable review and improvement by the Board during 
the year and there were no reported material control failures. 
This has lead the Board to conclude that the systems of internal 
control and risk management are effective and have complied 
with the requirements of the Code during the year.
In reaching this assessment, the Board has considered whether 
the events leading up to the December trading update constituted 
a significant control failure and have concluded that they did 
not. The Board determined that external factors beyond its 
reasonable control in the broader UK gaming market led to 
a decline in trading performance. Furthermore, the Board 
recognises the further improvements made in the risk 
management and internal control systems operated by 
the Group.
Details of the internal controls of the Company and the manner 
in which the Board and its committees assess the effectiveness 
of internal controls during the year are set out as part of the 
Audit and Risk Committee Report on pages 82 to 87. This 
includes activities undertaken by the Board with the support 
of the Audit and Risk Committee and a description of the 
main features of its internal control and risk management 
arrangements in relation to the financial reporting process.
Preserving and enhancing shareholder value
An explanation of the basis on which the Company generated 
and seeks to preserve and enhance shareholder value over 
the long term and the strategy for delivering the objectives 
for the Group is set out in the Strategic report on pages 7 to 65 
which is incorporated by reference into the Corporate 
Governance Statement.
The Going Concern Statement together with the Viability 
Statement is set out in the Strategic report on page 58 
and by reference is incorporated as part of the Corporate 
Governance Statement.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
CONTINUED Committee members
John Jackson and Lesley Watkins, both independent Non-
Executive Directors are members of the Committee. There 
have been no changes to the membership of the Committee 
during the year. Full career profiles of the Board and Committee 
members can be found under Board of Directors on pages 
70 to 71. The Board is satisfied that the collective skills and 
experience of the Committee continues to provide sufficient 
commercial and sector-related expertise to meet the needs 
of the role the Committee plays.
Responsibilities
The key responsibilities of the Committee are set out in the 
Committee’s written terms of reference. These can be found 
under the Corporate Governance section of the corporate 
website, www.gamedigitalplc.com, and include:
 — making recommendations to the Board in respect of 
appointments to the Board and to the committees of 
the Board
 — keeping the structure, size and composition of the Board 
under regular review
 — making recommendations to the Board with regard to 
any changes necessary.
Work of the Committee
The Committee convened three times during the year to 
evaluate the Board. Attendance at the meetings is set out 
in the Corporate Governance Statement on page 77 and 
below. The Company Secretary (who acts as secretary to 
the Committee) and Caspar Woolley as an independent 
Non-Executive Director are regularly invited to attend. The 
CEO also attends by invitation from time to time as requested.
Summary of key activities during the year
In 2015-16 the principal activities focused on by the 
Committee were:
 — approval of the 2015 Nomination Committee Report
 — review of the UK senior management team structure
 — recruitment of a Chief Operating Officer
 — succession planning for the role of Chairman of the Board
 — annual review of Board size, structure and composition 
including time commitment

DAVID HAMID
CHAIRMAN OF THE NOMINATION COMMITTEE
I am pleased to present the report of the 
Nomination Committee (the ‘Committee’)  
in respect of the year 2015-16 and in consideration 
of the ongoing work of the Committee.
In 2015-16, the Committee’s main tasks were the 
induction of Mark Gifford as our new CFO, who 
joined the Company on 1 October 2015, and the 
work carried out relating to the succession of the 
Chairman of the Board.
As previously announced, John Jackson will 
succeed me as Chairman of the Company and as 
Chairman of this Committee, subject to his election 
by shareholders, from the conclusion of the AGM in 
January 2017. I am pleased that John Jackson, with 
his knowledge and understanding of the business, 
will take on the role and lead the future work of 
the Committee.

NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT Succession planning
Throughout the year succession planning, not only for a new 
Chairman but also for senior management positions, was the 
principal focus of the Nomination Committee’s three formal 
meetings. The review of the senior management structure and 
recruitment of a Chief Operating Officer in the UK will assist the 
business in strengthening its operational leadership team as 
well as planning for the future. 
During the year, the Committee also carried out its ongoing 
corporate governance review in regard to the size, structure 
and composition of the Board and was satisfied that it remained 
appropriate. The announcement that the Chairman will step 
down from the Board at the conclusion of the AGM in January 
2017 led to a further review of the Board’s composition. The 
Committee recommended to the Board that the Chairs of the 
Audit and Risk Committee and the Remuneration Committee 
be appointed from the existing independent Non-Executive 
Directors, following the decision to internally promote the Senior 
Independent Director to Chairman. It was agreed that the role of 
the Senior Independent Director and the potential recruitment of 
an additional Non-Executive Director would be kept under review. 
The current required time commitment for the role of Chairman 
and for the Non-Executive Directors was considered to be 
sufficient, with recognition that additional responsibilities going 
forward would be treated separately. 
In regard to succession planning for the position of Chairman, 
frequent informal exchanges between committee members 
and other Board Directors also took place. The Committee 
oversaw the appointment process. As part of that process, 
those independent Non-Executive Directors who did not have 
an interest in the position of Chairman of the Board canvassed 
and fed back opinions and recommendations reflective of the 
other non-conflicted Board Directors. The process considered 
the future expectations of the role and reviewed the job 
specification including key skills, knowledge, experience 
and time commitment required to fulfil the position. 
The Senior Independent Director, John Jackson, was identified 
as the most appropriate candidate taking all things into 
consideration, including his time commitments. The decision 
not to engage the services of external recruitment consultants 
was made recognising both the suitability of John Jackson and 
the business need to continue to deliver the current plans and 
strategy at optimum pace, given the innovation and change 
happening within the Group’s markets. It was considered that 
the business had recently gone through a period of significant 
change, entering into new business activities of strategic 
importance alongside its core activities. With an agreed 
strategic path in place the decision was taken that an externally 
recruited Chairman of the Board would take time to settle in 
and get to know the business at a time when it was imperative 
that the business move forward at pace. The Board agreed that 
an internal candidate would not face the further challenge of 
settling into the business. 
Acknowledgement was given that the Senior Independent 
Director had the requisite skills and knowledge of our evolving 
business and would satisfy the interests of stakeholders, 
including the major shareholders, and the management team. 
The Board concluded that John Jackson was a compelling 
candidate for the role and best placed to fulfil it, leading to 
the decision to not explore external candidates.
The Committee did retain the services of Korn Ferry to assist 
in identifying potential candidates for senior management roles 
considered by the Committee for recommendation to the Board. 
Korn Ferry has no other connection with the Company.
Following the announcement on 9 September 2016 that 
John Jackson would succeed me as Chairman of the Board, 
the Committee met to re-evaluate the size and shape of the 
Board and Board committee composition. The Committee 
recommended that the Board should revisit the position of 
Senior Independent Director at a future point in time.
The recommendation was additionally made by the Committee 
to keep the recruitment of an additional Non-Executive Director 
under review. The Committee recognise that the balance of the 
future independence of the Board should be considered in 
conjunction with ensuring that the Board maintains requisite 
skills to support the future activities of the business.
 
Induction process
Mark Gifford joined the Board on 1 October 2015. Mark 
was involved in a series of informal meetings prior to his 
commencement of the role which provided him with a good 
basis to make an early contribution to Board discussions and to 
have a good understanding of our strategy. Throughout the year 
Mark has undergone a thorough induction into the business, 
familiarising himself with operations both in the UK and Spain.
Effectiveness
The Committee is satisfied that all the independent 
Non-Executive Directors continue to fulfil the criteria of 
independence and are able to commit the required time for 
the proper performance of their duties. Furthermore, following 
formal performance evaluation, the Executive Directors 
and Non-Executive Directors continue to be effective and 
demonstrate commitment to their roles, and should be put 
forward for reappointment at the AGM with the exception of 
the outgoing Chairman.

NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT
CONTINUED Boardroom diversity
Regarding all appointments to the Board, whether for Non-
Executive or Executive positions, the Committee considers 
carefully the benefits of greater diversity, including gender and 
age, whilst ensuring that it fulfils its obligations to shareholders 
to recruit the best person to the role, on merit. Korn Ferry, the 
executive search firm used by the business, are a signatory to 
the Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms. The 
Committee ensures that the specification for any new Director 
role is equally suited to both female and male applicants.
Diversity is monitored across the Group, including gender 
and age, which are analysed on a Group-wide scale within 
the Operating Responsibly section of the Strategic report on 
page 59. Individual appointments within the Group and to the 
Board are based on individual merit and skill. Whilst the 
Group appreciates and believes in the benefits of diversity, 
appointments are not prescriptive to gender, or any other 
criteria which do not relate directly to the ability to perform 
the role. 
Taking account of appointments considered by the Nomination 
Committee and within the control of the Board (excluding the 
one Director nominated by the Major Shareholder), the female 
percentage ratio of the Board is 17 per cent, with one 
independent Non-Executive Director being female.
 
The future work of the Committee
I anticipate that the future work of the Committee will be 
to keep the size and shape of the Board under review, giving  
consideration to whether the recruitment of an additional 
Non-Executive Director is appropriate. Such a review will look 
at maintaining an appropriate balance of skills and experience 
on the Board having regard to the needs of the business. 
In addition, it is likely that the Committee will continue with 
its work on succession planning for both senior management 
and executive roles.

I am delighted to present the report  
of the Audit and Risk Committee (the  
‘Committee’) in respect of the year 2015-16.
During the year the Committee has continued 
to focus significant time and attention on the 
Group’s systems of internal control and risk 
management, the integrity of financial reporting 
and the effectiveness of both the external and 
internal auditors. I welcome the changes to the ‘UK 
Corporate Governance Code’ and the new ‘Guidance 
on Risk Management and Internal Control, Related 
Business and Financial Reporting’ published in 
September 2014 and which apply to the Company 
for the first time this year . In this report I set out the 
key activities initiated by the Committee to ensure 
we implemented the necessary changes.
Following my acceptance of the position of 
Chairman of the Board from the conclusion of the 
AGM in January 2017, this will be my last report 
as the Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee. 
I am pleased that Lesley Watkins, with her 
knowledge of the business and current financial 
experience, will take on the role and I shall look 
forward to being a member of the Committee and 
supporting its future work.

82 Summary of key activities during the year
The Committee self-evaluation in 2014-15 highlighted the 
need to develop a statement of the Board’s risk appetite 
and to continue work to improve the effectiveness of risk 
management and internal control. I am pleased to report 
considerable progress in this area, details of which can be 
found in the Internal Control and Risk Management section, 
under Risk Assessment, in this report.
In addition, the Committee has:
 — reviewed the integrity of the financial statements and 
associated disclosures at half year and full year. This 
included the appraisal of critical judgements and key 
estimates covering: loyalty, gift card, marketing income, 
inventory provisions, acquisition accounting in respect 
of Ads Reality and impairment risk in relation to the 
Multiplay acquisition
 — reviewed the results of the internal and external audits 
and has continued to monitor the timely implementation 
of corrective action. See the Internal Audit and External 
Audit sections of this report
 — assessed the effectiveness of the external auditor. See the 
External Audit section of this report
 — reviewed and approved a number of policies including: 
delegation of authority, expenses, changes to UK bank 
mandates, risk management, foreign exchange and credit 
control
 — reviewed a number of business updates covering key risk 
areas including: information security, business continuity 
and crisis management, Group insurance and divisional 
risk assessments
 — reviewed and approved the risk-based internal audit plan
 — reviewed the internal audit reports including: financial 
controls, risk management, information security, disaster 
recovery, stock management, gift card reporting and 
online order to cash
 — assessed whether the Annual Report, taken as a whole, 
is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s position and performance, business model 
and strategy. The resulting Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement can be found on page 109.
Evaluation of the Committee
The Committee undertook a self-assessment of its 
performance in July 2016, taking into account its collective 
skills and experience, the activities it has engaged in during 
the year and the effectiveness of its actions in improving the 
Company’s system of risk management and internal control. 
This assessment has been submitted to the Board and the 
Board has concluded that the Committee has operated 
effectively.
In 2016-17, the Committee will remain focused on the areas 
of activity outlined above with particular focus on: 
 — maintaining sufficient oversight of key areas of risk and, 
in particular, the effectiveness of the controls and mitigation 
plans in place
 — monitoring and anticipating changes in the Company’s risk 
profile as the business model evolves.
External Audit
Appointment, terms and remuneration for audit and audit-
related services
The Committee approved the reappointment of Deloitte LLP 
as the Group’s Statutory Auditor for 2015-16, led by Gregory 
Culshaw, ACA, who has been the Partner on the audit for three 
successive years, since incorporation.
The Committee reviewed the external audit plan, terms of 
engagement and scope of work and approved the audit fee. 
The fee for 2015-16 is estimated at £350,000, which includes 
£10,000 in respect of turnover rent certificates and £42,500 in 
respect of the fee for the interim review. The Committee was 
satisfied that the fee was appropriate to ensure an effective 
and high quality audit. See note 6 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements, Auditor Remuneration.
Non-audit services and independence
The Committee is mindful of the need to preserve auditor 
objectivity and independence. Its express approval is needed 
in all circumstances before the external auditor provides 
non-audit services. The exception to this is where the 
Committee has pre-approved certain immaterial services, 
as was the case again in 2015-16 with Deloitte LLP’s work in 
respect of the turnover rent certificates.
The external auditor did not undertake any other non-audit 
services on behalf of the Company during the year and the 
Committee has reviewed and is satisfied with Deloitte LLP’s 
independence and objectivity.

Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information Assessing the effectiveness of the external audit process
A review of the effectiveness of the external auditor and audit 
process has been undertaken with input from the Committee 
members, CFO, UK and Spanish finance teams and internal audit.
The Committee has adopted a formal assessment framework 
which covers a number of key areas, including:
 — the auditor’s independence and objectivity
 — the auditor’s knowledge and skills, particularly in relation 
to the industry and the environment in which the Company 
operates
 — the quality of the assessment of audit risk
 — the quality of the audit planning, execution and reporting 
to management
 — the role of management in facilitating an effective audit
 — the quality of professional judgement, advice and insight 
 — the quality, sufficiency and timeliness of communication 
between the auditor and the Company
 — the quality of the formal audit report to the shareholders.
The assessment is undertaken annually using a tailored 
questionnaire and is initially completed by individuals in private 
rather than by the Committee as a group. The responses are 
collated by the Company Secretary and presented back to the 
Committee at its next meeting. Any differences of opinion are 
highlighted and discussed and consensus is then reached on 
the Committee’s overall assessment. The Committee deemed 
the performance of the external auditor to have been effective 
and was satisfied with the quality of work produced.
Given that Deloitte LLP have been appointed as statutory 
auditor for three consecutive years and, in line with the 
Company’s broader focus on greater operational efficiency 
and cost effectiveness, the Committee has decided it is the 
right time to benchmark the external audit service externally. 
To this effect, a tendering process has been initiated.
Internal Audit
For the first half of the year, PwC acted as the Company’s 
internal auditor. However, the Committee reviewed the need for 
an Internal Audit function in October 2015 and decided to bring 
this activity in-house. A new Head of Internal Audit, reporting 
to me, was appointed in January 2016. 
Internal Audit (represented either by PwC or the new Head of 
Internal Audit) attended all Committee meetings during the year 
and also met separately with me, in my role as the Audit and 
Risk Committee Chairman.
The Committee has reviewed and approved the internal audit 
charter and risk-based internal audit plan, and received 
quarterly updates outlining: the internal audit activity, 
engagement results and the status of, and time to close, 
management actions, to help it form a view on internal audit 
effectiveness.
The Committee has satisfied itself that the quality, experience 
and expertise of the internal audit function are appropriate for 
the Company.
Financial reporting and significant financial judgements 
The Committee reviews the accounting policies of the Group, 
focusing particular attention on those which are more complex 
in nature or require significant judgement. To inform the 
Committee’s assessment of the appropriateness of such 
policies and judgements, management prepares accounting 
papers outlining the basis of the calculations and any associated 
estimates. In addition, the Committee receives detailed reports 
from the external auditor setting out their approach in gaining 
assurance over the key judgements and calculations.
The table below sets out the significant financial reporting 
issues that the Committee has devoted most time to during 
the year and which could give rise to material misstatement 
of the Group’s financial statements. The associated accounting 
policies are set out on pages 120 to 125 and references are 
included in the table below to the relevant note to the 
financial accounts.

AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT
CONTINUED Activities of the Audit and Risk Committee during the year
The carrying value of 
accruals for gift cards and 
loyalty scheme
 
(see ‘Gift cards and vouchers’ under 
the ‘Accounting Policies of the 
Group’, page 121 and note 21 to the 
financial statements).
Gift cards 
In the second half of the year, management identified an issue with the integrity of gift card reporting from 
the third-party gift card provider. Subsequent investigation revealed that the automatic reporting of expiries 
to the Company was not activated for two of the three third-party gift card databases. This resulted in the 
under-reporting of expiries to the Company and impacted the accounting estimate for the gift card provision 
used in the prior year. This has been corrected with a one-off exceptional accounting item reported in the income 
statement in the current year.
The historic prior year expiries of £3.4 million (2015: £nil) have been included within exceptional items, whereas all 
current year expiries and the resulting change in estimate arising from the recalculation of the expiry rate have 
been recognised within current year revenue.
In gaining assurance over the integrity of the exceptional item and the carrying value of the gift card provision, 
the Committee has:
 — discussed with management the analysis undertaken to determine the ageing of the under-reported expiries 
so as to determine the correct allocation of prior period and current year items
 — reviewed a report from internal audit setting out the root causes of gift card reporting issues identified during 
the year and monitored management’s responsiveness in addressing the issues
 — challenged management on the appropriateness of the estimated expiry and redemption rates being applied 
going forward
 — reviewed the external auditor’s findings and conclusions on gift card accounting.
The Committee is satisfied that the correct accounting treatment has been applied in terms of:
 — the reporting of current year (non-exceptional) income including the recurring annual expiries
 — the reporting of current year (non-exceptional) income relating to a £1.4 million revision to the accounting 
estimate of future expiries
 — the exceptional item of £3.4 million relating to previously unrecognised gift card expiries in respect of prior periods
 — the calculation of the revised expiry rate being applied going forward
 — the calculation of current year accounting estimate, representing the closing balance in the Statement 
of Financial Position.
Loyalty scheme 
As with gift cards, deferred revenue is adjusted for the value of points expected to expire, based on historical 
redemption and expiry rates.
 — During the year, the Committee has reviewed a paper prepared by management setting out the loyalty scheme 
terms and conditions, accounting policy and the approach adopted for estimating the expiry rate. The paper 
highlighted a change in scheme terms and conditions in the UK retail business in May 2016 which reduced the 
period of validity of points from 18 months to 12 months. This had the effect of increasing the expiry rate and 
increased income recognition to the income statement during the year, compared with prior years.
 — The Committee has also analysed the results of Deloitte’s review of loyalty accounting and is satisfied the 
carrying value of the loyalty provision is appropriate.
The carrying value of 
inventories
 
(see ‘Inventories’ under the 
‘Accounting Policies of the Group’, 
page 124 and note 16 to the financial 
statements).
Significant judgement is required in determining the net realisable value of inventory, particularly in relation 
to estimating stock losses and future sales value.
 — The Committee has reviewed the accounting policy, inventory balance, associated provisions and disclosures.
 — In assessing the appropriateness of the net realisable value and slow-moving stock provisions, the Committee 
discussed and challenged management on the assumptions made regarding sales and, where relevant, supplier 
returns and contributions.
The Committee has reviewed the findings and assessment of the external auditor and monitored management’s 
responsiveness to their recommendations.
Overall, the Committee is satisfied with accuracy of the inventory balance.
Assessing whether 
contractual performance 
conditions of supplier funding 
agreements (including 
marketing income and rebate 
discounts) have been met 
and discounts or income 
recognised appropriately
 
(see ‘Supplier Funding’ under the 
‘Accounting Policies of the Group’, 
page 125).
The Company receives supplier funding in the form of sale-out agreements (supplier supported promotional 
discounts), volume rebates and marketing income. The area of most significant judgement relates to marketing 
income, in terms of ensuring the performance criteria have been met before the revenue is recognised.
The Committee has reviewed and discussed reports from management and external audit outlining the Company’s 
accounting policy and approach. The Committee is satisfied that marketing income is accurately reported.

treatment of the Group’s

Multiplay
 
(see ‘Acquisition of Multiplay (UK) 
Limited’, ‘Acquisition of Ads Reality 
Limited’ and ‘Impairment of 
goodwill’ under the ‘Accounting 
Policies of the Group’, page 125 and 
note 30 to the financial statements).
Acquisition accounting and impairment reviews 
Multiplay continues to develop and grow its core events and digital activities. In scaling its operations to deliver 
further growth, the business has underperformed against initial plans and budgets. However, based on the three 
year plan, management has determined that no adjustments for impairment are required.
To gain comfort over the carrying value of Multiplay, the Committee has:
 — analysed the three year plan, cash flows, discount and growth rate assumptions incorporated in the annual 
impairment review
 — discussed the impairment review with management and the external auditor and is satisfied that the 
value-in-use significantly exceeds Multiplay’s carrying value and that no impairment is required.
Acquisition of Ads Reality 
In May 2016, the Company acquired the trade and assets of Ads Reality Limited (‘Ads Reality’), for an initial 
consideration of £2 million, with additional potential payments to the founding directors of up to £18 million, 
subject to performance conditions being met.
The key areas of judgement concern the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired and the assessment related to 
the accrual of potential additional payments to the founding directors, which is split into two tranches. In assessing 
the appropriateness of the accounting treatment, the Committee has:
 — analysed a detailed report from PwC LLP who were instructed to assess the valuation of the intangible assets
 — reviewed the five-year forecast to determine the likelihood of the performance criteria for the potential additional 
payments to the founding directors being met
 — discussed the outputs of the above reviews with management and the external auditor.
The Committee is satisfied with the integrity of the valuation of intangible assets and with the accrual level relating 
to potential additional payments to the founding directors. Specifically, the Committee concurs with management’s 
view that, given the early stage of business development, it is unlikely that the performance criteria for the second 
tranche of deferred consideration will be met. The Committee agrees that it would therefore be correct not to 
recognise these potential future payment obligations.
Going concern and long-term 
viability assessment
In light of the rapidly changing and cyclical nature of the video games industry (linked to major new console 
launches and significant new game releases), combined with the Company’s evolving strategy and business model, 
the Committee has devoted significant time towards year-end assessment of the short, and medium- to longer-
term viability of the Company. For further details of the Committee’s activities here, please see the Internal control 
and risk management section, under Risk Assessment within this report.
Internal control and risk management

system of risk management and internal control and for the 
ongoing monitoring of its effectiveness. The system, which has 
been in place and subject to ongoing improvement throughout

AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT
CONTINUED Control environment 
At the half year, following the December trading update, there 
was a short-term re-prioritisation of actions and objectives as 
well as a longer-term strategic appraisal. As part of this, there 
was a restructuring of the UK organisation which also resulted 
in a few redundancies. The new structure is more appropriately 
aligned with our evolving strategy and business model.
A review and re-organisation of committees and senior 
management meetings has also been undertaken to provide 
adequate governance and oversight over operational 
performance, strategic planning and execution.
Proposals for changes to corporate rewards and incentives have 
also been approved by the Board to ensure appropriate alignment 
with business strategy, objectives and performance. These are 
due to be implemented for the forthcoming financial year.
Risk assessment
The Committee, supported by the Head of Internal Audit, has 
made significant progress during the year in assisting the Board 
in improving risk management. Key activities undertaken were 
as follows:
 — completion of a new risk management framework and policy 
document requiring the ongoing assessment of risk across 
the Group and more formal, bi-annual, divisional and Board 
level risk assessments
 — the enhancement of reporting, moving to quarterly, divisional 
and Board level risk updates 
 — the appointment of designated ‘risk champions’ in each 
business division to ensure risk management is embedded 
in day-to-day operations and decision-making going forward
 — divisional risk workshops, facilitated by the Head of Internal 
Audit in the second half of the year, the results of which were 
communicated to and reviewed by the Committee and Board 
 — a robust assessment by the Board of the Company’s principal 
risks as set out on page 42 to 44 in the Strategic report which 
took into account those significant risks raised by the divisional 
leadership teams
 — definition of risk appetite statements for each of the 
principal risks
 — assessment of the Company’s medium- to longer-term 
viability and completion of the viability statement, which 
can be found on page 58 in the Strategic report
 — an annual assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s 
risk management and internal control systems, which can 
be found in the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 
73 to 78.
Control activities
 — The ‘Core Foundations’ action plan was implemented in the 
second half of the year to refocus management attention on 
operational efficiency and effectiveness and to improve 
overall business performance.
 — There are a number of other committees and senior 
management meetings that take place either on a regular 
basis or periodically, to monitor business performance, 
oversee projects, monitor compliance or agree strategic 
plans and monitor effective execution.
 — There has been a strengthening of controls during the year 
to support the accuracy and reliability of financial reporting 
including: a ‘financial controls’ programme with dedicated 
project manager, clear lines of delegated authority, three-
year planning cycle, annual budget with quarterly review and 
half-yearly reforecast, monthly management accounts and 
cash flow forecasts.
 — Individual teams and functions have responsibility for 
implementing and monitoring a number of other operational 
and compliance controls such as loss prevention and health 
and safety.
 — The Committee appointed a new Head of Internal Audit in 
January 2016 to establish an in-house internal audit function; 
further details can be found in the Internal Audit section of 
this report.
 — A confidential reporting policy and process has been in place 
throughout the year. There were no reported improprieties.
Information and communication
The Board and Committee receive reports and updates from 
senior management and the internal and external auditors 
periodically and on request to help it monitor the risk 
management and internal control system. These are detailed 
in the Work of the Committee section within this report.

On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to  
present the report of the Remuneration 
Committee (the ‘Committee’) in respect of  
the year 2015-16.
During the year, following the rebasing of external 
market forecasts that led to the Company’s 
December trading statement, the Committee 
faced a challenging task of conducting a mid-year 
review of outstanding awards under its 
Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’). Whilst the 
Committee adheres to the principle of paying 
for performance, it also recognised that bonus 
targets would not be met again and the existing 
PSP targets were increasingly looking 
unachievable. Accordingly, with the need to drive 
the necessary business change and development 
with an appropriately incentivised management 
team, the Committee consulted with its main 
shareholders. The conclusion reached was that an 
additional grant under the PSP in surrender of the 
October 2015 PSP award was the correct measure 
to adopt. The Committee has also reviewed and 
set its approach with regard to the national living 
wage and believes it has attained the correct 
balance to continue to be an attractive employer.
Following my acceptance to take up the position 
of Chairman of the Board from the conclusion 
of the Annual General Meeting in January 2017, 
this will be my last report as the Chairman of 
the Remuneration Committee. I am pleased 
that Caspar Woolley, with his knowledge and 
understanding of remuneration structures in 
the business, will take on the role and I shall 
look forward to being a member of the Committee 
and supporting its future work.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT Policy and shareholder voting
The Annual Statement and Annual Report on Remuneration 
will be subject to an advisory shareholder resolution at the 
Company’s forthcoming AGM. Our Directors’ remuneration 
policy was approved by shareholders on 15 January 2015 and 
became effective for three years from that date. Other than the 
‘Illustrations of application of remuneration policy’, which have 
been updated, the remuneration policy is unchanged.
The Committee has continued to operate the Remuneration 
Policy first approved by Shareholders at the 2014 AGM. The 
2016-17 financial year will be the last full year of its operation 
before the triennial approval of a new policy at the 2017 AGM. 
The business conducted by the Committee during the year 
related primarily to the implementation of the approved policy.
Statement of shareholder voting on the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report
At last year’s AGM, the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
received the following votes from shareholders:
Director
Approve the Remuneration Report
Total number of votes % of votes cast
For 152,520,827 99.99%
Against 13,563 0.01%

votes withheld) 152,534,390 100%
Votes withheld 3,841,419
Total votes cast (including 
votes withheld) 156,375,809
Note: 
Votes withheld are not included in the final proxy figures as they are not 
recognised as a vote in law. 
At the forthcoming AGM of the Company, one resolution 
approving the Annual Statement and Annual Report on 
Remuneration will be proposed as an ordinary resolution.
Performance of the Group
The Company faced challenging market conditions in the UK 
and a significant reduction in sales across the UK video games 
market led to a revision in its full year results expectations, 
announced to the market in December 2015. A further 
contributing factor to the decline in full year results has been 
the necessary longer-term strategic investment in business 
activities within Events, Esports & Digital, since the acquisition 
of Multiplay. To promote good performance in our core retail 
business and deliver the strategic growth in new business 
areas, the Committee recognises the need for recruitment 
and investment in developing talent. Consequently whilst there 
was no performance-related bonus in 2015-16 for Executive 
Directors, the Committee remains focused on developing 
remuneration packages that motivate and incentivise across 
all levels going forward.
Committee members
Lesley Watkins and Caspar Woolley, both independent 
Non-Executive Directors, are members of the Committee. 
There have been no changes to the membership of the 
Committee during the year. Full career profiles of the Board 
and Committee members can be found under Board of 
Directors on pages 70 to 71.
The Board is satisfied that the collective skills and 
experience of the Committee continues to provide sufficient 
commercial and sector-related expertise to meet the needs 
of the Company.
Responsibilities
The key responsibilities of the Committee are set out in the 
Committee’s terms of reference. These can be found under 
the Corporate Governance section of the corporate website, 
www.gamedigitalplc.com, and include:
 — making recommendations to the Board on the Company’s 
policy on remuneration for the Group
 — determining and monitoring specific remuneration 
packages for the Chairman, each of the Executive 
Directors and certain senior management in the Group, 
including pension rights and any compensation payments
 — recommending and monitoring the level and structure 
of remuneration for senior management
 — recommending and overseeing the implementation of 
share option schemes, or other performance-related 
schemes, including scheme grants.
The Board remains responsible for the approval and 
implementation of any recommendations made by the 
Remuneration Committee. Fees in relation to the Non-
Executive Directors including the Chairman of the Board 
are discussed and determined by the Board.
Overview
This report sets out the remuneration policy for the Directors 
of Game Digital plc, prepared in accordance with the Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Report) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013 and discloses amounts paid 
and accrued to them over the course of the financial year. 
The report is comprised of the following three sections:
 — this Annual Statement: summarising and explaining the 
major decisions on, and any substantial changes to, 
Directors’ remuneration in the year
 — the Annual Report on Remuneration: which sets out the 
remuneration earned by the Group’s Directors in the year 
ended 30 July 2016, together with how the remuneration 
policy will be implemented in the year ending 29 July 2017
 — the Directors’ Remuneration Policy: which sets out the 
three year Directors’ remuneration policy for the Company 
which became formally effective from the 2015 AGM. 
While disclosure of this report is not required this year, 
this section has been included in line with best practice.

Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information Base salary and annual bonus
The Committee reviewed salaries in the year and with effect 
from 1 October 2016 the CEO’s and CFO’s base pay/salary 
will not be increased in 2016-17. We expect that more than 
half of UK employees will see an increase of over 5 per cent, 
on average, during the course of the year as a result of changes 
related to increases in the National Living Wage and the 
National Minimum Wage. This follows the Board’s decision, 
upon a recommendation from the Committee, to offer a small 
premium above the base levels set out by the Government. The 
decision took account of market comparators and affordability. 
In parallel and in the light of living wage increases, the Committee 
recommended that UK store pay bandings should be reviewed 
on an ongoing basis. 
In our Spanish subsidiary, the majority of employees will see 
an above inflationary 2 per cent increase on average following 
the conclusion of union negotiations in relation to pay. 
In receiving recommendations from the Committee around 
general salary increases, the Board has been mindful of the 
Group’s intention to recruit and retain highly talented individuals 
and teams on competitive packages that will help drive a high 
performance culture. In parallel, the Board is also focused on 
the need to control costs and optimise operational efficiency 
to ensure the right balance is struck. 
Annual bonuses for the year ended 30 July 2016 were based on 
profit before tax. However, primarily as a result of a continuing 
challenge in the UK trading environment, we did not meet our 
budgeted expectations for gross profit delivery and the threshold 
profit before tax target for bonus purposes was not met. Therefore 
no bonus is due for the Executive Directors. The maximum 
bonus opportunity for the coming year is 125 per cent of salary 
for the CEO and 100 per cent of salary for the CFO and will 
operate in a similar way to 2015-16.
Performance share plan
Executive Directors were granted awards under the PSP 
in October 2015. Following on from the December trading 
statement, the Committee reviewed the outstanding awards 
under the plan. As part of this review the Committee 
considered making additional awards under the PSP in order 
to re-incentivise the Executive Directors and senior managers 
to improve the performance of the Company. This consideration 
was driven by a significant change in market conditions as 
reported on in December 2015. 
As part of the review, the Committee consulted with the 
Company’s top four shareholders, who were in agreement that 
the Executive Directors should be re-incentivised. A decision 
was taken by the Board, on the recommendation of the 
Committee, to make awards in May 2016 to participants, 
provided the October 2015 awards were first surrendered. 
In May 2016 awards were made under the PSP to Executive 
Directors and senior managers at the same level (as a 
percentage of salary) as the October 2015 awards surrendered. 
The performance criteria split, being 80 per cent Total 
Shareholder Return and 20 per cent Earnings Per Share (‘EPS’), 
remains the same, with the EPS target being set by reference 
to the 12 months ending 26 January 2019. Full details of awards 
and the performance criteria can be found on pages 94 to 95.
The Committee intends to make awards under the PSP in 
October 2016 based on 125 per cent of salary in respect of 
the CEO and 100 per cent of salary in respect of the CFO. 
The primary performance measure for the October 2016 
PSP award will be based on relative growth in total shareholder 
return, representing 80 per cent of the performance conditions 
and 20 per cent subject to the Group’s basic adjusted EPS. 
Specific targets for the award can be found on page 93.
We believe that our policy continues to deliver a robust link 
between reward and performance and is aligned with our 
strategic goals. We hope that you will support our 
Remuneration Report at this year’s AGM.

CONTINUED Annual Report on Remuneration
Work of the Committee
The Committee convened nine times during the year in line 
with activities as part of the Company’s remuneration cycle and 
ad-hoc as required. Attendance at the meetings is set out in the 
Corporate Governance Statement on page 77. The Chairman 
of the Board, Company Secretary (who acts as secretary to the 
Committee) and Group Human Resource Director are regularly 
invited to attend. The CEO, CFO and remuneration consultants 
also attend by invitation from time to time as requested.
Meetings normally take place on the day of but prior to the 
Board meeting. I then report to the Board on the relevant 
activities and recommendations of the Committee.
Summary of key activities during the year
In 2015-16 the Committee gave consideration to the following 
key areas:
 — approving the Directors’ Remuneration Report 2015
 — recommending a Share Plans Committee to administer 
the Company’s share plans
 — surrender of 2015 PSP grants and approval of May 2016 
PSP grants
 — the Group’s approach to the National Living Wage and 
National Minimum Wage in the UK
 — remuneration levels amongst the senior management 
population
 — remuneration of the senior management of Ads Reality 
as a newly acquired businesses, including share-based 
incentives connected to the acquisition with potential to 
utilise the Group-Wide Share Acquisition Plan
 — receiving updates on equal pay in regard to gender pay 
reporting and the pension annual allowance
 — policy regarding mitigation payments on exit of senior 
management
 — approval of the design of, and determination of targets 
for, performance-related pay schemes across the Group
 — approval of the October 2016 PSP grant.
Evaluation of the Committee
The Committee self-assessed its performance in July 2016, 
taking into account its collective skills and experience, the 
activities it has engaged in during the year and the effectiveness 
of its actions in applying appropriate rigour and challenge. 
This assessment has been submitted to the Board for review 
and the Board has concluded that the Committee has operated 
effectively.
Remuneration Committee and advisors
The Remuneration Committee has access to independent advice 
where it considers it appropriate. The Committee seeks advice 
relating to executive remuneration from New Bridge Street 
(‘NBS’), part of Aon plc. NBS provides no other services to the 
Company. Aon UK Limited, part of the Aon plc group, provided 
insurance brokerage services to the Company during the year.
The Committee is satisfied that the advice received by NBS 
in relation to executive remuneration matters during the 
year was objective and independent. NBS is a member of 
the Remuneration Consultants Group and abides by the 
Remuneration Consultants Group Code of Conduct, which 
requires its advice to be objective and impartial. The fees 
payable to NBS for providing advice in relation to executive 
remuneration over the financial year under review were 
£34,160 (2015: £38,778).

An explanation of how the Directors’ Remuneration Policy will be applied during the financial year 2016-17 is set out below.
Base salary
Salaries were reviewed in 2016 and have not been increased. This compares to more than half of UK employees who will see an 
increase of over 5 per cent, on average, during the course of the year as a result of changes related to increases in the National 
Living Wage and the National Minimum Wage and the majority of Spanish employees will also see an above inflationary 2 per cent 
increase on average following the conclusion of union negotiations in relation to pay with regard to our Spanish operations. 
Pension and benefits
The Committee intends that the implementation of its policy in relation to pension and benefits will be in line with the disclosed 
policy on page 98 of this report.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
CONTINUED Annual bonus
The maximum annual bonus for the financial year ending 29 July 2017 will be 125 per cent of salary for Martyn Gibbs and 
100 per cent of salary for Mark Gifford. Up to 50 per cent of any bonus earned will be paid in shares and deferred for three years, 
subject to continued employment. Clawback and malus provisions apply.
The bonus will be based entirely on profit before tax. The specific targets relating to the bonus have not been disclosed as they are 
considered by the Committee to be commercially sensitive. Details will be given on a retrospective basis when they are no longer 
deemed to be commercially sensitive.
Performance share plan
The Committee intends to make awards under the PSP to Executive Directors in the financial year ending 29 July 2017.
The extent to which any PSP award will vest will be determined by relative growth in total shareholder return (‘TSR’) when 
compared to the FTSE All-Share Index, amounting to 80 per cent of the award. The remainder of the award (20 per cent) will be 
subject to the Group’s basic adjusted earnings per share (EPS) as follows:
Earnings per share Total shareholder return
EPS  
(20% of award) % of award vesting
Relative TSR growth vs. FTSE 
All-Share Index (80% of award) % of award vesting
7.8p 25% TSR equal to FTSE All Share 25%
9.2p 100%
FTSE All Share + 10% p.a. 
(non-cumulative) 100%
Pro-rata vesting will be applied between the points.
TSR will be measured over three financial years starting with the financial year in which the award is made, based on an average 
share price for the 30 dealing days prior to the start of the first financial year and ending with the average share price over the last 
30 dealing days of the last financial year.
Awards will be subject to clawback and malus provisions.
Fees for Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
The decision of the Chairman to step down following the next AGM in January 2017 led to a review of the fee for the position of 
Chairman. In line with the approach that had been agreed as part of succession planning, the Committee set the new Chairman’s 
fees. In setting the new fee, the relevant committee members took into account the time and responsibility involved; the current 
status of the development of the business (the Company being at an important point in its strategy to transition its operations); 
as well as the need to make cost savings. The agreed fee for the new Chairman will be £165,000 (inclusive of the Nomination 
Committee Chair role), to take effect subject to shareholder approval from the conclusion of the AGM in January 2017. 
The Company’s approach to Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration, set by the Board, was also reviewed in September 2016. 
It was decided that fees for the Non-Executive Directors should remain unchanged with the introduction of additional fees for 
positions of responsibility for the Committee Chairs. See the table entitled At a Glance on page 92, for full details of the agreed 
fees, to take effect following the conclusion of the AGM in January 2017.
Franck Tuil has waived any entitlement to fees under his letter of appointment.

supplement, amounting to £21,628 during the financial year ended 30 July 2016 (2015: £0).
3. Mark Gifford joined the Company on 1 October 2015.
Annual bonus for the financial year ended 30 July 2016 – audited
The bonus was based on achievement of GAME’s budgeted profit before tax (PBT). The threshold for meeting the bonus involved 
achieving budgeted PBT. The threshold level of PBT was not met and therefore no bonus was payable. 
Annual bonus targets for the financial year ended 30 July 2016 are not disclosed due to their commercially sensitive nature and 
they will be disclosed at a future point in time when they are no longer considered to be commercially sensitive. 
Annual bonus for the financial year ended 25 July 2015 – audited
Although the PBT target was not met, it was stated in last years’ report that the actual targets would be disclosed when they 
were no longer deemed commercially sensitive. The targets for the financial year ended 25 July 2015 were set significantly ahead 
of the previous year’s performance to reward profit improvement. Although a significant performance improvement was delivered, 
it wasn’t sufficient to trigger the start to earn PBT target of £46.4 million.

absolute growth of 100% over the performance period with pro-rata vesting between the points.
3.  50% of the award requires the Group’s basic adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to be 26p (25% vests) rising to 28p (100% vests). The remaining 50% 
of the award requires three year absolute TSR growth of 30% (25% vests) to 75% (100% vests).
4.   Awards surrendered on 4 May 2016. 20% of the award required the Group’s adjusted earnings per share to be 22.4p (25% vests) rising to 26.4p 
(100% vests). The remaining 80% of the award required relative TSR growth vs. FTSE All-Share Index of 0% p.a. (25% vests) to 10% p.a. (non-cumulative) 
(100% vests).

Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information Remuneration Policy Report
Policy overview
The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for 
determining the remuneration for the Chairman, 
Executive Directors and other senior managers.
The aim of the remuneration policy is to: attract, retain 
and motivate high-calibre senior management; focus them 
on the delivery of the Group’s strategic and business objectives; 
promote a strong and sustainable performance culture; 
incentivise high growth; and align the interests of Executive 
Directors and other senior managers with those of 
shareholders. In promoting these objectives, the policy aims 
to ensure that no more is paid than is necessary and the policy 
has been structured so as to adhere to the principles of good 
corporate governance and appropriate risk management.
The remuneration arrangements have been structured with 
due consideration of both best practice and market practice 
for UK listed companies.

Reflects individual’s 
responsibilities, 
experience and role.
Normally reviewed annually in October and 
normally takes effect from this date.
Salaries are normally paid monthly. 
Decisions are influenced by:
 — responsibilities, abilities, experience and 
performance of an individual
 — the Company’s salary and pay structures and 
general workforce increases.
There is no prescribed maximum 
annual base salary or salary 
increase. The Committee is guided 
by the general increase for the 
broader employee population but 
may decide to award a lower 
increase for Executive Directors 
or exceed this to recognise, for 
example, an increase in the scale, 
scope or responsibility of the role 
and/or take account of relevant 
market movements.
Not applicable.
Pension
 
To provide 
competitive 
retirement benefits.
Directors may participate in a defined contribution 
plan, or, subject to Committee approval, elect to 
receive cash in lieu of all or some of such benefit.
Only base salary is pensionable.
The Company may contribute up 
to 15% of salary.
Not applicable.
Other benefits
 
To provide a

Package of benefits including private health 
insurance, life insurance, relocation costs, tax 
equalisation, critical illness cover, car allowance 
and directors’ and officers’ indemnity insurance.
Additional benefits might be provided from time to 
time if the Committee decides payment of such 
benefits is appropriate and in line with market 
practice.
There is no maximum level of 
benefits provided to an Executive 
Director.
Not applicable.
How the views of shareholders and employees 
are taken into account
In setting the remuneration for the Executive Directors, 
the Committee takes note of the overall approach to reward 
for employees in the Group; salary increases will ordinarily 
be (in percentage of salary terms) in line with those of the wider 
workforce. The Committee does not formally consult directly 
with employees on executive pay but does receive periodic 
updates from UK and Spanish HR teams.
The Committee will consider any shareholder feedback received 
in relation to the policy at the AGM. This, plus any additional 
feedback received from time to time, will be considered as part 
of the Company’s annual review of remuneration policy.
The remuneration policy for Directors
The total remuneration package for Executive Directors 
is structured so that variable elements (annual bonus and 
long-term incentives) make up a significant proportion of 
the package. This table summarises the key aspects of 
the Company’s remuneration policy for Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors:

Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information How the Committee operates the variable pay policy
The Committee operates the share plans in accordance with 
their respective rules and in accordance with the Listing Rules 
and HMRC regulations where relevant. The Committee, 
consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a 
number of areas relating to the operation and administration 
of certain plans, including:
 — who participates in the plans
 — when to make awards and payments
 — implementation and operation of bonus deferral
 — how to determine the size of an award or a payment, 
and when and how much of an award should vest
 — the testing of a performance condition over a shortened 
performance period
 — how to deal with a change of control or restructuring of 
the Group
 — whether a Director is a good/bad leaver for incentive plan 
purposes; what proportion of awards vest at the original 
vesting date, or whether and what proportion of awards 
may vest at the time of leaving
 — how and whether an award may be adjusted in certain 
circumstances (e.g. for a rights issue, a corporate 
restructuring or for special dividends)
 — what the weighting measures and targets should be for 
the annual bonus plan and PSP from year to year.
The Committee also retains the discretion, within the policy, 
to adjust existing targets and/or set different measures for the 
annual bonus and the PSP. This may only take place if events 
occur that cause the Committee to determine that the targets 
set are no longer appropriate and that amendment is required 
so the relevant bonus can achieve its original intended purpose, 
provided that the new targets are not materially less difficult 
to satisfy.
Any use of the above discretions would, where relevant, 
be explained in the Annual Report on Remuneration and 
may, as appropriate, be the subject of consultation with the 
Company’s major shareholders.
Choice of performance measures for Executive 
Directors’ awards
The choice of the performance condition(s) applicable to the 
annual bonus plan, being profit before tax, reflects the principle 
that the bonus plan be appropriately challenging and tied to the 
strategic and financial performance of the Company.
Earnings per share (‘EPS’) and total shareholder return (‘TSR’) 
were selected by the Committee as the performance conditions 
applicable to the PSP on the basis that they align to the strategic 
plans of the Company and are designed to ensure growth is 
delivered in a profitable way.
In line with HMRC regulations for such schemes, SAYE and SIP 
do not operate performance conditions.
Remuneration policy for other employees
The policy described above applies specifically to the 
Company’s Executive and Non-Executive Directors. The 
following differences exist between the Company’s policy for 
the remuneration of the Executive Directors and its approach 
to the payment of employees generally:
 — a lower level of maximum annual bonus opportunity (or zero 
bonus opportunity) may apply to employees
 — performance metrics attached to the annual bonus may 
differ to reflect the precise roles and responsibilities of the 
employee and may be based on country rather than Group 
financial performance
 — variable pay plans, where appropriate (such as commission 
based plans) are used to incentivise employees. Where 
employees participate in such plans they are not eligible 
for any annual bonus awarded in that year
 — participation in the PSP is limited to the Executive Directors 
and certain selected senior managers
 — participation in a long-term incentive cash plan for certain 
selected senior managers not participating in the PSP
 — the Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in 
the Group-Wide Share Acquisition Plan (approved by 
shareholders at the 2015 AGM).
In general, these differences arise from the development of 
remuneration arrangements that are market competitive for 
the various categories of employee. They also reflect that, 
in the case of the Executive Directors and senior management, 
a greater emphasis is placed on performance-related pay 
reflecting their influence over the Company’s performance.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
CONTINUED Service contracts and letters of appointment
Service contracts and letters of appointment are available for 
inspection at the Company’s registered office.
Service contracts and loss of office
The policy for executive service contracts is that notice periods 
will normally not exceed 12 months. The service contracts for 
the Executive Directors are terminable by either the Company 
or the Executive Director on not less than 12 months’ notice 
in respect of Martyn Gibbs or six months’ notice in respect of 
Mark Gifford.
The Committee’s policy in relation to termination of service 
contracts is to apply an appropriate level of mitigation, having 
regard to all of the circumstances of the individual, the 
termination of employment and to any legal advice received. 
The Company can terminate either Executive Director’s service 
contract by payment of a cash sum in lieu of notice equivalent to 
the base salary or in monthly equal instalments over the notice 
period. The Company also has the discretion to include pension 
contributions, car allowance and the cost of providing insured 
benefits within the payment in lieu of notice. There are no 
enhanced provisions on a change of control.
The Company may also pay outplacement costs, legal costs and 
other reasonable relevant costs associated with termination.
Annual bonus on termination
There is no automatic or contractual right to bonus payment. 
At the discretion of the Committee, in certain circumstances to 
incentivise short-term retention and completion of key business 
deliverables, and where poor performance is not a factor in the 
decision to exit, a pro-rata bonus may become payable at the 
normal payment date for the period of employment and based 
on full year performance. Where the Committee decides to 
make a payment, the rationale will be fully disclosed in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration.
PSP on termination
Share-based awards are outside of service contracts. 
The default treatment is that any outstanding awards would 
lapse on termination. However, under the Rules of the PSP, 
in certain prescribed circumstances, such as death, injury, 
ill-health, retirement, redundancy, leaving the Group because 
the employer company or business leaves the Group or where 
the Committee determines otherwise, ‘good leaver’ status can 
be applied.
Awards held by a good leaver will vest on the normal vesting 
date, unless the Committee determines otherwise. Vesting will 
be subject to satisfaction of any performance conditions which 
shall, where the Committee has decided that the PSP awards 
may vest early, be measured over the period from grant to the 
date of cessation. The proportion of the award which vests will, 
unless the Committee determines otherwise, be reduced to 
reflect the proportion of the vesting period which has elapsed 
as at the date of cessation. Pro-rating will generally be 
calculated on a monthly basis.

Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information Letters of appointment
All Non-Executive Directors (save for Franck Tuil) have letters 
of appointment with the Company for an initial period of three 
years, subject to reappointment each year at the AGM. The 
appointment letters for the Non-Executive Directors provide 
that no compensation is payable on termination. The 
appointments are terminable by the Company on three 
months’ notice.
Franck Tuil serves as a Director representing the Major 
Shareholder under the terms of the Relationship Agreement 
as described in the Corporate Governance Statement on 
pages 73 to 78. He is expected to serve for as long as he 
remains the Major Shareholder’s nominated Director. The 
Major Shareholder is entitled to remove from office such person 
as is appointed as its nominated Director and to nominate 
another individual in their place. Franck Tuil’s appointment is 
terminable (immediately or otherwise) by the Company giving 
notice in writing under certain circumstances under the terms 
of his appointment set out in the Relationship Agreement.
Approach to recruitment and promotions
The recruitment package for a new Director would be set 
in accordance with the terms of the Company’s approved 
remuneration policy. Currently, this would facilitate a maximum 
annual bonus payment of no more than 125 per cent of salary 
and policy PSP award of up to 150 per cent of salary (other than 
in exceptional circumstances where up to 200 per cent of salary 
may be made). The 200 per cent limit has been set in order for 
the Company to be able to attract talent should it need to do so.
On recruitment, salary may (but need not necessarily) be set 
below the normal market rate, with phased increases as the 
Director gains experience. The rate of salary should be set so 
as to reflect the individual’s experience and skills.
In addition, on recruitment the Company may compensate for 
amounts foregone from a previous employer (using Listing Rule 
9.4.2 if necessary) taking into account the quantum foregone 
and, as far as is reasonably practicable, the extent to which 
performance conditions apply, the form of award and the time 
left to vesting.
For an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in 
respect of their prior role should be allowed to pay out according 
to its terms. Any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing 
prior to appointment may continue, provided that they are put to 
shareholders for approval at the earliest opportunity.
For all appointments, the Committee may agree that the 
Company will meet appropriate relocation costs.
For the appointment of a new Chairman, Committee Chair, or 
Non-Executive Director, the fee arrangement would be set in 
accordance with the approved remuneration policy in force at 
that time.
Policy on external appointments
Subject to Board approval, Executive Directors are permitted 
to take on non-executive positions with other companies and to 
retain their fees in respect of such positions. Details of outside 
directorships held by the Executive Directors and any fees that 
they received are provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Legacy arrangements
In approving this Directors’ Remuneration Policy, authority is 
given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into 
with Directors which were fully disclosed in the prospectus. 
Details of any such payments will be set out in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration as they arise.
Approval
This Directors’ Remuneration Report, including both Policy and 
Annual Remuneration Report, has been approved by the Board 
of Directors on 12 October 2016.

shareholders for inspection at the Company’s registered office 
and at the AGM. Details of each Executive Director’s contractual 
arrangements, including notice periods, are included as part of 
the Directors’ Annual Report on Remuneration on pages 88 to

Directors’ Report.
Following the Board’s internal review and upon receiving 
recommendations from the Nomination Committee, the Board 
considers that all Directors continue to be effective, committed 
to their roles and able to devote sufficient time to discharge 
their responsibilities. With the exception of David Hamid, 
each of the Directors will seek re-election at the Company’s 
forthcoming AGM in accordance with the Company’s articles 
of association and in line with the recommendation in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code which require all of the Directors 
to stand for election at each AGM. 
Subject to the Company’s articles of association, the Companies 
Act 2006, any directions given by the Company by special 
resolution and any relevant statutes and regulations, the 
business of the Company, including in relation to the allotment 
and issuance of ordinary shares, is managed by the Board 
which may exercise all the powers of the Company. Matters 
reserved for the Board are detailed on page 75 of the Corporate 
Governance Statement.
Related Party Transactions
On 20 April 2016, the Company and certain members of the 
Group entered into an asset-backed revolving facility agreement 
(the ‘Lajedosa Facility Agreement’) with Lajedosa Investments 
S.à r.l (‘Lajedosa’), on a conditional basis, and signed (but did not 
complete) a debenture creating fixed and floating security for 
the obligations under the Lajedosa Facility Agreement (the 
‘Lajedosa Debenture’). At the time of entry by the Company 
into those financing documents, for the purposes of Chapter 11 
of the Listing Rules, Lajedosa was an associate of Duodi 
Investments S.à r.l. (‘Duodi’), which was a related party of the 
Company by virtue of holding approximately 43.44 per cent of 
the Company’s ordinary shares of £0.01 each. As a result, 
Lajedosa itself was also a related party of the Company and the 
entry into such financing documents by the Company and the 
other members of the Group was, therefore, treated as a related 
party transaction for the purposes of Chapter 11 of the Listing 
Rules. Duodi is an investment vehicle ultimately wholly-owned 
by Elliott International, L.P. and Elliott Associates, L.P. (the 
latter via a participation interest with Elliott International, L.P.).
The Lajedosa Facility Agreement provided that the substantive 
terms of the Lajedosa Facility Agreement would become 
effective only once the Group had satisfied certain conditions. 
Those conditions included the approval of the shareholders of 
the Company for the purposes of the related party transaction 
rules referred to above, which was obtained on 19 May 2016, and 
that the Company and Game Retail Limited (‘GRL ’, the borrower 
under the Lajedosa Facility Agreement) had delivered a written 
notice to Lajedosa, the lender under the Lajedosa Facility 
Agreement (the ‘Lajedosa Activation Notice’).
As disclosed under a regulatory announcement issued on 
21 April 2016, the primary terms of the Lajedosa Facility 
Agreement and Lajedosa Debenture are as follows: 
Lajedosa Facility Agreement
The initial aggregate principal commitment of Lajedosa under 
the Lajedosa Facility Agreement is £50,000,000, which sum may 
be increased, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, 
at GRL ’s request up to a maximum of £100,000,000. Once all the 
conditions relating to the effectiveness of the Lajedosa Facility 
Agreement have been satisfied, subject to the deferral 
described below, GRL will be required to pay a commitment 
fee equal to 0.5 per cent per annum on the undrawn committed 
amounts under the Lajedosa Facility Agreement. 
Interest on borrowings under the Lajedosa Facility Agreement 
will accrue at a rate which is the aggregate of 5.5 per cent per 
annum plus one-month LIBOR. If GRL fails to pay any amount 
payable by it under the Lajedosa Facility Agreement on its 
due date, interest will accrue on the unpaid sum at a rate 
which is 2 per cent higher than that rate. The Lajedosa Facility 
Agreement will reach maturity on 31 October 2017, subject to 
GRL ’s ability and Lajedosa’s consent to extend the term for up 
to two additional periods of one year each (or such longer period 
as may be agreed by the Lajedosa).

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
CONTINUED The Lajedosa Facility Agreement will be cross-guaranteed by 
the Company, GRL and the other members of the Group (each 
an ‘Obligor’) and will be secured by the Lajedosa Debenture, 
which creates fixed and floating charges over all the assets of 
each Obligor. The Lajedosa Facility Agreement does not include 
any financial covenants, but does include restrictions, amongst 
other things, in relation to mergers, acquisitions, investments, 
disposals, new business activities and entry into certain forms 
of financing arrangement, in each case subject to certain 
exceptions. The Lajedosa Facility Agreement also includes 
customary events of default, including a cross-default clause 
whereby non-payment of any member of the Group’s (as defined 
in the Lajedosa Facility Agreement) indebtedness of £2,500,000 
or more when due constitutes an event of default under the 
Lajedosa Facility Agreement (subject to applicable grace 
periods). For the purposes of the Lajedosa Facility Agreement, 
the ‘Group’ includes each of the Company’s subsidiaries other 
than Game Stores Iberia SLU.
Lajedosa Debenture
The Lajedosa Debenture is standard in form and creates fixed 
and floating security over each Obligor’s assets, including 
property owned by them. The Lajedosa Debenture also 
contains standard provisions requiring the Obligors to notify 
counterparties to any insurance policies which are charged 
or assigned to Lajedosa pursuant to the Lajedosa Debenture, 
and any banks which hold accounts which are charged pursuant 
to the Lajedosa Debenture, as well as provisions relating to 
investments (including shares) held by the Obligors, including 
that, once the security created pursuant to the Lajedosa 
Debenture has become enforceable, Lajedosa may exercise any 
voting rights in respect of the relevant investments in the name 
of the Obligor which holds those investments.
The security created pursuant to the Lajedosa Debenture 
becomes enforceable upon the occurrence of an event of 
default under, and as defined in, the Lajedosa Facility 
Agreement. If the Lajedosa Debenture becomes enforceable, 
it would allow Lajedosa to appoint an administrator to any 
Obligor or a receiver to any assets which are secured by 
the security created pursuant to the Lajedosa Debenture.
New alternative financing arrangements and 
consequential changes
In addition to entering into the Ladejosa Facility Agreement, 
the Group continued to explore complementary or alternative 
financing arrangements from other third-party providers and 
the Group’s discussions with those third-party finance providers 
resulted in the Company, GRL (as borrower) and certain other 
members of the Group entering into: (i) an asset-backed 
revolving loan facility agreement with PNC Business Credit 
(a trading style of PNC Financial Services UK Ltd) (‘PNC’) 
and Wells Fargo Capital Finance (UK) Limited (‘Wells Fargo’, 
together with PNC, the ‘Lenders’) in an aggregate principal 
amount of up to £75,000,000 (the ‘PNC Facility Agreement’) and 
(ii) an intercreditor deed with PNC, Wells Fargo and Lajedosa 
(the ‘PNC ICA’). Both the PNC Facility Agreement and the PNC 
ICA were entered into on 15 July 2016. The Lajedosa Activation 
Notice was also delivered by GRL and the Company to Lajedosa 
on 15 July 2016, which caused the terms of Lajedosa Facility 
Agreement to become fully effective. On the same date, 
(i) the Lajedosa Debenture was dated and completed and 
(ii) Ads Reality Limited, which had been acquired by the Group 
during the period between the Lajedosa Facility Agreement 
being entered into and the Lajedosa Activation Notice being 
delivered to Lajedosa, acceded to the Lajedosa Facility 
Agreement (as a guarantor) and to the Lajedosa Debenture 
(as a chargor) in accordance with the terms of the Lajedosa 
Facility Agreement. It was also agreed, and documented in 
the Lajedosa Activation Notice, that, whilst the terms of the 
Lajedosa Facility Agreement would become effective upon 
the service of the Lajedosa Activation Notice, the commitment 
fee payable under the Lajedosa Facility Agreement (which is 
calculated at the rate of 0.5 per cent per annum on the undrawn 
amounts of the facility made available under the Lajedosa 
Facility Agreement) would not become payable until GRL had 
delivered the first request for a drawdown under the Lajedosa 
Facility Agreement.
Under the PNC Facility Agreement the Company has the right, 
in certain circumstances and subject to certain conditions, to 
(i) require the Lenders, as well as PNC in its capacity as the 
agent, arranger and security agent under the PNC Facility 
Agreement, to transfer to the Company or to any person 
nominated by the Company all (but not part) of their rights, 
benefits and obligations under the PNC Facility Agreement and 
(ii) require any Lender who wishes to assign or transfer any part 
of its participation under the PNC Facility Agreement to a new 
lender to instead assign or transfer such participation to the 
Company or to any person nominated by the Company (together, 
the ‘Purchase Option’). The Purchase Option can be exercised 
by the Company in favour of any person nominated by it, 
including Lajedosa or another Associate (as defined in the 
Listing Rules when used in the context of a controlling 
shareholder (also as defined in the Listing Rules) which is 
a company) of Duodi. If the Company were to exercise the 
Purchase Option in favour of Lajedosa or another Associate 
of Duodi, this would constitute a related party transaction for 
the purposes of Chapter 11 of the Listing Rules. This is because 
Lajedosa is an Associate of Duodi, which is a Related Party of 
the Company by virtue of holding approximately 43.44 per cent 
of the Ordinary Shares (as at the date of this report). As a result, 
Lajedosa itself is also a Related Party of the Company and 
the exercise of the Purchase Option in favour of Lajedosa or 
another Associate of Duodi would be treated as a related party 
transaction for the purposes of Chapter 11 of the Listing Rules.
Summary of planned use of borrowing facilities in the UK
The Company does not expect to use any working capital 
facilities in the short term. If the Company needed to use 
a borrowing facility it would plan to use the PNC Facility 
Agreement as its primary source of working capital funding for 
its UK activities and, under the terms of the PNC ICA, it would 
then not have access to the Lajedosa Facility unless the PNC 
Facility is fully repaid and cancelled.

Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information Significant agreements – change of control
A number of agreements take effect, alter or terminate upon 
a change of control of the Group, such as credit facilities and 
employee share-based incentive schemes. 
The Group’s main credit facilities, under the PNC Facility 
Agreement, contain a provision which means that, should a 
change of control occur (i.e. a person or group of persons acting 
in concert gain, in relation to, the power to (i) cast or control 
the casting of a majority of the votes at a general meeting of 
the Company, (ii) appoint or remove all or the majority of the 
Directors of the Company, (iii) give directions with respect 
for the operating and financial policies of the Company or 
(iv) beneficially hold more than 50 per cent of the share capital 
of the Company), the facilities will be cancelled and the loans, 
together with accrued interest, be declared immediately due 
and payable. However, this is subject to certain exceptions. 
Firstly, should such change of control involve solely Lajedosa 
and/or Duodi and/or any affiliate of either of them taking control 
of the Company, then subject to the Lenders customary ‘know 
your customer’ and anti-money laundering procedures being 
satisfied in relation to the entity or entities which are taking 
control of the Company, then the facilities under the PNC 
Facility Agreement will remain in place. Secondly, the PNC 
Facility Agreement also provides that the Lenders may agree 
that any such event shall not constitute a change of control for 
the purposes of the PNC Facility Agreement. 
The Group’s back-up facility, under the Lajedosa Facility 
Agreement, also contains a change of control provision 
such that, if any person or group of persons acting in concert 
(in each case, other than (i) Lajedosa, (ii) Duodi, and (iii) any 
Affiliate of Lajedosa or Duodi) acquires direct or indirect 
beneficial ownership of more than 50 per cent of the share 
capital of GRL or the Company, as the case may be, or issued 
share capital of GRL or the Company, as the case may be, 
having the right to cast more than 50 per cent of the votes 
being cast in a general meeting of GRL or the Company, as 
the case may be, or otherwise gaining the power to direct the 
management and policies of GRL or the Company, as the case 
may be, whether through the ownership of voting capital, by 
contract or otherwise, then Lajedosa may, by notice to GRL, 
cancel the facility under the Lajedosa Facility Agreement and 
declare loans under it, together with accrued interest and all 
other amounts payable accrued under the Lajedosa Facility 
Agreement and related finance documents, immediately due 
and payable.
Articles of association
Any amendments to the articles of association of the Company 
may be made by special resolution of the shareholders.
Share capital 
The Company’s only class of share is ordinary shares of £0.01 
each. The authorised and issued share capital of the Company, 
together with any shares issued during the period, are set out 
in note 26 of the financial statements. The voting rights of each 
of the ordinary shares in the Company are identical, with each 
share carrying the right to one vote. The rights and obligations 
attached to the ordinary shares are governed by UK law and the 
Company’s articles of association.
Ordinary shareholders are entitled to receive notice of and to 
attend and speak at general meetings. On a show of hands, 
every shareholder present in person or by proxy (or a duly 
authorised corporate representative) shall have one vote and, 
on a poll, every member who is present in person or by proxy 
(or a duly authorised corporate representative) shall have one 
vote for every share held by that member.
Other than the general provisions of the articles of association 
and prevailing legislation, there are no specific restrictions on 
the size of a holding of the Company’s share capital.
The Directors are not aware of any agreements between 
holders of the Company’s shares that may result in the 
restriction on the transfer of securities or on voting rights. 
No shareholder holds securities carrying any special rights 
or control over the Company’s share capital. 
Restrictions on the transfers of shares
The articles of association do not contain any restrictions on the 
transfer of ordinary shares in the Company other than the usual 
restrictions, which are applicable where a share instrument 
is not duly stamped or certified as exempt from stamp duty, 
is in respect of more than one class of share, relates to joint 
transferees and such transfer is in favour of more than four 
such transferees, or relates to shares that are not fully paid.

shall, unless previously renewed, varied or revoked, expire 
on the date falling 12 months after 13 January 2016 or, if later, 
at the conclusion of the next AGM of the Company after 
13 January 2016, save that the Company may, before such

Post balance sheet events
On 27 September 2016 the Group exchanged contracts 
for the sale and leaseback of its freehold property interest 
of the distribution centre and head office buildings located 
in Basingstoke, UK and the immediate leaseback of 
these premises.
The Group will continue to operate its principal UK business 
activities from its Basingstoke head office and continue to 
use its distribution centre as its primary UK store and online 
storage and fulfilment centre.
The new lease for the distribution centre and head office 
property is for an initial 17-year term with a tenant only 
break after 12 years and an annual rent on commencement 
of £1.06 million. The rent will be subject to upward only rent 
reviews every five years. The first rent review will be to 
the higher of open market value and £1.13 million and all 
subsequent reviews will be reset to open market value.
The transaction completed on 7 October 2016. The total cash 
consideration payable on completion was £13.5 million. This 
will create an exceptional gain of £6.2 million, after transaction 
costs of £0.3 million, in the period ending 29 July 2017.
On 4 October 2016, Game Stores Iberia SLU agreed a 
further €10.0 million overdraft facility with BBVA bringing 
the aggregate facilities in Spain to €59.65 million.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
CONTINUED
GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2016
108 The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation and have also chosen to prepare the parent 
company financial statements under IFRSs as adopted by the 
EU. Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the 
Company and of the profit or loss of the Group and the Company 
for that period. In preparing the Group and Company financial 
statements the Directors are required to:
 — properly select and apply accounting policies
 — present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information
 — provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable 
users to understand the impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position 
and financial performance
 — make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. The Directors also have a general responsibility for taking 
such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the 
assets of the Group and Company and hence to prevent and 
detect fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 — the financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by 
the European Union, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as 
a whole
 — the Strategic report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face
 — the Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a 
whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
This responsibility statement was approved by the Board of
Directors on 12 October 2016 and is signed on its behalf by:

Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Revenue recognition and deferral 
A significant level of sales lead to loyalty points being earned by the customer 
and a large number of gift cards are purchased both as gifts and as a way of 
saving for a future purchase. We consider that there is a risk relating to the 
valuation of revenue provisions for loyalty points and gift cards given there is 
inherent judgement in the determination of eventual redemption rates.
 — Loyalty provision – £11.2 million 
 – Revenue is deferred to match future costs associated with the redemption 
of loyalty points. A redemption rate based on historical data is used to 
estimate the quantum and value of points that will be redeemed. 
 — Gift card provision – £7.2 million 
 – Similar to the loyalty provision, a redemption rate is employed to 
estimate the value of gift cards expected to be reclaimed. The amount 
not expected to be redeemed, based on historical usage, is released to 
revenue materially in line with actual redemptions.
Refer to Accounting Policies of the Group on page 121 for the Group’s 
revenue recognition policies and note 21 for the financial disclosure.
We have: 
 — Assessed management’s judgements and estimates on gift cards and 
loyalty points for reasonableness and compliance with accounting 
standards and recalculated the recognition of revenue; 
 — Assessed the change in estimate for gift cards by inspecting the information 
provided by the external service provider and audited the underlying data 
used to inform the breakage assessment for gift cards and loyalty points;
 — Reviewed the process by which management can now reconcile gift 
card data;
 — Performed analytical procedures, comparing the revenue provisions 
against corresponding positions in previous periods and challenged 
explanations for any variances; 
 — Reviewed the accounting entries to check the proper creation of 
provisions, recognition of revenue and the recording of loyalty point costs; 
 — Challenged management’s assessment and presentation of non-recurring 
exceptional adjustments to the provision for historical gift cards; and
 — Reviewed the accounting policy and disclosure note in the financial 
statements to assess consistency with our understanding. 
Opinion on financial statements of GAME Digital plc
In our opinion:
 — the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of 
the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 30 July 
2016 and of the Group’s profit for the period then ended;
 — the Group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union; 
 — the parent company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union and as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 — the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement of

Going concern and the Directors’ assessment of the principal 
risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the Group
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ 
statement regarding the appropriateness of the going concern 
basis of accounting contained within the accounting policies to 
the financial statements and the Directors’ statement on the 
longer-term viability of the Group contained within the Strategic 
report on page 58. 
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
 — the Directors’ confirmation on page 109 that they have 
carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing 
the Group, including those that would threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
 — the disclosures on pages 41 to 44 that describe those risks 
and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
 — the Directors’ statement in the financial statements about 
whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their 
identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s ability 
to continue to do so over a period of at least 12 months from the 
date of approval of the financial statements; and
 — the Directors’ explanation on page 58 as to how they have 
assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they 
have done so and why they consider that period to be 
appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period 
of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We agreed with the Directors’ adoption of the going concern 
basis of accounting and we did not identify any such material 
uncertainties. However, because not all future events or 
conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee 
as to the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Independence
We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting 
Council’s Ethical Standards for Auditors and we confirm that we 
are independent of the Group and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. We 
also confirm we have not provided any of the prohibited 
non-audit services referred to in those standards.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below 
are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the 
allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of 
the engagement team.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF  
GAME DIGITAL PLC Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Inventory valuation
The inventory balance is highly material, being £76.1 million (2015: 
£66.8 million), and assessing net realisable value is an area of significant 
judgement, in particular with regard to the basis and value of provisions, 
being £5.1 million (2014: £4.4 million).
The inventory balance is made up of two components.
 — Mint stock – brand new games, consoles and other items.
 — Pre-owned stock – including items traded in by customers and stock 
purchased from third-party suppliers and subsequently resold.
The determination of the basis of provisioning is a significant judgement 
based on historical experience of stock losses and expected future sales 
prices.
Refer to Accounting Policies of the Group on page 124 for the Group’s 
inventory policy and note 16 for the financial disclosure.
We have:
 — Assessed post period end stock turn for large slow-moving stock lines 
and challenged the level of provisioning; 
 — Assessed the methodology and assumptions used in the calculation of 
the inventory provisions; 
 — Recalculated the provision using source data from a system tested by 
our IT specialists; and
 — Reviewed the accounting policy and disclosure note in the financial 
statements to assess consistency with our understanding. 
Supplier funding – marketing income
GAME receives supplier funding in a number of different forms. Having reviewed 
the different types of funding we consider that the area of significant judgement 
is around marketing income £18.8 million. Marketing income is often given in 
relation to a product rather than for a period of time and so determining when 
the contractual performance conditions have been met, and therefore when to 
recognise the income is a matter of management judgement. 
Refer to Accounting Policies of the Group on page 125 for the Group’s supplier 
funding arrangements policy.
We have:
 — Met with the relationship managers for all the key suppliers to understand 
the arrangements entered into during the period;
 — Reviewed Board minutes and met with key employees involved in the 
supplier funding process to confirm that there are no side letters relevant 
to the accounting of supplier funding arrangements;
 — Checked a sample of marketing income to vendor correspondence and 
game release dates to evaluate the timing of the income recognition; 
 — Performed substantive analytical review and cut-off procedures to assess 
completeness of income; and
 — Agreed a sample of total marketing income to supporting documentation 
and subsequent cash receipt.
Treatment of the acquisition of Ads Reality Limited 
On 4 May 2016 GAME Digital Group acquired the trade and assets of Ads 
Reality Limited for a total purchase price of up to £20 million, being £1 million 
cash consideration and £1 million share consideration on acquisition, and up 
to £18 million post-acquisition remuneration comprising shares that are 
convertible into cash or shares in GAME Digital plc.
There are two main judgemental areas in the acquisition accounting of Ads 
Reality.
 — The allocation of the agreed purchase price (up to £20 million) between 
consideration and post-acquisition remuneration and the determination of 
the amount of post-acquisition remuneration that will become payable, 
based on performance criteria, and should therefore be recognised as an 
expense, on a straight-line basis from acquisition to payment date. IFRS 3 
Business Combinations lists a number of criteria to consider when 
determining if amounts should be considered post-acquisition 
remuneration with the most significant being the requirement of the person 
to remain in employment of the Group in order to receive the shares. 
 — The valuation and useful life of the separately identifiable intangible asset 
in line with IFRS 3.
Refer to Accounting Policies of the Group on page 125 for the Group’s critical 
accounting judgements relating to the acquisition of Ads Reality and note 30 
for the financial disclosure.
We have:
 — Reviewed the allocation of the agreed purchase price. We have 
considered whether amounts paid to management shareholders, which 
is contingent on continued employment, as post-acquisition 
remuneration are in line with IFRS 3 Business Combinations;
 — Reviewed and challenged the key judgements adopted in preparing the 
underlying forecasts such as the forecast revenues and margins used to 
determine the level of post-acquisition remuneration that will become 
payable, based on the performance criteria, and recalculated the 
associated liability;
 — Engaged our internal valuation specialists to evaluate the valuation 
methodology used for the separately identifiable intangible asset, assess 
valuation inputs for market consistency and evaluate the fair value 
model for appropriateness with the entity’s circumstances; 
 — Reviewed the useful life of the separately identifiable intangible asset 
against market expectations and tested the classification and nature of 
assets acquired;
 — Reviewed the allocation of consideration between goodwill and 
intangible assets; 
 — Reviewed the fair value adjustments made to the carrying value of the 
acquisition balance sheet, in addition to adjustments made to align 
accounting policies; and
 — Reviewed the disclosure in the financial statements to assess 
compliance with the requirements in IFRS 3.

Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information Last year our report included a risk which is not included in our 
report this year: Acquisition accounting for Multiplay, as this was 
a one-off event in the prior period.
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with 
the significant issues considered by the Audit and Risk 
Committee discussed on pages 85 to 86.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion 
on these matters.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the 
financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be 
changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the 
scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £1.4 million 
(2015: £1.4 million), which equates to 0.17% of revenue. This is 
a change in base from the period ended 25 July 2015, where 
materiality was determined as 5% of profit before tax, adjusting 
for the IFRS 2 Share-based payment charge relating to the 
public offering. Having considered other measures of the 
business, we changed the materiality base to revenue as it 
provides a more stable measure of the business than does 
profit before tax, whilst still being a key driver of the business 
and a key focus for shareholders. At £1.4 million, our materiality 
level aligns with that adopted in the previous period. We 
consider this to be appropriate on the basis that there have 
been no fundamental changes to the business in the period that 
might cause the users of the financial statements to adopt a 
level of scrutiny that exceeds the materiality threshold that we 
have applied.
We agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would 
report to the Committee all uncorrected audit differences in 
excess of £62,000 (2015: £27,000) as well as differences below 
that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds. The change in our reporting threshold has 
been made following us reassessing what matters require 
communicating. We also report to the Audit and Risk 
Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when 
assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the 
entity and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. 
Audit work to respond to the risks of material misstatement was 
performed directly by the audit engagement team.
The Group operates in two distinct geographical markets, the 
UK and Spain. Significant judgements impacting the 
consolidated Group financial statements have been accounted 
for by head office in the UK with local judgements and 
transactions being owned by the local operating businesses.
A full audit scope was performed over all companies in the 
Group (2015: also 100% full scope). A component materiality of 
£1,260k (2015: £1,247k) was adopted.
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation 
process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our 
conclusion that there were no significant risks of material 
misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the 
remaining components not subject to audit or audit of specified 
account balances.
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of 
planned visits that has been designed so that a senior member 
of the Group audit team visits Spain every year. The component 
audit team in Spain are involved in our team briefing, and we 
discuss their risk assessment, and review documentation of the 
findings from their work.
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Risk of impairment of Multiplay goodwill 
On 2 March 2015 GAME Digital Group acquired 100% of the share capital of 
Multiplay (UK) Limited, giving rise to goodwill of £8.5 million. See note 14. 
In scaling its operations to deliver further growth, the business has 
underperformed against initial plans and budgets, giving rise to the risk 
of impairment.
Management have estimated the value-in-use of Multiplay by assessing 
forecast cash flows, discounted to present value. The key judgements are the 
assumptions underlying the forecast cash flows, which are highly judgemental 
due to the high expected growth rate and limited historical data due to the 
company’s short history within the GAME Group. 
Refer to Accounting Policies of the Group on page 125 for the Group’s critical 
accounting judgements relating to the carrying value of Multiplay goodwill and 
note 14 for the financial disclosure.
We have:
 — Assessed the process for preparing the forecasts;
 — Assessed the key judgements adopted in preparing the underlying 
forecast cash flows such as the forecast revenues and margins;
 — Assessed the discount rate applied with reference to external data;
 — Recalculated the value-in-use computation;
 — Conducted sensitivity analysis to reach a reasonable worst-case 
scenario of performance, by removing less certain forms of income. The 
de-risked value in use was then derived using an inflated discount rate, 
based on increasing the risk premium within a reasonable range; and
 — Reviewed the disclosure in the financial statements to assess 
compliance with the requirements in IFRS 3.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF  
GAME DIGITAL PLC
CONTINUED Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 — the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
 — the information given in the Strategic report and the 
Directors’ Report for the financial period for which the 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion:
 — we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or
 — adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or
 — the parent company financial statements are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if 
in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration 
have not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns. We have nothing to report arising from 
these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review part of 
the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Group’s 
compliance with certain provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising from 
our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we 
are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the 
Annual Report is:
 — materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
financial statements; or
 — apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the 
course of performing our audit; or
 — otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have 
identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired 
during the audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider 
the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and 
whether the Annual Report appropriately discloses those matters 
that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we consider 
should have been disclosed. We confirm that we have not 
identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). We also comply with International Standard on Quality 
Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim 
to ensure that our quality control procedures are effective, 
understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems 
include our dedicated professional standards review team and 
independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and 
the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies 
are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all 
the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report 
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, 
the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the 
audit. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications 
for our report.

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS
FOR THE 53 WEEKS ENDED 30 JULY 2016 General information
GAME Digital plc is a public limited company, which is listed on the 
London Stock Exchange and incorporated in the United Kingdom.
The Group offers an extensive range of gaming and gaming-
related products, including hardware (which comprises 
consoles, personal computers and handheld devices), console 
physical content, console digital content (in the form of 
downloadable content, full game downloads, digital 
subscriptions and digital currency top-ups), non-console digital 
content (such as PC downloads), accessories, licensed 
merchandise and own-label products in the UK and Spain. The 
Group also sells mobile devices and movies. This range (with

model). The Group also operates community-based specialist 
gaming activities including gaming events and esports, digital 
hosting services for businesses and end customers for 
multiplayer gaming. Furthermore, the Group operates a 
software development business specialising in visual 
recognition and augmented reality technologies.
Basis of preparation
GAME Digital plc, and its subsidiaries (together ‘the Group’), is 
required to prepare its consolidated financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) and IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) 
interpretations as adopted by the European Union and in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006 applicable to 
companies reporting under IFRS.
The Group’s accounting reference date is 31 July. The Group 
draws up its financial statements for the accounting period 
ending on the Saturday directly before or following the 
accounting reference date, as permitted by section 390 (3) of the 
Companies Act 2006. 
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical 
cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial 
instruments that are measured at revalued amounts or fair 
values at the end of each reporting period, as explained in the 
accounting policies below. Historical cost is generally based on 
the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods 
and services. The principal accounting policies adopted are set 
out below.
The Group’s accounting policies have been applied consistently.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial 
statements of GAME Digital plc (‘the Company’) and entities 
controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries). Consolidation of a 
subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the 
subsidiary and is deconsolidated from the date that control 
ceases. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the 
financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting 
policies into line with those used by the Group. Intercompany 
transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on 
transactions between Group companies are eliminated on 
consolidation.
Standards affecting the financial statements
Adoption of new and revised standards
The following new and revised standards and interpretations 
are relevant to the Group and have been adopted for the first 
time for the financial period. Their adoption has not had any 
significant impact on the amounts reported in the financial 
statements:
 — Annual Improvements 2010 – 2012 Cycle
 — Annual Improvements 2011 – 2013 Cycle
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are 
effective and have a material impact on the Group.
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and 
interpretations are effective for periods beginning on or after 
31 July 2016, and have not been applied in preparing these 
consolidated financial statements. None of these are expected 
to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial 
statements of the Group:
 — IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
 — Annual Improvements 2012 – 2014 Cycle
 — Amendments to IFRS 11 Acquisitions of Interests in Joint 
Operations
 — Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and 
IAS 38 Intangible Assets
 — Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements
 — Amendments to IAS 7 Cash Flow Statements
 — Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes
 — Amendments to IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial 
Statements.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers has been 
issued and is effective for periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2018 but is not yet endorsed by the European Union. 
We are currently assessing the impact on the consolidated 
financial statements and it is not practical to provide a 
reasonable estimate of the effect of this standard until our 
detailed review has been completed. 
IFRS 16 Leases has been issued and is effective for periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2019 but is not yet endorsed by 
the European Union. We have not begun to assess the impact 
this standard will have on the consolidated financial statements 
and it is not practical to provide a reasonable estimate until a 
detailed review has been completed although as with most 
retailers this standard is expected to have a significant impact 
on the Group’s results and balance sheet.
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not 
yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact 
on the Group.
Significant accounting policies
Going concern
The Company’s business activities, together with factors which 
potentially affect its future development, performance or 
position, can be found in the Strategic report on pages 7 to 65 
and the Directors’ Report on pages 103 to 108.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE GROUP  The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and 
the Company has adequate financial resources to ensure it 
continues to operate for the foreseeable future. In reaching 
their conclusion the Directors have carefully considered the 
cash resources and financing facilities available to the Group 
and have reviewed budgets and forecasts including downside 
sensitivities. On that basis they have adopted the going concern 
basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
Revenue
Revenue from the sale of games and gaming-related products, 
which consists of physical and digital content, hardware and 
accessories, all offered as new and preowned products, 
comprises the value of sales (excluding VAT and similar taxes 
and trade discounts) of goods provided in the normal course of 
business. Revenue is recognised at the point of sale, for high 
street retailing, to the extent that it is probable that the 
economic benefits will flow to the Group. Online revenue is 
recognised when the goods are despatched to the customer. 
Revenue for goods, such as third-party gift cards and digital 
content, sold on a commission basis is recognised net of 
associated purchase costs. A provision is made within revenue 
and cost of sales for estimated customer returns. 
Revenue relating to the organisation and management of events 
is recognised on the occurrence of the event. Hosting revenue 
and multiplayer gaming subscription income is recognised on a 
straight-line basis over the period to which it relates. Software 
development income and similar services are recognised when 
contracts are signed and services are substantially completed 
or over the term of the contracts, as appropriate.
Supplier funding
Supplier rebates and other similar promotional funding are 
recognised as a credit to cost of sales over the period to which 
they relate, based on actual or estimated volumes. 
Suppliers also provide marketing and advertising support to the 
Group which is recognised when specific, incremental and 
identifiable actual costs are incurred, and is classified as a 
reduction to other operating expenses.
Loyalty schemes
The Group operates loyalty programmes which allow members 
to accumulate points on purchases and receive exclusive offers 
and other benefits. Pursuant to IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty 
Programmes, the fair value of the points awarded to customers 
is accounted for as a separately identifiable component of a 
sales transaction. For every loyalty transaction, points are 
earned and the value of those points is estimated. Revenue is 
deferred to match the estimated value of earned loyalty points. 
Deferred revenue is adjusted for the value of points that are not 
expected to be redeemed by customers based on historical 
redemption rates.
When the points are redeemed and the Group fulfils its 
obligations pursuant to the programmes, the revenue that was 
deferred is recognised. 
In the UK, points awarded expire following a period of 12 
months (2015: 18 months) of inactivity. In Spain, the points 
awarded are valid until the end of the following calendar year. 
Gift cards and vouchers
Revenue from gift cards and gift vouchers sold by the Group is 
recognised on the redemption of the gift voucher or gift card. 
Monies received represent deferred revenue prior to 
redemption and are disclosed within accruals. The valuation of 
the accrual is adjusted based on amounts relating to 
outstanding gift card balances where redemption is deemed to 
be remote, calculated based on historical redemption and 
expiry rates, which are recognised within revenue. 
Deposits
The Group takes deposits in advance of new releases of 
software titles, hardware consoles and other products. Monies 
received are recorded in deferred revenue until the date of 
release and despatch to the customer at which point the 
revenue is recognised. Deposits are non-refundable in cash and 
the ability to exchange unredeemed deposits typically expires 12 
months after the launch date of the product. Unredeemed 
deposits relating to products that have been launched are 
recognised within revenue using calculations based on 
historical redemption and expiry rates.
Exceptional items
The Group presents as ‘Exceptional items’ on the face of the 
statement of comprehensive income those items which, 
because of their size, nature or expected infrequency of events 
giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow the 
users of the financial statements to understand better the 
Group’s financial performance in the period. Examples of items 
that may give rise to disclosure as exceptional items include:
 — property-related items arising from a material lease 
reorganisation, such as profit or loss on the disposal of 
property, significant lease surrender costs or similar 
contract cancellation costs and impairment charges
 — corporate-related costs including refinancing costs, costs 
associated with the issue of equity including IPO-related 
costs, costs relating to the administration of the former 
GAME Group and significant costs relating to acquisitions 
and disposals
 — legal costs or litigation settlements from major claims made 
against or by the Group
 — significant restructuring and integration costs including 
store closure costs and major reorganisations within the 
Group
 — material impairments of intangible assets or property, plant 
and equipment as well as the reversal of such write downs or 
impairments
 — material changes in accounting estimates that do not relate 
to the Group’s financial performance in the period.

Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information Operating segments
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with 
the internal reporting presented to the Group’s chief operating 
decision maker. The Group’s operating segments are the UK, 
Spain and Events, Esports & Digital.
Inter-segment revenue and expenses represent items eliminated 
on aggregation and are accounted for on an arm’s-length basis. 
Foreign currencies
The presentational currency of the Group is Pounds Sterling 
because that is the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the Group operates. The functional 
currency of Group companies is Pounds Sterling other than 
Game Stores Iberia SLU for which it is the Euro.
In preparing the financial information of each Group entity, 
transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional 
currency (foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of 
exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At each 
reporting period end, monetary assets and liabilities that are 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates 
prevailing on the balance sheet date. 
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial 
information, income and expense items are translated at the 
average exchange rates for the period. The assets and liabilities 
of the Group’s foreign operations are translated at exchange 
rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. All resulting 
exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive 
income. On the disposal of a foreign subsidiary, the cumulative 
translation differences that were recognised in equity are 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. 
Interest income
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest 
rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of 
interest would be immaterial.
Finance costs
Interest payable is charged to the statement of comprehensive 
income as incurred.
Dividend distribution
Dividends proposed by the Board but unpaid at the period end 
are not recognised in the financial statements until they have 
been approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. 
Interim dividends are recognised when paid. 
Business combinations
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for 
using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred for 
the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets 
transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the 
acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group in exchange 
for control of the acquiree. The consideration transferred includes 
the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent 
consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as incurred. 
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the 
consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling 
interest in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s 
previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the 
fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the 
Group’s previously-held interests in the acquired entity are 
re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date (i.e. the date 
the Group attains control) and the resulting gain or loss, if any, 
is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is 
recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Changes in the 
fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as 
measurement period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, 
with corresponding adjustments against goodwill. Contingent 
consideration that is classified as an asset or liability is 
re-measured at subsequent reporting dates in accordance with 
IAS 39 with the corresponding gain or loss recognised in profit 
or loss. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is 
not re-measured and its subsequent settlement is accounted 
for within equity.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete 
by the end of the reporting period in which the combination 
occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for 
which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts 
are adjusted during the re-measurement period or additional 
assets or liabilities are recognised to reflect new information 
obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the 
acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts 
recognised as of that date. The measurement period is the 
period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains 
complete information and is subject to a maximum of one year.
Investments in associates
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant 
influence but not control, generally accompanying a 
shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. 
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity 
method of accounting whereby the investment is initially 
recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or 
decreased to recognise the share of profit or loss after the date 
of acquisition.
The Group’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss and 
movements in other comprehensive income are recognised in 
the statement of comprehensive income with a corresponding 
adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment.
The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is 
any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is 
impaired.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE GROUP

GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2016
122 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less 
accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost less estimated 
residual values of all property (other than freehold land), plant 
and equipment, on a straight-line basis, over their expected 
useful lives:
 — Improvements to leasehold property – over the lesser of 10 
years or the remaining period of the lease 
 — Freehold property – 50 years
 — Fixtures, fittings and equipment – 3 to 10 years
 — Computer hardware – 3 to 5 years
The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation 
method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with 
the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a 
prospective basis.
Assets under construction are recorded as property, plant and 
equipment and are transferred to the appropriate asset 
category when completed, and depreciated from that date.
Intangible assets – goodwill
Goodwill is initially recognised and measured as set out above.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed annually for 
impairment. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is 
allocated to the relevant cash-generating units of the Group. 
Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more 
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a 
potential impairment. If the recoverable amount of the cash-
generating unit is less than the carrying value of the unit, the 
impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount 
of any goodwill and then to other assets of the unit. An 
impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a 
subsequent period.
Intangible assets – software and development costs
The development of software and website costs are accounted 
for as intangible assets where the criteria of IAS 38 Intangible 
Assets have been met. These intangible assets are valued at 
cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis over three years. 
Amortisation is charged to the other operating expenses line in 
the statement of comprehensive income. Intangible assets with 
finite lives are reviewed for impairment if there is any indication 
that the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
Technology assets acquired in a business combination are 
included in the software, development and technology category 
and are amortised on a straight-line basis over five years.
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and 
recognised separately from goodwill are initially recognised at 
their fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, intangible assets are reported at initial cost less 
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation 
is calculated on a straight-line basis, over their expected useful 
lives as follows:
 — Brand – 8 to 10 years
 — Customer relationships and contracts – 6 to 8 years
Impairment of non-financial assets
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for 
impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate a potential impairment.
 
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying 
amounts of its property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets to determine whether there is any indication that those 
assets have suffered an impairment loss. For the purposes of 
assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels 
for which there are largely independent cash flows (cash-
generating units). An impairment loss is recognised for the 
amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an 
asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. An 
impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Prior impairments of assets (other than goodwill) are reviewed 
for possible reversal at each reporting date. 
Leased assets
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the 
Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the 
minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of 
the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in 
the statement of financial position as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and 
reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of 
interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges 
are charged directly against income, unless they are directly 
attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised 
in accordance with the Group’s general policy on borrowing costs.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the 
statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis 
over the term of the relevant lease. In some instances, the 
Group will agree to revenue-based lease agreements where a 
portion of the rent is contingent upon future sales of the store. 
The costs associated with the revenue-based portion of the 
lease are recognised as a period expense within other operating 
expenses. Leases which include minimum agreed uplifts are 
assessed and calculated on entering the lease and spread over 
the term of the lease.
Premiums paid or lease incentives received on the acquisition of 
short leasehold properties are transferred to the statement of 
comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the length 
of the lease or to a break date that has been exercised where 
relevant.
Assets held for sale
Assets are classified as held for sale when their carrying 
amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction 
and a sale is considered highly probable. On classification as 
held for sale, assets are stated at the lower of carrying amount 
and fair value less costs to sell.
GAME Digital plc

Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Cost is calculated to include, where applicable, duties, 
handling, transport and other directly attributable costs.
Net realisable value is based on estimated normal selling 
prices less further costs expected to be incurred in selling and 
distribution, with a provision being made against lines identified 
as slow-moving, old or at risk of obsolescence. Where relevant 
future expected supplier contributions are considered when 
assessing net realisable values. A further shrinkage provision is 
made to provide for expected stock loss.
Inventories considered by management to be held on a 
consignment basis remain the property of the supplier and 
hence are not recognised on the Group’s balance sheet.
Taxation
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the 
tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date in the countries where the Group operates and has taxable 
income.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on 
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the 
corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable 
profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability 
method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all 
taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits 
will be available against which deductible temporary differences 
can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if 
the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial 
recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that 
affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to 
apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is 
realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is 
charged or credited in the statement of comprehensive income, 
except when it relates to items charged or credited in other 
comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also 
dealt with in other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a 
legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes 
levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to 
settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Pension contributions
The Group makes payments to a number of defined contribution 
pension schemes. The assets of these schemes do not form 
part of the assets of the Group. The pension cost charge 
represents contributions payable during the period.
Share-based compensation
Equity-settled share-based payments and equity-settled 
post-acquisition remuneration granted to employees are 
measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant 
date. The fair value excludes the effect of non-market-based 
vesting conditions.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled 
share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over 
the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of equity 
instruments that will eventually vest. At each balance sheet 
date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity 
instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of market 
and non-market-based vesting conditions. The impact of the 
revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit 
or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised 
estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
The social security contributions payable in connection with the 
grant of the share options is considered an integral part of the 
grant itself, and the charge is treated as a cash-settled 
transaction.
Trade receivables
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value 
and subsequently carried at amortised cost, less provision for 
impairment. To the extent an indicator of impairment is 
identified, a provision for impairment of trade and other 
receivables is established when there is objective evidence that 
the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according 
to the original terms of the receivables. This provision 
represents the difference between the asset’s carrying amount 
and the present value of estimated future cash flows. The 
amount of the provision is recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held 
at call with banks and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are 
shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the statement 
of financial position.
Financial assets held at fair value through profit and loss 
(‘FVTPL ’)
Financial assets are classified as FVTPL when the financial 
asset is either held for trading or it is designated as at FVTPL.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value on 
the contract date and are subsequently valued at fair value at 
each reporting date. Changes in the fair value of derivative 
financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting 
are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as 
they arise.
Trade payables
Trade and other payables are recognised on the trade date of 
the related transactions. Trade payables are not interest-
bearing and are stated at their nominal value.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE GROUP
CONTINUED Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of 
transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated 
at amortised cost, with any difference between the proceeds 
(net of transaction costs) and the redemption value recognised 
in the statement of comprehensive income over the period of 
the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation 
uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, the 
Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities. The estimates and judgements are based on 
historical experience and other factors that are considered to be 
relevant and are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Actual results 
may differ from these estimates. 
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
Inventory provisions
As inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value, this requires the estimation of the eventual sales price of 
goods. A high degree of judgement is applied when estimating 
the impact on the carrying value of inventories to take into 
account factors such as slow-moving items, expected future 
supplier support, shrinkage and obsolescence. There is 
uncertainty in the assessment of the provisions because the 
calculations require management to make assumptions and to 
apply judgement regarding inventory ageing, forecast consumer 
demand, the promotional environment and technological 
obsolescence (note 16).
The shrinkage provision involves uncertainty because the 
calculations require management to make assumptions and to 
apply judgement regarding a number of factors, including 
historical results and expectations of current inventory loss 
trends. The quantity, age and condition of inventories are reviewed 
and assessed through the inventory count process undertaken 
throughout the financial period and across the Group.
Loyalty provision and gift card provision
Management calculates the net cost of loyalty rewards issued 
and estimates the amount that will be redeemed. The resulting 
value is recorded as a deduction to revenue and recognised as 
deferred income in the statement of financial position. The key 
judgement used is the estimated redemption rate. Management 
uses historical redemption rates experienced under the loyalty 
programme and continually reviews the methodology and 
assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns. 
Changes in this redemption rate have the effect of increasing or 
decreasing the provision at the reporting date.
Provisions for future redemptions of gift cards and gift vouchers 
are estimated by management on the basis of historical 
transactions and redemption patterns. Changes in this 
redemption rate have the effect of increasing or decreasing the 
provision at the reporting date. The key judgement is the 
redemption rate which is calculated based on historic data.
In the current year, and as set out in the Audit and Risk 
Committee Report on page 85, management identified an issue 
with the integrity of gift card reporting from the third-party gift 
card provider. This resulted in an exceptional item relating to 
previously unrecognised gift card expiries in respect of prior 
years (note 4). It also resulted in additional income being 
recorded in current period revenue relating to the revision to 
the accounting estimate of future expiries, see the Audit and 
Risk Committee Report on page 85.
Supplier funding arrangements
The supplier funding arrangements that the Group has in place 
for rebates, marketing income and other supplier support are 
not complex and minimal judgement is required in the 
calculations. Rebates are recognised in arrears in line with a 
pre-determined formula codified in signed agreements with our 
suppliers. Marketing income is conditional on the Group 
performing specified actions or satisfying certain performance 
conditions and is recognised over the period earned and when it 
can be reliably measured. Supplier funding is also received to 
support stock clearance and this can be in the form of upfront 
funding to allow the markdown of a particular stock line which 
is recorded on receipt or retrospective margin support for 
promotion and clearance activity which is recognised as sales 
of the stock are made.
Acquisition of Ads Reality
An external valuer assisted management with the identification 
and valuation of the intangible assets of Ads Reality as well as 
the determination of the useful lives of the separately 
identifiable intangible assets. Management reviewed and 
discussed the calculations and assumptions with the external 
valuer. The goodwill and intangibles on the acquisition have 
been reviewed at the period end date for potential impairment.
The total initial purchase price for the acquisition was deemed to 
be consideration and any further amounts payable are classified 
as post-acquisition remuneration as continued employment is a 
requirement for the payments to be made in future years (note 
30). The payment of post-acquisition remuneration is also 
dependent on meeting specified performance conditions and the 
probability of meeting these has been assessed based on current 
expectations and the three year plan for Ads Reality.
Acquisition of Multiplay (UK) Limited
Multiplay (UK) Limited was acquired in the previous financial 
period and as such the adjustment period remains open in the 
current financial period. The latest three year plan for the 
company was reviewed in conjunction with the goodwill 
impairment review and it was concluded that no acquisition 
adjustments are required.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Impairment of goodwill
Following the acquisition of Multiplay (UK) Limited in the previous 
financial period, the Group tests annually whether goodwill has 
suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy 
on page 123. The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit 
has been determined based on value-in-use calculations. This 
calculation requires the use of estimates (note 14).

2. Segmental information
The Group’s Chief Executive Officer is the Group’s chief operating decision-maker. Management has determined the operating 
segments based on the information reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer for the purposes of allocating resources and assessing 
performance.
The Group’s Chief Executive Officer considers the business from a geographic perspective for the retail businesses, namely the UK 
(including one store in the Isle of Man) and Spain and these segments are separately managed. 
Recent acquisitions in the current and previous periods, comprising Multiplay (UK) Limited, Ads Reality Limited and SocialNAT, are 
presented as a separate segment titled ‘Events, Esports & Digital’. The performance of this segment is reviewed separately by the 
Chief Executive Officer, the activities are different to those of the retail segments and significant growth is expected in the next few 
years. The prior period segmental information has been restated to reflect the change in reportable segments.
The Group’s Chief Executive Officer assesses the performance of the operating segments based on Gross Transaction Value, 
Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA defined as follows: 
 — Gross Transaction Value is a non-IFRS measure defined as total retail receipts excluding VAT and before the deduction of 
revenue deferral relating to loyalty points. Gross Transaction Value reflects the full retail sales value of digital sales, agency 
sales (including sales by business partners on GAME’s Marketplace website), warranties and other similar arrangements and 
thereby includes the publishers’ and sellers’ shares of those transactions. Gross Transaction Value provides the most reliable 
measure of activity in an environment where more sales are expected to move from physical to digital. 
 — Revenue is measured in a manner consistent with that in the statement of comprehensive income.
 — The Group defines Adjusted EBITDA as operating profit before depreciation and amortisation, exceptional and adjusting items 
(note 4). Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of the Group’s performance and liquidity that is not required to be 
presented in accordance with IFRS.

management’s view are not reflective of underlying trading, are presented as adjusting items, when calculating non-GAAP 
performance measures, namely Adjusted EBITDA (note 2) and Adjusted Earnings per Share (note 12).

Gift card expiries relating to prior periods and other similar items 1.4 –
Redundancy and reorganisation costs (0.5) –
Total 0.9 –
Gift card expiries relating to prior periods and other similar items relating to prior periods have been presented as exceptional due to 
the size and nature of this amount. New information has been obtained relating to the level of unredeemed and expired gift card 
balances which had not been recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in previous periods and have been recorded as an 
exceptional item in the current year. Further information is set out in the Audit and Risk Committee report on page 85. Other prior 
period items reflect additional costs arising from the recalculation of amounts presented in previous periods for the Virtual Loyalty 
Share Plan, reductions in provisions for liabilities recognised at the time of the acquisition of the former GAME Group together with 
IPO-related items and additional provisions in relation to other prior year items.
Redundancy and reorganisation costs are associated with the implementation of the organisational redesign for the UK businesses 
to ensure they are structured and resourced to drive future growth opportunities and to realise saving opportunities. The 2015-16 
redesign was part of an ongoing process of repositioning the business for growth and involved significant reorganisation of 
functions and roles across the UK activities.
No exceptional items were incurred in the previous period.

Cost of transferring GameStop Spain stores – 0.2
Costs relating to the acquisition of Multiplay (UK) Limited – 0.3
Total adjusting items 12.4 12.2
Brand amortisation arose in the UK on the purchase of the trade and assets from the former GAME Group plc and in Spain on 
consolidation of the company. Following the acquisition of Multiplay (UK) Limited and Ads Reality, the separately identifiable intangible 
assets were capitalised, including brand value, customer relationships and contracts and technology, and amortised over their useful 
lives. These amortisation charges are recurring costs to the Group and therefore not classified as exceptional, however, as they are 
significant non-cash items and are not reflective of the underlying trading of the business are presented as adjusting items.
Post-acquisition remuneration relates to cash and shares payable to certain selling shareholders agreed at the time of the 
acquisition of Multiplay (UK) Limited and this cost is in addition to recurring annual remuneration for these employees. Similar 
post-acquisition remuneration is also payable in shares or cash to certain senior management of Ads Reality (formerly directors of 
Paperclip Mobile Limited) and is in addition to recurring annual remuneration for these employees.
Legal and professional fees associated with the transfer of GameStop Spain store leases and stock to Game Stores Iberia SLU, the 
costs of acquiring Multiplay (UK) Limited and acquisition and impairment costs for Ads Reality are not deemed significant enough 
to meet the definition of exceptional items. However, as the costs are acquisition related and not part of the underlying trading of 
the business they are classified as adjusting.
One-off awards of ordinary shares were made in conjunction with the IPO in June 2014. The share-based payments charge and 
associated costs in respect of these awards are presented within adjusting items due to the nature of the awards. Subsequent 
annual awards are included within operating expenses as they are a recurring cost to the Group.

Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. The recoverable amount of each CGU has been determined from value-in-use 
calculations. The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and 
pre-tax cash flow projections which are derived from the most recent financial budget and forecast approved by management for 
the next three years. The cash flow projections are those by which the recoverable amount of the CGU is most sensitive given the 
early stages of growth of this business. Cash flows beyond the three year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rate 
of 2.2% (2015: 2.9%). The growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the UK.
The pre-tax discount rate which has been applied in determining the value-in-use is 15.59% (2015: 15.59%).
The Group has conducted sensitivity analysis on the impairment test for the Multiplay (UK) Limited CGU. A 22% reduction in the 
pre-tax cash flow projections, a cut in the growth rate to 1.2% and an increase of 3.0% in the discount rate would cause the 
carrying value of goodwill to equal its recoverable amount. No sensitivity analysis has been performed on the SocialNAT and Ads 
Reality CGUs as the goodwill balances are not material to the Group.

The Group acquired a 3% holding in the ordinary share capital of Paperclip Mobile Limited (formerly Ads Reality Limited), a 
company incorporated in England and Wales, on 2 March 2015. No amount has been recorded in the statement of comprehensive 
income as the Group’s 3% share of the results of the company is £nil. No summarised financial information in respect of Ads 
Reality Limited is presented for the period from acquisition to the balance sheet date as the amounts are trivial.
On 4 May 2016 the Group acquired the trade and assets of Paperclip Mobile Limited (formerly Ads Reality Limited) and based on the 
valuation of the company on this date an impairment of £0.1m has been recorded. The remaining £0.1m relates to the acquisition of 
the business and is included within the acquisition accounting (note 30).

in 2014.
16. Inventories

25 July 2015
£m
Finished goods and goods held for resale 76.1 66.8
The cost of inventories, net of rebates, recognised as an expense and included in cost of sales amounted to £616.0m (2015: £661.3m).
The Directors consider that the replacement value of inventories is not materially different from their carrying value. There are no 
individual items of inventory held at fair value less costs to sell. The stock provision as at 30 July 2016 of £5.1m (2015: £4.4m) is an 
estimate of the difference between the cost of stock and its estimated net realisable value. There has been no material reversal of 
provisions made in the previous period and previous write-downs have been reversed where the inventory has been sold in the period.
 
The majority of mint inventory purchased is subject to retention of title when delivered and this is released when the inventory is 
paid for. The asset-based revolving loan facility provided by PNC and Wells Fargo is secured by way of a floating charge over all 
inventory of Game Retail Limited (note 23).

Within trade receivables are balances due from suppliers of £7.0m (2015: £6.0m) which will be offset against future supplier 
balances and payments. There are no specific payment terms associated with these balances hence it is not possible to perform an 
ageing analysis.
Of the remaining £3.5m (2015: £1.4m) of trade receivables balances, £3.0m (2015: £1.2m) are fully performing, £0.4m (2015: £0.2m) 
are up to three months past due but not impaired and £0.1m are impaired (2015: £nil).

At beginning of period 0.4 –
Provisions for receivables impairment 0.8 0.4
Receivables written off as uncollectible – –

At end of period 1.0 0.4
Provisions for trade receivables are made based on estimated irrecoverable amounts determined on a case-by-case basis. The creation 
and release of provision for impaired receivables is included within other operating expenses in the statement of comprehensive income.
The other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets.
The fair values of trade and other receivables are the same as book values due to the negligible credit risk associated with these 
assets and their short duration.

Cash-settled equity forward 0.2 0.9
On IPO in June 2014, the Group created the Virtual Loyalty Share Plan whereby 20,000 of the Group’s most loyal customers in the 
UK were offered virtual shares in the Company. These shares can be redeemed for loyalty points at certain times over a three year 
period at the market value of the shares on that date. At the same time, Game Retail Limited entered into a derivative contract with 
HSBC in order to finance and hedge its liabilities under the Virtual Loyalty Share Plan. The derivative contract takes the form of a 
cash-settled equity forward transaction (the ‘Forward’). The underlying shares in the Company were sold at nominal value to 
HSBC by the selling shareholder on IPO on behalf of Game Retail Limited.
Under the Forward, if the customers participating in the Virtual Loyalty Share Plan redeem Virtual Loyalty Shares, Game Retail 
Limited will communicate this to HSBC and HSBC will reduce the number of Ordinary Shares under the Forward by the same 
number of the Virtual Loyalty Shares that have been redeemed. HSBC will pay to Game Retail Limited the amount that would be 
received if a number of Ordinary Shares equal to the number of Ordinary Shares by which the Forward has been reduced were sold 
at then-current market prices. The cash-settled Forward is carried as a current asset and recognised at fair value through profit 
and loss. The carrying amount reflected above represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk for such loans and 
receivables. 
During the period, a number of shares have been sold under the Forward to match the cost of Virtual Loyalty Shares redeemed by 
customers. The Forward has been revalued at the end of the reporting period to reflect the period end share price.
The Forward has been classified as a Level 1 financial asset in accordance with the fair value hierarchy. The cash ultimately to be 
received by the Group is derived from the Company’s share price, which is publicly available and its shares are quoted on an active 
market.

and services normally settled on 30 days or 60 days following the end of the month of receipt.
The fair values of trade and other payables approximate the book values due to the short-term nature of these items.
Accruals and deferred income includes gift card liabilities of £7.2m (2015: £11.2m), liabilities in respect of the loyalty programme of 
£11.2m (2015: £11.4m) and cash-settled post-acquisition remuneration (note 27) payable in more than one year of £1.1m (2015: £0.3m).

23. Financial instruments
Financial risk management
The main risks arising from the Group’s activities are market risk (primarily foreign exchange risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. 
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, and risk management is controlled by the finance 
functions in the UK and Spain.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be 
undertaken.

Trade and other payables excludes the gift card liabilities and loyalty liabilities detailed in note 21.
The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the 
financial statements approximate their fair values.
Market risk
The Group operates autonomously with respect to trading in the UK and Spain and therefore does not carry any material exposure 
to foreign currency exchange movements in respect of its trading activities. 
The Group is exposed to currency exposures on the Euro on the translation of the investment and the results of its Spanish 
subsidiary and no hedging is carried out to manage this exposure.
Credit risk
Credit risk on trade and other receivables is minimised as the Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties. At the 
end of the reporting period there were no concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is represented by the carrying value of the financial assets in the 
statement of financial position.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having 
similar characteristics. The Group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are related entities.

CONTINUED Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy on liquidity is to ensure that there is sufficient cash, working capital and committed borrowing facilities to meet 
the Group’s medium-term funding requirements. Cash flow forecasting is performed by each trading entity and consolidated 
centrally to manage the Group’s overall position.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves, banking facilities and other financing or similar 
arrangements, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets 
and liabilities.

On 7 October 2015, Game Retail Limited terminated its asset-based revolving loan facility of £25.0m with HSBC Invoice Finance 
(UK) Limited and this facility was not utilised up to the termination date.
 
On 14 October 2015, the Company (as guarantor), its subsidiary Game Retail Limited (as borrower) and certain other subsidiaries of 
the Company (each as guarantors) entered into a secured revolving credit facility agreement with Barclays Bank PLC and HSBC 
Bank PLC (both as original lenders) and HSBC Corporate Trustee Company (UK) Limited (as security agent) in an aggregate 
amount of £30.0m. When utilised the drawn balances accrued interest at a rate of 2.0% per annum plus LIBOR. This facility was 
terminated on 15 July 2016 as detailed below.
On 20 April 2016, the Company, its subsidiary Game Retail Limited (as borrower) and certain other subsidiaries of the Company 
entered into an asset-backed revolving loan facility of up to £100.0m with Lajedosa Investments S.à r.l., a related party (note 31). If 
this facility should become effective, drawn balances would accrue interest at a rate of of 5.5% per annum above LIBOR.
On 15 July 2016, the Company (as guarantor), its subsidiary Game Retail Limited (as borrower) and certain other subsidiaries of the 
Company (each as guarantors) entered into an asset-backed loan facility with PNC Financial Services UK Limited and Wells Fargo 
Capital Finance (UK) Limited in an aggregate amount of £50.0m and an additional £25.0m available for a number of weeks annually 
over the peak Christmas period, expiring on 31 December 2020. If utilised the interest rate on drawn funds is 2.5% per annum plus 
LIBOR.
The Spanish subsidiary reviewed and renewed its overdraft and commercial credit guarantees with BBVA, Banco Santander and 
Caixa Bank S.A. throughout the period and had an aggregate facility of €49.650m at the balance sheet date. The overdraft facility 
incurs interest on drawn funds of between 2.0% and 3.0% per annum above Euribor 90 and the bank guarantees incur interest on 
committed amounts at a maximum of 1.0% per annum. The facilities also incur a quarterly commitment fee of 0.1%.
(b) Currency of cash balances
The currency exposure of the Group’s floating rate net cash balances is shown below:
30 July 2016

Euro 5.5 8.0
US Dollar 0.1 0.3
43.1 63.1
(c) Sensitivity analysis
The Group’s principal funding facilities during the period were a revolving credit facility of up to £30.0m in the UK and an overdraft and 
commercial credit guarantees of up to €49.650m in Spain. The interest on drawn balances attracts a floating rate interest. A 1% 
increase in the floating interest rate would have increased interest payable on drawn balances in the period by £0.1m (2015: £nil).

Overview Strategic report Governance Results Shareholder information Foreign currency risk management
The Group had no material monetary assets or liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the Company and 
each subsidiary. Forward currency contracts are entered into by one subsidiary in the Group to manage foreign currency 
payments, however contract amounts are immaterial and the value of open contracts at the period end totalled £nil (2015: £0.1m).
The Group has one Euro denominated subsidiary whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk. No hedging is 
carried out to manage this exposure although the Group operates a dividend policy ensuring surplus cash is remitted to the UK 
thereby minimising the impact of exchange volatility.
The Group’s main foreign exchange exposure is to the Euro and US dollar. If at the balance sheet date the Pound had weakened/
strengthened by 15% (2015: 15%) against these currencies with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit would have been 
£0.2m higher/£0.4m lower (2015: £0.2m higher/£0.3m lower). Management consider 15% to be a reasonable sensitivity threshold 
based on the fluctuations in the exchange rate in the financial period.
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to 
provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the 
cost of capital.
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents, borrowings and equity attributable to equity holders of 
the parent company, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the statement of changes in equity.

working capital purposes that is drawn down upon in the event that cash flow forecasts show insufficient cash and cash 
equivalents to meet short-term requirements. The capital structure of the Group can also be maintained or adjusted by adjusting 
the amount of dividends paid to shareholders.
24. Deferred taxation
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and when the deferred tax relates to the same fiscal authorities.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable 
profits is probable. The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets of £0.1m (2015: £0.7m) in respect of losses amounting to 
£0.6m (2015: £3.3m) that can be carried forward indefinitely against future taxable income.
Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised on unremitted earnings of the Spanish subsidiary as the dividends by which these are

The Company has a performance share plan (the ‘PSP’), an all-employee share incentive plan (the ‘SIP’) and an all-employee 
sharesave plan (the ‘SAYE Plan’). 
One-off awards of ordinary shares were made in conjunction with the IPO in June 2014 under the PSP and the SIP respectively and 
further awards under the PSP have been made in the subsequent financial periods. No awards have been made or granted under 
the SAYE Plan.
All IPO awards including the SIP were not paid for by the Company or the Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’) and were designed to be 
one-off IPO-related incentives. The share-based payments charge in the accounts in respect of these awards has been excluded 
from Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS calculations, in line with the treatment of other one-off IPO-related costs in the previous 
financial period.

The EBT was established to hold and purchase shares on behalf of the Company, in connection with the obligation to satisfy current 
and future share awards under the PSP and any other employee incentive schemes. The SIP Trust was established to hold and 
purchase shares on behalf of the Company for the benefit of employees, in connection with the SIP.
The EBT has waived its rights to receive dividends on any shares held by them, unless otherwise instructed by the Company, if 
required by the terms of an employee share scheme, or by reference to other requirements set out in the EBT Trust Deed. The 
Company may direct that the Trustee can vote at any general meeting. If the Trustee does vote, the Company cannot direct the 
manner in which the Trustee votes. In the absence of such circumstances, the Trustees of the EBT will abstain from voting at any 
general meeting. 
On certain awards granted under the PSP in previous periods, participants are entitled to any dividends paid during the vesting 
period, to the extent the awards vest. The expected amount of these payments has been included within employee costs in 
operating expenses.
The Trustees of the SIP Trust will waive any dividends and other distributions on any unawarded shares which form part of the 
Trust, unless otherwise instructed by the Company, in line with the terms set out in the SIP Trust Deed. The Trustees of the SIP 
Trust will abstain from voting in relation to any unallocated shares held in the SIP Trust at any general meeting. In respect of 
allocated shares in the SIP Trust, the Trustees will vote in accordance with the participants’ instructions. In the absence of any 
instruction, the Trustees will not vote.
As at the balance sheet date, the SIP Trust held 290,398 (2015: 402,109) ordinary shares of 1p each; and the EBT held 880,989 (2015: 
1,397,756) ordinary shares of 1p each.
Performance share plan
The following awards have been made under the PSP:
1. Director and Senior Manager IPO Awards
Nil cost options were granted to the CEO of the Company and one other senior manager within the Group (‘Director and Senior 
Manager IPO Awards’) for which there is a vesting period of 36 months at the end of which these options will vest, provided certain 
performance conditions are satisfied. The performance condition these options are subject to is continued employment and 
absolute growth in Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) from the IPO Offer Price as follows:
 — 50% will vest for absolute growth of 75% (being equivalent to a compound annual growth rate of approximately 20.5% per 
annum); and
 — 100% will vest for absolute growth of 100% (being equivalent to a compound annual growth rate of approximately 26% per 
annum), with straight-line vesting between these two points. 
TSR at the end of the vesting period will be measured based on the average share price for the Company for the last 30 dealing 
days of that period.

As the Group has recently listed, the volatility was calculated by considering the historical volatility of the share price of 
comparable businesses. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the 
effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Share incentive plan
The SIP is an HMRC approved scheme open to all UK employees at the date of invitation. During the financial period ended 26 July 
2014 the plan made an award of free shares under the SIP to participating employees, with individual values being pro-rated on 
salary and length of service. No further awards have been made in subsequent financial periods. 
There are no performance conditions other than remaining in employment for three years from the date of award. Shares are held 
in the GAME Digital plc Share Incentive Plan Trust (the ‘SIP Trust’) for at least three years and are capable of being released to 
participants at any time thereafter.
The fair value of awards under the SIP was 198p and was equal to the share price on the date of award as there was no price to be 
paid. The weighted average remaining contract life is 0.9 years (2015: 1.9 years).

Equity-settled post-acquisition remuneration
Deferred post-acquisition remuneration comprising 2,079,002 ordinary shares in the Company, valued at £5.0m on a five-day 
average from 24 March 2015, will be payable to certain selling shareholders of Multiplay (UK) Limited subject to their remaining in 
employment with the Group for three years. The earn-out payments are accounted for within share-based payments in the 
statement of comprehensive income as the services are provided and classified as post-acquisition remuneration in other 
operating expenses (note 4).
Deferred post-acquisition remuneration totalling £2.0m and to be settled by the issue of shares will be payable to certain former 
directors of Ads Reality subject to their remaining in employment with the Group for two years and satisfying certain performance 
conditions. The earn-out payments are accounted for within share-based payments in the statement of comprehensive income as 
the services are provided and classified as post-acquisition remuneration in other operating expenses (note 4). Further post-
acquisition remuneration up to a maximum of £16.0m is payable subject to continuing employment and satisfying certain 
performance conditions and profit targets over a five year period from the acquisition date. Management have determined that at 
this early stage in the development of the business, payment is not probable and hence no amounts have been recognised in the 
financial statements.

Share premium account
The share premium account represents amounts received in excess of the nominal value of shares on issue of new shares, net of 
the direct costs associated with issuing those shares. 
Merger reserve
On 11 June 2014 the Group was listed on the Premium Listing segment of the Official List of the UK Listing Authority and trading on 
the main market of the London Stock Exchange following a reorganisation implemented by way of a share-for-share exchange 
made by the Company for the shares of Game Digital Holdings Limited. As the Group had been formed through a reorganisation in 
which GAME Digital plc became a new parent entity of the Group, the consolidated financial statements were prepared as a 
continuation of the existing Group using the pooling of interests method (or merger accounting). 
Merger accounting principles for this combination gave rise to a merger reserve of £130.9m.
Cumulative translation reserve
The translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign 
subsidiaries.
Other reserve
The other reserve represents the value of share capital and share premium to be issued in future periods relating to deferred 
equity-settled post-acquisition remuneration payable on recent acquisitions (note 27).

A number of the Group’s leases are subject to rent payments which are contingent upon the revenue of the stores in question. At 
the balance sheet date the contingent rent accrued was £0.4m (2015: £0.5m). 
30. Business combinations
On 16 February 2016, the Group obtained control of the trade and assets of SocialNAT, a business that organises esports 
championships. The acquisitions support the Group’s Spanish subsidiary with the growth of its esports business. The goodwill of 
£0.5m arising from the acquisition is attributable to the acquired customer base and the skilled and knowledgeable workforce who 
join the Group.
On 4 May 2016, the Group obtained control of the trade and assets of Paperclip Mobile Limited (formerly Ads Reality Limited). Ads 
Reality specialises in the development of innovative and impactful uses of augmented reality and visual recognition technologies 
across a wide range of industries including the video game, retail and entertainment sectors. The acquisition is a complementary 
strategic addition to the Group’s digital capabilities and will support digital marketing solutions to the existing games publisher 
partners and will introduce new non-gaming customers to the Group.

The fair value of the 859,106 ordinary shares issued as part of the consideration paid for Ads Reality was based on the market value 
on the acquisition date.
Post-acquisition remuneration comprising £2.0m of new ordinary shares in the GAME Digital plc will be issuable to certain former 
directors of Ads Reality Limited subject to their remaining in employment with the Group for two years following the acquisition 
date and meeting performance criteria. The earn-out payments are charged to other operating expenses in the statement of 
comprehensive income as the services are provided.
The fair value of trade and other receivables approximates the gross contractual value. The best estimate at the acquisition date of 
the contractual cash flows not to be collected was £nil.
In the period since acquisition on 4 May 2016, Ads Reality Limited has contributed £nil revenue and a loss after tax (including 
post-acquisition remuneration charges and acquisition costs) of £1.0m in the statement of comprehensive income. Had Ads Reality 
Limited been consolidated from 26 July 2015, the statement of comprehensive income would have included pro-forma revenue of 
£0.4m and a profit after tax of £0.1m.

On 25 June 2015, Game Stores Iberia SLU entered into a lease agreement for a property in which a member of key management 
owns 50% of the ordinary share capital of the lessor company. The annual rent is £0.1m and the lease term is for a period of five 
years, however the lessee can terminate the lease at any time by providing three months’ notice.
On 20 April 2016, the Company, its subsidiary Game Retail Limited (as borrower) and certain other subsidiaries of the Company 
entered into an asset-backed revolving loan facility of up to £100.0m with Lajedosa Investments S.à r.l., a related party. Lajedosa 
Investments S.à r.l. is an associate of Duodi Investments S.à r.l. which is a related party of the Company by virtue of holding 
approximately 43.44% of the Company’s ordinary share capital. No amount had been drawn under this facility up to the period end 
date. The cost to the Group of this facility should it be activated is a commitment fee of 0.5% per annum on the undrawn committed 
amount and interest on drawn funds of 5.5% per annum above LIBOR. The Group has an asset-backed loan facility with PNC 
Financial Services UK Limited and Wells Fargo Capital Finance (UK) Limited. This facility is available to Game Retail Limited, the 
Group’s principal UK trading company. This facility would be used, if required, in preference to the Lajedosa facility. The Lajedosa 
facility would only become available if the PNC and Wells Fargo facility was undrawn and cancelled.
32. Post balance sheet events
On 27 September 2016 the Group exchanged contracts for the sale of its freehold property interest in the distribution centre and 
head office buildings located in Basingstoke, UK and the immediate leaseback of these premises.
The Group will continue to operate its principal UK business activities from its Basingstoke head office and continue to use its 
distribution centre as its primary UK store and online storage and fulfilment centre.
The new lease for the distribution centre and head office property is for an initial 17 year term with a tenant only break after 12 years 
and an annual rent on commencement of £1.06m. The rent will be subject to upward only rent reviews every five years. The first rent 
review will be to the higher of open market value and £1.13m and all subsequent reviews will be reset to open market value. 
The transaction completed on 7 October 2016. The total cash consideration payable on completion was £13.5m. This will create an 
exceptional gain of £6.2m, after transaction costs of £0.2m, in the period ending 29 July 2017.
On 4 October 2016, Game Stores Iberia SLU agreed a further €10.0m overdraft facility with BBVA bringing the aggregate facilities 
in Spain to €59.65m.

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS OF THE COMPANY
FOR THE 53 WEEKS ENDED 30 JULY 2016 Basis of preparation
The Company’s accounting reference date is 31 July. The 
Company draws up its financial statements for the accounting 
period ended on the Saturday directly before or following the 
accounting reference date, as permitted by section 390 (3) of the 
Companies Act 2006. 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRS and IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) 
interpretations as adopted by the European Union and in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006 applicable to 
companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical 
cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial 
instruments that are measured at revalued amounts or fair 
values at the end of each reporting period, as explained in the 
accounting policies below. Historical cost is generally based on 
the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods 
and services. The principal accounting policies adopted are set 
out below and have been applied consistently through the period 
and the preceding period.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation 
uncertainty
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS 
requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the 
reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting 
period.
Significant items subject to such assumptions and estimates 
include the carrying value of investments and the recognition of 
deferred tax assets and liabilities for potential corporation tax. 
The most critical accounting policies in determining the 
financial condition and results of the Company are those 
requiring the greatest degree of subjective or complex 
judgements. This includes taxation, including the assessment of 
future earnings to determine the extent to which deferred tax 
can be recognised and the assessment of qualifying deductions.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on 
historical experience and various other factors that are believed 
to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which 
form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values 
of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other 
sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
There are no critical accounting judgements and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty.
Standards affecting the financial statements
Adoption of new and revised standards
The following new and revised standards and interpretations are 
relevant to the Company and have been adopted for the first time 
for the financial period. Their adoption has not had any significant 
impact on the amounts reported in the financial statements:
 — Annual Improvements 2010 – 2012 Cycle
 — Annual Improvements 2011 – 2013 Cycle
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are 
effective and have a material impact on the Company.
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and 
interpretations are effective for periods beginning on or after 
31 July 2016, and have not been applied in preparing these 
financial statements. None of these is expected to have a 
significant effect on the financial statements of the Company:
 — IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
 — IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 — IFRS 16 Leases
 — Annual Improvements 2012 – 2014 Cycle
 — Amendments to IFRS 11 Acquisitions of Interests in Joint 
Operations
 — Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and 
IAS 38 Intangible Assets
 — Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements
 — Amendments to IAS 7 Cash Flow Statements
 — Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes
 — Amendments to IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial 
Statements
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not 
yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact 
on the Company.
Going concern
The Company’s business activities, together with factors which 
potentially affect its future development, performance or 
position, can be found in the Strategic report on pages 7 to 37 
and the Directors’ Report on pages 103 to 108.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company 
has adequate financial resources to ensure it continues to 
operate for the foreseeable future. In reaching their conclusion 
the Directors have carefully considered the cash resources and 
financing facilities available to the Company and Group and have 
reviewed budgets and forecasts including downside 
sensitivities. On that basis they have adopted the going concern 
basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
Significant accounting policies
Foreign currencies
The presentational and functional currency of the Company is 
Pounds Sterling because that is the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the Company operates. 
In preparing the financial information of the Company, 
transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional 
currency are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing at 
the dates of the transactions. At each reporting period end, 
monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign 
currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the 
balance sheet date. 
Interest income
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest 
rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of 
interest would be immaterial.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE COMPANY Dividend distribution
Dividends proposed by the Board but unpaid at the period end 
are not recognised in the financial statements until they have 
been approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. 
Interim dividends are recognised when paid. 
Investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less 
provision for impairment reviewed annually on the reporting 
date.
Taxation
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred 
tax.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the 
tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on 
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax 
bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is 
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred 
tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against 
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such 
assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary 
difference arises from the initial recognition of other assets and 
liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor 
the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to 
apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is 
realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is 
charged or credited in the statement of comprehensive income, 
except when it relates to items charged or credited in other 
comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also 
dealt with in other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a 
legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes 
levied by the same taxation authority and the Company intends 
to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Pension contributions
The Company makes payments to a defined contribution 
pension scheme. The assets of this scheme do not form part of 
the assets of the Company. The pension cost charge represents 
contributions payable during the period.
Share-based compensation
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are 
measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant 
date. The fair value excludes the effect of non-market-based 
vesting conditions. Details regarding the determination of the 
fair value of equity-settled share-based transactions are set out 
in note 8.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled 
share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over 
the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of equity 
instruments that will eventually vest. At each balance sheet 
date, the Company revises its estimate of the number of equity 
instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of 
non-market-based vesting conditions. The impact of the 
revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit 
or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised 
estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
When employees of the Company’s subsidiary companies are 
issued equity-settled compensation awards over shares in the 
Company, the Company recognises an increase in the value of 
its investment in the subsidiary and an increase in reserves. 
The social security contributions payable in connection with the 
grant of the share options is considered an integral part of the 
grant itself, and the charge is treated as a cash-settled 
transaction.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value 
and subsequently carried at amortised cost, less provision for 
impairment. To the extent an indicator of impairment is 
identified, a provision for impairment of trade and other 
receivables is established when there is objective evidence that 
the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due 
according to the original terms of the receivables. This provision 
represents the difference between the asset’s carrying amount 
and the present value of estimated future cash flows. The 
amount of the provision is recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held 
at call with banks and bank overdrafts. 
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised on the trade date of 
the related transactions. Trade payables are not interest-
bearing and are stated at their nominal value.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE COMPANY
CONTINUED 1. Statement of comprehensive income
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, no 
statement of comprehensive income and related notes to the 
financial statements have been presented. The Company’s profit 
for the period was £23.0m (2015: £52.0m).
2. Fixed asset investments
The Company owns 100% of the ordinary share capital of Game 
Digital Holdings Limited, a holding company incorporated in the 
UK.

Cost and net book value
At beginning of period 4.2 1.6
Additions 18.5 2.6
At end of period 22.7 4.2
The £18.5m (2015: £2.6m) addition in the period reflects the 
increase in the value of the investment for equity-settled 
compensation awards recorded in the Company’s subsidiary 
undertakings as detailed in the share-based compensation 
accounting policy of £2.5m (2015: £2.6m) and an additional 
investment in Game Digital Holdings Limited of £16.0m.
The Directors believe that the carrying value of fixed asset 
investments is supported by the value of their future cash flows.
3. Trade and other receivables

Amounts owed by group undertakings 25.0 11.7

Within amounts owed by group undertakings, £25.0m (2015: 
£8.3m) incurs interest at a rate of 0% (2015: 5%) and is 
repayable on or before 21 June 2031 (2015: 23 January 2016). 
The remaining balance of £nil (2015: £3.4m) is unsecured, 
interest free and is repayable on demand.
The fair values of trade and other receivables are the same as 
the book values due to the negligible credit risk associated with 
these assets and their short duration.

Amounts owed to group undertakings are unsecured, interest 
free and repayable on demand.
The fair values of trade and other payables approximate the 
book values due to the short-term nature of these items.
5. Financial instruments
Financial risk management
The Directors of the Company are responsible for financial risk 
management. The main risks arising from the Company’s 
activities are liquidity risk, market risk (primarily foreign 
exchange risk) and credit risk. The Directors review and agree 
policies for managing each of these risks, and risk management 
is controlled by the finance function in the UK.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the 
Company’s policy that no trading in financial instruments shall 
be undertaken.

Total financial assets 1.3 1.3
The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial 
assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the 
financial statements approximate their fair values.
Market risk
The Company operates in the UK and therefore does not carry 
any material exposure to foreign currency exchange movements 
in respect of its activities except on the translation of monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in Euro. 
Credit risk
The Company does not enter into derivatives contracts to 
manage its credit risk.
With respect to credit risk arising from financial assets of the 
Company which comprise trade and other receivables and cash 
at bank, the Company’s exposure to credit risk arises from the 
default of the counterparty with a maximum exposure equal to 
the carrying amount of these instruments.

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE 53 WEEKS ENDED 30 JULY 2016 Liquidity risk
The Directors seek to maintain sufficient liquid assets to settle 
liabilities as they fall due.
The Company had made an interest-bearing loan to a subsidiary 
undertaking but was not exposed to interest rate risk as the rate 
was fixed at 5%.
(a) Cash balances
All cash balances are held in interest-bearing Sterling bank 
accounts.
(b) Sensitivity analysis
The Company was exposed to currency fluctuations through one 
balance due to a subsidiary undertaking denominated in Euro 
and this balance was repaid in full in December 2015. If at the 
balance sheet date the Pound had weakened/strengthened by 
15% against the Euro with all other variables held constant, 
post-tax profit would have been £nil higher/£nil lower (2015: 
£0.1m higher/£0.1m lower). Management consider 15% to be a 
reasonable sensitivity threshold based on the fluctuations in the 
exchange rate in the financial period.
Capital risk management
The Company’s objectives when managing capital are to 
safeguard the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern 
and retain sufficient funds to continue to invest and grow its 
activities whilst providing appropriate returns for shareholders 
and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal 
capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
The capital structure of the Company consists of cash and cash 
equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the 
Company, comprising issued capital, share premium and 
retained earnings as disclosed in the statement of changes 
in equity.

awards under the PSP have been made in subsequent financial 
periods. 
The charge recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income for share-based payments and associated costs in the 
period is £nil (2015: £0.4m) and £0.3m (2015: £0.2m) has been 
recorded in equity.

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE 53 WEEKS ENDED 30 JULY 2016
CONTINUED Shares held in the EBT
The EBT was established to hold and purchase shares on behalf 
of the Company, in connection with the obligation to satisfy 
current and future share awards under the PSP and any other 
employee incentive schemes. 
The EBT has waived its rights to receive dividends on any shares 
held by them, unless otherwise instructed by the Company, if 
required by the terms of an employee share scheme, or by 
reference to other requirements set out in the EBT Trust Deed. 
The Company may direct that the Trustee can vote at any 
general meeting. If the Trustee does vote, the Company cannot 
direct the manner in which the Trustee votes. In the absence of 
such circumstances, the Trustees of the EBT will abstain from 
voting at any general meeting.
On certain awards granted under the PSP in previous periods, 
participants are entitled to any dividends paid during the vesting 
period, to the extent the awards vest. The expected amount of 
these payments has been included within employee costs in 
operating expenses.
As at the balance sheet date, the EBT held 880,989 (2015: 
1,397,756) ordinary shares of 1p each.
Performance share plan
The following awards have been made under the PSP:
1. Director and Senior Manager IPO Awards
Nil cost options were granted to the CEO of the Company and 
one other senior manager within the Group (‘Director and 
Senior Manager IPO Awards’) for which there is a vesting period 
of 36 months at the end of which these options will vest provided 
certain performance conditions are satisfied. The performance 
condition these options are subject to is continued employment 
and absolute growth in Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) from 
the IPO Offer Price as follows:
 — 50% will vest for absolute growth of 75% (being equivalent to 
a compound annual growth rate of approximately 20.5% per 
annum); and
 — 100% will vest for absolute growth of 100% (being equivalent 
to a compound annual growth rate of approximately 26% per 
annum), with straight-line vesting between these two points. 
TSR at the end of the vesting period will be measured based on 
the average share price for the Company for the last 30 dealing 
days of that period.

options are as follows:

2. The Senior Employee PSP Awards
Nil cost options have been granted to certain senior employees 
(‘the Senior Employee PSP Awards’) for which there is a vesting 
period of 36 months at the end of which these options may vest. 
All awards are conditional on the employee completing three 
years’ service and most awards require certain performance 
conditions to be satisfied including achieving Adjusted Earnings 
per Share targets and absolute growth in TSR.

Risk-free rate 0.56% 0.96%
Expected volatility 30.49% 29.09%
Expected life 3 years 3 years
As the Company has recently listed, the volatility was calculated 
by considering the historical volatility of the share price of 
comparable businesses. The expected life used in the model 
has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for 
the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and 
behavioural considerations.
9. Related party transactions
During the period, the Company recharged £0.6m (2015: £0.4m) 
of costs relating to the management and operations of Group 
companies to certain trading subsidiaries. Balances are 
included within amounts owed by group undertakings (note 3).

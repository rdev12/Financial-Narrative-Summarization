_01_cover.indd   1 16/10/2007   18:01:41 Pure Wafer is a worldwide leader in the provision of 300mm wafer reclaim services. 
These services enable semiconductor manufacturers to gain efﬁciencies through the 
increased re-use of silicon test wafers within their production processes. 
“
”
Our history
Pure Wafer was established in 
2000 by a management team widely 
experienced in the semiconductor 
industry with the backing of strategic 
investment from Venture Capital and 
industry partners. 
The Group ﬂoated on AIM in 
December 2004 and in February 
2007 Pure Wafer completed the 
acquisition of a wafer reclaim 
facility in Arizona, US.
The Group is now an industry leading 
provider of wafer reclaim services.
 
Our facilities – UK
The UK business operates from a 
state of the art, purpose built facility 
situated in a new technology park 
in Swansea, Wales and is the most 
advanced plant of its kind in Europe. 
The size of the facility is in excess of 
4,500m
2
 and includes over 2,000m
2
 
of production cleanrooms. 
We have installed the latest generation 
of tools available on the market, 
with the most advanced equipment 
as used by IC and prime silicon 
producers. With the highest technical 
speciﬁcations, we are positioned to 
offer the most effective wafer reclaim 
service to our customers with minimal 
silicon removal. This enables our 
customers to maximise the number 
of times a test wafer can be reclaimed.
Our facilities – US
The facility in Prescott, Arizona 
was constructed in 1997 and 
has received in excess of $40m 
of investment since then. This high 
volume high-tech fab has been 
focussed on provision of 100mm, 
125mm, 150mm and 200mm 
wafer reclaim services, but following 
the acquisition by Pure Wafer in 
February 2007 capability to reclaim 
300mm wafers has been installed.
Wafer reclaim
During the many stages of 
the manufacturing process of 
semiconductors, large quantities 
of test wafers are used to check 
the accurate calibration of 
equipment. These test wafers 
are a key consumable in the 
manufacture of semiconductors 
and the ability to reclaim them 
through Pure Wafer’s advanced 
process provides manufacturers 
with the opportunity to reduce costs.
The semiconductor industry is currently 
seeing a rapid transition to 300mm 
wafers. In order for manufacturers to 
continue to increase functionality at a 
reduced cost, the industry has sought 
to increase the size of wafers on which 
semiconductors are manufactured. 
300mm wafer processing now 
represents the fastest growing area 
of the semiconductor industry.
However, wafer reclaim is a 
highly specialised and technically 
sophisticated process. Only a few 
companies worldwide are able to 
meet the exacting standards required 
by semiconductor manufacturers 
for the reclaim of 300mm wafers, 
of which Pure Wafer is one.
Our process
At Pure Wafer, our process for 
reclaiming test wafers involves 
the following key stages: 
  Inspection of the wafers for 
defects and classiﬁcation by type 
of contaminant to be removed 
  Submersion in a precise mix 
of chemicals appropriate to 
remove the contaminant 
  Assessment of ﬂatness and 
correction of defects using 
Pure Wafer’s advanced 
polishing processes 
 Cleaning and drying 
  Final quality inspection 
and packaging for return 
to the customer
The Company has an established track record, one of the world’s most advanced wafer 
reclaim facilities and a blue chip customer base that includes some of the world’s 
largest semiconductor manufacturers and independent foundries. As a business 
partner, Pure Wafer works with its customers to design and develop a service that 
delivers reclaimed wafers to the exact speciﬁcations and high standards required 
by today’s leading semiconductor manufacturers.

Chairman’s statement
This has been a good year of progress. The Board expects 
proﬁtable growth during ﬁnancial year 2008. 
“
”
Introduction
This has been a good year of progress and gives a ﬁrm basis for optimism about the future. 
I am pleased to announce that the management team has again met expectations and continued 
to deliver growth in proﬁt, in particular a 54% increase in EBITDA and a 46% increase in adjusted 
diluted EPS.
This year has been the most signiﬁcant in terms of strategic positioning since the formation of 
the Group. We acquired a wafer reclaim facility in Arizona, US during February of this year which 
gives us further access to a very exciting market.
We also saw the exit of our original venture capital funding partner, Apax Partners Limited (“Apax”). 
On behalf of all at Pure Wafer, I would like to thank Apax for their continued support from formation 
until the day they exited. Without Apax’s initial ﬁnancial and management support to one of the 
UK’s largest ever venture capital backed greenﬁeld start-ups, Pure Wafer would not be in the 
enviable position that we ﬁnd ourselves in today.
Shareholders may wish to note that the Group’s results have been signiﬁcantly affected by 
movements in the US Dollar. I draw your attention to the ﬁnance director’s analysis in the ﬁnancial 
review and point out that movements in the exchange rate this year have had a negative impact 
of approximately £1.4m on our pre-tax proﬁts. It is worth noting that the US acquisition will 
reduce our exposure to currency movements on new business in our largest market.

Management
We have further strengthened our Board this year by the appointment of Paul Dolan, a chartered 
accountant and formerly a partner of Deloitte, as non-executive director following the departure 
of the Apax representative, John Samuel.
Our senior management team is also beneﬁting from the wealth of experience and skills acquired 
as part of the purchase of our US facility. The senior management of the US site has many years 
experience of the semiconductor and wafer reclaim industry between them, in many key areas 
from manufacturing and process development through to sales.
I shall take this opportunity to welcome our new colleagues in Arizona and all new employees in 
Swansea, and to congratulate them on joining this successful, results driven Group.
I would like to thank the entire team across both sites, led by Keith Baker, for their hard work and 
continued delivery of results. I am conﬁdent that they will continue to strive for success and 
achievement in the current ﬁnancial year.
Outlook
The Board expects proﬁtable growth during the next ﬁnancial year as the Group exploits its strong 
position in the expanding global 300mm wafer reclaim market. The results for the ﬁrst quarter 
of ﬁnancial year 2008 are expected to be affected by technical difﬁculities slowing down the ramp 
of a new product line with a single customer. With support from the customer we have recently 
developed an improved manufacturing process that we believe will enable us to run this product 
in higher volume. 
We look to the future with conﬁdence.

Chief executive’s review
Highlights
  Another year of record 300mm 
reclaim volumes
  Further capacity increases 
underway
  Arizona site performed in line 
with expectations
  New customers on board
  Market growth continues
Operational review
Volumes for all wafer sizes were increased during the year, with 300mm volumes up by 53% 
and 200mm volumes up by 131% (enhanced by our North American acquisition). The month 
of June 2007 saw a record for 300mm wafer reclaim at Pure Wafer.
We are planning to further increase our 300mm wafer reclaim capacity at the Swansea site 
to 100,000 wafers per month at the end of the ﬁnancial year to June 2008, through further 
process development and capital expenditure. Such expenditure will be fully funded through 
cash generation and existing facilities.
Prescott site, Arizona, US
The development of the US site that we acquired in February this year continues in line with our 
original plans. The existing business is cash positive and proﬁtable on an operating proﬁt level. 
I am pleased to announce that the transfer of the 300mm technology from our Swansea site is 
progressing satisfactorily: the ﬁrst 300mm wafer reclaim line is now substantially in place and the 
installation is running according to plan, both in terms of cost and time. We expect capacity of 
this 300mm line to be approximately 20,000 wafers per month at the end of our ﬁnancial year 
to June 2008.
Market and products
Our customer base has signiﬁcantly increased as a result of the acquisition, more than doubling 
to over 80 customer sites, and I would like to take this opportunity to welcome all new Pure Wafer 
customers and to thank them for their support through the change of ownership of the US plant.
Smaller diameter wafer reclaim (100mm, 125mm and 150mm) is a new addition to the Pure Wafer 
product portfolio and has been gained through our US acquisition. These are proﬁtable product 
lines, with well established processes in a developed market place.
The current slowdown within the semiconductor industry is having the impact of reducing the 
demand for smaller diameter wafer reclaim as customers look to switch towards the more efﬁcient 
300mm manufacturing. With the comprehensive product offerings within the business we are well 
placed to support our customers through this transition.
Both the Swansea site and the newly acquired Arizona site 
performed in line with our expectations. 
“

As expected, the competitive landscape is increasing as the market continues its growth, with 
two new 300mm competitors emerging in Taiwan and existing competitors continuing to increase 
capacity. We feel that we are well placed with our multi-site locations, leading technology, and 
wealth of experience, to maintain our position as a leading supplier of 300mm products.
During the year we shipped in high volume our new 50nm product offering. This product is very 
much in the early stages of product ramp, but we remain optimistic about the future potential of 
this product line.
New technology
We are continuing to look at opportunities outside of wafer reclaim, following the successful 
introduction of our 50nm product. We are conﬁdent that there are many more ways that we can 
leverage our world-class cleanrooms and silicon polishing expertise in order to continue to deliver 
increasing shareholder value in the future.

Financial review 
Turnover
Turnover for the period was £22.35m, an increase of 54% on last year (2006: £14.52m).
Analysed by destination:
 Europe £7.51m, up 76% (2006: £4.27m)
 North America £9.32m, up 43% (2006: £6.51m)
 South East Asia £5.52m, up 48% (2006: £3.73m)
Analysed by product:
 150mm wafer reclaim £0.43m (a new product line in the year as a result of the acquisition)
 200mm wafer reclaim £3.39m up 93% (2006: £1.76m)
 300mm wafer reclaim and 50nm polishing £17.26m up 35% (2006: £12.76m)
  Other revenue £1.27m, a new revenue stream in the year comprising smaller diameter 
wafer reclaim and scrap sales
Proﬁt before tax
Proﬁt before tax was £2.70m, up 38% on prior year (£1.96m). We added new wafer reclaim product 
lines with the acquisition (150mm diameter and smaller), and continued to organically grow 
existing business. Wafer volumes of each size continued to increase and each size remains proﬁtable.
Margins were impacted by the weaker US Dollar in the year and the acquisition of a site currently 
without the beneﬁt of the higher margin 300mm volumes.
Despite the challenges thrown up from the increase in customer speciﬁcations as the requirement 
for smaller and lower numbers of particles per wafer continues to progress, the consolidated 
Group has managed to continue to reduce the cost per 300mm equivalent wafer. We are continuing 
our focus on cost reduction and are pursuing production cost per wafer savings across both 
manufacturing sites.

Foreign exchange
As over 95% of Group revenue is in US Dollars, revenue and margins are impacted by the 
movement in the currency. 
As can be seen in the table below, year on year, the average rate achieved by the Group (after 
taking into account the impact of hedging instruments) has moved negatively by approximately 8%.

We continue to convert as much of the costbase as possible to US Dollars in order to provide a 
natural hedge against the US Dollar revenue streams.

Cash ﬂow and capital expenditure
The Group continues to be increasingly cash generative on an operating cash level, with a net 
cash inﬂow from operating activities of £4.26m (2006: £2.68m).
During the period, capital equipment with the value of £7.60m was acquired, with £5.64m 
of this expenditure happening at the UK site. The construction in progress value (£1.89m) 
relates to the upgrade of the US site and installation of a 300mm wafer reclaim line. 
Construction is nearing completion, and is currently running broadly in line with the 
ﬁnancial budget.
Taxation
There is no tax charge across the Group, as taxable proﬁts generated within the UK have been 
set against tax losses brought forward. The directors are conﬁdent of the trading and ﬁnancial 
prospects of the Group, so based upon short-term forecasts, the remaining available unutilised 
UK tax losses (£2.86m) were recognised in the balance sheet during 2007. This will have the 
impact in future periods of showing a UK tax charge in the proﬁt and loss account, but with 
no cash impact until the deferred tax asset has unwound.
Acquisition
The total purchase cost of US$11.20m comprised a payment of US$7.50m on completion, 
US$1.75m interest free deferred consideration falling due after 12 months, and a further 
US$1.95m interest free deferred consideration falling due after 24 months.
The initial purchase payment of $7.50m was funded through a four year variable rate 
interest loan from Royal Bank of Scotland (“RBS”) that was ﬁxed through an interest swap 
at the time of drawdown to a rate of 6.94% per annum. The deferred consideration payments 
are not contingent, and accordingly are backed by a letter of credit from RBS. The two deferred 
consideration payments have been discounted to present values, and are reﬂected in the 
accounts as a ﬁnancial liability within net funds. As the amounts have been discounted, 
an imputed non-cash interest charge is levied through the proﬁt and loss account each 
period until the deferred considerations are paid.
Financial review continued
The Group continues to be increasingly cash generative on an 
operating cash level.

International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”)
Following a European Union Regulation (IAS Regulation EC 1606/2002) issued in June 2002 
and AIM notice 22, Pure Wafer plc is required to prepare its consolidated ﬁnancial statements 
under International Financial Reporting Standards with effect for the year ending 30 June 2008.
This is the last set of Pure Wafer plc ﬁnancial statements prepared under UK GAAP . The Group 
adopted IFRS on 1 July 2007 and consequently future ﬁnancial reporting will be under IFRS. 
The Group will hold a brieﬁng at the Annual General Meeting to update stakeholders on the 
impact of adoption of IFRS.
EPS and dividend
Diluted EPS for the period was 20.59p (2006: 14.42p), which included the effect of the  
recognition of the UK deferred tax asset and FRS20 share option charge. Excluding these 
items, adjusted diluted EPS for the Group was 11.11p (2006: 7.63p).
As at 30 June 2007, the Group did not have sufﬁcient distributable reserves for the Board to 
be able to recommend a dividend. Accordingly, no dividend is payable for this ﬁnancial year.
Following the end of the ﬁnancial year, the subsidiary company Pure Wafer International Limited 
completed a capital reduction which is expected to leave the Group with distributable reserves 
by 30 June 2008.

Introduction
The directors present their annual report and audited ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 30 June 2007.
The accounts are the third set of accounts for the Pure Wafer plc Group and the ﬁrst containing results of the newly acquired US operations. 
The US facility was acquired on 12 February 2007, so accordingly the Pure Wafer plc Group results reﬂect the 4.5 months of trading since 
the acquisition.
Review of business and future developments
The principal activity for the Group remains the reclaim of silicon test wafers.
The Group proﬁt and loss account is set out on page 22.
A review of developments affecting the Group during the year and its prospects for the future is set out in the chairman’s statement and 
the chief executive’s review.
Dividends
The directors do not recommend a dividend for the period.
Research and development
The Group has continued to invest in the ongoing continuous improvement of a proven process to reclaim silicon test wafers, together with 
complementary products. Costs attributable to the development of the wafer reclaim process have been charged to the proﬁt and loss account 
as incurred.

Employees
The Group’s employment policies are designed to attract, retain and motivate the very best staff for each role in the Group, recognising that this 
can be achieved only through offering equal opportunities regardless of gender, race, religion or disability.
Regular meetings are held with employees to discuss the performance of the Group as a whole and the area in which they work. Financial and 
economic factors are dealt with in this context.
Information concerning employees and their remuneration is given in notes 4 and 5 to the accounts and in the report of the remuneration committee.
Supplier payment policy
The Group’s policy in relation to the payment of its suppliers is to settle its terms of payment with each supplier when agreeing the terms of each 
business transaction. The supplier is made aware of the terms, which are detailed on the Group’s purchasing orders. It is the Group’s practice 
to abide by the agreed terms of payment. The Group’s creditor payment period was 60 days (2006: 72 days) and the Company’s creditor 
payment period was 86 days (2006: 78 days).

Authority to issue and allot shares
The Companies Act 1985 contains restrictions on the power of the directors to allot a company’s shares. As a result, the directors may only 
issue the shares pursuant to the authority within the statutory terms given by shareholders’ resolutions or contained in the Articles of Association. 
Their power to issue equity shares for cash to persons other than the existing shareholders is similarly restricted.
Resolutions to confer these authorities were passed at the previous Annual General Meeting (AGM) not on incorporation. These authorities 
will expire at the conclusion of the 2007 AGM unless previously renewed, varied or revoked by the Group in general meeting.
Resolutions to renew the authorities will be proposed at the AGM to be held on 14 November 2007.
Subsequent to the passing of these resolutions, the directors will have the authority to allot shares up to an aggregate nominal amount 
of £159,547 and it will not be necessary for the directors to seek further approval from shareholders to issue shares for cash to persons, 
other than existing shareholders, up to an aggregate nominal amount of £26,591.
Financial risk management
The directors’ assessment of key ﬁnancial risks and policies in place to mitigate those risks, is set out in note 18 to the ﬁnancial statements.
_0_PUR_ar07_back.indd   13 16/10/2007   18:02:38 14 Pure Wafer plc Annual report and accounts 2007
Health and safety, environmental and social responsibility
The Group has detailed health and safety guidelines which are communicated to all employees, and which are regularly reviewed for suitability 
in the context of the Group’s activities.
The Group is fully committed to protecting the environment in which we live and work, both ecologically and socially. A formal policy is in place 
with internal management control systems to ensure that this is achieved as best as is practicable and to ensure that the International Standard 
for Environmental Management ISO 14001 is met.
Key performance indicators
Commentary on key performance indicators is included in the ﬁnancial review on page 8. The Board deem that the Group’s signiﬁcant KPIs are 
largely ﬁnancial and include: turnover, proﬁt before tax, results at constant exchange rates, cash ﬂow and EPS.
Charitable and political donations
The Group did not make any monetary charitable or political donations during the period.
Provision of information to auditors
Each of the persons who is a director at the date of approval of this report conﬁrms that:
 so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Group’s auditors are unaware; and
  the director has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken as a director in order to make himself/herself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Group’s auditors are aware of that information.
This conﬁrmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of Section 234ZA of the Companies Act 1985.
Going concern
The directors are of the opinion that, at the time of approving the ﬁnancial statements, the Group has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
ﬁnancial statements.
By order of the Board

Directors’ report for the year ended 30 June 2007 continued
_0_PUR_ar07_back.indd   14 16/10/2007   18:02:38 15 Pure Wafer plc Annual report and accounts 2007
The Group is listed on AIM and is therefore not required to comply with the provisions of the Combined Code. However, the Board adopts a 
number of principles of the Combined Code that it feels are relevant to a business of the size and complexity of Pure Wafer plc, as set out below.
During the year, the Board comprised a non-executive chairman, three executive directors and a further two non-executive directors who brought 
an independent judgement to the Group. The roles of chairman and chief executive have been split.
All the directors have access to the advice and services of the Company secretary, who is responsible to the Board for ensuring that Board 
procedures are followed and compliance with applicable rules and regulations. If necessary, independent professional advice can be sought 
by all the directors of the Group.
Board responsibilities
The Board of directors, which includes three non-executive directors, meets regularly throughout the year. C G Clarke, E ap Gwilym and P D B Dolan 
are considered by the Board to be independent non-executive directors. The Board is responsible for overall Group strategy, acquisition and 
investment policy, approval of major capital expenditure projects and consideration of signiﬁcant ﬁnancing matters. There is a formal schedule 
of matters speciﬁcally reserved to the Board’s jurisdiction. It reviews the strategic direction of the Group, its annual budgets, the progress 
towards achievement of those budgets, its forecasts and its capital expenditure programmes. In furtherance of their duties, there are agreed 
procedures for the directors to take independent advice, if necessary, at the Group’s expense.
The Board considers the chairman to be the main point of contact to whom concerns of whatever nature may be conveyed. In the event that 
an individual does not wish to raise a concern with him, the Board has identiﬁed E ap Gwilym, the deputy chairman, as an independent member 
of the Board to whom such concerns may be addressed.
Audit committee
The Group has an audit committee comprising two non-executive directors and the chairman. During the year, the committee was chaired 
by J A W Samuel and P D B Dolan, and provides a link between the Board and the Group’s auditors on matters falling within the scope of the 
Group’s audit. These matters include accounting standards and policies, internal ﬁnancial control procedures and the Group’s statutory ﬁnancial 
statements, which are intended for publication. 
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee comprises the two non-executive directors and the chairman and meets at least once a year. During the year 
the committee was chaired by E ap Gwilym. It is the remuneration committee’s role to establish a formal and transparent policy on executive 
remuneration and to set remuneration packages for individual directors.
Treasury committee
The treasury committee comprises the three executive directors and the Group ﬁnancial controller. The committee meets on an as-needed basis 
where speedy approval for treasury matters, particularly relating to foreign exchange, is required. The chairman of the committee, J J Dearing, 
reports any decisions taken, with justiﬁcation, to the Board as quickly as practicable.
Corporate governance report
_0_PUR_ar07_back.indd   15 16/10/2007   18:02:38 16 Pure Wafer plc Annual report and accounts 2007
Board meetings
There were seven Board meetings during the period to 30 June 2007. All Board members attended every meeting that took place whilst they 
were a director. 
Risk management
The Board of directors has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness, whilst the role 
of management is to implement Board policies on risk and control. The system of internal control is designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure of business objectives. In pursuing these objectives, internal controls can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
The key elements of this system are:
 the audit committee;
 a comprehensive budgeting system, with an annual budget approved by the Group Board;
  detailed monthly reporting, including forecasting to the Group Board and comparison of results against budget, with performance monitoring 
and explanations provided for signiﬁcant variances; and
 a deﬁned procedure for seeking and obtaining approval for major transactions.
In order to address risk management, a control framework is in place which aims, as best as practicable, to:
 safeguard Group assets;
 ensure proper accounting records are maintained; and
 provide reliable ﬁnancial information for internal and external use.
Dialogue with shareholders
The Group reports formally to the shareholders twice a year, when its half year and full year results are announced and the interim report 
and annual report are sent to shareholders. The annual report is accompanied by notice of the AGM of the Group, at which a presentation 
is given and directors are available to take questions, both formally during the meeting and informally after the meeting. The management 
is available for dialogue with major shareholders on the Group’s plans and objectives and from time to time meets with them.

Role of the remuneration committee

During the year, the remuneration committee received guidance from, the chief executive ofﬁcer and the Company secretary, except on matters 
relating to their own remuneration, and Odgers, Ray & Berndtson.
Remuneration policy

to provide a competitive market based remuneration structure which rewards Group and individual performance.
Remuneration packages comprise:
 basic salary;
 annual performance related bonus;
 other beneﬁts; and
 participation in share incentive plans.
Basic salary
Salaries are normally reviewed annually and any changes are effective from July in each year. Pay reviews take into account Group 
and individual performance.
Performance related bonuses
Payments under the scheme are based upon the achievement of ﬁnancial targets for the Group as set by the remuneration committee.
Beneﬁts
Beneﬁts in kind include the provision of a car or car allowance, a payment of private fuel, private medical insurance, life assurance 
and permanent health insurance.

Company law requires the directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of 
the Company and the Group and of the proﬁt and loss of the Group for that period. The directors are required to prepare the ﬁnancial statements 
on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business.
The directors conﬁrm that suitable accounting policies have been used and applied consistently. They also conﬁrm that reasonable and prudent 
judgements and estimates have been made in preparing the ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 30 June 2007 and that applicable 
accounting standards have been followed.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the ﬁnancial position of the 
Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for ensuring that the directors’ report and other information included in the annual report is prepared in 
accordance with company law in the United Kingdom. They are also responsible for ensuring that the annual report includes information 
required by the AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Group’s website on which these ﬁnancial statements are published. 
The directors acknowledge that legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of the ﬁnancial information contained in the 
ﬁnancial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. The directors are aware that the uncertainties that exist are compounded 
as information published on the internet is accessible in many countries with different legal requirements relating to the preparation and dissemination 
of ﬁnancial statements.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities
_0_PUR_ar07_back.indd   20 16/10/2007   18:02:39 21 Pure Wafer plc Annual report and accounts 2007
We have audited the Group and parent company ﬁnancial statements (the ‘‘ﬁnancial statements’’) of Pure Wafer plc for the year ended 30 June 2007 
which comprise the Group proﬁt and loss account, the Group and Company balance sheets, the Group cash ﬂow statement and the related 
notes. These ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited, at the request of the 
directors, the information in the report of the remuneration committee that is described as having been audited.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities. 
The directors are also responsible for preparing the report of the remuneration committee.
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We also, at the request of the directors, audit the part of the report of the remuneration committee to be audited. 
This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of 
the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or 
to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view and whether the ﬁnancial statements and the part 
of the report of the remuneration committee to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also 
report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements. The information 
given in the directors’ report includes that speciﬁc information presented in the chairman’s statement and the chief executive’s review that 
is cross referred from the review of business and future developments section of the directors’ report. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the annual report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited ﬁnancial statements. This other 
information comprises only the directors’ report, the unaudited part of the report of the remuneration committee, the chairman’s statement, the 
chief executive’s review, the ﬁnancial review and the corporate governance report. We consider the implications for our report if we become 
aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the ﬁnancial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements and the part 
of the report of the remuneration committee to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgments made 
by the directors in the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group and 
Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide 
us with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the report of the remuneration committee to 
be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the 
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the report of the remuneration committee to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
  the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state 
of the Group and the parent company’s affairs as at 30 June 2007 and of the Group’s proﬁt and cash ﬂows for the year then ended;
  the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the report of the remuneration committee to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 1985; and
 the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements.

1. Principal accounting policies
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with Accounting Standards currently applicable in the United Kingdom and in accordance with 
the provisions of the Companies Act 1985. The principal accounting policies have been applied consistently with the exception of the changes 
arising on the adoption of new Accounting Standard FRS20 (share-based payments), as set out below.
Changes in accounting policy and presentation
During the year, FRS20 (share-based payments), has been adopted. This resulted in the following restatement to the proﬁt and loss account for 
the year ended 30 June 2006:
        Year ended 
        30 June  
        2006 
        £000
Proﬁt before tax, as reported        2,038
Impact of adoption of FRS20        (83)
Proﬁt before tax, restated        1,955
No restatement to the comparative balance sheet or cash ﬂow statement was required.
The charge for the current year was £300,000.
Basis of accounting
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts comprise the consolidation of the accounts of the Group and all its subsidiary undertakings after eliminating intragroup 
transactions. As provided by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, a separate proﬁt and loss account for the Company is not disclosed.
Intangible ﬁxed assets – goodwill
Businesses acquired have been dealt with in the consolidated accounts using acquisition accounting. Upon the acquisition of a business, 
the fair values that reﬂect the condition at the date of acquisition are attributed to the identiﬁable assets and liabilities acquired. Adjustments 
are also made to bring the accounting policies of the businesses acquired into alignment with those of the Group. Where the consideration 
paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, the difference is treated as goodwill.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition made during the year has been capitalised and is being amortised over 20 years on a straight line basis. 
The amortisation period is the length of time over which the directors believe the Group will draw economic beneﬁt from the acquisition.
Tangible ﬁxed assets
The cost of ﬁxed assets is their purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of acquisition.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost, or valuation, of tangible ﬁxed assets, less their estimated residual values, on a straight line 
basis, over the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned. No depreciation is charged until the assets have been commissioned 
and are in use.
The principal rates used are as follows:
Leasehold buildings   15 years
Plant and machinery  10 years
Fixtures, ﬁttings and equipment 5 years
IT equipment   3 years
Motor vehicles   3 years
Equipment acquired as part of the trade and assets of Exsil, Inc during the year have been assessed and an average useful economic life of seven 
years has been applied from the date of acquisition.

1. Principal accounting policies continued
Impairment of ﬁxed assets
Impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the recoverable value of income-generating units. Recoverable value 
is the higher of net realisable value and estimated value in use at the date the impairment loss is recognised. Value in use represents the present 
value of expected future discounted cash ﬂows. If incurred, impairment is recognised in the proﬁt and loss account.
Stocks and work in progress
Stocks and work in progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. In general, cost is determined on a ﬁrst in ﬁrst out basis 
and includes transport and handling costs; in the case of manufactured products, cost includes all direct expenditure and production overheads 
based on the normal level of activity. Net realisable value is the price at which stocks can be sold in the normal course of business after allowing 
for the costs of realisation and, where appropriate, the cost of conversion from their existing state to a ﬁnished condition. Provision is made 
where necessary for obsolete, slow-moving and defective stocks.
Taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions 
or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there 
will be suitable taxable proﬁts against which to recover carried forward tax losses and/or from which the future reversal of underlying timing 
differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected 
to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured 
on a non-discounted basis. 
Government grants
Government grants in respect of capital expenditure are credited to a deferred income account which is released to the proﬁt and loss account 
over the expected lives of the assets concerned. All other grants are credited to the proﬁt and loss account on a receivable basis.
Translation of foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet 
date, except where covered by forward currency transactions when they are translated at the contracted rates. Other assets are translated to 
Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the date of purchase or, where covered by forward currency transactions, at the contract rate. 
The proﬁt and loss accounts and cash ﬂow statements of non-sterling denominated Group companies are translated to Sterling (the Group’s 
presentation currency) at average rates of exchange in each period. Assets and liabilities of those companies are translated at rates of exchange 
ruling at the balance sheet date. The differences between retained proﬁts and losses translated at average and closing rates are taken to 
reserves, as are differences arising on the re-translation to Sterling of non-sterling denominated net assets at the beginning of the year. 
Research and development expenditure
All research and development costs are written off in the year in which they are incurred, with the exception of certain major product development 
projects relating to new products or processes where reasonable certainty exists, as regards technical and commercial viability. Such expenditure is 
capitalised and amortised over the expected product life commencing in the year when sales of the product are made for the ﬁrst time.
Leased assets
Where assets are ﬁnanced by leasing agreements which give substantially the same rights as ownership (“ﬁnance leases”) the assets are treated 
as if they had been purchased outright at the capital value of the assets and the corresponding leasing commitments are shown as obligations 
to the lessor. The capital element of lease payments is applied to reduce the outstanding obligations and the interest is charged to the proﬁt 
and loss account over the period of the lease. Other rentals are charged wholly to the proﬁt and loss account.
Financial instruments
The only derivative instruments utilised by the Group are forward exchange contracts. Forward exchange contracts are used for hedging 
purposes to alter the risk proﬁle of an existing underlying exposure of the Group in line with the Group’s risk management policies.
Turnover
Turnover, which represents the value of goods and services supplied, excluding value added tax, trade discounts and commissions paid, 
is recognised on despatch of goods sold.

1. Principal accounting policies continued
Pension scheme arrangements
The Group makes contributions on behalf of its employees into deﬁned contribution pension arrangements. Contributions are charged 
to the proﬁt and loss account as incurred.
Share-based payment
In accordance with FRS20 (share-based payment), the fair value of equity-settled share-based payments to employees is determined at the date 
of grant and is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period based on the Group’s estimate of shares or options that will eventually 
vest. In the case of options granted, fair value is measured by a Black-Scholes pricing model.

7. Taxation continued
Deferred taxation
Current year proﬁts have been relieved against brought forward tax losses. As the directors are conﬁdent of the trading and ﬁnancial prospects 
of the Group, based upon short-term forecasts, a deferred tax asset has been recognised for part of the unutilised tax losses at 30 June 2007 
to the extent that the asset is regarded as recoverable. The quantum of the deferred tax asset will be reassessed annually.
The Pure Wafer Group, headed by Pure Wafer plc, has approximately £23.9m (2006: £25.1m) of taxation losses. Of this, £6.5m (2006: £5.1m) 
has been utilised to eliminate the requirement for a deferred tax liability, £16.7m (2006: £6.3m) has been recognised as a deferred tax asset 
(tax value of £4.7m) and £0.7m (2006: £13.7m) has not yet been recognised as a deferred tax asset (tax value of £0.2m).

Announcements were made in the March 2007 Budget that the following changes to the corporation tax legislation would be enacted in the 
2007 and 2008 Finance Acts:
1) The reduction of the main rate of corporation tax to 28% from 1 April 2008 onwards (Finance Act 2007);
2) The abolition of balancing adjustments on the sale of industrial buildings from 21 March 2007 onwards (Finance Act 2007); and
3) The phasing out of industrial buildings allowances from 1 April 2008 onwards (Finance Act 2008). 
At the balance sheet date the Finance Act 2007 had been substantially enacted and the numbers reported in the ﬁnancial statements have 
therefore been impacted as follows:
1)  The change in the main rate of corporation tax has resulted in the deferred tax asset recognised at 30 June 2007 being reduced 
by £0.3m; and
2) The abolition of balancing adjustments on the sale of industrial buildings has had no impact on the reported ﬁgures.
The changes to be enacted in the Finance Act 2008 would however reduce the deferred tax asset recognised at 30 June 2007 by £0.1m. 
8. Loss for the ﬁnancial year of the parent company
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the Company’s proﬁt and loss account has not been included in these ﬁnancial 
statements. Of the proﬁt for the year, a loss of £737,000 (2006: loss of £158,000) is dealt with in the entity accounts of Pure Wafer plc.

9. Earnings per share
The basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing proﬁt attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue during the year. 
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential 
ordinary shares.
Earnings per share have been calculated as follows:

18. Financial instruments
Policy
The role that ﬁnancial instruments have had during the period in creating or changing the risks that the Group faces in its activities is 
summarised below. This note also sets out details of the objectives and policies for holding or issuing ﬁnancial instruments and similar contracts. 
Details are also set out of the strategies for achieving these objectives that have been followed during the year.
The numerical disclosures in this note deal with the ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities as deﬁned in Financial Reporting Standard 13: 
Derivatives and other Financial Instruments (“FRS13”). For this purpose, certain ﬁnancial assets such as investments in subsidiary companies 
are excluded from the scope of these disclosures.
As permitted by FRS13, short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the disclosures, other than currency disclosures. 
(a) Objectives, policies and strategies
Introduction
The Group’s ﬁnancial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, some cash and various items such as trade debtors and trade 
creditors, which arise directly from its operations. 
The Group also enters into forward foreign currency transactions, the purpose of which is to manage the currency risks arising from the Group’s operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period, the Group’s policy that no trading in ﬁnancial instruments is undertaken.
The Group has borrowings at ﬁxed rates only. Where a variable rate loan is taken out, an interest rate swap is taken out to ﬁx the rate on the 
date of drawdown. Accordingly, the Group is not subject to interest rate risk on existing borrowings.
The main risks arising from the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments are foreign currency risk and liquidity risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies 
for managing these risks, as summarised below:
Foreign currency risk
Over 95% of the Group’s sales are invoiced in US Dollars. The majority of the Group’s costs are incurred in Sterling. The Group uses forward 
currency contracts and any other similar derivative instruments, based on the forecast exposure for each quarter, to manage the risk.
Liquidity risk
The Group constantly reviews its borrowing requirements to ensure adequate funds are available for ongoing operations. This is achieved 
through the preparation of cash ﬂow forecasts with comparison to actual performance.
Credit risk
The Group has procedures in place to mitigate credit risk, including: credit checks on potential new customers, review of the ﬁnancial position 
of existing customers and a regular review of the ageing of debts.

(b) Summary of ﬁnancial instruments
Short-term debtors and creditors are excluded from the disclosures at (b) to (g), except for the currency proﬁle at (c) below:

Summary of ﬁnancial instruments   
Financial assets   
– cash at bank       2,976  5,652
Financial liabilities   
– obligations under ﬁnance leases      (i) (4,250) (3,088)
– borrowings      (ii) (3,532) —
– deferred consideration      (iii) (1,701) —
(i) Finance leases
The ﬁnance leases are in US Dollars and are repayable over four years, with interest rates ﬁxed on the date of drawdown. The blended interest 
rate achieved on interest bearing ﬁnance leases outstanding on 30 June 2007 is 7.8% per annum (2006: 8.1%).
(ii) Borrowings
The borrowings represent the bank loan drawndown on 12 February 2007 to fund the purchase of the trade and assets of Exsil, Inc. The loan 
is at a variable rate, but an interest rate swap was taken out at the time of drawdown to ﬁx the rate at 6.94%. The borrowings are in US Dollars 
and are repayable over four years. The Group is subject to a number of ﬁnancial covenants as part of the loan agreement for these borrowings. 
The covenants are measured on a quarterly basis.
(iii) Deferred consideration
As part of the consideration payable to acquire the trade and assets of Exsil, Inc, an element was deferred and is payable in two parts. The ﬁrst 
tranche of $1,750,000 falls due on 12 February 2008 and the second tranche of $1,950,000 falls due on 12 February 2009. Neither tranche 
is contingent on any criteria and as such are backed by an irrevocable letter of credit by the Group’s bankers.
(c) Currency proﬁle of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities
During the period, the functional currency of all of the Group’s operations has been Sterling.
The net amount of monetary assets/(liabilities) denominated in currencies other than Sterling as at each balance sheet date covered 
by this report was as follows:
       2007 2006 
       £000 £000
US Dollars       (6,659) 1,611
Euro       (763) (161)

(d) Maturity proﬁle of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities
At 30 June 2007 the Group had bank and cash deposits of £2,976,000 (2006: £5,652,000) available on demand. 
Borrowings were repayable as follows:
       2007 2006 
       £000 £000
In one year or less, or on demand:  
– obligations under ﬁnance leases       (1,384) (655)
– borrowings       (942) —
– deferred consideration       (834) —
In more than one year but not more than two years:  
– obligations under ﬁnance leases       (1,418) (1,391)
– borrowings       (943) —
– deferred consideration       (867) —
In more than two years but not more than ﬁve years:  
– obligations under ﬁnance leases       (1,448) (1,042)
– borrowings       (1,647) —
Total       (9,483) (3,088)
All ﬁnance leases are secured on speciﬁc items of plant and machinery. Borrowings are secured by a ﬁxed and ﬂoating charge across the Group.
The deferred consideration is interest free, and guaranteed by a letter of credit. In accordance with UK GAAP , the value of the deferred 
consideration has been discounted back in order to charge a notional interest rate thereon.
Following the year end, Pure Wafer, Inc has made the ﬁrst drawdown on funding secured at the time of acquisition. This drawdown ($889,000) 
is to fund spending on the development of 300mm capacity at the Pure Wafer US site in Arizona.
(e) Fair value of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities
The fair value of the Group’s cash at bank and in hand and its ﬁnance leases as at 30 June 2007 and 30 June 2006 is considered by the 
directors not to be signiﬁcantly different to the book value.
(f) Hedging 
The Group has, on occasion, entered into forward foreign currency contracts to hedge against the currency exposures that arise on sales 
denominated in foreign currencies. Changes in the fair value of instruments used as hedges are not recognised in the ﬁnancial statements 
until the hedged position matures. 
At 30 June 2007, the fair value of unrealised gains on these ﬁnancial instruments amounted to £39,000 (2006: £10,000) of which £nil 
(2006: gains of £106,000) were carried forward in the balance sheet.
(g) Borrowing facilities
Aside from headroom within the ﬁnance leasing facilities and the letters of credit backing the deferred consideration relating to the acquisition, 
the Group did not have any unutilised borrowing facilities at 30 June 2007.

Form of proxy Pure Wafer is a worldwide leader in the provision of 300mm wafer reclaim services. 
These services enable semiconductor manufacturers to gain efﬁciencies through the 
increased re-use of silicon test wafers within their production processes. 
“

Our history
Pure Wafer was established in 
2000 by a management team widely 
experienced in the semiconductor 
industry with the backing of strategic 
investment from Venture Capital and 
industry partners. 
The Group ﬂoated on AIM in 
December 2004 and in February 
2007 Pure Wafer completed the 
acquisition of a wafer reclaim 
facility in Arizona, US.
The Group is now an industry leading 
provider of wafer reclaim services.
 
Our facilities – UK
The UK business operates from a 
state of the art, purpose built facility 
situated in a new technology park 
in Swansea, Wales and is the most 
advanced plant of its kind in Europe. 
The size of the facility is in excess of 
4,500m
2
 and includes over 2,000m
2
 
of production cleanrooms. 
We have installed the latest generation 
of tools available on the market, 
with the most advanced equipment 
as used by IC and prime silicon 
producers. With the highest technical 
speciﬁcations, we are positioned to 
offer the most effective wafer reclaim 
service to our customers with minimal 
silicon removal. This enables our 
customers to maximise the number 
of times a test wafer can be reclaimed.
Our facilities – US
The facility in Prescott, Arizona 
was constructed in 1997 and 
has received in excess of $40m 
of investment since then. This high 
volume high-tech fab has been 
focussed on provision of 100mm, 
125mm, 150mm and 200mm 
wafer reclaim services, but following 
the acquisition by Pure Wafer in 
February 2007 capability to reclaim 
300mm wafers has been installed.
Wafer reclaim
During the many stages of 
the manufacturing process of 
semiconductors, large quantities 
of test wafers are used to check 
the accurate calibration of 
equipment. These test wafers 
are a key consumable in the 
manufacture of semiconductors 
and the ability to reclaim them 
through Pure Wafer’s advanced 
process provides manufacturers 
with the opportunity to reduce costs.
The semiconductor industry is currently 
seeing a rapid transition to 300mm 
wafers. In order for manufacturers to 
continue to increase functionality at a 
reduced cost, the industry has sought 
to increase the size of wafers on which 
semiconductors are manufactured. 
300mm wafer processing now 
represents the fastest growing area 
of the semiconductor industry.
However, wafer reclaim is a 
highly specialised and technically 
sophisticated process. Only a few 
companies worldwide are able to 
meet the exacting standards required 
by semiconductor manufacturers 
for the reclaim of 300mm wafers, 
of which Pure Wafer is one.
Our process
At Pure Wafer, our process for 
reclaiming test wafers involves 
the following key stages: 
  Inspection of the wafers for 
defects and classiﬁcation by type 
of contaminant to be removed 
  Submersion in a precise mix 
of chemicals appropriate to 
remove the contaminant 
  Assessment of ﬂatness and 
correction of defects using 
Pure Wafer’s advanced 
polishing processes 
 Cleaning and drying 
  Final quality inspection 
and packaging for return 
to the customer
The Company has an established track record, one of the world’s most advanced wafer 
reclaim facilities and a blue chip customer base that includes some of the world’s 
largest semiconductor manufacturers and independent foundries. As a business 
partner, Pure Wafer works with its customers to design and develop a service that 
delivers reclaimed wafers to the exact speciﬁcations and high standards required 
by today’s leading semiconductor manufacturers.

This has been a momentous year for  
 
announced our recommended merger with 
Janus Capital Group – the beginning of the  
next stage on our 80 year journey to deliver  
value to our clients and shareholders. 
“Now is the moment for a step 
change. The cross-border 
merger of equals between 
Henderson and Janus will 
create a compelling new global 
brand of an independent,  
active investment manager.”
Richard Gillingwater
Chairman
Pioneering history


made his fortune through investments in 

America, Spain and East Africa, and was  
one of the early pioneers of global investing. 
Evidence of his pioneering spirit remains 

our US business over 15 years ago, there was 

Through sound strategy, dedication and 
constant client focus, our team in the US  
grew our AUM to £15bn at the end of 2016. 
They have been extraordinarily successful, 

Now is the moment for a step change. Janus 
Capital Group (Janus) had AUM of US$151bn 
in the US at the end of 2016 – eight times the 
size of Henderson in the US. The proposed 
cross-border merger of equals between 
Henderson and Janus will create a compelling 
new global, independent, active investment 
manager, with pro-forma AUM of US$322bn, 
which matches the industry distribution of 
 
our progress in a fast-changing world.
A transformational merger
The Board thought carefully and diligently 
about the merits of a transformational merger 
for Henderson’s clients and shareholders, and 

Henderson Group on the New York and 
Australian stock exchanges, not London.
At our strategy day in October 2015, we 
 
become a truly global asset manager, and 
asked the executive team to devote more  
time and energy to exploring options for  
a transformational solution. We undertook  
a thorough process, looking primarily at  
North American companies, until it became 
apparent that there was an opportunity  
to create a compelling merger of equals 

which your Board unanimously recommends.
Cultural alignment
Corporate actions in people businesses  
stand or fall on people-related issues. 

it is critical to the success of the proposed 
merger that our investment teams buy into  
its value, that integration is handled smoothly, 
that our people are treated fairly and – most 
importantly – that we deliver minimum

The Boards of both companies were of the 
view that the continuing presence of the 
CEOs of both companies is essential to this 
process, so we are delighted that Andrew 
Formica and Dick Weil agreed to work 
together as co-CEOs, should the merger be 
approved by shareholders at an Extraordinary 
General Meeting. The excellent chemistry 
between Andrew and Dick mirrors a strong 

across our two organisations. This creates  
the strongest possible backdrop against 
which to execute a complex transaction. 
The Board and senior management of  
Janus Henderson will have a vital role  
to play in shaping and embedding a healthy 
corporate culture in the new organisation.  
The introduction of the FCA’s Senior Managers 
 
will help us focus on setting the values and 
standards of behaviour expected, and will  

strong links between governance and a 
culture that supports long-term success.
Continuing our journey
With attention focused on our merger 
with Janus, it would be easy to overlook 
Henderson’s resilience as a standalone 
business. This annual report – which we 
expect to be our last as Henderson Group  
plc – comments on the turbulent year we  
have experienced from a political perspective 
in the UK, Europe, and the US, but also seeks  
to celebrate the fundamental strength of our 
business, which has positioned us well for  
the next stage of our journey. We cover the 
proposed merger with Janus in the opening 
sections, then focus in the rest of the  
report on the key events of this year from  
a Henderson perspective.
This has been a volatile year for markets, 
politics and our business. Among the 
highlights from the Board’s perspective are 
our engagement with our clients to navigate 
political turmoil, our work with our regulators 
to enhance our product governance 
disciplines and product control procedures, 
and our continued disciplined approach  
to the deployment of capital. 
 
careful stewardship of our business in 
 
before tax of £212.7m (2015: £220.0m) 
 
lower performance fees, in light of softer 
investment performance. Our assets under 
management reached a record £101.0bn 
thanks to positive markets and FX 
 
of client money in our Retail business.
Against this backdrop, the Board is 
 
of 7.30 pence per share, bringing the total 
dividend for the year to 10.5 pence per share, 
a 2% increase over 2015 in sterling terms. 
Henderson operates a progressive dividend 
policy, an approach we intend to carry forward 
into Janus Henderson. 

Board members for the thought, care and 
diligence with which they have discharged 
their stewardship duties. We have had  
a series of special meetings this year to 
consider the merger, and the engagement  
of the Board has always been high. 
 
at Henderson for the positive way in which 
they have embraced the proposed merger 
with Janus, and the whole executive team  
at Henderson for the huge amount of work 
they have undertaken to create the Janus

Henderson in the coming years, to continue 
to deliver exceptional value to our clients  
and shareholders.

The Henderson culture
Our culture is fundamental to our success  
and drives the outcomes that we achieve  
for our stakeholders, both internally and 
externally. The professional behaviours 
embodied by our employees are shaped  
and underpinned by our guiding principles of 
collaboration, commitment and responsibility, 
and have been instrumental in our ability  
to grow the business on a global scale. 
A key differentiator of Henderson in the 
marketplace is our philosophy of putting  
our clients at the heart of everything we do. 
This, together with our shared commitment to 
respect and collaboration, indicates a cultural 
alignment which we believe will contribute  
to the success of our proposed merger with 
Janus Capital. 
As testament to our people’s belief in our 
culture, our retention rates continue to be 
high. Our annual turnover is 10% and nearly  
a quarter of employees have worked for 
Henderson for 10 years or more, with  

“Our culture is fundamental to 
our success and drives the

Engaging our employees 
For the past three years we have run an 
employee survey through an external provider 
to gain feedback on Henderson, our culture 
and to measure engagement across the 
organisation. This is an important tool as  
 
in our people and offers employees an 
opportunity to voice their opinions. 
The 2016 results were again well above 
industry benchmarks and continue to 
demonstrate high employee engagement. 
There was a slight dip in our engagement 
score, down three percentage points from 
2015 (86% from 89%), however this  
was anticipated in light of the merger 
announcement and the challenging operating 

higher than the industry average. 
Taking into account the results of the ‘pulse 
check’ in 2015, the focus for 2016 was to 
continue to build career and development 
opportunities and to increase collaboration 
between different parts of Henderson.  
We have seen positive improvements in  
both of these areas. 
Our employees’ commitment and 
responsibility to the company remains strong, 


Reward and recognition
Recognising and rewarding the contribution 
of our people is an important lever in 
maintaining employees’ engagement  
and retention. 88% of employees indicated

Employee share ownership continues to be  
a popular component of our reward strategy. 
Employees hold 8.6% of the Group’s issued

is supported and encouraged by global 
communications on our shareplan activities 
and demonstrates our employees’ faith  
and commitment to Henderson products.
We continue to be recognised for our 
innovative and proactive approach to 
 
the following awards in 2016:
 •
employees’ from ProShare
 • 
from World Centre for Employee Ownership.
We also operate a global recognition scheme 
which rewards employees who go the extra 
mile to help achieve Henderson’s strategic 
objectives and provide a role model for our 
guiding principles. The scheme is open to all 
staff throughout the year, with awards made 
on an individual or team basis. 100 employees 
have received an award since its inception  

Building a diverse workforce
Equal opportunities, diversity and inclusion 
are important to Henderson. We know that 
having a diverse and inclusive workplace  
will support our strategic vision of growth  
and globalisation, and aligns with the interests 
of our clients and shareholders. By employing 
individuals with a broad mix of skills, 
perspectives and experiences, we are better 
equipped to be a dynamic, innovative, and

communities we operate in.

gender diversity. 
To achieve these aspirations, we actively 
embed diversity and inclusion into our 
development programmes and require our 
core training providers to evidence their 
diversity and inclusion approach. We have 
also introduced lunchtime seminars covering 
diversity and inclusion-related topics, the  

learned from sport in understanding diversity,

central to the achievement of goals.

Following the success of these initiatives,  
a parents’ network has been launched and 
initial feedback is very encouraging. We also 
successfully piloted a manager masterclass 
in Asia and the US to support managers  
in effectively navigating the challenges  
of working in a global organisation. This will 
be rolled out further during 2017.

European Equities capability? 
Henderson is renowned for having a strong 

in both the team and the product range.  
The team comprises 21 specialists with  
an average of 20 years’ experience. Each 
team member operates in a collaborative 
environment where the sharing of research 
and ideas is encouraged. There is no 
over-arching team view, however, with 
managers able to implement their views 
according to where they believe the best 
potential lies for investors, in line with 
portfolio mandates and regulatory rules. 
Depth in product is demonstrated by the 
range of strategies that the team manages, 
including portfolios with distinct geographic 
exposures or different style biases. This 
spectrum of strategies allows Henderson  
to meet the European equity needs of a wide 

What have been the challenges 
and highlights of 2016? 
For much of 2016 a combination of initially 
weak economic data and an unsettled political 
backdrop cast a shadow over European equity 
markets. Matters were not helped by strong 
momentum in US equities acting as a magnet 
for US stocks and the forthcoming 2017 
European political calendar inviting caution 
among investors. For the most part, the 
region proved unpopular with investors and

range, where the translation effect of weaker 
sterling versus the euro gave a boost to 
returns for UK-based investors in European 
assets. There was also ongoing demand for 
the Henderson Horizon Euroland Fund, which 
 
as investors demonstrated a drift away  
from defensive growth towards more 
value-orientated strategies.
Aggregate relative performance for  
the capability weakened in 2016 as 
outperformance in smaller cap strategies was 
offset by underperformance among the more 
sizeable large cap funds. The percentage of 
assets outperforming their benchmark over 
one year to 31 December was 26%, although 
over the more meaningful three year period 
was a strong 86%.
Were there any changes to  
the team?
We continued to strengthen the team in 2016 
with the promotion of James Ross, who is 
now working alongside Tim Stevenson as 
co-manager of the Henderson Horizon Pan 
European Equity Fund. James has been  
with Henderson since joining the graduate 
scheme in 2007 and continues our long-term 
strategy of developing talent in-house.  
Marc Schartz and Dan Davies also joined the 
team to provide additional analyst support.
What are you most excited about 
seeing develop in 2017?
The shock Brexit result marked the start of  
a rotation away from quality growth and other 
‘safe haven’ areas, towards areas considered 
better value – a process that accelerated with 
Trump’s victory in the US election. Although 
challenging, this rotation means we are 
seeing the return of pricing dispersion, the

What are the key elements of the 
Global Equities capability? 
Our Global Equities capability continues to

Through experience, our expert teams have 
developed their own investment approaches,

In general, how was 2016? 
Overall, global equities rose during 2016  
with some markets, such as the US, reaching 
record highs. Market growth, however, was 
punctuated by periods of volatility, driven  
by changeable economic data and political

deepen their market presence, something that 
will see an even bigger step change through 
the planned merger with Janus Capital Group.

Fixed income markets were supported  
for much of 2016 by investor interest from

 What differentiates the Henderson 
Multi-Asset Team? 
One of the most attractive things about 
managing multi-asset strategies is that we 
have a huge investment opportunity set.  
At Henderson, our multi-asset funds are 
typically run to broad investment mandates, 
allowing us to exploit opportunities in a wide 
range of asset classes and geographies.  
We have great freedom in how we implement 
our ideas, choosing among active, passive 
and smart beta vehicles

portfolios that meet or exceed our clients’ 
expectations for capital growth. Of course, 
some of our mandates have other more 


constraints. Our investment process is 
team-based, which allows us to blend 
together all our different specialist skill-sets 
for every fund we manage. On the team, we 
have expertise in asset allocation, including 
macroeconomics and quantitative analysis 
and in fund selection, covering not only 
traditional asset classes but a wide range  
of alternative asset classes as well. 
What have been the highlights  
and challenges of 2016? 
As we expected, 2016 was a fairly volatile 
year for global investors but ultimately a 
rewarding one. While it was clear from the 
outset that investors were going to have to 
deal with an unusually high level of political 
risk during the year, few anticipated the 
outcomes of the big political events and even 
fewer could have predicted the market impact 
of each. The UK’s referendum decision  
to leave the European Union and Donald 
Trump’s victory in the US presidential election 
were major surprises for pollsters and 
investors alike and were events that caused 

Although the volatility surrounding these 
events was often very challenging, it did also 
present investment opportunities. At times 
like these, our broad instrument remit is 
particularly valuable as we are not obliged  
to invest in any geography or asset if 
conditions are unfavourable. 

aggregate performance for the capability 
compared with 2015 can be attributed  
to a cohort of segregated balanced  
mandates where underperformance of less 
than 0.1% over a three year period dragged 
30% of assets into underperforming territory, 
together with a couple of large funds similarly 
missing the top half of their peer group by

There was also a strong story developing  

Growth fund, which, over one, three and

risk-adjusted returns.
On the product side, our focus during  
2016 has been on managing our existing 
multi-asset range, rather than adding new 
funds. We continued to work with marketing 
to raise client awareness and understanding 
of our Core Solutions range, where the

Fund, a highly differentiated fund that offers 
clients exposure to a wide range of listed 
alternative assets such as commodities, 
hedge funds, private equity and infrastructure. 
What are you most excited about 
seeing develop in 2017 and beyond?
We think it will be a year in which the global 
economy experiences more growth and more 

support from central banks. We believe that 
2016’s upsurge in political turbulence globally 
is more of a regime shift than a blip and 

 
often overlooked in the sort of liquidity-driven, 
trending markets seen in recent years, the 
more challenging conditions that we see for 
2017 should be a great opportunity for active 
managers to prove their worth.

to explain the changes and assist investors 
with any action they needed to take. 
Close behind the conversion was the Brexit

subsequent weeks. The shift in sentiment 
led to substantial withdrawals and, in turn, 
liquidity issues for some of the direct

including our own, taking the decision  
to temporarily suspend daily dealing. 
Explaining the rationale for the suspension 
and then providing regular updates for 
investors on the progress being made to 
allow the fund to reopen was particularly 
important. While it was disappointing  
to have to apply the suspension, it was

designed for a particular client subsequently 
adapted to meet wider demand. 
To support this dialogue, we seek to make  
our fund managers’ thinking readily available 
to clients. This insight is delivered in as timely 
a manner as possible, in a variety of formats 
and at the appropriate level of sophistication 
for our range of clients globally. 
The intention is to provide a level of candour 
and honesty not necessarily expected from 
an asset manager and we encourage our 
managers to ‘call it as they see it’. At times  
this may result in managers explaining that 
they believe the market to be overvalued with 
limited buying opportunities. While at odds 
with the industry’s usual ‘sales messaging’, 
we believe that it is on this kind of honesty 
that strong long-term relationships and an 
open dialogue with clients will be built.

Developments in 2016
Macroeconomic and geopolitical risks 
throughout 2016 have continued to impact 
market prices and investors’ risk appetite. 
These included: 
 • The low interest rate environment, with the 
potential that the rate cycle may be starting 
to turn as the year draws to a close
 • Risks to emerging market economies, 
notably China, and related commodity  
price risks 
 • Continued uncertainty over the impact of the 
tightening of monetary policy in the US. 
Geopolitical risks included: 
 • The UK’s referendum on its EU 
membership, which led to investor hesitation 
in the run up to the vote, a subsequent 
market shock immediately following the 
result and nervousness over the medium 
term impact
 • The US election, which has led to uncertainty 
following the anti-establishment result
 • Sustained positioning of Russia in relation to 

in the Middle East 
 • The increased terrorism threat and instability 

The market impact of the UK’s referendum on 
EU membership was relatively short lived in 
relation to UK large-cap equities, however 
investor risk appetite in relation to European 
assets fell, triggering Retail redemptions.

There has been little structural change to

The risks associated with a merger of this 
scale include: 
 • The broad risk of strategic failure and 
negative economics from the transaction 
 • The risk of organisational stress and stretch 
leading to people, process or system failures 
 • The loss of key individuals or teams. 
The strategic risks have been mitigated  
by a robust programme of due diligence 
carried out by a focused and experienced 
team. Organisational stress is being mitigated 
by separate completion and integration 
programmes, staffed by senior, experienced 
staff and supported by external specialists. 
Where business staff are engaged in 
completion or integration activities,

 STRATEGIC REPORT
Capital position
Henderson’s risk exposure has not materially 
changed in 2016. Through the continued 
delivery on our objectives, the Group’s gross 
capital resources have increased and our 
capital position remains within the Board’s 
risk appetite, with net capital above the 
£216.0m regulatory requirement by  
£69.0m at 31 December 2016. 
Risk management framework
Risk management is a fundamental 
component of our global operating model  
and is deeply integrated in our day-to-day 
processes and controls. Although overall 
accountability for risk management lies  
with the Board, the principle of individual 
accountability and responsibility for risk 
awareness, monitoring and management  
is a key feature of our culture. All staff  
are assessed against their approach to,  
and demonstration of, risk management  
as part of the year end appraisal process. 
Henderson’s approach to risk management  
is documented in our risk appetite statement, 

quantitative statements covering the material 
risks which the Group faces as a result of its 
business model and strategy. The successful 
management of these risks is considered 
essential to the successful delivery of the 
Group’s strategic goals and the risk appetite 
statement provides direction as to the levels 
of risk which the business can take. The 
statement is updated on at least an annual 
basis and incorporates risk limits which,  
if reached, will prompt management to  
take action to reduce risk levels. These are 
supported by a broad range of key risk metrics 
to ensure the Board is able to assess levels  
of risk across the business against the 
mandated appetite.
The risk appetite statement has been 
considerably enhanced during the year  
to provide more depth and transparency for 
the Board, covering the nine Principal Risks 


undertakes an annual review of the material 

 
and appropriate from one year to the next. 
Principal Risks: 
 •
 •Market
 •
 • People
 • Acquisitions and divestments
 • Strategic
 •Fund liquidity
 •Regulatory change
 •
Other Risks: 
 •Foreign exchange
 • Pension obligation
 •Tax
 • Client concentration
 •
 • Credit
 • Corporate liquidity.
Henderson treats reputational risk as a 
consequence of other risks crystallising, 
rather than as a distinct category of primary 
risk in itself. Whilst considered a second order 
risk it is nonetheless critical, as any event that 
results in damage to Henderson’s reputation 
or brand could trigger a consequential loss of 
client trust, on which the business is centred.
The Board and senior management take a 
forward looking view of risk to enable timely 
assessment and, where necessary, mitigation 
of new and emerging risks. The risk 
management process supports this approach 

risks so that they can be evaluated alongside 
known and continuing risks. 
The risk management framework is 
documented in the Group’s risk management 
policy, a summary of which can be found  
on our website (henderson.com/ir).
Three lines of defence
Our framework utilises a ‘three lines of 
defence’ approach to managing risk.

and business management, who are 
responsible for the management of the Group 
on a day-to-day basis in accordance with our 
risk appetite.
The second line comprises the Risk and 
Compliance functions which monitor the 

regulatory risks in the business and the related 
controls in place to manage these risks. The 
Risk and Compliance teams report to the Chief 

management and reports directly to the chair 
of the Board Risk Committee (BRC). The CRO 
attends all Board, Audit Committee and BRC 
meetings and detailed Risk and Compliance 
reporting is provided to these meetings by  
the second line functions. The CRO is also  
a member of the ExCo to ensure that risk 
management remains central to all aspects  
of business strategy and management.

provides independent assurance over the 
operational effectiveness of processes and 

reports directly to the chair of the  
Audit Committee.
Henderson’s Assurance function
The Assurance function comprises both 
second line of defence (Risk and Compliance) 

activities. The primary purpose of the Risk 
and Compliance functions is to assist 
Henderson in achieving its strategic objectives 
by ‘doing the right business in the right way’.
Consequently, Henderson will successfully 
protect all its clients’ interests and its 
reputation as a trusted global asset manager. 
These goals underpin the work of all of 
Assurance, although each of the component 
parts of the function achieves them through 
different blends of educating, providing 
oversight and challenge, advising and 
supporting the business.

This is the risk that negative publicity

is considered more likely to result from  
one of the other risks materialising rather  
than as a standalone risk. 
Reputational risk is, therefore, mitigated 
primarily by the controls in place around  
our principal risks, but is also supported  
by our client-centric culture, which focuses  
on openness, transparency and delivery

Chairman’s 
introduction
“The Board spent a great deal  
of time considering the merger 
with Janus Henderson, which 
continues to be the case.”
Richard Gillingwater
Chairman
Dear Shareholder

on our journey of growth and globalisation 
with the proposed transformational merger  
of equals between Henderson and Janus 
Capital. As you would expect the Board spent 
a great deal of time considering the merger, 
which continues to be the case. Updates  
and presentations were made to the Board 
throughout 2016 and we also constituted  
a committee to oversee the necessary due 
diligence which considered the proposed 

matters, operational matters, people matters 
and legal issues.
The Janus merger was considered against  
a backdrop of Brexit. Brexit dominated the 
headlines over the last year, and it is also  
a matter which received regular attention 
from the Board, with updates being made  
in the earlier part of the year regarding the 
possible outcome of the referendum vote  
and potential risks to the Group and, since  
the referendum, on the effect and possible 
implications of Brexit.
The Directors fully recognise the importance 
of corporate culture. During 2016, the Board 
received an update on the key actions 

conclusions reported to the Board following 
the review of culture carried out by  
 
a self-assessment of the culture of both 
Henderson and Janus Capital has been 
carried out which showed remarkably similar 
results between the two organisations. 
 
a constantly evolving regulatory environment. 
A great deal of time was spent by a dedicated 
committee of the Board to review the work 
the Group is undertaking in enhancing 
various areas of its control environment.  
The work of this committee has since  
been transferred to the Audit Committee.  

We continue to have in place a robust 
governance framework that underpins  
and enables us to deliver on our strategy  

 
of the Audit, Nomination, Remuneration  
and Board Risk Committees. 
This Corporate Governance Statement  
is correct as at 8 February 2017 and has  
been approved by the Board of Directors.

Independence
Although the Chairman,  
Richard Gillingwater, met the 
independence criteria on 
appointment, the UK Code 
provides that the test of 
independence is not appropriate 
thereafter and does not allow the 
Chairman to be counted with the 
independent Non-Executive 
Directors in determining whether 
there is an appropriate balance on 
the Board, which is not the case 
under the ASX Principles. For the 
avoidance of doubt, the Chairman 
considers himself to be both 
objective and independent but for 
good order he is not counted with 
the independent Non-Executive 
Directors. The Board considers  
all the other Non-Executive 

Desai, Kevin Dolan, Tim How, 
Robert Jeens and Angela 
Seymour-Jackson – to be 
independent, as they do not have 
any interest or business or other 
relationship which could, or could 
reasonably be perceived to, 
interfere materially with their ability 
to act in the best interests of the 
Company. We have considered the 
criteria proposed by the UK Code 
and the ASX Principles in assessing 
the independence of the Directors. 
Materiality, as referred to in the 
ASX Principles, has been assessed 
on a case-by-case basis by 
reference to each Director’s 
individual circumstances rather 
than general materiality thresholds. 

independent Non-Executive 
Directors meet a quantitative 
materiality threshold for 
independence, which is that none 
of them has a relationship with  
the Group which generates or 
accounts for more than 5% of  
the Group’s revenue or expenses. 
Accordingly, the Board (excluding 
the Chairman) has a majority of 
Directors who are independent.

Training
To ensure that the Directors continually update 
their skills and knowledge, all Directors receive 
regular presentations on different aspects of 

and regulatory matters affecting our sector. 
For example, during 2016, the Directors 
received presentations regarding the progress 
of investment in teams made during the last 

 

regarding US corporate governance 
requirements compared to both the UK  
and Australian models.
Board evaluation
Evaluation of the Board’s performance
The 2016 Board internal evaluation focused 

external evaluation and 2015 internal 
evaluation, and was conducted internally  

improve upon the previous paper-based 
exercise. As usual for the evaluation, the 
Directors completed a questionnaire 
regarding the effectiveness of the Board and 
its Committees following which the Chairman 
held a formal evaluation meeting with each 

met with the Non-Executive Directors and 
evaluated the Chairman’s performance.
The performance of Andrew Formica,  
Chief Executive, was evaluated by the 
Chairman and the Remuneration Committee.
The evaluation of the ExCo members  
was undertaken by the Chief Executive  
and the Remuneration Committee. These 
performance evaluations were conducted  
in accordance with the processes disclosed 
on our website.
The outcome of the 2016 evaluation process 
was that the Board and its Committees 
continue to operate effectively and the 
progress against the actions arising from  
 
to be monitored and progress mapped. 
An action from the 2015 evaluation, as 
reported in the 2015 corporate governance 
statement, was to ensure that strategy remains 
a focal part of the Board agenda. As set out  
in this report, a great deal of time was spent 
on strategic matters, which culminated in the 
approval of the proposed merger, and this 
continues to be the case. The Board receives 
various updates on strategic matters, such  
as the merger with Janus and Brexit and  
the Chief Executive ensures during agenda 
setting meetings that Board meetings have 
an appropriate strategic focus.
Certain items arising from the 2016 evaluation 
included continuing to review succession 
planning and for further improvements to be 
made to the content and provision of materials 
to the Board.

Dear Shareholder
 
the Board Risk Committee (BRC) for 2016. 
Although the purpose of the BRC is to  
assist the Board in the oversight of risk, it is 
important to note that the Audit, Nomination 
and Remuneration Committees as well as the 
Board also consider certain key risks relating 
to Henderson as appropriate, at which certain 
members of the BRC are also present.
We believe it is important to ensure that  
the right information regarding the principal 
risks facing Henderson is being presented  
to the Committee. Therefore, during 2016  
we conducted a thorough review of the 
Committee’s Terms of Reference and the 
principal risks it considers. As part of this 
process, a detailed assessment of the principal 
risks was undertaken and their relative 
magnitude was considered. We also put in 
place a comprehensive schedule of matters  
to be considered during the year to ensure  
that the Committee considers these risks  
 
of Reference. This schedule is reviewed and 
updated throughout the year. To support this, 
papers are therefore presented during the year

robust process, including the consideration  
of the responses to a survey completed by 
both the Board and the ExCo, together with  

of risk appetite, along with the proposed 
rating attached to each risk, in light of these 
responses. A great deal of time was spent  
by the Committee challenging and reviewing 
these proposals as we believe that the 
language used in the statement should be  
as clear as possible in order to ensure that 
both the language and the tone is understood 
and embedded throughout the organisation 
and linked to our culture.

risks, which included a risk heat map for 
strategic risks. As a result of these reports  
the BRC discusses and assesses whether 
appropriate mitigating actions are in place.  
The risk heat map itself was reviewed and 
updated in 2016 as part of the update to the 
Risk Appetite Statement, using the same 
underlying metrics and focusing on the  
same key risks as the Risk Appetite 
Statement. To ensure clear reporting  
of any risks outside the agreed appetite.  
Risk categories are constantly reviewed  
and either added or removed from the  
heat map depending on the probability  
or severity of the risk facing Henderson. 
The Committee is also responsible for 
agreeing the CRO and Assurance function’s 
objectives, priorities and resourcing and 
reviewing these.

Matters 
considered 
when reviewing 
the Annual 
Report

As part of the review of the Annual Report, 
the Audit Committee also considered various 

and discussed how these may be addressed. 
These included the matters set out below.
Acquisitions and Disposals
During 2016 the Audit Committee considered 
a number of issues relating to acquisitions 
and disposals and the effect of these on the 
report and accounts. 
(i) Recommended merger with Janus 
The recommended merger of equals with 
 
by the Audit Committee as part of the review 
of the 2016 results. The merger agreement 
does not impact the 2016 results, with the 
exception of any deal costs and integration 
costs incurred for the period ended  
31 December 2016, which are recognised  
as a non-recurring item in the Group’s 

(ii) Northern Pines
During 2016 the Group took the decision  
to wind up its joint venture in Northern Pines 
Henderson Capital GP LLC and Northern 
Pines Henderson Capital LLC (together 
‘Northern Pines’). The transaction resulted  
in the Group impairing its £2.7m investment  
in April 2016. This will be presented as  
a non-recurring item in the Consolidated 

(iii) Volantis team 
As referred to in the Strategic Report,  
the Group agreed to the sale of the  

Management with the deal due to complete  
in early 2017. Consideration for the sale 
consists of a deferred share of future fees 
and will be booked as a non-recurring gain  
at completion. Total deferred consideration 
will be re-assessed at each reporting period, 
with any adjustments recognised directly  

item. The above does not impact the Group’s 
2016 results.
Other Matters
The Audit Committee received regular 
updates and reports from management  
which set out a summary of both the above 
and other matters to be discussed or 
considered by the Committee (as for example, 
forward-looking guidance, the disclosure  
of alternative performance measures, topics 
relating to provisions or accruals, tax matters 
or recommendations made as to the 
appropriate accounting treatment or 
disclosure in respect of a certain item).  
The Committee considers these and 
challenges management where appropriate 
on matters of judgement and the resultant 
recommendations.
Recurring areas of focus
A number of areas of focus were also 
considered, which included two areas as  
set out below.
(i) The recognition of management and 
performance fees;
Management and performance fees are an 
area of focus due to the size and importance 
of revenue to the Group’s results. 
(ii) Goodwill and intangible assets 
impairment review

Group is required to carry out an impairment 
review of goodwill at least annually or if an 

carrying value of goodwill as at 31 December 
2016 was £568.7m. The annual goodwill test 
showed no indicators of impairment were 


intangible assets at 31 December 2016  
was £68.8m which mainly relates to the 
acquisitions of Gartmore, Geneva and 
Perennial. There have been no indicators  

continue to be amortised in line with the  
set amortisation periods. 
The Committee, in each case, discussed 
these areas of focus with the auditors at both 
the planning and completion stages of their 
audit. The Committee concluded that the 
judgements made in respect of the above 
matters are reasonable and that appropriate 
disclosures have been included in the 
accounts. A further explanation of the above 
issues and how they were viewed by PwC  
is set out in their report on pages 92 to 97.
Fair, Balanced and Understandable
The Committee fully reviewed the Annual 
Report and recommended to the Board that 
the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, 
 
it was noted that the Financial Review  
on pages 36 to 39 provides an explanation  
of the Group’s results. This is reviewed by 
Management and the Group’s auditors to 


non-GAAP measures in the report and 
accounts but provides a reconciliation in

The reappointment of our external auditors, 
PwC, was approved by shareholders at  
the 2016 AGM. During 2016, the Audit 
Committee considered the risk and

withdrawal of PwC from the market.

both the objectivity and the independence  
of the external auditors. The Charter  
takes into account the FRC Guidance

services to maintain auditor independence.
As part of the review of PwC, the Audit

business activities in accordance with global

presented by the Global Head of Compliance, 
Charles Jones, to the Committee on a broad 
range of regulatory topics affecting our 
current business as well as on the impact  
of future regulation. A summary timetable  
for regulatory change projects over the next

committee was transferred to the Audit 
Committee at the end of 2016. The Committee 
also considered correspondence with key 
regulators such as the FCA and the SEC. 
Review of external auditors
The Audit Committee reviewed and 
approved PwC’s remuneration, engagement

the pre-year end interim audit scope  
was enhanced to help the Group meet  
its reduced reporting timetable for the 
2015 results.
As in 2015 there were learning points  
for both teams, such as the allocation  
of resources and planning by PwC  
and Henderson continuing to improve 
communication between UK and overseas

Management and PwC provide the platform 
to carry out these improvements.

to the outcome of our long-term 
plans which are closely aligned 
to shareholder returns.”
Tim How
Remuneration Committee Chairman
Dear Shareholder

Directors’ remuneration for your approval at 
our Annual General Meeting on 26 April 2017 
in the UK and Australia.
We comply with the UK reporting requirements 
and the ASX Principles relating to Directors’ 
remuneration on a voluntary basis. We last 
submitted our remuneration policy to 

cycle and indicated that, subject to shareholder 
support, it would be our intention for that policy 
to apply for up to three years until the AGM  
in 2018. As of writing, there are no material 
changes to that policy being proposed and we 
therefore are not required and do not propose 
to re-submit the policy for re-approval this year. 
As you will expect, should the proposed 
merger, upon which shareholders will vote 
separately, be approved, it is highly likely that  
a revised remuneration policy will be developed 
to harmonise any differences between the 
remuneration policies and practices of the 

goals and horizons of the combined entity. 
However, it would not be appropriate to 
pre-judge the outcome of the merger vote in 
this document nor to pre-empt remuneration 
policy decisions that will be the responsibility 
of the new Remuneration Committee at the 
appropriate time. 
The following section is therefore dedicated 
to the Directors’ Remuneration Report, which 
provides information on how the policy has 
been implemented during the year, and in 
respect of which we are offering shareholders 
the usual advisory vote at our 2017 AGM.

Global Head of Distribution, was appointed  
to the Henderson Group plc Board with effect

2016 performance and key  
pay outcomes
During 2016 all remuneration decisions  
have been made in line with the remuneration 
policy approved by shareholders at the AGM 
in April 2015.
As per last year’s report, a summary of the  
key performance outcomes and associated 
remuneration decisions is set out in the  
‘At a Glance’ section on pages 70 and 71. 
Clearly 2016 has been a challenging year 
against a backdrop of considerable market 
volatility and political uncertainty, with 
unforeseeable seismic shifts impacting 
investor sentiment and appetites. While  
our short-term investment performance  
has softened, our three year investment 
performance has remained strong, 
demonstrating our ability to deliver exceptional 
long-term performance for our clients.  
Our investment performance has enabled  
 
fees (although materially down on the levels 
reported in 2015), and management fee 
income (our principal revenue stream)  
 
from 2015 and our Australian acquisition, 
boosted by market movements and currency 
translation. Although we have experienced 

pull back from exposure to European assets, 


in our institutional strategies have begun to 
bear fruit. The above, together with disciplined 
cost management, has enabled us to deliver a 


year strategy, as part of which we targeted

Company’s share price following the external

At a glance
The Directors’ remuneration policy was  
approved by shareholders at the AGM in  
April 2015 and will remain in force until  
the 2018 AGM unless material changes  
are proposed in the intervening period. 
For ease of reference, a summary of the 
Company’s key remuneration principles  
and remuneration elements is set out below.  

remuneration policy following the proposed 
merger, these will be communicated to 
shareholders of the new entity separately.
Remuneration principles
Our remuneration policy remains focused on 
pay for performance and in driving shareholder 
returns over the long term, while prudently 
 
and the Board recognise that our remuneration 
policies and practices must enable us to 
attract, motivate and retain exceptional people, 
while aligning their interests with those of 
shareholders. The Committee works closely 
with the Board Risk Committee to ensure  
that performance is not achieved by taking 
unnecessary risks that fall outside the Board’s 
risk appetite.
The key drivers of our remuneration 
philosophy and strategy are to:
 • Attract and retain individuals critical to the 
long-term success of the Company by 
providing total reward opportunities which, 
subject to performance, are competitive 


contribution to business performance and 
sound risk management
 • Maintain an appropriate balance between 

long-term elements of remuneration, to 
minimise the probability of excessive risk 
taking and to align with the Company’s 
strategic objectives and time horizons
 • Reinforce a strong performance culture 
through rewards which are differentiated 
based on Company, division, team and 
individual performance 
 • Align management interests with those  
of the Company’s shareholders and clients 
through building appropriate share and fund 
ownership over time 
 • Ensure that reward related processes  
are compliant with industry regulations, 
legislation and market best practice and 
have effective risk management controls.
Our remuneration 
principles are 
reinforced by 
achieving an 
appropriate 
balance of  
the following 
remuneration 
elements:
Base pay

employees with the personal attributes, 
skills and experience required to deliver  
our strategy.

Provision of competitive, cost and tax 

promotion of employee wellbeing, to  
attract and retain employees with the 
personal attributes, skills and experience 
required to deliver our strategy.
Pension
Provision of market competitive pension 
arrangements, in a way that does not 

risk or cost to the Group, to assist with 
employee recruitment and retention,  
and to assist employees in building wealth 
for their retirement years.
Short-Term 
Incentive plan 
(STI)
Reward performance on an annual basis, 

performance and individual strategic and 
personal contribution, thereby aligning 
employee interests with the annual 
business plan and to the interests of 
shareholders. A material proportion of the 

requirements in addition to aligning the 
interests of the employee with those of the 
shareholders and clients via mutual linkage 
to the Group share price and investment 
performance of selected Henderson funds.
Long-Term 
Incentive plan 
(LTI)
Supports superior business performance 
over the longer term and aligns Executive 
Directors’ and shareholders’ interests via 
the linkage to TSR and to other long-term 
performance measures which are aligned 
to the achievement of the Company’s 
long-term strategy. Henderson Group plc Annual Report 2016

How the policy will be applied in 2017
This section is prepared on the assumption that the current shareholder approved remuneration policy will continue in its existing form for 2017. 
However dependent on the outcome of the shareholder vote on the merger and any subsequent remuneration decisions made by any new 
Remuneration Committee the details outlined below may be subject to change.
Base salary
The Committee has generally taken a restrained approach to base salary increases, and only made changes where it feels there is a material 
misalignment with the market, and in the context of good performance. The average percentage increase to base salaries across the Group 

position on base salaries had fallen over the past two to three years to a position towards the bottom of the range (95-105% of market median) 
which is stated as part of the Remuneration Policy. 

respectively, to maintain the current competitive position against the peer group in line with general market expectations. This increase is 
marginally below the average increase across the general workforce. The salary of the Global Head of Distribution was increased to £375,000

The Committee was encouraged by the further increase in the positive voting for the remuneration report relative to that in 2015. The Committee 
has analysed the reasons for the negative voting above and believe that, similar to the vote in 2015, it arises in relation to two key factors, mainly 
in relation to its Australian shareholder base, these being:
 • Material differences in market pay levels for the chief executives within the European asset management sector (against whom our

The Company is subject to the high standards

and the Corporate Governance Principles  
and Recommendations issued by the ASX 
Corporate Governance Council in March 

ASX Principles can be found on the websites 
of their respective organisations at  
www.frc.org. uk and www.asx.com.au.  
The Company’s corporate governance 
policies can be found on our website.
Throughout the year, the Company applied 
the main principles of the UK Code and the 
ASX Principles and Recommendations.  
The Company has complied with all the 
provisions of the UK Code and the ASX 
Recommendations as set out in the Corporate 
Governance Statement except in regard to the 
setting and disclosure of gender diversity 
targets in the diversity policy as set out in ASX 
Recommendation 1.5 (although Henderson

E.1.1 of the UK Code. The reasons for 
non-compliance are set out on pages 58

applied the ‘main principles’ set out in the UK 
Code and complied with the ASX Principles.

Recurring areas of focus
There are two areas of focus which we expect to recur each year 

statements and are an integral part of the business.
Recognition of management fees and performance fees
Recurring area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Management and performance fees are an area of focus due  
to the size and importance of revenue to the Group’s results.  
The existence of multiple fee arrangements on different terms 
creates a further risk that fees may be incorrectly calculated  
and/or recognised in the wrong period.
Fees are calculated as a percentage of AUM, net of any rebates. 
The fee rates vary across different funds and products and, for 
performance fees, are only earned once investment performance 
exceeds a certain level. 
Performance fees are inherently more complex as judgement can 
be required to determine whether performance criteria have been 
met, particularly when the performance period runs over more than 

The correct recognition of management and performance fees  
is dependent on:
a)   The fee rate and calculation methodology set out in the terms 
of the underlying contracts between the Group and its clients 
and/or the funds;
b)    The valuation, existence and completeness of the AUM  
of the funds or the client portfolio;
c)    The mathematical accuracy of the fee calculation; and
d)    The posting of the fees to the general ledger, including 
recognition of the fees in the correct period.
We focused our testing on the following areas:
a) Basis of calculation
We agreed a sample of fee rates and calculation methodologies  
to contracts and did not identify any differences.
b) Accuracy and completeness of AUM
We understood and evaluated the systems, processes and controls in 
place in respect of the valuation and existence of AUM and tested the 
relevant controls on which we sought to place reliance. This included 

independent third party controls reports where functions are 
outsourced to Third Party Administrators (‘TPAs’) or Transfer Agents 

were appropriate for our purposes. Where the reports did not cover the 


 
The results showed that the relevant controls were operating effectively.
c) Fee calculations
We used a combination of data auditing and manual sampling  
to independently recalculate management fees, rebates and 
performance fees. We obtained AUM data from source systems at 
Henderson and/or the TPAs and TAs in our calculations. We did not 
identify any differences as a result of this testing.
d) Posting of fees
We reconciled the fees we recalculated against the general ledger 
postings and investigated differences, where applicable. For a sample 
of fees recognised either side of the year-end we tested that they had 
been recognised in the correct period, paying particular attention to 
performance fees. Based on our work, the fees have been correctly 
calculated and recognised.
We also tested a sample of bank reconciliations and performed tests 
over journals impacting revenue which appeared to be unusual. We did 
not identify any exceptions as a result of this testing.

substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making enquiries and considering the Directors’ process supporting their 
statements; checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code; and considering 
whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing our audit. We have nothing to report

involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about 



free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: 
 • whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s and the 
Company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed;
 •
accounting estimates made by the Directors; 
and
 •
statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas  
by assessing the Directors’ judgements 
against available evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures  

We test and examine information, using 
sampling and other auditing techniques, to 
the extent we consider necessary to provide  
a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. 
We obtain audit evidence through testing  
the effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both.

The results of consolidated entities acquired 
or disposed of during the year are included in 

effective date of acquisition, being the date 
on which the Group obtains control, and 
continue to be consolidated until the date that 
the control ceases. Control is achieved when 
the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable 
returns from its involvement with an entity and 
has the ability to affect those returns through 
its power over the entity.

The column ‘Acquisition related and

 • Acquisition related items: the amortisation  
of intangible assets, fair value changes and 

consideration on business combinations,

as part of a business combination and void 

 • Non-recurring items: deemed to be  
one-off and material, when considering  
both size and nature.
These items are disclosed separately to give  
a clearer presentation of the Group’s results 
and are analysed further in note 7.
Income recognition
Fee income includes management fees  
and performance fees, net of rebates. 
Management fees are recognised in the 
accounting period in which the associated 
investment management service is provided. 
Performance fees are recognised when the 
prescribed performance hurdles are achieved 
and it is probable that a fee will crystallise  
as a result. 
Commissions
Commissions on management fees are 
accounted for on an accruals basis and are 
recognised in the accounting period in which 
the associated management fee is earned.
Operating expenses

Share-based payment transactions
The Group issues share-based awards to 

equity-settled share-based payments. 
Equity-settled share-based payments are 
measured at the fair value of the shares  
at the grant date. The awards are expensed, 
with a corresponding increase in reserves,  
on either a straight-line basis or a graded basis 
(depending on vesting conditions) over the 
vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate 
of shares that will eventually vest. Based on 
the Group’s estimate, the determination of fair 
value, using a Black-Scholes or Monte Carlo 
model at the date of grant is adjusted for the 
effects of market performance and 
behavioural considerations.
Income taxes
The Group provides for current tax expense 
according to the tax laws in each jurisdiction 
in which it operates, using tax rates that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by  
the reporting date.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary 
differences at the reporting date between  
the tax bases of assets and liabilities and  

purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are generally 
recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences. Deferred tax assets are 
recognised only to the extent that it is 

against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Deferred tax 
liabilities are not recognised on goodwill but 

intangible assets, where appropriate. The 
carrying amount of deferred tax assets is 
reviewed at each reporting date and reduced 
to the extent that it is no longer probable that 

allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised for 
taxable differences arising on investments in 
consolidated entities, branches, associates 
and joint ventures where the Group controls 
the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
differences and where the reversal of the 
temporary differences is not anticipated  
in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates  
that are expected to apply in the period when 
the liability is settled or the asset is realised, 
based on tax rates and tax laws that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by  
the reporting date.

Business combinations
All business combinations are accounted for 
using the acquisition method. The cost of a 
business combination is the aggregate of the 
fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets 
given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity 
instruments issued by the acquirer. The fair 
value of a business combination is calculated 
at the acquisition date by recognising the 
 
and contingent liabilities that satisfy the 
recognition criteria, at their fair values at that 
date. The acquisition date is the date on which 
the acquirer effectively obtains control of the 
acquiree. The cost of a business combination

Contingent consideration, resulting from 
business combinations, is recognised at fair 
value at the acquisition date as part of the 
business combination, and discounted where 
the time value of money is material. The 
determination of the fair value is based  

assumptions being the probability of meeting 
each performance target and the discount

Goodwill
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised 
in the Consolidated Statement of Financial 
Position. Goodwill on acquisitions prior to  
 

impairments. 
Goodwill arising on investments in associates 
and joint ventures is included within the 
carrying value of the equity accounted 
investments.
Where goodwill forms part of an entity  
or sub-group and the entity or sub-group  
or part thereof is disposed of, the goodwill 
associated with the entity or sub-group 
disposed of is included in the carrying amount 
of the operation when determining the gain  
or loss on disposal. 
Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or 
more frequently if changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying value may be 
impaired. For this purpose, management 
prepares a valuation for the Group’s cash 
generating unit based on its value in use.  
The value in use is based on forecasts 
approved by the Board, extrapolated for 
expected future growth rates and discounted 
at a risk-adjusted discount rate based on the 
Group’s pre-tax weighted average cost of 
capital. Where the value in use is less than the 
carrying amount, an impairment is recognised. 
Any impairment is recognised immediately 

and cannot subsequently be reversed. 
Investment management contracts
 

intangible asset arising on the acquisition of 
subsidiaries. Such contracts are recognised 
at the present value of the expected future 

contracts at the date of acquisition. The 
intangible asset is then amortised on a 
straight-line basis over the expected life  
of the contracts, currently estimated at  
between three and eight years.
Computer software
The costs of purchasing and developing 
computer software are capitalised where  

 
to the Group and the cost of the assets can  
be measured reliably. Computer software  
is subsequently measured at cost less 
accumulated amortisation. Computer 
software is amortised on a straight-line  
basis over a period of three to seven years. 
Investments in subsidiaries

undertakings are held at cost less any 
impairment in value where circumstances 
indicate that the carrying value may not  
be recoverable.
Equity accounted investments
The Group’s investment in associates,  
where the Group has the ability to exercise 

where there is joint control, are accounted  
for using the equity method of accounting. 

where purchased for cash, or at the fair value 
of shares received where acquired as part  
of a wider transaction. The investments are 
subsequently carried at cost adjusted for the 

changes in comprehensive income of the 
associate or joint venture, less any dividends 
or distributions received by the Group. The 
 

for the year, or period of ownership, if shorter.
Impairment of assets (excluding goodwill 

At each reporting date, the Group assesses 
whether there is any indication that an asset 
may be impaired. Where an indicator of 
impairment exists, the Group makes an 
estimate of the recoverable amount, being the 
higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell, 


to their net present value using a risk-adjusted 
discount rate based on the Group’s post-tax 
weighted average cost of capital.
Where the carrying amount of an asset 
exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is 
considered to be impaired and is written down 
to its recoverable amount. An impairment  
loss is recognised in the Consolidated  

Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised 
at fair value in the Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position when the Group becomes 
party to the contractual provisions of an 
instrument. The fair value recognised is 
adjusted for transaction costs, except for 


immediately recognised in the Consolidated 

derecognised when the rights to receive  

or where they have been transferred and the 
Group has also transferred substantially all 
the risks and rewards of ownership. Financial 
liabilities cease to be recognised when  
the obligation under the liability has been 
discharged or cancelled or has expired.
Financial assets
 
are recognised at the trade date, being the 
date when the purchase or sale becomes 
contractually due for settlement. Delivery and 
settlement terms are usually determined by 
established practices in the market concerned.
Debt securities, equity securities and holdings 
in authorised collective investment schemes 
are designated as either fair value through

Trade and other receivables and cash
Trade receivables, which generally have  
30 day payment terms, are initially recognised 
at fair value, normally equivalent to the invoice 
amount. When the time value of money is 
material, the fair value is discounted. Provision 

there is evidence that the Group may not be 
able to recover balances in full. Balances  
are written off when the receivable amount  
is deemed irrecoverable.
Cash amounts represent cash in hand and 
on-demand deposits. Cash equivalents are 
short-term highly liquid government securities 
or investments in money market instruments 
with a maturity date of three months or less.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities, excluding deferred 
consideration, provisions, derivatives, fund 
deferral liabilities and non-controlling 
interests in consolidated funds, are stated  
at amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate method. Amortised cost is calculated by 
taking into account any issue costs and any 
discount or premium on settlement.
Provisions
Provisions which are liabilities of uncertain 
timing or amount, are recognised when:  
the Group has a present obligation, legal  
or constructive, as a result of a past event,  


to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate 

the time value of money is material, provisions 
are determined by discounting the expected 


time value of money and, where appropriate, 

discounting, the increase in the provision  
due to the passage of time is recognised  

Non-controlling interests in

controlling interest is present, the non-
controlling interest is presented as a liability 
where there is an obligation on the fund to 
repurchase units at the investor’s request and

the fair value is negative. 
At the inception of a hedge, the Group formally 
designates and documents the hedge 
relationship to which the Group wishes  
to apply hedge accounting and the risk 
management objective and strategy for 
undertaking the hedge. Such hedges are 
expected to be effective in achieving 
offsetting changes in fair value and are 
assessed on an ongoing basis to determine 
that they have been effective throughout  
the reporting periods for which they were 
designated and are expected to remain 
effective over the remaining hedge period.
Forward foreign currency contracts that  
are used to hedge the currency nominal value 

 
The change in the fair value of a hedging 
instrument is recognised in the Consolidated 

value of the hedged item, attributable to the 
risk being hedged, is also recognised in the 

the fair value changes arising on the 
designated hedge instrument.
Fair value estimation
Fair value is the price that would be received 
to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability  
in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date.  

in active markets (such as publicly traded 
securities and derivatives) is based on quoted 
market prices at the reporting date. The 

instruments is the last traded market price for 

where the last traded price falls within the bid-

traded price is not within the bid-ask spread, 
management will determine the point within 
the bid-ask spread that is most representative 
of fair value current bid price. The fair value of 

active market is determined using valuation 
techniques commonly used by market 
participants, including the use of comparable 
recent arm’s length transactions, discounted 

Equity shares
The Company’s ordinary equity shares of  

instruments. Equity shares issued by the 
Company are recorded at the fair value of  
the proceeds received or the market price  
on the day of issue. Direct issue costs, net of 
tax, are deducted from equity through share 
premium. When share capital is repurchased, 
the amount of consideration paid, including 
directly attributable costs, is recognised  
as a change in equity.
Purchase of own shares 
Own shares held
Own shares held are equity shares of the 
Company acquired by or issued to employee 

at cost and are deducted from equity. No gain 
or loss is recognised in the Consolidated 

sale or cancellation of the Company’s own 
equity shares. 
Share buyback programmes
Shares purchased as part of a share buyback 
programme are immediately cancelled. The 
nominal value of each share purchased and 
cancelled is debited against share capital and 
the remaining balance, being the difference 
between the price paid per share and the 

and loss reserve.
Dividend recognition
Dividend distributions to the Company’s 
shareholders are recognised in the 
accounting period in which the dividends  

when these are approved by the Company’s 
shareholders at the AGM. Dividend 
distributions are recognised in equity. Henderson Group plc Annual Report 2016

judgements, estimates and 
assumptions

accounting policies, management has  

estimations and assumptions which are 
summarised below:
Acquisition accounting 
Acquisitions may require certain judgements 
and estimates to be made around the  
future performance of the business when 
accounting for any contingent deferred 

at the recognised liability, management apply 
estimates, which may include market growth 
rates, expectations about the growth 
potential of the business post acquisition and 

and other assumptions supported by 
management’s industry knowledge. 
Impairment of intangible assets
Goodwill and investment management 
contracts are reviewed for impairment annually 
or more frequently if there are indicators that 
the carrying value may be impaired.
The judgement exercised by management  
in arriving at these valuations includes the 

assumptions, expected margins and costs. 
Further details on these assumptions are 
given in note 13.
Share-based payment transactions
The Group measures the cost of equity-settled 
share schemes at fair value at the date of 
grant and expenses them over the vesting 
period based on the Group’s estimate of 
shares that will eventually vest.
Consolidation of funds
From time to time, the Group invests seed 
capital on the launch of products, such as 

equity funds and other investment vehicles. 
The seed capital investments vary in duration 
depending on the nature of the investment. 
The Group reviews the size and nature of 
these investments to consider its level of 

to warrant accounting for them using the 
equity method, consolidating them into the 

them as investments carried at fair value. 
Where the Group does not control the fund  
it holds seed capital investments in, the  


capital investments are intended to help 
establish a fund track record and provide 

external client capital, it is more appropriate 
for the Group’s interest to be shown as either

investment funds are structured entities

10.1 Share-based compensation plans
The Group operates a number of share-based compensation plans, being the Restricted Share Plan, Employee Share Ownership Plan, 

and Sharesave Scheme. Further details of the material plans in operation during 2016 are set out below:
Deferred Equity Plan (DEP)
Employees who receive cash-based incentive awards over a preset threshold, have an element deferred. The deferred awards are deferred into 
the Company’s shares, or into Group managed funds. The DEP trustee purchases Company shares and units or shares in Group managed funds 
and holds them in trust. Awards are deferred for up to three years and vest in three equal tranches. Those employees who elected to participate 
in the 201 1 ESOP, had their restricted shares, upon vesting, automatically transferred into the 201 1 ESOP as purchased shares. They attracted 
matching shares subject to the performance and employment conditions of that plan. 
The 2013 DEP had a matching share element where employees, excluding Executive Directors, were awarded one matching share for every three 
restricted shares held in trust on the third anniversary of the award. One third of the restricted shares became unrestricted on each anniversary.  

Forfeiture conditions applied in the case of leavers. A matching share element is not included on any DEP schemes awarded for later years.


Restricted Share Plan (RSP)
The RSP allows employees to receive shares in the Company for £nil consideration at a future point, usually after three years. The awards  
are made typically for staff recruitment and retention purposes and larger awards generally have performance hurdles. The Remuneration 
Committee approves awards to Code Staff, any awards over £500,000 and award vestings that exceed £50,000. On vesting, the employee 
must satisfy any employee tax and social security obligations. Henderson Group plc Annual Report 2016

The terminal value has been calculated assuming a long-term growth rate of 2.0% per annum in perpetuity, based on the Group’s view  
of long-term nominal growth, which does not exceed market expectations.
A pre-tax risk-adjusted discount rate of 1 1.8% per annum has been applied. The resultant value in use calculation has been compared with

are consolidated and are for the purpose of administering the Group’s share-based payment arrangements. Further details of the Group’s 
share-based payment arrangements are set out in note 10. The Group holds interests in funds via seed capital investments and investment 
management agreements, for which it earns management fees and, in certain funds, performance fees. Segregated mandates and investment 
trusts do not give the Group any rights over the client or trust who have the right to remove the Group as manager, being a right similar to a voting 
right. As such, segregated mandates and investment trusts are not structured entities. Management has determined that the Group acts as 
agent for unconsolidated funds due to its relatively low economic exposure and variability of returns. 
The Group is exposed to structured entities via the risk that their AUM decreases which will cause a fall in the Group’s income. Considering the 
potential for changes in the AUM of structured entities, management has determined that the Group’s structured entities should be aggregated

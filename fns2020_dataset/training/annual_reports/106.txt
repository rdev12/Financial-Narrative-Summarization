Chairman’s Statement 
On behalf of the Board of 888 Holdings plc, I am pleased to present 
the financial results for the year ended 31 December 2009.
These results again demonstrate the resilience of our brand, the 
breadth and depth of our product offering and our increasing 
geographic reach, in what was a challenging year for all consumer 
facing businesses. 
Financial Results and Dividend
Total Operating Income (‘TOI’) decreased 6% to US$247 million 
(2008: US$263 million) impacted by difficult trading conditions 
and unfavourable exchange rates. EBITDA* was US$46 million 
(2008: US$56 million). Our financial position remains strong as 
ever due to the continued cash generative nature of the Business. 
Our cash position as at 31 December 2009 was US$87.5 million 
(31 December 2008: US$98.4 million). The Board is therefore 
recommending a final dividend of 3.0 cents per share in addition to 
our interim dividend of 1.0 cent per share and special dividend of 2.6 
cents per share, both paid in October 2009.
We are in a strong position to take advantage of the ongoing 
industry consolidation and will participate in M&A opportunities as 
and when they become available.
B2C
888 is more than just a place that offers a first class online gaming 
experience to its players. It is fast becoming an entertainment 
destination, a place where people can enjoy a truly interactive 
experience and be part of an online community that shares common 
interests. 
We continue to innovate across the range of our offering providing 
players with a dynamic gaming experience. Cutting edge products 
such as Live Dealer targeted at European customers are growing 
in importance, and a constantly updated suite of instant games 
integrated across the portfolio helps to keep customers coming back 
to the site with increasing spend. Localisation remains a core focus 
for 888 as we deliver regionally targeted and appealing content in an 
increasing number of languages.
* Before share benefit charges of US$7 million (2008: US$8 million).
During the year we also made a significant change to the 888 brand 
architecture as well as our continuous drive to provide the best offering 
and customer service possible. The look and feel of our umbrella brand 
has been updated and we have refocused our sub-brands to reflect 
the four core gaming products — 888casino, 888poker, 888sport and 
888bingo. The new sites were launched in early 2010 and have proved 
popular with both existing and new players.
The acquisition of the Wink Online Bingo business added to our 
tremendously successful emerging offering, and the relaunch of Reef 
Club Casino introduced a product ideal for the recession, helping 
888’s casino segment to retain a market leading position.
Dragonfish
Early in the year we rebranded and relaunched the B2B business 
as Dragonfish, crystallizing its position as a stand-alone, but 
complementary, part of the Group. The Dragonfish brand is highly 
visible and has achieved significant cut-through in the competitive B2B 
market. A number of new agreements were signed during the year. 
Significantly, in September we signed a landmark deal with Harrah’s  
International Entertainment, to provide services to its non-US facing 
customers, marking the first ever B2B deal with a major US Casino 
operator.
The signing of a partnership with Linden Lab
®
 for payment service 
provision extends our reach outside the online gaming market for the 
first time.

Responsible Gaming and CSR
Responsibility has always been a cornerstone of our business. The 
importance of responsible gaming and corporate responsibility was 
illustrated through the publication of our first stand-alone Corporate 
Responsibility report, which is available on our dedicated website 
www.888responsible.com. 
The Group was saddened by the untimely passing of one of its 
founders, Dr Aharon Shaked late last year. Aharon continued to 
contribute his wisdom and advice to 888 throughout his illness and 
our thoughts and prayers are with his family.
In December, Shay Ben-Yitzhak, one of the founders of the 
business, decided to step down from the Board to devote more 
time to his family. On behalf of the Board and all staff, I would like 
to express our appreciation of Shay’s contribution in growing the 
Company from its infancy and his continuing contribution to date. We 
wish him all the best for the future.
I would also like to add my thanks to all our employees who have 
worked hard to drive the performance of the business in a challenging 
operating environment.
Outlook
2009 was a testing year but we have continued to drive growth 
in both our B2C and B2B businesses, organically and through 
acquisition.
As the economy moves on from the global financial crisis the wider 
online gaming industry can look to the future with confidence. The 
strength and diversity of our offering leaves us well positioned to 
continue to create sustainable value for our shareholders.
The Board remains confident about the prospects for the business.

Chief Executive Officer’s Review 
Introduction
While the economic backdrop remained hostile and continued to 
impact performance both in terms of trading and fluctuating exchange 
rates, 2009 was the year that validated the strength of the Group’s 
combined business model: a world class B2C operator and an 
innovative and comprehensive B2B service provider.
During the first nine months of the year, our B2C business remained 
under pressure from the challenging economic environment. The 
fourth quarter of 2009 saw a welcome return to more normalised 
trading, with much stronger performance. Our stand-alone B2B 
business which was branded Dragonfish in March 2009, continued 
to show good growth with a number of new strategic deals signed, 
including an agreement with Linden Lab, operator of Second Life for 
payment processing and an agreement with bwin Italia for casino 
tailored for the newly regulated Italian market. 
Throughout the period we maintained investment and innovation 
in both divisions, using our working capital wisely and, as you will 
see from the look and feel of this annual report, creating a new 
corporate identity and refreshed sub-brands for our B2C offering, 
now launched to our customers. 
From a financial perspective, in spite of the difficult environment, we 
have delivered a solid performance. Total Operating Income was 
US$247 million (2008: US$263 million) with 33% increase in TOI in 
B2B. EBITDA* was US$46 million (2008: US$56 million). The business 
remains highly cash generative and as at 31 December 2009 our cash 
position was US$87.5 million (31 December 2008: US$98.4 million). 
* Before share benefit charges of US$7 million (2008: US$8 million).
Business Overview
Our strategy is underpinned by a number of core objectives:
l  Maintain and improve our position as a leading B2C operator
l  Become a leading B2B provider with a focus on new entrants 
and major opportunities
l  Make strategic B2C and B2B acquisitions to enhance our 
market position
l  Position ourselves to benefit from market trends and regulatory 
changes
l  Remain the most responsible company in the sector
These are the building blocks of our business and we are committed 
to delivering a strong performance in each of these areas.
B2C
Whilst the market for our B2C business remained challenging we 
retained our focus on innovation to ensure our offering remains at the 
forefront of the gaming experience. This included: exciting visuals, 
increased interactivity, more community focus and a new customer 
loyalty programme. We also introduced a number of ‘recession 
busting’ promotions and products, giving our customers the 
opportunity to be entertained whilst being sensitive to their spending 
capacity, thus increasing their ‘entertainment value for money’.
Following the success of 888ladies, our UK-focused Bingo 
offering, we introduced new social networking features which 
make the playing environment more social, such as enhanced chat 
experiences and daily blogs.
Under the leadership of the B2C Managing Director the business 
has taken on a new focus, leveraging new products and marketing 
campaigns to deliver further growth. 
A new Bingo TV campaign was launched in the UK to stimulate 
Bingo growth. The innovative ‘Poker Ashes’ tournament was 
launched and televised featuring celebrities such as Shane Warne 
and Darren Gough. In support of this, a large-scale poker league 
was launched in hundreds of pubs. 
17555888COM.indd   04 17555888COM.indd   04 30/03/2010   12:33 30/03/2010   12:33 www.888holdingsplc.com 
 
05
17555 30/03/2010 Proof 11
A live casino product targeted at European customers was launched 
during the first half of 2009 and includes Roulette, Blackjack 
and Baccarat. Following extensive customer consultation, a new 
Poker version was rolled out incorporating 25 features and design 
changes and we also introduced a new ‘best of breed’ poker loyalty 
programme.
888sport, while still a nascent business unit for us, continued to 
gather momentum during the year. We introduced a new in-play 
betting application as well as an innovative video stream feature 
promoting our most popular events, all assisting in driving additional 
growth to the domain. 
In December we acquired the Wink Online Bingo business. The 
transaction marked a further expansion of our emerging offering 
segment and is invaluable in helping to support our domination of the 
online bingo industry. Wink Bingo runs several online bingo networks 
including WinkBingo, PoshBingo and BingoFabulous. The network is 
operated on the Dragonfish bingo infrastructure and had over 60,000 
active players at the time of acquisition, making it one of the most 
popular sites for online bingo in the UK.
In the third quarter of 2009 we began a restructuring and rebranding of 
our consumer offering. Following a comprehensive branding study, it 
became clear that we needed differentiated sub-brands for each product. 
We carefully researched how we could launch a new streamlined, 
distinctive and digital modern look without alienating our players and with 
the potential to attract thousands of new ones. The decision was taken 
to build on the strength of the 888 brand and enhance its visual display, 
while also promoting four key B2C sub-brands with a reinvigorated look 
and feel — 888casino, 888poker, 888bingo, and 888sport.
Dragonfish
In March we reached an important landmark in the transformation of 
our B2B business, launching it under its own brand — ‘Dragonfish’. 
This stand-alone brand is indicative of 888’s intention to become a 
major player in the B2B market, highlighting Dragonfish’s status as an 
independent business unit within the 888 Group and emphasising its 
difference from our traditional B2C offering.
‘Total Gaming Services’ is the strap line that underpins Dragonfish’s 
unique positioning. Our clients are given the opportunity to benefit 
from the advantage of our comprehensive end-to-end service, global 
reach, resources and contacts, and specific experience across local 
markets. This comprehensive offering, unique to Dragonfish, is built 
on our extensive experience as an operator and, as such, is a major 
differentiator from other B2B providers. 
Dragonfish has its own Managing Director who is responsible for all 
B2B activities. These include business development, Programme 
management & integrations, Client executives Unit, Client marketing & 
operations, B2B marketing and PR and B2B Finance. This structure 
as a stand-alone unit ensures that the confidential separation between 
the two activities is retained. 
A number of deals were signed during 2009, some of which have 
opened up new territories for us as referred to below.
Phumelela in South Africa, where we will be providing a 
comprehensive sports-book offering; poker and casino in the Balkans 
with Loper Gate; and with Probability to develop and execute 
opportunities for mobile gaming and mobile lottery services in a 
number of territories including China, and South and Central America. 
In September we signed a landmark deal with Harrah’s International 
Entertainment, to provide services to its non US facing customers 
marking the first ever B2B deal with a major US Casino operator. 
During the year we also announced three new bingo partners, 
MoonBingo, BingoHollywood and Costa Bingo, cementing our 
position as a global leader in the provision of bingo services. 
In November, Dragonfish signed an e-payments deal with Linden Lab, 
an agreement which extends our offering of Total Gaming Services 
into Total Payment Services and highlights the increasingly diverse 
nature and strength of Dragonfish’s operations. We have various 
existing and potential gaming partners interested in our e-payment 
solutions demonstrating this giant step beyond our core operations 
into the retail environment.

Chief Executive Officer’s Review
continued
People 
Key to the sustainable success of our business and, in turn, the 
delivery of shareholder value, is the continued development of our 
team who have once again delivered these excellent results.
Looking around the Group today, I am most encouraged by our 
significant and growing pool of talented employees. Our leadership 
and development programmes are designed to support employees 
at all levels, from senior managers to those who are at an early stage 
of their career.
We remain committed to enable our employees to fulfil their potential 
and share in the Group’s success.
We believe we have engendered the right culture within our 
business and we are committed to our corporate values: leadership, 
innovation, excellence, customer centricity, collaboration and caring, 
all of which helped us withstand the tough trading conditions 
throughout the year. 
Late last year, 888 mourned the passing of one of its founders, Dr 
Aharon Shaked. Aharon was a committed and passionate supporter 
of 888 and we shall miss his unique contribution in the future 
development of the Company.
Regulation
888, as a regulated and responsible company, is constantly reviewing 
actual and potential changes in the online gaming regulatory regime 
all over the world. This serves both to allow the Company to pursue 
any possible opportunities to seek, receive and operate under 
local licences, as well as to guide decision making in relation to its 
existing operations. Especially in Europe, the Company is pursuing 
licensing possibilities in Italy (where the 888 Group already holds a 
licence), France and other jurisdictions. In addition, 888 is looking 
into potential licensing opportunities outside Europe. We believe 
that the online gaming industry is making big strides towards 
being fully regulated in an increasing number of jurisdictions, in 
an unparalleled manner which will change for ever the industry 
landscape. The unique position of 888 makes it well placed to take 
advantage of these changes.
Responsible Gaming
As we state constantly at 888, playing is not just a matter of 
entertainment — we take our play very seriously. 
Entertainment is our core business and it has an impact both 
on the people who enjoy it and the environment in which it 
operates. Conducting our business responsibly is fundamental 
to the sustainability of our business and its future success. With 
responsibility comes transparency and we believe that transparency 
is created through communication and so, as part of that, we took 
the decision to share the way we conduct our business with all our 
stakeholders. During the year we published our first stand-alone 
Corporate Responsibility report: ‘People-Planet-Play.’ While we 
recognise that we still have much to achieve, we are committed to a 
proactive policy of corporate and social responsibility that reflects the 
high professional and ethical standards we have set for ourselves.
888 is committed to provide responsible gaming products that 
comply with the highest standards of gaming safety, security and fair 
practice that exist globally. We regularly collaborate with external and 
regulatory bodies who guide us on all aspects of responsible gaming. 
For more details see our website: http://safe.888.com.
Our own dedicated responsible gambling website 
(888responsible.com) provides a full guide to responsible practices 
and is a source of practical support for all those involved in gaming 
or those who seek to understand the gaming environment. We are 
most proud of our work in this area and will continue to see it as a 
key element in creating a sustainable, growing business. 
Our 2010 Focus
We aim to grow our B2C business through various strategic 
initiatives, including the rebranding and refocusing around products. 
We expect further expansion of our geographical footprint, largely 
led by the anticipated regulatory changes that the industry is facing, 
offering us a much more favourable environment for years to come. 
In casino, our strategic goal is to maintain our dominant market 
leading position by continuing to offer the right variety of products 
and we want to capture as many customer segments as possible. In 
pursuit of this goal, we will integrate more products and continue to 
enhance the customer experience introducing innovative products 
such as a 3-D virtual casino.

07
17555 30/03/2010 Proof 11
As regards our poker business, we will continue to focus on product 
innovation and customer needs, and will be launching a major 
upgrade to our gaming environment and player experience later 
this year. We will also be introducing various features designed 
to enhance the online poker-playing experience beyond what is 
available today, aiming to attract a bigger audience to our offering.
We will aim for greater focus on acquiring new players to our sports 
offering, promoting additional events and investing more in brand 
recognition in specific countries. We will present unique features as 
well as exclusive promotions around the main sports events of the 
year — led by the football World Cup. 2009 was the year in which 
sport betting became a real revenue-driver for us; we plan to build on 
these achievements and grow our market share in 2010.
Bingo will remain a key growth area for us, especially following the 
acquisition of Wink Bingo, and we will focus on penetrating new 
geographies throughout the year, bringing the message of bingo to 
many new customers worldwide. 
For Dragonfish, 2010 will see a continuation of the successful 
growth strategy, focusing on regulated markets and integrating a 
number of new products and services to deliver strong organic 
growth for partners, whilst targeting new partners with the Total 
Gaming Services proposition. We feel that we have a unique offering, 
unparalleled in the market, and will continue to seek major new 
deals throughout the year. The year will also see ongoing activity 
with our current partners, who will enjoy a variety of new games and 
capabilities that will assist them in growing their own businesses. 
Dragonfish’s first independent global payments agreement with 
Linden Lab will also be launched in 2010, followed by additional 
payment processing management agreements.
Outlook
In conclusion, in 2009 we made significant progress in a challenging 
environment. Our strong business fundamentals and successful 
growth strategy are the basis of our long-term sustainability.
We will continue to drive further organic growth, leveraging our 
enhanced geographic footprint and our dual business model. In 
parallel, we also remain committed to further acquisitions as part of 
the ongoing industry consolidation and also achieving our strategic 
goals. 
While 2009 was challenging, the overall market is on a growth 
trajectory. Casino continues to grow and Bingo has significant 
growth potential especially outside of the UK while Poker remains 
challenging. We remain excited that sportsbetting is still a major 
opportunity for us. Last but not least, Dragonfish presents significant 
additional growth opportunities which we plan to exploit, both in the 
Total Gaming and Total Payments environments. 
Financially and operationally we have a strong platform to grow our 
businesses further and look forward to continuing to provide all our 
stakeholders with value both now and in the future.

US$56 million), Profit before tax* was US$35 million (2008: US$49 
million) and Basic Earnings per share* was 9.2¢ (2008: 13.4¢).

In 2009 888’s turnover grew 36% in Rest of World while all other 
reported geographic markets showed decline: 7% in UK and Europe 
(excluding UK) and 27% in the Americas (excluding USA). The relative 
size of the UK and Europe (excluding UK) remained stable at 37% 
and 46%, respectively.
Expenses
During 2009, the Group continued its investment in infrastructure 
as required to propel its B2B capabilities while continuing the 
development of its B2C offerings.
Operating expenses, which are mainly salaries, chargebacks and 
payment service providers’ commissions, totalled US$98.4 million 
(2008: US$84.6 million) representing 40% of Total Operating 
Income (2008: 32%). Salaries and benefits, representing the 
largest component of operating expenses were US$45.5 million 
(2008: US$40.3 million) reflecting an increase of 13% as a result of 
continued investment in building up the B2B business. Chargebacks 
increased significantly during the year to US$9.0 million (2008: 
US$4.8 million) as a result of industry-wide concerted fraud 
attacks since Q2 2009. 888 responded to these by adopting new 
processes and procedures which resulted in a significant reduction in 
chargebacks starting in November and continuing to date.
During the year, the Group established a new outsourced low-cost 
development centre in Ukraine. While the number of development 
staff (employed and outsourced) increased during the year, 
development expenses were reduced to US$24.1 million (2008: 
US$27.4 million). The reduction was driven by more cost-effective 
workforce benefited from the new outsource local development 
centre which was established in late 2008 in Ukraine and partially a 
result of a favourable exchange rate movement.
Marketing expenses, driven almost exclusively by B2C activities, 
were US$67.3 million (2008: US$80.2 million), representing 27% of 
B2C Total Operating Income (2008: 31%). 
Administrative expenses* at US$22.5 million (2008: US$24.6 million). 
In 2009, the Group continued optimising cost per acquisition across 
various customer recruitment channels. During the year, 888’s  
marketing team recruited more than 206,000 new Casino and Poker 
first time depositors from more than 1.1 million (2008: 0.93 million) 
new real money registrations with an average cost per acquisition in 
2009 of $177 (2008: $232).

Share benefit charges
As part of 888’s commitment to invest in human capital, eligible 
management and employees receive equity awards under the 888 All 
Employee Share Plan (‘Share Plan’). In 2009, the Group continued to 
award shares and options to employees under the Share Plan. The 
non-cash charge for 2009 was US$7.0 million (2008: US$8.4 million), 
comprising a US$1.1 million charge relating to grants in the current 
year (2008: US$2.2 million) and US$5.9 million (2008: US$6.2 million) 
relating to grants made in the past.
Finance Income
While the Group continued to generate and retain cash surpluses 
throughout the year, net interest income was only US$0.2 million 
(2008: U$3.0 million) reflecting unprecedented low interest rates.
Profit and Earnings per share
EBITDA
EBITDA* was US$46 million (2008: US$56 million). EBITDA* margin 
was 18.5% (2008: 21.2%). 
Taxation
The tax charge for 2009 was $2.7 million (2008: $3.1 million) 
reflecting the Group’s efficient tax position.
Earnings per share
Basic Earnings per share* were 9.2¢ in 2009 (2008: 13.4¢).
 
* Before share benefit charge.
Dividend 
The Group’s stated policy is that it intends to make an annual 
dividend payment representing 50% of net profit, but the policy 
would reflect long-term earnings and cash flow potential of the 
Group. Given the performance in 2009, the Board is recommending 
a final dividend of 3.0 cents per share in addition to the interim and 
special dividend paid in October 2009. 
Cash flow
The Group’s strong profitability during the year was matched by 
strong cash generation with net cash generated from operating 
activities reaching US$41.5 million (2008: US$56.4 million). 
During 2009, the Group made cash payments of US$30.0 million 
(2008: US$36.7 million) in respect of business investment activities 
including US$18 million in respect of the acquisition of the Wink 
Online Bingo Business. The Group paid US$22.4 million (2008: 
US$25.6 million) in dividends to its shareholders consistent with its 
dividend policy.
Balance Sheet 
The Group’s balance sheet remains strong, it has no debt, and 
retains ample liquid resources. The Group’s cash position as at
31 December 2009 was US$87.5 million (31 December 2008: 
US$98.4 million). This strong position allows the Group to take 
advantage of suitable acquisition opportunities in the consolidating 
market.
Balances owed to customers were US$37.6 million (2008: US$33.3 
million). The Group maintains 100% cash reserves equal to this 
liability which would permit immediate withdrawal of all customer 
deposits at any time in the extremely unlikely event this was 
necessary.

B2C
It has always been 888’s goal to be the market leader in the global 
online gaming industry. In order to achieve this, it is vital to offer 
an exceptional gaming experience that appeals to a wide range of 
consumers — from the experienced poker player to casual sports 
fans and people who enjoy a game of bingo.
888 is more than just a place where people go to play online. 2009 
saw an increase in the focus on creating online entertainment 
destinations where players can combine an unparalleled gaming 
offering with a more complete internet experience, including social 
networking and personalised activities. 
The goal is for people to see 888 as a brand beyond gaming and an 
integral part of their online entertainment experience by fulfilling this 
wider role in the online lives of players. Building emotional ties with 
players and increasing their engagement with the brand builds loyalty, 
thereby helping to improve customer retention and spend.
Branding 
As the online gaming industry has evolved, it has become 
increasingly important to offer all four core gaming products — 
casino, poker, bingo and sport. Historically the four segments have 
been marketed as distinct brands to targeted audiences, with cross-
selling opportunities being utilised where possible. 
In 2009 the decision was taken to streamline the 888 brand focus 
and rebrand core products as being distinct, but complementary, 
parts of the wider 888 brand. With a reinvigorated look and feel and 
unified logos, the brands all speak with one language and link into 
one offering. The new sites were launched at the beginning of 2010 
as 888casino, 888poker, 888bingo and 888sport, all under the 888.
com umbrella brand.
Creating brand continuity allows the new sites to leverage the 
strength of the 888 brand and greatly increase the 888 ‘share of 
voice’. The multi-product offering and sub-brand strategy also 
increases the effectiveness and efficiency of marketing and search 
engine optimisation strategies, while cross-selling potential improves 
due to a powerful familiarity between the sites. 
 
888ladies will continue to be the leading bingo site in the UK market 
targeting the female population, while Pacific Poker and Casino-
on-Net will remain as additional stand-alone brands and important 
aspects of the B2C portfolio. The December acquisition of the Wink 
Online Bingo business added other leading brands to the B2C 
offering — Wink Bingo, Posh Bingo and Bingo Fabulous, all of which 
had previously performed well on the Dragonfish network.

Developing the Offering
Online gaming continues to evolve, and 888’s offering continues to 
innovate and change with it in order to remain at the forefront of the 
online gaming experience. 
888 is a truly global gaming destination, with localised offerings 
providing players in different geographies with games that appeal to 
them in the language that they speak. The 888 gaming experience 
is now available in a total of 23 languages. Four new languages 
were added in 2009 as 888 supported growing demand in Eastern 
Europe. 
As part of tailoring the offering to satisfy the demand of today’s 
discerning players we launched the innovative Live 888casino 
in June, allowing players to have a ‘Las Vegas style’ live gaming 
experience in the comfort of their own home. A live video stream with 
a personally chosen dealer provides a choice of Roulette, Black Jack, 
and Baccarat. Results in this area have been very encouraging. 
Live dealer was an important part of the new no-download Casino, 
which launched in May 2009. The no-download Casino uses flash 
games that can be accessed through web browsers such as Internet 
Explorer or Firefox, rather than downloading any form of software. 
The offering of instant online games removes the barrier to entry 
brought about by the hardship of extra time and effort to download 
software.
As well as innovative new features, constant improvements continue 
to provide a fresh and exciting gaming experience. 888 continues 
to offer a wide range of instant games across the B2C network, 
as games were added in 2009. These included games with iconic 
brands, such as Cluedo and Spiderman. Instant games have 
proven a popular addition. In Bingo, a new integration platform was 
completed allowing rapid game deployment. The speed to market 
of these games provides the opportunity to capitalise on trends 
and target offerings to interest and excite customers; 11 new side 
games have already been integrated. The successful X-Factor game, 
launched at the beginning of the popular show’s run in November 
supported through exclusive promotions, is a good example of the 
timely introduction of a tailored product. 
The increasing popularity in quick-play games led to the launch of 
888games. Initially launched on 888sport in July, 888games provides 
the opportunity to play instant win games whilst browsing the site, 
improving the gaming experience and time spent on the site as well 
as increasing customer spend. 
888games has since been launched as a stand-alone site with 60 
varied games, with more released continuously. Games range from 
scratch cards to video slots and virtual sports. As the rebranding 
of the core offering is completed, 888games will benefit from 
cross-selling traffic arising through players looking to enjoy a more 
instant gaming proposition. In addition, a further Casino brand was 
introduced, as Reef Club Casino was re-launched in August in 
both English and German. Reef Club Casino, with a low minimum 
deposit limit and high bonus offering, provided an inviting gaming 
environment which was well positioned at the height of the recession 
when many players were looking for a lower spend alternative and 
continues to offer an alternative experience.
The Poker offering also benefited from the addition of new features. 
A quick seat for beginners allows novices to pick up the basics in a 
free play environment, while private tournaments, the ability to export 
hand histories, and re-match tournaments give more experienced 
players a more satisfying poker experience.

Beyond Gaming
888ladies has been a pioneering website not just in its combination 
of a leading gaming product with a wealth of interactive features, but 
in the creation of a real online community. 888ladies goes beyond the 
core bingo product to provide players with a welcoming environment 
in which to interact with like-minded friends. Regular promotions, 
both online and offline, increase ties with players and provide 
incentives to visit the site frequently. 
Promotions ran throughout the year, including opportunities to 
win tickets to the Soap Awards at Easter and calendar themed 
promotions for Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day and Halloween.
However, it is the social features that set 888ladies apart. The 
888ladies blog receives hundreds of visitors every day, with 
community features leading to genuine interactivity and goodwill 
towards the brand. Utilising social media through providing daily 
communication and real-time promotions further increases brand 
engagement. A fan page on Facebook, and a regularly updated 
Twitter page have both been developed and are great successes. 
We will further develop the utilisation of social media and brand 
interactivity across additional areas of the B2C offering in 2010. 
Promotions
The economic environment in 2009 was the worst it has been since 
the advent of online gaming and indeed well before that. Customer 
acquisition conditions were, therefore, usually tough. It was important 
to offer new players compelling reasons to open accounts with 888.
Introductory offers in Casino included an immediate welcome bonus 
of 100% on a first deposit of up to $200, and a welcome package 
with a value of up to $1400. Other offers were specifically targeted 
for the recession. Promotions included the chance to win a year’s 
salary or a dream holiday, while lowering the deposit limit to £25 
fulfilled players need to continue playing with smaller stakes.
The largest promotion in 2009 was the £8,888,888 campaign, which 
offered the chance to use three free spins to win the biggest 
online jackpot of all time. The campaign appealed to players across 
the spectrum — including new, registered, and high value players, 
VIPs and inactive players. The promotion was supported by a 360 
degree marketing drive across all media outlets, including direct 
mail, television, online, and prominent public advertising, and also by 
search engine optimisation and cross-selling from 888 sites.
Offline Marketing
888 continued to seek out ground-breaking and timely offline 
marketing opportunities to build brand awareness amongst key 
demographics and to drive online traffic.
Leo Margets, the international female poker icon, and the last woman 
standing at the WSOP 2009, signed a 2-year contract with 888 and 
will spearhead the 888 ambassador programme. Leo has generated 
enormous media coverage, appearing in over 150 publications, most 
notably on the front cover of El Pais Semanal — the most important 
magazine for the Spanish audience. 
2009 was the second year of 888’s partnership with Shane Warne, and 
he continues to represent 888 at high-profile poker events such as the 
888 Poker Open, the Aussie Millions and the World Series of Poker. Also 
in 2009, the 888 Poker Ashes TV show was also launched in 2009 to 
coincide with the cricket Ashes series in the UK, and was broadcast 
after the cricket each day on Sky Sports. Moving the traditional rivalry of 
England and Australia from the cricket pitch onto the poker table led to 
one of the most successful poker television shows ever. The 2010/11 
cricket Ashes series (this time in Australia) will see the second season of 
the 888 Poker Ashes.
As the opposing countries squared up in the Poker Ashes, players could 
join and represent their country online. 100% welcome bonuses up 
to $400 offered an extra incentive to become an 888 player and was 
amongst the most innovative promotions in the poker industry in 2009.

Shane Warne extended his partnership with 888 in January 2010 
and he will continue to represent 888poker and other 888 brands 
internationally.
888poker has partnered with an offline poker league and clubs 
throughout 2009 taking the 888brand directly to players. The 888 Poker 
League was first formed in May, and rolled out in over 200 venues 
offering the opportunity to play with Shane Warne in the final. 
Customer Relationship Management
Strong customer relationships are the bedrock of our success. 
Whilst eye-catching promotions help to drive customer acquisition, 
customer retention comes from engendering loyalty through building 
bonds with players. This leads to people playing more games, more 
often, for more time. 
888’s ongoing commitment to localisation strengthens relationships 
worldwide through speaking to people in their language and culture, 
while the market-leading usage of social features and interactivity 
with players strengthens brand loyalty. This loyalty is also gained 
through 888’s loyalty plans, which form an important aspect of the 
customer relationship. In 2009 888 launched a new Poker loyalty 
plan, considered one of the best in the sector.
The VIP offering remains the best in the industry. VIP members get 
unparalleled customer service, with personal loyalty managers on call 
24 hours a day to deal with any enquiries quickly and easily. Exclusive 
promotions and more cashback and bonuses also mean that 888 VIPs 
receive a best in class product with best in class service. 
In 2009, 86 separate VIP promotions offered attractive gifts, bonuses 
and tickets to one of the 46 offline events held in nine different countries. 
Search Engine Optimisation 
(‘SEO’)
The specialist Search and Web Optimisation Technologies (‘SWOT’) 
team continue to give 888’s websites prominence on worldwide search 
engines, maximising the impact of the product offering. Successful use 
of SWOT has helped to drive players to 888 brands, helping customer 
acquisition and the ongoing growth of 888sport and 888ladies. 
In the UK, 888 sites come out on top of Google searches for 
‘casino’, ‘online casino’, ‘online blackjack’ and ‘poker.’ This 
positioning is replicated across core markets. 
888’s continuing focus on SEO will be a key driver in the success of 
the rebranded core 888 offerings.
2010 Focus
2010 has started well. With a number of strategic initiatives in the 
pipeline, including the completion of the rebranding and refocusing 
around core products, and further expansion of the geographic 
footprint, 2010 is set to be a year of growth.
In Bingo, the aim for the year is to become a truly global operator, 
with penetration in a number of new countries. In the UK, we will 
build on the success of 888ladies with the 888bingo offering, which 
appeals to a wider gaming demographic. The acquired Wink Bingo 
business also provides an opportunity to further increase market 
share in the growing UK bingo market.
The focus in Casino will continue to be on offering the right variety 
of products appealing to the widest range of consumers so as to 
maintain the Casino offering’s market leading position. In Poker 
the strategic goal is to differentiate the offering by identifying, and 
fulfilling, a significant customer need that has not yet been answered. 
This will be achieved through the creation of a brand positioning that 
is based on such unique product that customers need.
Targeted marketing campaigns in 2009 saw 888sport grow from 
being mainly a tactical business relying on cross-sell into an 
important contributor to the Group. 888sport’s growth in 2010 will 
continue through promoting additional events and investing in brand 
recognition in specific countries.

Dragonfish
2009 has marked a period of significant growth for the B2B division, 
with 33% growth over 2008. Growth has been achieved organically, 
through the provision of new product and service initiatives that have 
helped Dragonfish’s existing partners expand their market share, and 
through the signing of a number of key new partners. 
In March 2009, 888 took the decision to brand the rapidly expanding 
independent B2B division as Dragonfish, crystallizing the division’s 
separate function in 888 and signifying its evolution into a major 
player in the B2B market. A strong leadership team was established 
to drive the expansion of the business with departments covering 
Sales & business development, Programme management & 
integrations, Client executives unit, Client marketing & operations, 
B2B marketing & PR and B2B Finance. The combination of these 
teams ensures Dragonfish can provide an outstanding B2B service.
The creation of the Dragonfish identity was supported with an 
international advertising campaign in key publications, visibility at 
major trade shows, and through targeted PR achieving exposure 
across all trade publications and in overseas gaming markets. 
The brand has already achieved significant cut-through in a 
competitive market, and Dragonfish is now one of the largest 
providers in the B2B sector, with a broad cross section of partners 
across all core gaming segments and numerous geographic regions. 
New partners were retained in 2009 as strategic agreements were 
signed with, amongst others, Linden Lab and bwin Italia. 
Dragonfish’s goal is to become the major provider of Games & 
Technology, Marketing services, Operations and e-payments 
to companies that both lead the e-gaming market or require an 
experienced partner for entry into the sector. 
New entrants to the online gaming market require diverse gaming 
content, a technology platform to work with, expertise in setting up 
operations and, above all, knowledge of how to leverage their assets 
and target the gaming consumer. 
Dragonfish’s services help partners optimise the player experience 
and maximise customer lifetime value. Utilising over a decade’s 
experience in the online gaming industry, Dragonfish is able to offer 
clients a unique end-to-end proposition — Total Gaming Services. 
This strapline reflects the opportunity for clients not only to benefit 
from 888’s gaming portfolio and experience in technology, 
operations and e-payments, but also utilise advanced marketing 
services, from the provision of offline/online marketing, management 
of affiliates and search engine optimisation to Customer Relationship 
Management (CRM) and business analytics. Industry leading 
back-office systems, including operational risk management, 24/7 
customer support and chat hosting services, complete the offering. 
Dragonfish is able to provide clients with broad and customisable 
solutions for all of their gaming needs. They can utilise the complete 
white label solution or select from individual components to 
complement and enhance their own existing gaming offering. All 
solutions can be tailored for local markets, with Dragonfish currently 
providing services in more than 20 languages. The provision of a 
dedicated team and market leading technological infrastructure allow 
solutions to be both comprehensive and timely.

Utilising Dragonfish provides a gateway to a huge suite of successful 
games in a variety of languages, allowing rapid entry into emerging 
markets. Dragonfish provides hundreds of games with turnkey 
integration capabilities, plus the experience and expertise to 
customise game suites. Games can be seamlessly integrated 
through the Advanced Integration Platform allowing constant 
upgrades, increasing player retention and maximisation of customer 
lifetime value. 
Total Payment Services
The unique Total Payment Services offering combines payment 
optimisation technology and fraud management, including anti-
money laundering services, with 24/7 multi-lingual customer 
operations that assist customers’ deposits both reactively and 
proactively. 
Dragonfish has over a decade of experience in global payment 
processing and works with a variety of trusted payment partners. 
A rich portfolio of local and global payment methods enables 
Dragonfish to maximise transaction approval rates and provide the 
platform for partners to rapidly penetrate new markets. 
With the support of a highly experienced fraud and risk management 
department, Dragonfish’s e-payment solutions are both customer 
friendly and extremely secure.
In November an agreement was signed with the world’s leading 
virtual world technology company Linden Lab, the creator of 
Second Life, to provide e-payments, fraud and customer support 
management services. This collaboration represented an extension of 
Dragonfish’s offering beyond the gaming industry into the wider retail 
environment, and signified its emergence as a strong player in the 
regulated payment services market.
Partners
Dragonfish now works with e-gaming companies, media portals, 
offline casinos and pools operators, helping them all to maximise 
their online revenues and fulfil the potential of their brands. 
A number of significant partnerships were signed in 2009. 
Dragonfish’s prime position to provide the ideal platform for 
international land-based marquee brands to enter the online arena 
was illustrated through the signing of an agreement with Harrah’s 
to launch the internationally renowned World Series of Poker 
and Caesars casino brands online. This capability was further 
emphasised through the agreement with Tsogo Sun Gaming Group, 
one of the largest hotel and entertainment groups in South Africa, 
also choosing Dragonfish for their first move into online gaming. 
The agreement with Tsogo Sun Gaming Group followed the 
announcement of a partnership with Phumelela, one of the world’s 
largest pari-mutuel horseracing and tote betting organisations, to 
provide a comprehensive sportsbook offering in South Africa. This 
deal was an example of Dragonfish’s ability to co-operate with 
companies who utilise government licensing, and also indicates 
Dragonfish’s strategy of obtaining first-mover advantage in newly 
regulated territories. 
Further international agreements were signed in 2009 
harnessing Dragonfish’s multi-lingual offering and e-payments 
expertise in emerging territories. A partnership with Loper Gate 
launched poker and casino in the Balkans, enabling Dragonfish to 
achieve significant penetration in this emerging market.
Dragonfish remains one of the leading providers of bingo software 
worldwide, providing software to some of the biggest names in 
bingo including Foxy Bingo and Mirror Bingo. Dragonfish also runs 
one of the world’s leading bingo network with over 60 skins offering 
instant liquidity, dynamic content and access to top tier brands. 
This position was further consolidated during the year with the 
announcement that Kamay Holdings Ltd, owner of leading poker and 
casino sites LuckyAcePoker, LuckyAce Casino and SuproCasino, 
selected Dragonfish as its bingo partner to launch Silk Bingo on the 
Dragonfish bingo network. The agreement marked the tenth new 
brand launched on the network in 2009 and complements the new 
stand-alone networks, all powered by Dragonfish.

2009 also saw the fruition of Dragonfish’s hybrid strategy for its 
bingo model. This allows partners to join the Dragonfish bingo 
network swiftly, and benefit from instant liquidity whilst gaining a full 
understanding of back-office functionality, CRM and chat facilities. 
Following success on the network, appropriate levels of liquidity 
subsequently enable partners to launch stand-alone networks, whilst 
maintaining other brands on the Dragonfish bingo network. This 
model was followed by Moon Bingo in June, amongst others.
Dragonfish has been highly pro-active in delivering strong organic 
growth for the existing client base through the introduction of new 
product initiatives. The poker network has achieved greater liquidity 
across a number of diverse territories with particular growth for Lucky 
Ace and Tower Torneos. Growth has been achieved through new 
poker software upgrades to provide an enhanced and intuitive player 
experience, the introduction of a new loyalty club and the extension 
of the language portfolio. Successful new language integration 
projects have been implemented, one example being Lucky Ace 
poker now being offered in languages aimed to target the Eastern 
European market. The recent agreement with WSOP (World Series of 
Poker), arguably the world’s most powerful poker brand, will act as a 
further catalyst for liquidity growth on the network.
In Bingo, Dragonfish launched 17 new Quickplay ‘instant’ games on 
the bingo network, including the global brand X-Factor, to increase 
player retention across networks. A number of these games have 
been successfully integrated into Tower Torneos ‘casino in poker’ 
offering resulting in increased player performance.
2010 Focus
2010 will see a continuation of the successful growth strategy. 
This includes being the first to regulated markets and integrating a 
number of new products and services. The aim is to deliver strong 
organic growth for partners, whilst targeting new partners with the 
Total Gaming Services proposition so as to maintain the impressive 
growth rate.
The introduction of licensing in newly regulated markets such as 
Italy offers a significant opportunity to assist operators looking for 
a speedy entry to such markets. Dragonfish has recently signed 
an agreement with bwin Italia, a subsidiary of BWIN, to provide a 
comprehensive casino games suite. The agreement supports the 
Total Gaming Services proposition allowing partners to either take 
advantage of the full white label solution or to select constituent 
elements to be integrated into their existing online gaming business. 
In this case. Dragonfish has developed a flexible gaming platform 
that can be integrated into bwin Italia’s existing infrastructure.
Dragonfish has a number of new product integrations in the pipeline 
that will provide growth opportunities for partners. Live dealer has 
proven to be an excellent product for delivering strong growth and 
the live gaming application will soon be integrated into a number 
of partners’ offerings. Dragonfish will also be expanding the live 
chat multi-lingual customer operations team in Romania to enable 
partners to accelerate their penetration into new markets.
Plans are in place for the development of bingo in the Nordics, enabling 
partners to achieve further international expansion, together with a range 
of new features that will cement Dragonfish’s market-leading bingo 
position. This will be supported by the launch of a number of new
stand-alone networks and new brands on the Dragonfish bingo 
network.
2010 will also mark the launch of new multi-channel marketing 
campaigns as partners increase spend in UK and pan-European 
territories. 
Dragonfish’s first independent global payments agreement with 
Linden Lab will be launched in 2010. The agreement provides a 
platform for marketing its Total Payment Services beyond the gaming 
industry. Dragonfish is pursuing a number of existing opportunities in 
the Forex industry and other non-gaming opportunities.
Technological Infrastructure
888’s success is built on the strength of its technological 
infrastructure. 2009 saw the continued development of the platform 
from a pure B2C to a hybrid B2C and B2B platform which is able to 
utilise and offer partners leading infrastructure and a comprehensive 
suite of applications and services.
In addition to the customer facing applications and services, B2B 
licensees are able to view comprehensive customer data, providing 
them with the ability to drill down into data at any level in order to 
manage their business better. 
888 continues to invest in technology. In 2009 a significant 
investment was made in upgrading 888’s physical infrastructure, 
computing, storage and networking equipment was upgraded, 
maintaining the best of breed approach to our physical infrastructure: 
A state-of-the-art data centre replaced one of the existing data 
centres, and security, networking devices and protocols were 
replaced in order to provide better performance, maintainability, and 
scalability, as well as to reduce energy consumption and bandwidth 
costs.

Enhanced Business Review
continued
The number of servers was also increased. There are now more than 
1,000 servers in the development and testing environments, and 
900 in production, most of which are now based on virtual machine 
technology. 
In addition to data centre improvements, further platform 
enhancements and a significant upgrade in 888’s payment 
processing capabilities led to 888 receiving the Payment Card 
Industry level 1 certification, allowing the Group to provide third party 
payment services. The creation of a leading payment processing 
infrastructure allows 888, through Dragonfish, to offer partners a Total 
Payment Services proposition, moving the Company beyond the 
online gaming sector.
The Integration Platform allows seamless integration of new third 
party games from multiple vendors into the 888 gaming environment. 
Building on this flexibility, in 2009, a new Content Management 
System was implemented for all managed websites. The new system 
enables a greater quantity of content changes to be implemented 
with greater speed and frequency across all supported websites. 
The bingo platform also benefited from technological enhancement. 
Improvements to the Integration Platform saw an abstraction layer 
created allowing for easy integration of games and third party 
services, while the chat system was upgraded with enhanced 
capabilities and performance, further embellishing the community 
aspect of the bingo offering.
Steps were taken to benefit the player experience as well as 
improvements in the back-office infrastructure. The most eye-
catching of these was the introduction of the Live Dealer offering, 
which has proved to be very popular. A new loyalty system was also 
launched in 2009, with the integration of casual games across the 
offering further enhancing player satisfaction. 
CRM capabilities were also significantly enhanced through the 
implementation of a content management system with multiple offers 
and communication channels. This allows 888 to better segment 
and tailor offers and promotions, making the right offer to the right 
customer at the right time.
To further enhance development efforts and reduce costs, 
888 opened and integrated a large new outsourced software 
development facility in Eastern Europe. This development centre, in 
Ukraine, allows access to excellent, well-trained, highly professional 
and cost-efficient talent. By the end of 2009, around 50% of our 
development activities were successfully carried out at this centre.
888 has also focused attention and investment on developing 
solutions to take advantage of the changing regulatory scene in 
Europe. Tailor-made solutions for both the French and Italian markets 
were developed, seamlessly providing Casino services to B2B partners 
and leading to a number of significant deals being signed in newly 
regulated regions, such as bwin Italia.
Significant work was done during the latter part of the year on 
rebranding the 888 B2C offering. Alongside the eye-catching new 
look and feel, the sites’ infrastructure were rebuilt with content 
management systems better optimised for faster performance, 
improving the customer experience by more than halving response 
times. 
In January 2010, a new enterprise resource planning system was 
successfully implemented and integrated into 888’s business 
backbone — the result of a large undertaking carried out during 
2009. This new system streamlines 888’s capability to carry out daily 
business processes in an optimal manner.
Improvements were also made to 888’s operational command and 
control capability, dramatically enhancing the service levels provided 
to B2B partners through growth and process improvement in the 
Network Operating Center, the 24/7 nerve centre of operations. This 
greatly improved second level support capabilities. 
In order to better support the growing demands from an ever 
increasing set of B2B partners, and to adapt to the growing 
richness and size of our offering, 888 continues to evolve and 
upgrade existing offerings through routine maintenance, functionality 
upgrades, and changes to back-office services. 
17555888COM.indd   18 17555888COM.indd   18 30/03/2010   12:34 30/03/2010   12:34 www.888holdingsplc.com

17555 30/03/2010 Proof 11
888 will continue to invest in technology across the business, 
ensuring that leading back-office systems provide the basis for an 
unparalleled experience for both players and partners.
Customer Support and Service
888 remains committed to its goal of being the market leader in the 
global online gaming industry.
First class customer support is offered for each of the Group’s brands 
and White Labels via telephone, e-mail and chat 24 hours a day, 7 days 
a week, to customers around the world in 11 different languages. 
In 2009, we aligned our mission to increase customer conversion 
and retention by focusing training efforts on ‘sales through service’. 
On average, our support teams converted 28% of all relevant 
incoming phone calls to deposits, providing a service convenient to 
players and beneficial to the business.
The Telemarketing and Proactive Chat department has continued to 
expand. Three additional languages have been added to raise the 
total number of languages to eight. We are pleased to see that the 
department has increased its performance compared to 2008 on 
all main metrics measured internally — efficiency, productivity and 
revenue generated. New initiatives and optimisation of talented staff 
has also seen all main individual metrics increase. 
Five additional languages were added to the Online Web Self-Service, 
and a deal with RightNow was signed for the full deployment of its 
CRM solution across all operational sites in 2010. This investment will 
help 888 to reduce its operational expenditure, effectively manage its 
resources and improve efficiency and increase customer satisfaction. 
A third operational contact centre site was opened in Romania via an 
outsourcing arrangement at the end of the third quarter of 2009 in 
order to increase cost-effectiveness, capacity and continue providing 
each individual customer with an outstanding end-to-end customer 
experience around the clock. Operating multiple contact centres is 
a cost-effective way of managing customer contact overspill and 
allows for efficient balancing of operational demands. 
The main Gibraltar contact centre focuses on providing support for 
our principal markets in Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America while 
the Antiguan contact centre focuses on supporting the English-
speaking markets in Europe, Australia, Asia Pacific and Canada. 
In 2010, the newly established contact centre in Romania is set to 
expand inbound customer services for more brands and languages, 
and ultimately to become the main support centre for Dragonfish and 
888’s main markets in Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America.
Support teams in all locations aim to close the majority of issues 
during the first contact, as exemplified in the Service Level 
Achievement reached in 2009:
Casino in English 
l 98.0% of all phone calls were answered within, on average, 
30 seconds
l 99.0% of all e-mails were replied to within 24 hours
l 95.3% of all chats were answered within, on average, 
40 seconds
Poker in English
l 98.0 % of all phone calls were answered within, on average, 
30 seconds
l 89.0% of all e-mails were replied to within 24 hours
l 89.9% of all chats were answered within, on average 40 seconds
Bingo in English
l 96.0% of all phone calls were answered within, on average, 
30 seconds
l 91.0% of all e-mails were replied to within 24 hours
Customer Satisfaction
888 continues to monitor customer satisfaction at key points 
throughout their lifetime cycle by requesting and analysing real-
time feedback. As in previous years a comprehensive survey was 
conducted to benchmark 888’s service level within primary markets, 
with the results being used to form the basis of quality improvement 
efforts.
888 is proud to note that respondents in 2009 once again gave 
their highest rating to the level of professionalism of our support 
representatives. Respondents from Germany remain the most 
satisfied, closely followed by respondents from France where results 
show a considerable increase in satisfaction compared to previous 
studies:

Representatives at 4.0 (out of 5)
l 89% of all customers who contacted 888 in regards to the 
deposit process, were offered assistance in depositing and/or 
were presented with alternative depositing method to use 
In addition to understanding the different components of customer 
satisfaction, recent surveys demonstrated increased awareness and 
usage of the state-of-the-art Web Self-Service facility available to 
English and German speaking customers. Additional regions will be 
surveyed in 2010. 
A vital component in maintaining and exceeding customer 
expectations is 888’s ability to access each client’s full and complete 
history in real time, thus optimising customer interactions on all levels. 
888’s unparalleled customer service and leadership in the e-Gaming 
industry has been also recognised by the judges of the 2009 
e-Gaming Review Awards when awarding 888 the coveted title 
‘Casino Operator of the Year’.
Fraud and Risk Management
Utilising over a decade of experience, 888’s Fraud and Risk 
Management Department continues to provide 888 and B2B 
partners with a leading fraud prevention service. 888 has built a 
comprehensive database of fraudulent accounts and fraud patterns, 
helping introduce new measures to prevent fraudulent activity.
In 2009, the following steps were taken to further develop risk 
management and fraud control procedures:
l Fraud Alerts — 888 planned and created an in-house alerts 
mechanism that identifies changing trends and patterns, 
identifying suspicious activity
l Cashier — a more robust new cashier is being built
l Back-Office — back-office systems were updated, allowing 888 
to react to changes in the type of fraudulent activity
l Data Analytics — data continues to be collected and analysed 
through the data warehouse systems in order to monitor current 
fraudulent activity
l PCI Level 1 Compliance — 888 became the first online 
gaming company to be PCI Level 1 Compliant, showing 888’s 
commitment in handling sensitive and personal data with the 
highest degree of care
888 continues to optimise all procedures to ensure that fraud 
aspects are covered across the business. New releases of White 
Label brands are thoroughly checked to ascertain whether these 
bring any inherent risk, and new offerings investigated for possible 
domain specific risks. 
Innovation in this area will continue, ensuring that actions are taken in 
order that services and processes remain one step ahead of potential 
fraudulent activity.
Corporate Social Responsibility
As a global leader in the online gaming entertainment industry, 
888 is committed to a pro-active policy of corporate and social 
responsibility that reflects the high professional and ethical standards 
we have set for ourselves.
Conducting our business responsibly is fundamental to the future 
success of 888 and the sustainability of the business. At 888, we 
understand that our responsible approach is both the correct way to 
do business and one that enhances our credibility with stakeholders, 
thereby supporting our international business development. 
This year marked a significant milestone for the Company in this 
field. During October 2009 we published our first ever Corporate 
Responsibility report for the year 2008. The report is available at 
www.888responsible.com. 
We aim to publish such a report every two years. 
Regulation and General 
Regulatory Developments
The regulatory framework of online gaming in different countries 
around the world remains as dynamic and rapidly evolving as ever. 
While some jurisdictions have moved to curtail the activities of online 
gaming sites (such as the US and Turkey), many others are currently 
contemplating liberalisation and regulation of the industry, and some 
have already taken this route. The Group remains committed to 
monitoring closely and addressing regulatory changes as they occur, 
and to fostering, so far as possible, the trend towards liberalisation 
and regulation of online gaming throughout the world.
EU
The European Commission is challenging the online gambling 
and betting regulatory regimes of various European States. The 
Commission holds that, as regards EU licensed companies, these 
regimes might infringe the enshrined freedom to provide services, the 
freedom of establishment and the concept of mutual recognition. This 
effort is reflected in, inter alia, the infringement proceedings initiated 
against several EU States (including Spain, Germany, Portugal, 
Finland, Austria, Hungary, Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands, Denmark 
and France); should these Member States fail to supply adequate 
reasoning behind their gambling legislation and fail to rectify what is 
required from them by the EU Commission, the Commission may refer 
the issue with each Member State to the European Court of Justice. 
Enhanced Business Review

17555 30/03/2010 Proof 11
While these proceedings may, in the end, cause the European States 
to liberalise their gambling markets, it should be noted that it could 
be a very long time before resolutions or judgments are reached (if at 
all); and, as the European Court of Justice opined in its judgment in 
the case of bwin v. Santa Casa, the scope of discretion available to 
Member States in this sphere is relatively wide. In other cases referred 
to the European Court of Justice by several German courts, the EU 
Advocate General reiterated (in March 2010) this position and opined 
(although his opinion is not binding upon the Court) that EU law does 
not oblige Member States to recognise online gambling licenses 
issued by other Member States. However, in 2010 the new Internal 
Market Commissioner opined that the ECJ’s ruling in the bwin v. Santa 
Casa case will have little impact on the EU Commission’s activities 
in the sphere of cross border gambling services, as that judgment 
was based on considerations specific to Portugal and its gaming 
monopoly; the Commission will continue to review Member States’ 
legislation in the gambling sphere on a case by case basis. 
However, the pressure exerted by the EU Commission has resulted 
in several EU Member States contemplating, and in some cases 
advancing, a liberalised (or partially liberalised) gaming sector; these 
Member States include Spain, France, Sweden, Greece, Estonia, 
Belgium and Denmark. Other EU Member States such as Ireland, 
Cyprus and the Czech Republic are also considering (or are already 
in the process of) revising their gaming laws possibly so as to 
regulate online gaming. 
Thus, in France, a draft law is in the final stages of the legislative 
process, which will authorize the issue of French online gambling 
licences, limited to the spheres of poker, sports betting and 
horserace wagering. While the draft legislation is still being 
structured, and several aspects of it are still being discussed with the 
EU Commission, the Group is watching closely these developments 
so as to be in a position which will allow it to apply for an online 
gambling licence in France; this is expected to happen during 2010. 
In 2009, Belgium passed a law which will allow issuance of online 
gambling licences as an extension of existing terrestrial gambling 
licences; therefore, pure online gambling operators may face 
difficulties in obtaining online gambling licences in that jurisdiction. 
The Group is pursuing potential opportunities to allow it to utilise 
this change in legislation. In Denmark, the government announced 
that it will introduce legislation which will regulate and license online 
gambling activities in the spheres of casino, poker and sports betting. 
Spain too partially revealed its intention to license and regulate online 
gaming activities; a draft law is expected to be introduced in 2010, 
and is intended to present a federal online gaming licensing regime. 
Finally in Italy, where the Company holds an online gambling licence, 
current and future legislation will expand the scope of the games 
allowed to be offered under the licence (e.g. casino games), and will 
also relax some of the requirements posed to licensees (including, 
inter alia, the spheres of taxation and establishment in Italy). 
In Germany, the State of Schleswig Holstein announced that it will 
not agree to an extension of the prohibitive interstate lottery treaty, 
when its term ends at the end of 2011. While this in itself does not 
impact the formal validity of the treaty, it could represent a potential 
future shift in the regulatory regime in Germany.
In addition to these infringement proceedings, the EU Commission is 
involved in other instances in which the online gambling and betting 
regulatory regimes appear to contravene rights and freedoms of 
online gambling and betting operators (e.g. issuing detailed opinions 
against the enactment of prohibitive legislation, and intervening in the 
WTO process described below). 
UK
The DCMS has announced in 2010 that it will review the current 
online gaming licensing regime, and is considering whether to require 
all gaming operators targeting British consumers to be licensed (and 
most probably taxed) in the UK. 
USA
In the USA, several bills have been introduced into the 111th 
Congress, which focus on online gambling issues. One of these 
bills creates an online gambling licensing regime that will allow for 
a Federal online gambling licence to be issued (subject to various 
conditions, limitations and possible exclusions); the bill has yet to be 
advanced in Congress. Another bill aims to delay the implementation 
date of the UIGEA regulations to 1 December 2010 (following 
the decision of the Treasury and Federal Reserve to delay the 
implementation date of the regulations until 1 June 2010). In parallel, 
several US States (including California, Iowa, New Jersey and Florida) 
are reviewing the possibility of licensing some form of intra-state 
online gambling activities. 
WTO
Following a complaint filed in 2007 by the Remote Gaming 
Association, the European Commission decided to open an 
investigation into whether the United States is in breach of its WTO 
obligations in the sphere of gambling (in relation to the period prior 
to the planned withdrawal of its commitment). In March 2009, 
the investigation was concluded with a report issued by the EU 
Commission, which stated that the US measures taken against 
EU-based online gambling operators breach the WTO commitments 
of the US. The EU commission stated that it will seek to reach a 
settlement with the US in this respect; trade discussions between the 
US and the EU have dealt with, inter alia, this issue but no decision 
has been made as yet.

Employees 
At 888 we work hard to nurture and maintain the pool of talent of our 
employees. We acknowledge and value all our employees and strive 
to be an employer of choice. 888 values everyone’s contribution, 
regardless of their background or gender, and believes that diversity 
helps meet the need of our global customers. 
Since our employees are one of our key stakeholders we value their 
opinion. Therefore, during the last quarter of 2009 we conducted 
a global employee opinion survey to understand our employees’ 
feedback towards different aspects of their life at 888. The survey’s 
findings form the base for defining our 2010 goals. 
Professional development and training 
We strive to enable our employees to grow with the business, 
helping us to retain talent. During 2009 two major programmes were 
developed for our employees.
Panoramic Training
A global project designed to connect and enhance employees’ 
knowledge about the Company’s products. This project aimed to 
provide a panoramic outlook on both the internal and external parts 
of the business. The objectives of the programme are to improve 
employees’ connection to the customer experience and enhance 
the employees’ understanding of the end user experience, broaden 
employees’ understanding of 888 activities and what the Company 
offers its customers; and increase employees’ awareness to 
important Company processes. 
The programme includes four categories: customer Voice — live 
calls from the support team; tools — understanding operational tools 
such as reporting systems; products — internal product lectures; 
and tailor-made plans — training needs analysis and designed 
programmes for each division.
High Potential Programme
A high profile programme designed to identify and develop key 
talent within the Company, this programme is a global project with 
participants from all of 888’s divisions, sites and locations. The 
programme includes two groups: team leaders, who are the future 
potential managers, and employees, who are the future potential 
team leaders. The programme is either 12 or 18 months long, with 
the time set according to location and includes both individual and 
group training sessions. The project aims to identify future leadership 
and maximise internal human capital, reducing reliance on sourcing 
new talent externally, creating an internal tool for career progression, 
forming a tool for retention of key personnel and driving business 
success by relying on internal business knowledge.

Life at 888
At 888 we like to treat our employees as individuals and ensure that 
they work in a relaxed and stimulating environment. 
During 2009, every division had a dedicated division day and during 
the year over ten special days were marked. Celebrations were held 
at different times according to locations, their holidays and relevant 
events. 
As happens once a year, during the first quarter staff from a wide 
variety of levels, from team leaders to senior management, met for a 
global summit.
To combine creativity and fun at 888, 2009 saw the initiation of a 
Global Art & Craft Exhibition. The exhibition included works of 888 
employees, giving them an opportunity to present their work and 
express their creative side. 
Twenty-six representatives from all 888 locations took part in the 
exhibition, which included different forms of art such as painting, 
photography, sculpture, knitting and many more.
The exhibition was presented at 888 premises in various locations 
for 14 days, with the art works then printed onto a calendar and 
distributed to all employees. 
Community 
888 is committed to supporting the various local communities in 
which it operates and the broader global community through its 
ability to reach millions of consumers worldwide. 
Our community investment programme includes cash donations and 
long-standing community involvement in our key areas across the 
world. 
Local community involvement 
The Gibraltar, Antigua and UK offices focused their community work 
this year on raising funds for a wide range of issues, including Cancer 
Research UK, ‘Tarik School of Dance’, ‘Teen Tales’, the Gibraltar 
Philharmonic Society and various other global charities. 
Our employees in Israel have continued their year long relationship 
with the local Derech Haetgar charity, which focuses on enhancing 
the education of disadvantaged teenagers.
As has been the case for each of the past three years, employees 
in Israel joined the Ruach Hatova national volunteering organisation 
for a day of goodwill. A group of 25 employees helped at a special 
school for refugees, with volunteers working with the children to

Corporate Social Responsibility
continued
Online Charity day 
888 held its third annual charity day. The 2009 charity day offered 888’s 
customers across all brands the opportunity to take part in the day and 
play on the sites for a good cause. Together, 888 and its costumers 
donated a total of US$70,000 to help with the East Africa Crisis. 
Environment 
As an online business 888’s activities have a relatively small 
impact on the environment. However, we continue to develop our 
commitment to environmental issues in order to ensure that this 
impact is kept to a minimum, and 2009 saw a number of initiatives in 
this area.
Green IT was targeted as one of our major challenges which 
we approached on various levels — (a) Recycling IT: all old and 
nonfunctional IT equipment from all of our locations is now sent for 
recycling and (b) Virtualisation (VDI project): more than 120 stations 
were transformed from a PC to the VDI system, enabling us to use 
less hardware. 
Alongside these projects we continuously measure our energy 
consumption to make sure steps are taken to minimise it at all times. 
We try to recycle as many materials as possible. Paper, bottles and 
cans are collected regularly from all of our sites on a monthly basis. 
We use only ecological detergents in our offices and continue using 
water saving devices in all our locations. To minimise the impact of 
travel on the environment we encourage employees to either cycle to 
work and, in certain locations, provide buses for commuters. 
To reduce international travel we continue to invest in state-of-the-
art technology and this year we offered the new option of ‘888Live 
Meeting’ to all our staff. ‘888LM’ is a web sharing information tool 
which allows all 888 employees to communicate globally while 
viewing the same documents on their personal computer. 
Responsible gaming 
Our values place the community and the customer at the centre of all 
our endeavours. We are constantly creating new and innovative ways 
to create a caring, responsible gaming environment and to ensure 
our children are safe. 
888 aims to provide responsible adults with the best online gaming 
entertainment experience. However, we acknowledge that within our 
business there is the possibility of danger that the games may pose 
for a small minority of people. 
We continuously train all our staff and provide them with the tools 
necessary to provide a safe gaming experience. Our training 
programme incorporates methods and techniques that assist our 
employees in recognising and taking appropriate actions when they 
identify compulsive or under-age gambling.
Protecting Customers 
As a responsible, regulated gaming Company we comply with both 
the GamCare and the eCOGRA guidelines, and during 2009 had our 
certification renewed. 
GamCare is the leading authority on the provision of counselling, 
advice and practical help in addressing the social impact of gambling 
in the UK. 
eCOGRA ensures that approved online casinos are properly and 
transparently monitored to provide player protection.
 
Our site has links to helping agencies and we have placed many 
safeguards for those who need help with controlling their gaming: 
— Self-assessment test: For gamblers who are worried about their 
gambling habits and want to know more about the signs of 
compulsive gambling, 
— Controlling deposit limits: Should clients feel the need to, they 
can control their gambling by self limiting the amounts they 
deposit per day, per week or per month. 
— Self exclusion: A member can request to be self excluded for a 
chosen period, due to different concerns. Clients can choose 
from three options of exclusion period — 7 days, 30 days and 
180 days. During this period, 888 blocks the account and no 
promotional e-mails are sent to the client.

Protecting minors 
Under-age gambling on our sites is prohibited and the Group takes 
the matter of under-age gaming extremely seriously. Our offerings 
are not designed to attract minors. We use sophisticated verification 
systems to identify and prevent minors from logging into our 
software. 
We make every effort to prevent minors from playing on our site.
This year, we have added the age verification services of 192.com to 
complement the existing services provided by URU.
We train our staff to be highly sensitive to the possibility of under 
age gambling and make sure we immediately suspend any account 
suspected to be an under-age account. 
888responsible 
Since 2007, a dedicated website, www.888responsible.com, 
has been available, providing information regarding all aspects 
of responsible gaming. The site was translated in June 2009 into 
three additional languages, and is now available in English, French, 
Spanish and German.
888safe
888 is committed to providing responsible gaming products which 
comply with the highest standards of gaming safety, security and fair 
practice. 
In March 2009, we were awarded the prestigious TRUSTe Privacy 
seal of approval for all our websites. As a result of a rigorous audit we 
are the first online gaming company to be awarded the Web Privacy 
Seal, a clear indication of the importance we place on being a highly 
trustworthy operator.
TRUSTe runs the world’s largest privacy seal programme, with more 
than 2,000 organisations certified. It helps millions of consumers 
identify trustworthy online organisations through its Web Privacy Seal, 
E-mail Privacy Seal and Trusted Download Programmes. TRUSTe 
ensures online privacy and protects confidential user information on 
more than 2,400 Websites and many of the most highly trafficked, 
including Yahoo, AOL, Microsoft, Disney, eBay, Intuit, and Facebook.
We continue to collaborate with external and regulatory bodies who 
guide us on all aspects of responsible gaming, and our dedication to 
this area is shown through our specialist website,
http://safe.888.com/.
United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) 
During 2009, 888 joined United Nations Global Compact. The UNGC 
is the largest global initiative to promote the social responsibility 
of businesses. It is a voluntary initiative, which brings together 
thousands of businesses across more than 100 sectors worldwide. 
Representatives confirm their commitment to the UNGC in order 
to promote ten universally accepted principles in the field of human 
rights, workplace standards and anti-corruption. 
We believe that the activities of 888 are in line with the principles 
of the Global Compact, and it therefore seemed appropriate 
that we should publicly declare our support and ensure greater 
exposure to a wider public. By joining the UNGC we are now in line 
with an established and globally recognised policy framework of 
environmental, social, and governance policies and practices.

Risk Report
The Group operates in a dynamic business environment. In addition 
to the day-to-day commercial risks faced by most enterprises, the 
online gaming industry faces particular challenges in respect of 
Regulatory risk, Reputational risk, Information Technology risk and 
Taxation risk, each of which is detailed below. 
Regulatory risk
The regulatory framework of online gaming is dynamic and complex. 
Change in the regulatory regime in a specific jurisdiction could have a 
material adverse effect on business volume and financial performance 
in that jurisdiction. A detailed regulatory review is set out in previous 
pages.
Reputational risk 
Under-age and problem gaming are inherent risks associated with 
the online gaming industry and the Group is no exception. The 
Group devotes considerable resources to putting in place prevention 
measures coupled with strict internal procedures designed to prevent 
under-aged players from accessing its real money sites. In addition, 
the Group promotes a safe and responsible gaming environment to 
its customers supplemented by its corporate culture. The Group has 
a dedicated Director of CSR & Responsible Gaming tasked with the 
responsibility of implementing such policies. Further details about the 
Group’s responsible gaming initiatives are set out in previous pages.
Information Technology risks 
As a leading online business, the Group’s IT systems are critical to its 
operation. The Group is reliant on the performance of these systems. 
Cutting-edge technologies and procedures are implemented 
throughout the Group’s technology operations and designed to 
protect its networks from malicious attacks and other such risks. 
These measures include traffic filtering, anti-DDoS (Distributed Denial 
of Service) devices, Anti-Virus protection from leading vendors 
and other such means. Physical and logical network segmentation 
is used to isolate and protect the Group’s networks and restrict 
malicious activities. In order to ensure systems are protected properly 
and effectively, external security scans and assessments are carried 
out in a timely manner. The Group has a high-end storage solution 
to ensure storage availability and performance. All critical data is 
replicated to another storage device for disaster recovery purposes 
and all data is stored off-site on a daily basis.
In order to minimise dependencies on telecommunication service 
providers, the Group invests in network infrastructure redundancies 
whilst regularly reviewing its service providers. The Group has two 
internet service providers in Gibraltar in order to minimise reliance on 
one provider.
As a part of its monitoring system, the Group deploys set user 
experience tests which measure performance from different 
locations around the world. Network-related performance issues are 
addressed by rerouting traffic using different routes or providers. 
888 operates a 2457 Network Operations Centre (NOC). The NOC’s 
role is to conduct real time monitoring of production activities using 
state-of-the-art systems. These systems are designed to identify and 
provide alerts regarding problems related to systems, key business 
indicators and issues surrounding customer usability experience. 
Taxation risk
The Group aims to ensure that each legal entity within the Group 
is a tax resident of the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated and 
has no taxable presence in any other jurisdiction. While the Group’s 
customers are located worldwide, certain jurisdictions may seek to 
tax such activity which could have a material adverse effect on the 
amount of tax payable by the Group or on customers’ behaviour. 
The Group benefits from favourable fiscal arrangements in some of 
the jurisdictions in which it has taxable presence without which its 
results would be adversely affected. All gaming activities are based 
in Gibraltar, where the Group currently benefits from a tax exempt 
status. A change of control or activity of a tax exempt subsidiary 
would result in the loss of its tax status. However, this is not 
expected to have a material adverse effect on the overall tax rate of 
the Group. The tax exempt status is due to expire by the end of 2010 
when the Government of Gibraltar intends to introduce a new fiscal 
regime that complies with EU requirements. 
Domestic corporate tax in Gibraltar is 22% (2009/2010). Gibraltar’s 
Chief Minister has announced further reductions in anticipation of 
the introduction of a flat tax rate of 10% in 2011. A consultation is in 
place with respect to the new tax regime in Gibraltar and it is widely 
anticipated, following Government indications, that the new rules 
will subject the Group to an effective rate of tax well below the new 
flat tax rate. The Group is currently required to pay a gaming duty, 
currently set at 1% of gaming yield, with an annual maximum cap 
of £425,000 in aggregate, in respect of its Casino, Poker and Bingo 
activities and, separately, at the same rate in respect of the Group’s 
Sports offering. The applicability of the gaming taxes following the 
implementation of the new tax regime is, as yet, unclear.
The Group’s subsidiary in Israel, Random Logic Limited, and the 
Israeli branch of Intersafe Global Limited, have each entered into 
separate transfer pricing agreements on an arm’s length basis 
with the Israeli Income Tax Commissioner. The arrangements for 
Random Logic Limited are effective until 31 December 2010, while 
the arrangement for the Intersafe Global Limited branch terminated 
on 31 December 2007. The Group has discontinued the use of this 
branch. 
The operation in Antigua also benefits from a low tax regime.

Corporate Governance 
888 Holdings plc (the ‘Company’) is admitted to the UK Official List 
and traded on the London Stock Exchange, but it is not subject to 
the UK Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued in June 
2008 (the Code) as it is a Gibraltar incorporated company. The 
Directors support high standards of Corporate Governance and will 
continue to comply with the Code as far as it is appropriate for a 
company incorporated in Gibraltar. 
The Board
The Directors consider it essential that the Company should be both 
led and controlled by an effective Board.
Composition
Following the resignation of one Director on 30 December 2009, 
the Board consists of seven Directors as follows: three Independent 
Non-executive Directors, one non-Independent Non-executive 
Director, a Non-executive Chairman, and two Executive Directors, 
comprising the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. 
The biographical details of all of the Directors are given on page 27.
Strategic approach
The Board focuses upon the Group’s long-term objectives, strategic 
and policy issues and considers the management of key risks 
facing the Group. The Board is responsible for acquisitions and 
divestments, major capital expenditure projects and considering 
Group budgets and dividend policy. The Board also determines key 
appointments. The Board receives regular updates on shareholders’ 
views. 
The Board has established a calendar of business. This provides 
for the financial calendar, strategic planning, annual budgets and 
performance self-assessments, as well as the conduct of standing 
business. The calendar forms the basis for effective integration 
of business activities as between the Board and its principal 
Committees (see pages 29 and 30), which individually consider their 
own operating frameworks against the Board’s business programme. 
The Board has established a formal process for the annual evaluation 
of the performance of the Board, its committees and individual 
Directors. The evaluation process covered a range of issues such as 
Board processes, Board roles and responsibilities, Board agendas 
and committee processes. The Board and its committees were found 
to be operating effectively.
The Board plans to meet six times a year. During 2009, the Board 
met six times.
Set out below are details of the Directors’ attendance record at 
Board and Committee meetings in 2009.
The Chairman has responsibility for ensuring that agendas for Board 
meetings are set in advance. Board papers are issued to Directors 
sufficiently in advance of meetings to facilitate both informed debate 
and timely decisions. 
Non-executive review and performance 
appraisal
The Chairman holds meetings at least once per year with the 
Non-executive Directors without the Executive Directors being 
present. Led by the Senior Independent Director, the Non-executive 
Directors meet once per year without the Chairman present in order 
to appraise the performance of the Chairman. The Directors have 
wide ranging business experience, and no individual, or group of 
individuals, dominates the Board’s decision making.
The Board considers that Brian Mattingley, Michael Constantine and 
Amos Pickel satisfy the criteria of the Code to act as Independent 
Non-executive Directors. The Board is satisfied that, upon his 
appointment as Chairman, Richard Kilsby met the independence 
criteria of the Code. The other significant commitments of the 
Chairman during 2009 are detailed in his biography on page 27. 
The Board considers that Mr Kilsby’s other commitments do not

interfere with the discharge of his responsibilities to the Group and is 
satisfied that he makes sufficient time available to serve the Company 
effectively.
Reserved powers and delegation
A schedule of matters reserved to the Board has been adopted 
and its content is reviewed to align it with operational needs and 
the Board’s preference to monitor and, where appropriate, approve 
matters of substance to the Group as a whole. Senior executives 
have given written undertakings to ensure compliance within their 
business operations with the Board’s formal schedule of matters 
reserved to it for decision or approval. 
Division of responsibilities
The responsibilities of the Chairman are clearly and formally defined, 
with the Chairman being responsible for the effective operation of the 
Board as a whole and supporting key external relationships. 
Other issues
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary and the Company’s nominated advisers, who 
are responsible for ensuring that Board procedures are followed. 
Directors are able to seek independent professional advice, if 
required, at the Company’s expense provided that they have first 
notified their intention to do so. The appointment or removal of the 
Company Secretary is a matter for the Board as a whole.
The Board accepts that there should be a formal, rigorous and 
transparent procedure for the induction of new Directors, which has 
been formulated with the guidance of the Nominations Committee.
The opportunity to hold office as Non-executive Directors of other 
companies enables Directors of 888 to broaden their experience and 
knowledge, which will benefit the Company. Executive Directors may 
be allowed to accept Non-executive appointments with the Board’s 
prior permission, so long as these are not likely to lead to any conflict 
of interest. Executive Directors may be required to account for fees 
received from such other companies.
The Company has arranged insurance cover in respect of legal 
actions against its Directors. To the extent permitted by Gibraltar law, 
the Company also indemnifies the Directors. Neither the insurance 
nor the indemnity provides cover where a Director has acted 
fraudulently or dishonestly.
Re-election of Directors 
All Directors are subject to reappointment by shareholders at the 
first Annual General Meeting after their appointment, and thereafter, 
in accordance with the Articles of Association of the Company, at 
intervals of no more than three years. Gigi Levy and John Anderson 
were appointed as Directors (Mr Anderson for an initial period of 
three years) at the 2007 Annual General Meeting. Richard Kilsby, 
Shay Ben-YItzhak and Aviad Kobrine were appointed for a period 
of three years, following their reappointment by the shareholders 
at the 2008 Annual General Meeting. Michael Constantine, Brian 
Mattingley and Amos Pickel were appointed for a period of three 
years, following their reappointment by the shareholders at the 2009 
Annual General Meeting. 
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises three Independent Non-executive 
Directors: Brian Mattingley (Chair), Michael Constantine and 
Amos Pickel. The Board is satisfied that Brian Mattingley has 
sufficient recent and relevant financial experience to Chair the Audit 
Committee. Normally, by invitation, the Chairman, Chief Executive 
Officer and Chief Financial Officer and, where appropriate, the 
Internal Auditor and representatives of the Company’s external 
auditors attend the Audit Committee meetings. 
The Audit Committee’s terms of reference are available on request to 
the Company Secretary and are included on the Company’s website, 
www.888holdingsplc.com.
In summary, the Audit Committee assists the Board in discharging 
its responsibilities with regard to financial reporting, external and 
internal audits and controls, including reviewing 888’s annual financial 
statements, considering the scope of annual audit and the extent 
of non-audit work undertaken by external auditors, approving 888’s 
internal audit programme, advising on the appointment of external 
auditors and reviewing the effectiveness of internal control systems.
Nominations Committee 
The Nominations Committee comprises three Independent Non-
executive Directors, Michael Constantine (Chair), Brian Mattingley 
and Amos Pickel, as well as Richard Kilsby, Chairman. The 
Nominations Committee did not meet during 2009.
The Nominations Committee assists the Board in discharging 
its responsibilities relating to the composition of the Board. The 
Nominations Committee is responsible for reviewing, from time 
to time, the structure of the Board, determining succession plans 
for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and identifying and 
recommending suitable candidates for appointment as Directors. The 
Nominations Committee’s terms of reference are available on request 
to the Company Secretary and are included on the Company’s 
website, www.888holdingsplc.com.
Remuneration Committee
The Company’s Remuneration Committee comprises three 
Independent Non-executive Directors: Brian Mattingley (chair), 
Michael Constantine and Amos Pickel.

Corporate Governance 
continued
The Board has overall responsibility for determining the framework of 
Executive remuneration and its cost. It is required to take account of any 
recommendation made by the Remuneration Committee in determining 
the remuneration, benefits and employment packages of the Executive 
Directors and senior management and the fees of the Chairman.
The Remuneration Report, which outlines the Remuneration 
Committee’s work and details of Directors’ remuneration, is on pages 
31 to 38. The Remuneration Committee’s terms of reference are 
available on request to the Company Secretary and are included on 
the Company’s website, www.888holdingsplc.com.
Risk Management and Internal Control
The Directors acknowledge that they are responsible for the 
Company’s system of internal control, for setting policy on internal 
control and risk management, and for reviewing the effectiveness 
of internal control and risk management. It is management’s role to 
implement Board policies on risk and control, including reporting. 
The system of internal control is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can 
only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
The Board has delegated responsibility to the Audit Committee to 
review the appropriateness and adequacy of systems of internal 
control and risk management in relation to the financial reporting 
process on an ongoing basis and to make recommendations to the 
Board. The Company has an Internal Auditor who reports to the 
Audit Committee. 
888’s payment risk management team, based in Gibraltar, has 
developed stringent payment risk management and fraud control 
procedures. The team makes use of external and internal systems to 
manage the payment risks. Detailed procedures exist throughout the 
Company’s operations and compliance is monitored by operational 
management and the Internal Auditor.
The Directors periodically review the effectiveness of the Group’s 
systems of internal control and risk management. The review 
considers individual risk control responsibilities, reporting lines and 
qualitative assessments of residual risks. 
Relations with Shareholders and Key Financial 
Audiences
The Company maintains an active and regular dialogue with principal 
and institutional shareholders and sell-side analysts through a 
planned programme of investor relations and financial PR activity. The 
outcome of these meetings is reported to the Board. The programme 
includes formal presentations of full year and interim results, quarterly 
release of Interim Management Statements, analysts’ conference 
calls and periodic road shows.
Brian Mattingley, the Senior Independent Director, is available 
to shareholders to address any issues where contact with the 
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer is 
inappropriate or where such contact has failed to resolve the issue.
All shareholders are welcome to attend the 2010 Annual General 
Meeting and private investors are encouraged to take advantage of 
the opportunity given to ask questions. The Chairmen (or nominated 
members) of the Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees 
will attend the meeting and be available to answer questions.
Compliance with the Code Provisions
As 888 Holdings Public Limited Company is registered in Gibraltar, it 
is subject to compliance with Gibraltar statutory requirements and is 
not bound by the UK Combined Code. The main legislation relevant 
to companies in Gibraltar is the Gibraltar Companies Act, which is 
based on the UK Companies Act 1929. 888 Holdings Public Limited 
Company is in full compliance with the Gibraltar Companies Act.
Going Concern
After careful review of the Group’s budget for 2010, its medium-term 
plans, liquid resources and all relevant matters the Directors are 
confident that the Company and the Group have adequate financial 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. They have therefore continued to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements.
The principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group are 
disclosed on page 26.
Corporate Social Responsibility Statement
The Group’s Chief Executive Officer is the Director responsible for 
monitoring corporate social responsibility within 888. The Board 
receives periodic reports on the Group’s activities in this area 
from the Chief Executive Officer. Further details are set out in the 
Corporate Social Responsibility report on pages 22 to 25.
Community 
Sponsorship
888 is a sizeable employer with a visible presence in Gibraltar 
and enjoys a good relationship with the local community. During 
2009, the Group continued its policy of reinforcing this relationship 
by making contributions to a number of local causes, primarily 
educational. 
Charities
In 2009, the Group made donations totalling US$124,799 
(2008: US$107,821) to organizations promoting various social 
causes in Gibraltar and Israel.

In accordance with the Listing Rules, the Company presents its 
report on the remuneration of its Directors for the year ended 
31 December 2009. The Company is incorporated in Gibraltar and, 
therefore, is not required to comply with the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report requirements in Schedule 8 to the UK Large and Medium-
sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 
2008, but has chosen to prepare this Remuneration Report on the 
basis of those requirements, as appropriate.
The report sets out the structure and details of the remuneration 
of the Directors for the year ended 31 December 2009. It also 
describes the Board’s policy and approach to the Principles of Good 
Governance relating to Directors’ remuneration. BDO LLP and BDO 
Limited have audited the sections headed ‘Directors’ Remuneration 
Summary’ and ‘Directors’ Interests in Share Awards and Share 
Options’.
A resolution to approve the Remuneration Report is proposed, 
annually, to shareholders for approval. This Remuneration Report will 
be put to shareholder vote at the 2010 Annual General Meeting.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consists solely of independent 
Non-executive Directors, currently Brian Mattingley (Chair), Michael 
Constantine and Amos Pickel. Details of attendances at Committee 
meetings are contained in the statement on Corporate Governance 
on page 28. The Remuneration Committee has formal terms of 
reference (which are available on request in writing to the Company 
Secretary and on the Company’s website, www.888holdingsplc.
com).
Independent Advice
The Board intends that executive remuneration policies be both 
formal and transparent. It further acknowledges the importance of 
taking into consideration independent advice in setting remuneration 
policies and benefit levels. The Remuneration Committee has taken 
advice from KPMG Somekh Chaikin with regard to the structuring of 
awards under the share option plans. The Remuneration Committee 
also plans to seek advice from external consultants with regards to 
the appropriate amount and terms for future awards to the Executive 
Directors and such awards will be granted following the next meeting 
of the Remuneration Committee in May 2010.
Remuneration Policy
Executive Directors
Remuneration packages must be sufficient to attract, retain and 
motivate Directors of the calibre appropriate to a global business in 
a competitive environment. The Remuneration Committee is mindful 
that most of the Group’s competitors are not UK listed companies 
and takes this into account in determining appropriate remuneration 
levels. The components of the remuneration structure are set out 
below.
At least half of the total potential remuneration of the Chief Executive 
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer are represented by a variable 
element, dependent on the performance of the Group. The 
Remuneration Committee considers that these represent achievable 
and motivational levels of personal rewards commensurate with 
stipulated levels of corporate performance. 
The Remuneration Committee is mandated by the Board to satisfy 
itself that the level of the Directors’ and senior management’s 
remuneration is appropriate, having regard to pay and conditions 
throughout the rest of the sectors in which the Group operates. It 
will further satisfy itself that such remuneration aligns with the risks 
and rewards to shareholders. In this context the Remuneration 
Committee will regularly review individual and corporate performance 
targets. In the current volatile economic climate, executive leadership 
is more important than ever. The Remuneration Committee 
will continue to use careful and rigorous judgement to match 
remuneration to achievements. 
Non-executive Directors
The Chairman and the Non-executive Directors receive fees only, and 
are not eligible to participate in any bonus plan, pension plan, share 
plan, or long-term incentive plan of the Company. The Chairman and 
the Executive Directors determine the fees paid to the Non-executive 
Directors. The Chairman’s fees are determined by the Remuneration 
Committee.
Fees paid to the Non-executive Directors are set by reference to an 
assessment of the time commitment and responsibility associated 
with each role. Levels take account of additional demands placed 
upon individual Non-executive Directors by virtue of their holding 
particular offices, such as Committee Chairman and/or Deputy 
Chairman, and travel time to Board meetings and the Group’s 
headquarters in Gibraltar. The fees paid to each Non-executive 
Director during 2009 are disclosed in the Directors’ remuneration 
summary on page 34.
Remuneration Structure
Base Salary and Benefits
The Executive Directors’ base salaries are subject to annual review. 
Given market conditions, there were no salary reviews in 2009. 
The Group’s functional currency is USD and the Chief Executive’s 
income, performance and expenses are more closely aligned with 
USD than GBP . Accordingly, given currency movement in the USD 
GBP exchange rate since he was employed Gigi Levy’s salary 
was converted in January 2009 from GBP to USD756,000. Aviad 
Kobrine’s salary for 2009 was maintained at GBP285,000*. Benefits 
provided to executive Directors include a car (in the case of Gigi 
Levy) and a car allowance (in the case of Aviad Kobrine) and health, 
disability and life insurance. 
* Part of which is paid by the Company and part of which by 
Cassava Enterprises (Gibraltar) Limited.

Remuneration Report

Annual Cash Bonus
Gigi Levy and Aviad Kobrine are entitled to an annual cash bonus 
of up to 120% of annualised salary, subject to the achievement of 
predetermined targets. The Remuneration Committee sets bonus 
targets and levels of eligibility each year. For the 2009 financial year, 
the performance target was 20% growth in revenue compared to 
2008 and provided that the adjusted EBITDA margin for 2008 was 
maintained. The payout levels were set at 50% of base salary for 80% 
performance, increasing on a linear basis up to 100% where targets 
were fully satisfied. In the event  that revenue growth exceeded 20%, the 
percentage bonus entitlement increased by 4% for every 1% additional 
revenue growth, up to a maximum bonus entitlement of 120%.
Notwithstanding that the performance targets were not met in 
2009, the Remuneration Committee made a discretionary bonus 
payment of 35% of base salary. This payment took account of both 
the unilateral decision by the Executive Directors to waive 25% of 
the bonuses to which they were entitled in 2008 given the economic 
environment at that time together with the hard work and dedication 
of the Executive Directors in a particularly difficult economic year.
Additionally, the performance conditions attaching to the share award 
granted to Gigi Levy in 2006, vesting of which was subject to the 
same conditions as for his annual cash bonus, were not met for the 
financial year 2009 and the portion of the award capable of vesting in 
2010 lapsed.
Pensions
Gigi Levy and Aviad Kobrine are each entitled to a cash payment in 
lieu of an annual contribution to their personal pension schemes of 
15% of their respective base salaries. 
Long-Term Incentives 
The Company has two employee share incentive plans: (i) the 888 
All-Employee Share Plan, and (ii) the 888 Long-term Incentive Plan. 
The Company currently only grants awards under the 888 All-
Employee Plan. 
Performance-dependent options and awards were granted under the 
888 All-Employee Plan to the Executive Directors on 14 September 
2006, 30 April 2007 and 8 April 2008. Details of these awards and 
options are set out on pages 36 to 37.
888 All-Employee Share Plan
All employees, exclusive consultants and Executive Directors of the 
Group who are not within six months of their normal retirement age 
are eligible to participate in the 888 All-Employee Share Plan at the 
discretion of the Remuneration Committee. 
Awards under the 888 All-Employee Share Plan can either be 
granted for no consideration (or with a nil exercise price for options) 
or at an exercise price that will normally be no less than the market 
value of an Ordinary Share at the time of grant or average share 
price during a period as determined by the Remuneration Committee 
at time of grant. In countries where an award or option involving 
real shares is not appropriate or feasible for legal, regulatory or tax 
reasons, a phantom award may be used.
The maximum number of Ordinary Shares that an eligible employee 
may acquire pursuant to share awards or options granted to him 
in any calendar year under the 888 All-Employee Share Plan and 
the 888 Long-term Incentive Plan may not have an aggregate 
market value, as measured at the date of grant, exceeding 200% 
of his annual base salary or such higher limit as the Remuneration 
Committee may determine is appropriate in any individual 
case. Awards vest over a fixed period of up to four years. The 
Remuneration Committee may determine that the vesting and 
release or exercise of share awards and options under the 888 All-
Employee Share Plan are subject to performance conditions imposed 
at the time of grant. 
The performance conditions which determine the vesting of the 
options and awards granted on 14 September 2006, 30 April 2007 
and 8 April 2008 to Executive Directors are driven solely by financial 
performance, not by comparison to an external peer group. Options 
and awards vest in portions on a yearly basis over a period of four 
consecutive years and are subject to target growth as determined by 
the Remuneration Committee.
The performance condition related to the portion of all awards capable 
of vesting in 2010 was such that TOI in 2009 must grow by 5% over 
financial year 2008 in order for 100% of the portion of the awards due 
to vest in 2010 in respect of 2009 performance subject to maintaining 
adjusted EPS (excluding share benefit charges, interest receivable and 
foreign currency impact) at the same level as 2008. Fifty per cent of 
the portion vests upon achievement of 50% of the target TOI growth 
rate and increases on a linear basis up to 100% upon achievement 
of 100% of the target TOI growth. If the threshold of 50% of target 
TOI growth rate is not met, the portion of the award due to vest 
in 2010 lapses. Performance conditions may be amended by the 
Remuneration Committee if circumstances which prevailed at the date 
of grant have subsequently changed and are no longer considered 
a fair measure of performance provided that the Remuneration 
Committee is satisfied that the amended performance conditions are 
consistent with and no less demanding to satisfy than the original 
conditions. Any such amendment would be reported and explained in 
the remuneration report. The performance conditions were not fulfilled 
in 2009 and the awards capable of vesting in 2010 lapsed.

17555 30/03/2010 Proof 11
The Remuneration Committee has sought advice from external 
consultants with regards to the appropriate amount and terms for 
future awards and such awards will be granted following the next 
meeting of the Remuneration Committee in May 2010. 
888 Long-term Incentive Plan
All employees and Executive Directors of the Group who are not 
within six months of their normal retirement age are eligible to 
participate in the 888 Long-term Incentive Plan at the discretion 
of the Remuneration Committee. As at the date of this report, no 
awards have been granted pursuant to the 888 Long-term Incentive 
Plan. As set out above, 888 has given long-term incentive awards to 
Executive Directors under the 888 All Employee Plan. 
Scheme Limits 
Awards and options granted under the 888 All-Employee Share Plan 
and the 888 Long-term Incentive Plan may be satisfied through the 
issue of new shares. It is intended that grants of options and awards 
are to be planned so as not to exceed 5% of the issued Ordinary 
Share capital in any rolling ten year period for the 888 Long-term 
Incentive Plan, and 10% of the issued Ordinary Share capital in any 
rolling ten year period for the 888 All-Employee Share Plan and the 
888 Long-term Incentive Plan, in the aggregate. The Committee 
intends to have regard to appropriate annual flow-rates so as to 
ensure that these limits are not breached.
Employee Trusts
The Company has established two Trusts to further the interests 
of the Company, its subsidiaries and shareholders by providing 
share incentives to employees (including Executive Directors) of any 
Group company to enable the Group to attract, retain and motivate 
employees.
The 888 IPO Share Award Trust and the 888 Holdings plc Share Plan 
Trust were created pursuant to Trust Deeds dated 14 September 
2005. The 888 IPO Share Award Trust is operated in connection with 
the grant of share awards and nil cost options to employees of the 
Group at the time of the IPO. These trusts currently hold 156,441 
Ordinary Shares in the Company.
Director Appointments — Service Contracts 
and Directors’ Fees
Executive Directors
It is the Company’s policy that each Executive Director’s service 
agreement is terminable on no more than 12 months’ written 
notice by either party. Each Executive Director’s employment 
can be terminated by making a payment equal to the salary and 
pension contributions and the value of other contractual benefits 
due to the Executive Director in lieu of any unexpired notice 
period. The Executive Directors continue to be entitled to be paid 
a bonus during any unexpired part of the notice period even if the 
employment is terminated by making payment in lieu of notice. 
Share Awards granted under the 888 All-Employee Share Plan to 
Gigi Levy and Aviad Kobrine pursuant to their service agreements, 
on 14 September 2006, and 29 September and 4 October 2005 
respectively, continue to vest during any unexpired part of the notice 
period and they shall be treated as a ‘good leaver’ under the terms of 
the 888 All-Employee Share Plan where their employment has been 
terminated by making a payment in lieu of notice. No other benefits 
upon termination of employment are payable. An Executive Director’s 
entitlement to share awards and share options under the 888 All-
Employee Plan on termination of employment will be governed by 
the terms of that plan (and in the case of the initial awards made to 
Gigi Levy and Aviad Kobrine by the relevant provisions of their service 
agreements) as discussed above.

Shareholder Agreements and Consent 
Requirements
There are no known arrangements under which financial rights are 
held by a person other than the holder of the shares.
A Relationship Agreement governing the relationship between the 
above Principal Shareholder Trusts and the Company was entered 
into in connection with the Company’s flotation. The Relationship 
Agreement provides that all transactions between the Group and 
the Principal Shareholder Trusts will be on a normal business basis, 
that the Group will be allowed to carry on business independently 
of them and that the Principal Shareholder Trusts will not cause the 
Company to contravene the Combined Code unless required by 
law or as contemplated in the Relationship Agreement. It further 
provides that each of the Principal Shareholder Trusts will not solicit 
Group employees without consent, that only Independent Directors 
can vote on proposals to amend the Relationship Agreement, that 
the Principal Shareholder Trusts will consult the Group prior to 
disposing of a significant number of shares in order to maintain an 
orderly market and shall not disclose confidential information unless 
required to do so or having first received the Company’s consent. 
The Relationship Agreement also includes restrictions on the 
Principal Shareholder Trusts power to appoint Directors and includes 
obligations on the trusts to ensure that the majority of the Board, 
excluding the Chairman, is independent. The Principal Shareholder 
Trusts can nominate a Non-executive Director for appointment to the 
Board. In the event that this right is exercised and it results in fewer 
than half the Board (excluding the Chairman of the Board) being 
Independent Directors, such appointment shall only become effective 
upon the appointment to the Board of an additional Independent 
Director acceptable to the Nominations Committee. Such restrictions 
and obligations apply in respect of the E Shaked Shares Trust and
O Shaked Shares Trust whilst they collectively hold not less than 
7.5% of the issued share capital of 888, and in respect of the 
Ben-Yitzhak Family Shares Trust whilst it individually holds not less 
than 7.5% of the issued share capital of 888.
Change of Control
Other than the Group’s gaming licences where change of control is 
subject to prior consent, there are no contracts to which the Group 
is a party which would allow the counterparty to terminate or alter 
those contractual arrangements in the event of a change of control of 
the Group.
Charitable Contributions
Contributions for charitable purposes were made during the year 
amounting to US$124,799 (2008: US$107,821).
Directors’ Responsibility Statement
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records 
which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company, for safeguarding the assets, for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other 
irregularities and for the preparation of a Directors’ report which 
complies with the Gibraltar Companies (Accounts) Act 1999, the 
Gibraltar Companies (Consolidated Accounts) Act 1999 and the 
Gibraltar Companies Act.
Financial statements are published on the Group’s website in 
accordance with legislation in the UK governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements, which may vary from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity of the 
Group’s website is the responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ 
responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity of the financial 
statements contained therein.
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the 
financial statements. The Directors are required to prepare financial 
statements for the Group in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and have also chosen to prepare 
financial statements for the Company in accordance with IFRSs.
Corporate Governance
The corporate governance statement is on pages 28 to 30 and is 
incorporated in this Directors’ Report by reference.

Group and Parent Company Financial 
Statements
Company law requires the Directors to prepare such financial 
statements in accordance with the Gibraltar Companies (Accounts) 
Act 1999, the Gibraltar Companies (Consolidated Accounts) Act 
1999 and the Gibraltar Companies Act.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial 
statements present fairly for each financial year the Group and 
Company’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. 
This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, 
other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and 
recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set 
out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework 
for the preparation and presentation of financial statements’. In 
virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by 
compliance with all applicable IFRSs. A fair presentation also requires 
the Directors to:
l consistently select and apply appropriate accounting policies;
l present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; and
l provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable members to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance.
We confirm, to the best of our knowledge:
(a) the financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the Group and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
(b) the Enhanced Business Review’, includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the position 
of the Group and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face.
Auditors
A resolution for the reappointment of BDO LLP and BDO Limited 
as auditors of the Company will be proposed at the 2010 Annual 
General Meeting.
During the year ended 31 December 2009 BDO LLP were appointed 
auditors for the purposes of the Company preparing financial 
statements as required pursuant to the Listing Rules of the UK Listing 
Authority. BDO Limited have been appointed to act as auditors for 
the purposes of issuing an audit report pursuant to Section 10 of 
the Gibraltar Companies (Accounts) Act 1999 to be filed with the 
Gibraltar Companies Registry.

Independent Auditors’ Report 
to the Shareholders of 888 Holdings plc
We have audited the financial statements (‘the financial statements’) 
of 888 Holdings plc for the year ended 31 December 2009 which 
comprise the Group income statement, the Group and Parent 
Company balance sheets, the Group and Parent Company 
statements of changes in equity, Group and Parent Company 
statements of cash flow, Group and Parent Company statements 
of comprehensive income and the related notes. These financial 
statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set 
out therein. We have also audited the information in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and 
auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the 
Remuneration Report and the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of 
the Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance with relevant 
legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). 888 Holdings Plc has complied with the 
requirements of rules 9.8.6 and 9.8.8 of the Listing Rules of the UK 
Financial Services Authority and in accordance with Section 421 
of the UK Companies Act 2006 in preparing its Annual Report, as 
if it was incorporated in the United Kingdom. As auditors, we have 
agreed that our responsibilities in relation to the Annual Report will be 
those as set out below.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements 
give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Gibraltar Companies 
(Consolidated Accounts) Act 1999, the Gibraltar Companies 
(Accounts) Act 1999 and the Gibraltar Companies Act and the part of 
the Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared 
in accordance with Section 421 of the UK Companies Act 2006. We 
also report to you whether in our opinion, the information disclosed 
in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements, 
if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have 
not received all the information and explanations we require for our 
audit, or if information specified by the Listing Rules and Gibraltar 
legislation regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is 
not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement set out in 
the Directors’ Report reflects the Company’s compliance with the 
nine provisions of the 2008 Combined Code specified for our review 
by the Listing Rules, and we report if it does not. We are not required 
to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover 
all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control 
procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report 
and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial 
statements. This other information comprises only the Directors’ 
Report, the unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report, 
the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Business Review, 
the Enhanced Business Review, Risk Report, Corporate and Social 
Responsibility Report and the Corporate Governance Statement. 
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of 
any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the 
financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other 
information.
Our report has been prepared pursuant to the terms of our 
engagement letter and for no other purpose. No person is entitled 
to rely on this report unless such a person is a person entitled to rely 
upon this report by virtue of the terms of our engagement letter or 
has been expressly authorised to do so by our prior written consent. 
Save as above, we do not accept responsibility for this report to 
any other person or for any other purpose and we hereby expressly 
disclaim any and all such liability.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant 
to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the 
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited. It also 
includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements 
made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, 
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed.

We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary in 
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements and the part of the 
Remuneration Report to be audited are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. 
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the 
presentation of information in the financial statements and the part of 
the Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
l  the financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the state of the 
Group’s and the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2009 and 
of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
l  the financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Gibraltar Companies (Consolidated 
Accounts) Act 1999, the Gibraltar Companies (Accounts) Act 
1999 and the Gibraltar Companies Act; 
l  the part of the Remuneration Report described as having been 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with Section 
421 of the UK Companies Act 2006;
l  the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with 
the financial statements; and
l  we have nothing to report to you in respect of our responsibility 
set out above in relation to the Company keeping proper 
accounting records and the auditors receiving information and 
explanations for our audit and disclosures regarding Directors’ 
remuneration and other transactions.
Emphasis of Matter — Regulatory Issues
In forming our opinion, which is not qualified, we have considered 
the adequacy of, and draw attention to, the disclosures made in 
note 24(c) to the financial statements concerning the residual risk 
of an adverse impact arising from the Group having had customers 
in the US prior to the enactment of the Unlawful Internet Gambling 
Enforcement Act.
Note 24(c) includes a statement that the Board has not been able 
to identify reliably at this stage what, if any, liability may arise and 
accordingly no provision has been made.

and endorsed for use by companies listed on an EU regulated market.
The significant accounting policies applied in the financial statements of the Group in the prior years are applied consistently in these

The financial statements are presented in thousands of US dollars (US$’000) because that is the currency the Group primarily operates in.
The consolidated financial statements comply with the Gibraltar Companies (Accounts) Act 1999, the Gibraltar Companies (Consolidated 
Accounts) Act 1999 and the Gibraltar Companies Act.
The following standards and interpretations, issued by the IASB or the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC), 
are also effective for the first time in the current financial year and have been adopted by the Group with no significant impact on its 
consolidated results or financial position.

business use of technology, software, operations, e-payments and advanced marketing services, through the provision of offline/
online marketing, management of affiliates, SEO, CRM and business analytics.

Critical accounting policies, estimates and judgements
The preparation of consolidated financial statements under IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and judgements that affect the 
application of policies and reported amounts. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience 
and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may 
differ from these estimates.
Included in this note are accounting policies which cover areas that the Directors consider require estimates and assumptions which 
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. These 
policies together with references to the related notes to the financial statements can be found below:

2 Significant accounting policies continued
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. The subsidiaries are companies 
controlled by 888 Holdings Public Limited Company. Control exists where the Company has the power to govern the financial and 
operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date the parent gained 
control until such time as control ceases. 
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements using the purchase method of 
accounting. On the date of the acquisition, the assets and liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values and any excess of the 
fair value of the consideration over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Inter-company transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the Parent Company and using consistent 
accounting policies.
Total Revenue 
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably 
measured. Revenue is recognised in the accounting periods in which the transactions occurred.
Total Revenue consists of revenue from online gaming and revenue generated from processing customers’ cross currency deposits and 
withdrawals. It comprises:
Casino
Casino winnings that are the differences between the amounts of bets placed by customers less amounts won by customers.
Poker
Ring games:  Rake, which is the commission charged from each winning hand played.
Tournaments:  Entry fees charged for participation in Poker tournaments are recognised when the tournament has concluded.
Emerging Offerings 
 Revenue from Emerging Offerings is defined as winnings from Sportsbook activity and fees charged for participation in
Bingo games.
Casino winnings, revenues from the Poker business and Emerging Offerings are stated after deduction of certain bonuses
granted to customers.
In the case of white label activity, revenue is the net commission charged.
Other operating income 
Other operating income consists mainly of revenue generated from processing customers’ cross currency deposits and withdrawals.
Foreign currency 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-US dollar currencies are translated into US dollar equivalents using year end spot 
foreign exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. 
Exchange rate differences on foreign currency transactions are included in administrative expenses.
The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different from US dollars are translated into the 
presentation currency as follows:
(i)   monetary assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
(ii)  income and expenses for each income statement are translated at an average exchange rate (unless this average is not a 
reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and 
expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions); and
(iii)  exchange rate differences on translation of Group entities that have functional currencies different from US dollars are included in 
administrative expenses.

Taxation
The tax expense represents tax payable for the year based on currently applicable tax rates.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet differs from its tax 
base. It is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where 
it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the difference can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised 
if the temporary differences arise from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and 
liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. The amount of the asset or liability is determined 
using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred 
tax liabilities/assets are settled/recovered. 
Intangible assets
Acquisitions
Identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value 
at the acquisition date. The identified intangibles are amortised over the useful economic life of the assets. For the acquisition completed 
during the year 2007, the useful economic life of the intangible assets acquired is estimated to be between three months and four years. 
For the 2009 acquisition, the useful economic life of the intangible assets acquired is estimated to be eighteen months with the exception 
of trade names, which have an indefinite useful economic life. Intangible assets are reviewed annually for evidence of impairment. Any 
impairment in carrying value is charged to the consolidated income statement.
Internally generated intangible assets
Expenditure incurred on development activities is capitalised only when the expenditure will lead to new or substantially improved products 
or processes, the products or processes are technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete 
development. All other development expenditure is expensed. Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only 
where it clearly increases the economic benefits to be derived from the asset to which it relates. The Group estimates the useful life of 
these assets as between 3 and 5 years.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over the interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities acquired. Cost comprises the fair value of any assets transferred, liabilities assumed and equity instruments 
issued, plus any direct costs of acquisition.
Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the consolidated income statement. 
Where the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceed the fair value of consideration paid, the excess is 
credited in full to the consolidated income statement on the acquisition.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historic cost less accumulated depreciation. Carrying amounts are reviewed at each balance 
sheet date for impairment.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, at annual rates estimated to write off the cost of the assets less their estimated 
residual values over their expected useful lives. The annual depreciation rates are as follows: 
IT equipment      33%
Office furniture and equipment      7–15%
Motor vehicles      15%
Leasehold improvements   Over the shorter of the term of the lease or useful lives
Impairment of non-financial assets
Impairment tests on goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful economic lives are undertaken annually on 31 December, 
and where applicable an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement. Other non-financial assets are subject to 
impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Where the 
carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell), the asset is 
written down accordingly.

17555 30/03/2010 Proof 11
53
2 Significant accounting policies continued
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on the asset’s cash 
generating unit (i.e. the lowest Group of assets in which the asset belongs for which there are separately identifiable cash flows).
Financial instruments
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised at fair value and carried at amortised cost and principally comprise amounts due from credit card 
companies and from e-payment companies. An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer 
probable. Bad debts are written off when there is objective evidence that the full amount may not be collected.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash comprises cash in hand and balances with banks. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to known amounts of cash. They include short-term deposits originally purchased with maturities of three months 
or less. 
Equity
Equity issued by the Company is recorded as the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised at fair value and carried at amortised cost.
Liabilities to customers
Liabilities to customers comprises the amounts that are credited to customers’ bankroll (the Group’s electronic ‘wallet’), including 
provision for bonuses granted by the Group, less management fees and charges applied to customer accounts, along with full 
provision for jackpots. These amounts are repayable on demand in accordance with the applicable terms and conditions.
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets comprise non-derivative financial assets not included in any of the above financial asset categories 
and comprise principally the Group’s investments in entities not qualifying as subsidiaries. They are carried at fair value with 
changes in fair value recognised directly in a separate component of equity. Where there is a significant decline in the fair value of an 
available-for-sale financial asset the full amount of the impairment, including any amount previously charged to equity, is recognised 
in the income statement. On disposal of an available-for-sale asset any balance within equity is transferred to the income statement.
Chargebacks 
The cost of chargebacks is included in operating expenses.
Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases wherever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
Group. All other leases are classified as operating leases and rentals payable are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term 
of the lease.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present or constructive obligation as a result of a past event from which it is probable that 
it will result in an outflow of economic benefits that can be reasonably estimated.

Segment information 
Segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The chief 
operating decision maker has been identified on the management team including the Chief Execute Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. 
These segments are:
l  B2C (Business to Customer) Casino, Poker and Emerging Offering which mainly comprises Bingo, 888’s Sportsbook, Live dealer 
offering and games; and
l  B2B (Business to Business) which offers Total Gaming Services under the Dragonfish trading brand. Dragonfish offers to its business 
partners use of technology, software, operations, E-payments and advances marketing services, through the provision of offline/
online marketing, management of affiliates, SEO, CRM and business analytics.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. In the case of interim dividends this is when paid. In the case of final 
dividends, this is when approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Share-based payments
Where the Company grants its employees or contractors shares, nil priced options or market value options, the fair value at the date of 
grant is charged to the income statement over the vesting period. Non-market performance conditions are taken into account by adjusting 
the number of instruments expected to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the 
vesting period is based on the number of instruments that eventually vest.

Severance pay liability — Israel
The Group’s employees in Israel are eligible to receive certain benefits from the Group in certain defined circumstances. As such the Group 
operates a defined benefit severance pay plan which requires contributions to be made to separately administrated funds. 
The method used to determine the current service cost and the present value of the defined benefit obligation, according to IAS 19 
‘Employee Benefits’ is the Projected Unit Credit actuarial cost method. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised by the Group using the 
equity method.
The following table summarises the employee benefits figures as included in the Group’s financial statements for 2009 and 2008,

the grandfathering of tax-exempt benefits in respect of existing tax-exempt companies will extend up to 31 December 2010.  Domestic 
corporate tax in Gibraltar is 22% (2009/2010) 27% (2008/2009). Gibraltar’s Chief Minister has announced further reductions in anticipation 
of the introduction of a flat tax rate of 10% in 2010. A consultation is in place with respect to the new tax regime in Gibraltar but it is widely 
anticipated, following Government indications that it is expected the new rules will be in place by July 2010 but not come into effect until 
January 2011.
Israel — 888 have entered into certain transfer pricing agreements with the Israeli Income Tax Commissioner. The agreement in respect 
of Random Logic Limited is effective until the end of 2010. The agreement in respect of the Israeli branch of Intersafe Global Limited was 
effective until the end of 2007. Accordingly, the Group has discontinued the use of this branch. Domestic corporate tax in Israel in 2009 is 
26% (2008: 27%) and is scheduled to go down to 25% from 2010 and onwards.
UK — 888’s subsidiary in the UK pays corporate tax in the UK at the applicable rate of 28% (2008: 28%).

8 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share from continuing operations
Basic earnings per share have been calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number 
of shares in issue during the year.
Diluted earnings per share
In accordance with IAS 33, ‘Earnings per share’, the weighted average number of shares for diluted earnings per share takes into account 
all potentially dilutive shares and share options granted, which are not included in the number of shares for basic earnings per share. In 
addition, certain employee options have also been excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their exercise price is greater than the 
weighted average share price during the year and it would not be advantageous for the holders to exercise the option. The number of 
options excluded from the diluted EPS calculation is 2,124,274 (2008: 3,117,110).

10  Acquisitions made during the year — Wink Bingo business
On 31 December 2009 the Group acquired the trade and assets comprising the online Wink Bingo business of Daub Limited (‘Wink Bingo 
Business’) for an all cash consideration. 
In calculating the goodwill arising on acquisition, the fair value of the net assets of the Wink Bingo business was valued by a professional 
valuation firm and recognised in accordance with IFRS 3 and adjustments from book value have been made where necessary. These 
adjustments are summarized as follows:
     Book Value on  Fair value

 See note 11.
The fair value relates to the recognition of customer relationship (US$1,626,000) and trade names intangible assets (US$789,000) acquired 
as part of the acquisition. The customer relationship intangible asset is being amortised over its estimated useful economic life of 18 
months. Trade names intangible assets are subject to an annual impairment review. All intangible assets on acquisition have been identified 
and fair valued. The remaining goodwill represents the access to future trade associated with the operation of the Wink Bingo Business.

 The Directors estimate that an earn-out payment of US$3.8 million is likely to become payable in the future based on projected 
 performance during the period from April 2010 to March 2011. The earn-out payment is payable in cash by 31 May 2011.
Had the business been owned for the entire year, the revenue and operating profit for 2009 would have been $21.0 million and $3.5 million 
respectively. Given that the business was acquired on 31 December 2009 there has been no actual contribution to revenue or operating 
profit during the year.

Acquired intangible assets and goodwill
Online Bingo Business
Intangible assets and goodwill are associated with the cash generating online Bingo business unit acquired during May 2007 of the online 
Bingo business of Globalcom Limited and the acquisition of the Wink Bingo business in 2009 (see note 10). The intangible assets include 
customer lists, royalty agreements, trade names and software. These intangibles, except for trade names, are being amortised over their 
estimated useful economic lives of up to four years. On acquisition, the intangible assets have been identified and valued using third party 
professional valuers. During the year the Group also acquired an internet domain name which is used in its online Bingo business for a total 
cash consideration of US$100,000. With the exception of the US$500,000 acquisition in the prior year, all of the goodwill relates to the 
bingo cash generating unit. All of the income streams generated from the bingo business acquisitions have been treated as a single cash 
generating unit as the risks and rewards associated with those income streams are deemed to be sufficiently similar.
At the year end, the carrying value-in-use was determined by discounting the expected future cash flows of the online Bingo cash 
generating unit to their present value. The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations were those regarding discount rate and 
growth rates of the business. The Directors estimate discount rates that reflect the current market assessment of the time value of money 
and risks appropriate to the online Bingo business. The discount rate that is considered by the Directors to be appropriate is 12% (2008: 
12%) being the Group’s specific weighted average cost of capital which also applies to the online Bingo cash generating unit.
In estimating the future cash flows the Group has used conservative estimates in respect of revenues generated and costs incurred. 
Growth rates of the online Bingo business are based on past experience and projections of future changes in the online gaming market, 
taking into account external sources of information such as analysts’ research reports. These suggest that Bingo is expected to 
demonstrate year on year growth. The Group has used lower and declining growth rates in estimating the future cash flows conservatively 
reflecting the current uncertainties about the medium-term global economic outlook. The Directors have used forecasts for the next five 
years of the expected cash flows, of which the first year is based on the Group’s current approved budget.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
11 Intangible assets continued
An annual growth rate of 2% (2008: 4%) was used for 2010, 2% for 2011 (2008: 2%), and nil for 2012–2014 (2008: nil). Following year 
five, the Group extrapolates cash flows in perpetuity, using an estimated conservative growth rate of 1% (2008: 1%), which is lower than 
the forecasted long-term growth rate of the UK economy. Marketing costs associated with the Bingo cash generating unit were projected 
as a fixed percentage of revenues. All other operational costs are forecasted as percentage of revenue, such percentage increased 
conservatively by 10% (2008: 10%) in each of the five year periods to 2014, over and above the level of growth in revenues.
The Directors are not aware at this time of any need to change their key assumptions on which they have based their determination of 
the recoverable amount of the goodwill which would cause its carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount. In fact, although such 
movements are not expected to arise, neither a 1% decrease in the growth rate in each of the next three years nor a 5% increase in the 
discount rate would have led to an impairment of the acquired intangible assets and goodwill in the current year.
Internet domain name
During the prior year the Group acquired an internet domain name based business which is used to generate traffic into the Group’s 
various web sites. Consideration of $US513,000 was paid in the prior year. 
The Directors have performed a valuation of the intangible asset acquired. The Directors took into account the following factors, amongst 
other, in determining the fair value of this intangible asset:
l   Domain’s ranking with search engines
l   Traffic ranking as a measure of popularity
l   Number of unique visitors to the site
l   Number of links pointing to the domain
The Directors concluded that the fair value that should be assigned to the intangible asset is of US$13,000 whilst the remainder of 
US$500,000 is to be recognised as goodwill (given that trade balances acquired were incidental). No further IFRS 3 disclosures have been 
given on the grounds of materiality.
Yearly impairment review
The Group regularly monitors the carrying value of its acquired intangible assets and goodwill, or when such events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that these may be impaired. The result of the review, undertaken as at 31 December 2009, was that no impairment 
needs to be recognised and the carrying value of the acquired intangible assets and goodwill is considered appropriate.
Internally generated intangible assets
The Group has put in place processes and procedures which enable it to ascertain technological feasibility before development costs 
are incurred and therefore be in a position to capitalise costs incurred after that point. Such expenditure is only capitalised when the 
development cost meets the definition of an intangible asset and the recognition criteria as set out in IAS 38 ‘Intangible assets’. 
The Group estimates the useful life of these assets as between 3 and 5 years. These assets are subject to impairment test wherever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable on the same basis as described above for 
acquired intangible assets. At 31 December 2009 no impairment needs to be recognised and the carrying value of internally generated 
assets is considered appropriate.

20 Share-based payment
Prior to flotation, the Company adopted two equity-settled employee share incentive plans — the 888 All-Employee Share Plan and the 
Long-term Incentive Plan. Awards were granted under the 888 All-Employee Share Plan conditional upon flotation. The 888 All-Employee 
Share Plan is open to all employees and Executive Directors of the Group who are not within six months of their normal retirement age at 
the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. Awards under this scheme will vest in instalments over a fixed period of up to four years.
The Company grants awards to certain Executive Directors and members of its senior management. These awards are subject to 
performance conditions imposed by the Remuneration Committee at the dates of grant.

The Monte Carlo model takes into account all the minimum requirements set by IFRS 2 such as: the exercise price of the option, the 
current price of the underlying share, the expected volatility of the price of the underlying share, the expected dividend on the underlying 
share, the expected term of the option both contractual term and based on employees’ expected behaviour and the risk-free interest rate 
for the expected term of the option.
In accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards a charge to the income statement in respect of any shares or options 
granted under the above schemes will be recognised and spread over the vesting period of the shares or options based on the fair value of 
the shares or options at the date at grant, adjusted for changes in vesting conditions at each balance sheet date. This charge has no cash 
impact.

23 Financial risk management 
The Group is exposed through its operations to risks that arise from use of its financial instruments. Policies and procedures for managing 
these risks are set by the Board following recommendations from the Chief Financial Officer. The Board reviews the effectiveness of these 
procedures and, if required, approves specific policies and procedures in order to mitigate these risks. 
The main financial instruments used by the Group, on which financial risk arises, are as follows:
l   Cash and cash equivalents
l   Restricted cash
l   Trade and other receivables
l   Available-for-sale financial assets
l   Trade and other payables
l   Liabilities to customers
l   Contingent consideration on acquisition

Capital
The capital employed by the Group is composed of equity attributable to shareholders. The primary objective of the Group is maximizing 
shareholders’ value, which, from the capital perspective, is achieved by maintaining the capital structure most suited to the Group’s size, 
strategy, and underlying business risk. Other than disclosed elsewhere in note 24, there are no demands or restrictions on the Group’s 
capital.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
23 Financial risk management continued
The main financial risk areas are as follows:
Credit risk
Trade receivables
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to trade receivables who are the Group’s payment service providers (‘PSP’). These are third 
party companies that facilitate deposits and withdrawals of funds to and from customers’ virtual wallet with the Group. These are mainly 
intermediaries that transact on behalf of the main credit card companies. 
The risk is that a PSP would fail to discharge its obligation with regard to the balance owed to the Group.
The Group reduces this credit risk by:
l  Monitoring those balances on a regular basis.
l  Arranging for the shortest possible cash settlement intervals. 
l  Replacing rolling reserve requirements, where they exist, with a Letter of Credit by a reputable financial institution.
l  Ensuring a new PSP is only contracted following various due diligence and ‘Know Your Customer’ procedures.
l  Ensuring policies are in place to reduce dependency on any specific PSP .
The Group believes that based on the above and on extensive past experience, the PSP receivables are of good credit quality and there is 
no requirement to provide for any potential bad debts arising from a PSP failing to discharge its obligation. None of the balances owed by 
the various PSP are overdue or impaired.
An additional credit risk the Group faces relates to customers disputing charges made to their credit cards (‘chargebacks’) or any other 
funding method they have used in respect of the services provided by the Group. Customers may fail to fulfil their obligation to pay which 
will result in funds not being collected. These chargebacks and uncollected deposits, when occurring, will be deducted at source by the 
PSPs from any amount due to the Group. As such the Group provides for these eventualities by way of a provision based on analysis 
of past transactions. This provision is netted off from the trade receivables balance and at 31 December 2009 was $1,586,000 (2008: 
$1,070,000). 
The Group’s in-house Fraud and Risk Management department carefully monitors deposits and withdrawals by following prevention and 
verification procedures using internally developed bespoke systems integrated with commercially available third party measures. 
Cash and cash equivalents
The Group controls its cash position out of its Gibraltar headquarters. Subsidiaries in its other locations (Israel, Antigua and London) 
maintain minimum cash balances which are deemed required for their operations.
Cash settlement proceeds from PSPs, as described above, are paid into bank accounts controlled by the Treasury function in Gibraltar.
The Group segregates funds due to customers and holds these funds in separate bank accounts. These funds are not used to fund 
activity other than that directly related to customers.
The Group maintains its funds with highly reputable financial institutions and will not hold funds with financial institutions with low 
credit rating.
The Group maintains its cash reserve in highly liquid deposits and regularly monitors rates in order to maximize yield.

Restricted cash
Restricted cash is mainly attributed to a deposit in respect of the Group’s obligation with the developer of the offices of its subsidiary 
in Israel.
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk by type of financial instrument is summarized below:

    108,305 108,305 113,590 113,590
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk exists in the case where the Group will encounter difficulties in meeting its financial obligations as they become due.
The Group monitors its liquidity in order to ensure that sufficient liquid resources are available to allow it to meet its obligations.
In the case of the Group’s liability to its customers, the Group maintains these deposits in separate bank accounts which are not used for 
its day to day operations.
The Group has ensured that cash earmarked to fund its final dividend payment for 2009, is in place.
The Group expects to have sufficient liquidity to meet all of its financial obligations under all reasonably expected circumstances and will 
not need to resort to any borrowing.

Market risk
Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk is limited to the interest bearing deposits in which the Group invests surplus funds. 
The Group’s policy is to invest surplus funds in low risk money market funds or on call over night facilities. The Group also arranged with its 
principal bankers that excess funds are swept automatically across its accounts, every night, in order to maximize availability of funds for 
investments. 
Downside interest rate risk is minimal as the Group has no borrowings. Given current low US$ interest rate a 0.5% downward movement 
in bank interest rates would not have a significant impact on finance income for the year. However, a 0.5% increase in interest rates would, 
based on the year end deposits, increase annual profits by US$400,000.
Currency risk
The Group’s financial risk arising from exchange rate fluctuations is mainly attributed to:
l  Mismatch between Balance sheet Liabilities to customers which is predominately denominated in US$ and the net receipts from 
customers which are settled in the currency of the customer’s choice, of which sterling (GBP) and euros (EUR) are significant. 
l  Mismatch between reported revenue which is mainly generated in USD (the Group’s functional and reporting currency) and 
significant portion of deposits which are settled in local currencies. 
l  Expenses, the majority of which are denominated in foreign currencies including sterling (GBP), the euro (EUR) and the New 
Israeli Shekel (ILS).

23 Financial risk management continued
The Group continually monitors the foreign currency risk and takes steps, where practical, to ensure that the net exposure is kept to
an acceptable level, inter alia by using foreign exchange forward contracts designed to fix the economic impact of known liabilities. At
31 December 2009 and 31 December 2008, there were no outstanding forward contracts. There were no significant fair value movements 
on these contracts during the year.

responsibility is to manage the cash resources of the Group and minimise the various exposures associated with holding and investing 
these funds.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
24  Contingent liabilities and regulatory issues
(a) As part of the Board‘s ongoing regulatory compliance and operational risk assessment process, the Board continues to monitor 
legal and regulatory developments, and their potential impact on the business, and continues to take appropriate advice in respect 
of these developments.
(b) Given the nature of the legal and regulatory landscape of the industry, from time to time the Group has received notices, 
communications and legal actions from a small number of regulatory authorities and other parties in respect of its activities. The 
Group has taken legal advice as to the manner in which it should respond and the likelihood of success of such actions. Based on 
this advice and the nature of the actions, the Board is unable to quantify reliably any material outflow of funds that may result, if any. 
Accordingly, no provisions have been made.
(c) Following the enactment of the UIGEA on 13 October 2006, the Group stopped taking any deposits from customers in the US and 
barred such customers from wagering real money on all of the Group’s sites. Notwithstanding this, there remains a residual risk of 
an adverse impact arising from the Group having had customers in the US prior to the enactment of the UIGEA. The Board is not 
able to identify reliably at this stage what, if any, liability may arise and accordingly, no provision has been made. On 5 June 2007 
the Group announced that it has initiated preliminary discussions with the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of 
New York. It is too early to assess any particular outcome of these discussions.

A description of the Company, its activities and definitions are included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
The Company has applied accounting policies identical to the Group’s accounting policies listed in note 2 to the consolidated financial

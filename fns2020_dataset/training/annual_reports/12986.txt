Creating value  
through our Brands
1 Community-gaming as outlined above refers to the different games and services available in our Mecca and Enracha venues. Unlike casinos the Mecca and Enracha 
customer base tend to have a shorter journey time to the venue and hence are more likely to reside in the local community. Also, the games on offer differ from those 
found in casinos; they are pari-mutuel and hence create a community-style game within the venue.

28 Operating review 8 The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014
Strategic report
Dear shareholder
As outlined in our interim statement,  
the Group had a challenging H1 where  
a weaker performance from our London 
casinos and the highly competitive 
market adversely affected our ﬁnancial 
performance compared to the prior 
period. As a direct result, we undertook 
three actions in H2 aimed at delivering 
improved performance: 1) improving  
the value for money for our customers, 
2) tightening of our cost controls and  
3) a more focused capital expenditure 
programme. We are pleased to report 
that the 21% increase in H2 operating 
proﬁt versus H1 highlights the success  
of these actions.
Last year the following priorities were 
outlined for the Group. Here we provide 
an update on our progress made in  
each area.
1. Integration of acquired casinos
This year we worked hard to successfully 
integrate the former Gala casino venues 
which were acquired back in May 2013. 
With £17.8m of capital invested in the 
year, we have made signiﬁcant 
improvements to the estate while also 
implementing operational improvements. 
The 19 venues are on track to deliver the 
anticipated level of returns and, along 
with our existing estate, before central 
costs, represent 60% of the Group’s 
operating proﬁt for the year.
2. Growth in digital
The Group continued its focus  
on growing the digital channels.  
www.grosvenorcasinos.com  
continues to grow strongly and  
now offers its bespoke live casino 
product. Our growing live casino is  
now a major revenue contributor to  
our digital casino channel. 
Chairman’s statement
Creating shared 
experiences
Rank is in a strong 
ﬁnancial position, 
possesses market-
leading brands and 
has a clear strategy 
for long-term 
growth.
3. Retail channel improvements
During the year particular focus was placed 
on improving the performance of our 
Mecca venues. Further detail is provided 
in Mecca’s venues performance review.
There still continues to be some 
underperformance in the Group, which 
has resulted in the Group having to 
recognise £12.9m of impairment charges 
at 30 June 2014 in respect of certain 
venues in the UK and Spain.
Board changes
John Warren
On 17 October 2013, John Warren 
stepped down from the board after 
serving more than seven and a half  
years as non-executive director and 
chairman of the audit committee.
Colin Child
On 18 March 2014, Colin Child, Rank’s 
senior independent director, resigned 
from the board. Colin joined the board 
on 1 January 2012 and was Rank’s senior 
independent director, chairman of the 
nominations committee and chairman  
of the audit committee. Following Colin’s 
departure, I was appointed chairman of 
the nominations committee and Owen 
O’Donnell chairman of the audit 
committee. I am currently leading  
the search for a new senior independent 
director. An update will be provided as 
and when appropriate. 
Ian Burke
After eight years as chief executive of  
the Group I decided it was the right  
time to step away from the role. On  
27 March 2014, the Group announced 
the appointment of Henry Birch as 
Rank’s new chief executive and Henry’s 
appointment took effect from 6 May 2014. 
My time as chief executive has been 
challenging and rewarding, and I wish 
Henry all the very best in his new role.
Ian Burke, Chairman The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 9
On 6 May 2014, I became non-executive 
chairman and have been working 
alongside Henry to ensure a smooth 
transition of executive responsibilities. 
Dividend
The board is pleased to recommend a 
ﬁnal dividend of 3.15 pence per share be 
paid on 22 October 2014 to shareholders 
on the register at 12 September 2014.
Regulatory reform
1
Rank has been lobbying for regulatory 
modernisation within gaming for a 
number of years. Following the successful 
campaign to cut bingo duty, Rank’s 
current objectives reﬂect restrictions  
on our ability to meet customer  
demand for casino gaming and are:
• An increased provision of slot 
machines in casinos (Great Britain’s 
casinos currently have less than 2%  
of the machines in Great Britain); and
• The right for local authorities to elect 
whether to license casinos (the majority 
of local authorities in Great Britain do 
not currently enjoy this right).
While achievement of these objectives 
remains uncertain, progress was  
made in 2013/14 with increases in 
maximum stakes (from £2 to £5)  
and prizes (maximum of £10,000) for 
Category B1 slot machines in casinos  
and an increase in the maximum prize 
(from £70 to £100) for Category C slot 
machines in the Group’s bingo venues. 
Taxation
The 2014 Budget statement contained 
two major changes to the taxation of the 
Group’s activities:
• A reduction in bingo duty from 20%  
to 10% to take effect from 30 June 
2014; and
• The application of remote gaming  
duty (‘RGD’), at 15%, to all online 
gaming involving consumer 
transactions in the UK (regardless  
of where the operator is based) to take 
effect from 1 December 2014. 
As a consequence of the reduction  
in bingo duty Rank has committed to  
the construction of three new bingo 
venues, the re-starting of its venues 
refurbishment programme and providing 
better value for customers in terms of 
game prices and prize funds.
Rank has been working hard on assessing 
the full impact of RGD and developing 
ways to reduce any negative impact on 
shareholder value, for example through 
the renegotiation of key digital contracts 
and reviewing the effectiveness of digital 
marketing campaigns. The Group 
anticipates the majority of the duty  
cost will impact digital proﬁtability. 
Listing Rules
On 16 May 2014, new Listing Rules  
came into force for all premium listed 
companies. The Financial Conduct 
Authority (“FCA”) conﬁrmed that the 
For more information see pages:

51 Corporate governance
minimum free ﬂoat requirement remains 
at 25%, however they stated that they 
will take into account certain factors 
when making any decision to modify  
the 25% requirement. Rank has therefore 
made a formal submission to the FCA 
requesting it to modify LR 6.1.19 R so 
that Rank can continue to be a premium 
listed company with a slightly lower free 
ﬂoat percentage than 25%. 
Current trading and outlook
Since the beginning of July performance 
has been in line with management’s 
expectations and ahead of last year. 
While such a short trading period can  
be distorted by external factors, we are 
pleased with the underlying trends.
Rank remains in a strong ﬁnancial 
position, possesses market-leading  
brands and has a clear strategy for  
long-term growth.

CHief Executive’s Q&A
meet our new 
chief executive
 What made you want to join Rank?
Rank is a company with a fantastic 
reputation and legacy, but I was drawn 
more to the potential of where it can go 
in the future than to its past. Like most 
people in the UK I had grown up knowing 
the Rank brand and its stable of products 
and entertainment history, but more 
recently working in the gaming industry, 
I knew it as a group with great brands 
and an enviable position in venue-based 
bingo and casino gaming. Coming from 
William Hill, where I helped transform a 
company with a retail focus and culture 
into one which straddled the high street 
and the internet, I could see some 
parallels with Rank and that made me 
feel I could make a difference. Compared 
with other gaming companies Rank has  
a much more entertainment-led offer, 
engagement between staff and customers 
is closer and we have a greater awareness 
of who our customers are and what they 
enjoy. Additionally it was apparent to me 
that Rank is very aware of its duty to 
operate responsibly and therefore has 
engaged with Government and other 
interested parties on this issue. These 
elements are important differentiators for 
Rank and ones that I feel that we can 
harness further to grow the Group. 
What have been your ﬁrst impressions 
after three months with the Group?
It may sound like a cliché but I have 
been extremely impressed with the 
people throughout the business – they 
truly are our greatest assets. There is  
a huge amount of passion and loyalty  
to the brands our employees work for  
– Mecca, Grosvenor Casinos and Enracha 
– and their knowledge of our business 
and engagement with customers is better 
than I have seen in any other group. 
Ultimately we are in the business of 
providing entertainment to our customers 
and that begins and ends with the 
service and customer experience our staff 
provide. Through visiting our venues and 
meeting with team members I have come 
to realise what a strength our people are.
I have also been struck by the amount  
of potential and opportunity that Rank 
has. We have really powerful assets at

with a fantastic 
reputation  
and legacy.

our disposal: nearly 11,000 engaged and 
passionate staff, more than 160 venues, 
over three million customers and market 
leading positions in casino and bingo. 
When you join a group as a new chief 
executive you want to be excited about 
where the Group can go – about its 
potential – and in this regard I am 
extremely positive.
As with any company, Rank needs to 
change and evolve. What has been 
encouraging in my ﬁrst few months here 
– and perhaps unexpected – is that there 
is real appetite and agitation for change 
including from those who have been 
here the longest. There is no shortage  
of ideas or energy in the Group, it is just 
a question of ensuring that we have the 
right focus and the right tools to harness 
them. A willingness and desire to change 
from within is a great base from which  
to start.
Will there be a big focus on digital  
in the future?
My background is predominantly digital, 
so there has been an assumption that 
this will be my focus at Rank. In my view 
we are underpowered in digital, with just 
10% of our total revenues coming from 
our digital business (versus 30% for the 
wider gambling industry), and there  
is an opportunity for us to grow here.  
But I am also clear that we remain a 
venues-led business and there are many 
parts of our customer offer that can’t be 
 “I have been extremely 
impressed with the 
people throughout the 
business – they truly  
are our greatest assets”
‘digitised’ and nor would our customers 
want us to try. Our opportunity is to 
create a strong multi-channel offer for 
our customers, such that we give them  
a fantastic product and experience 
however they choose to engage with  
us – in one of our venues, from a home 
computer or with a mobile device. Having 
a strong digital business is a key part of 
having a multi-channel offer. So yes, 
digital will be a big focus, but not at the 
expense of other parts of our business.
I do however believe that technology 
generally will play an increasingly 
important part across our business, not 
just in the digital arena. If you look at 
the offer in our clubs, it hasn’t changed 
substantially in many years. Yes, some of 
our slots may be server-based and some 
of our bingo customers may be using our 
Mecca Max units, but fundamentally not 
a lot has changed in the way in which 
we deliver entertainment in our venues. 
However, this is not the case in other 
sectors, for instance in retail or banking, 
where technological innovation is 
increasingly changing the way people 
use products and services. I expect our 
venues will also evolve in this way. How 
and when technology plays a bigger part 
will be dependent on us and on our 
customers, but it will happen. It may be 
the implementation of a more cashless 
environment or the use of customer-
owned mobile devices in venues to 
participate in gaming or to replace 
membership cards, but technology will 
start to positively impact our business. 
Harnessing technology can not only 
make us more efﬁcient, but crucially  
it can be used to provide an improved 
customer experience and give us a 
competitive advantage. 
What are your immediate priorities?
Setting the right strategic focus for the 
Group is a key priority. This involves 
discipline in ensuring that non-core 
issues get put to one side and it involves 
plenty of communication. I am keen that 
everyone in the business knows where 
we are heading and what we are trying  
to achieve. There is no point in having 
priorities and a strategy if people aren’t 
aware of them. Additionally we need to 
have clear milestones associated with our 
strategic focus. Setting the strategy is the 
easy bit, the execution of the strategy  
is what counts. 
I am also focused on building the right 
team at Rank: a team that works well 
together, challenges each other and 
complements each other. Fortunately  
I have inherited a strong management 
team at Rank, but inevitably there will  
be some change.
I am looking forward to spending more 
time in our clubs talking to our staff  
and customers, ﬁnding out how we can 
improve our business and run it better. 
What is your vision for the Group? 
Ultimately, my vision is that Rank will  
be the UK’s leading multi-channel 
gaming company. This means creating  
a compelling multi-channel offer so  
that however our customers choose to 
interact with us – in venue, at home or 
on the move – we can provide them with 
the best possible product, service and 
entertainment experience. If we can do 
this, we will build a growing, robust and 
more valuable business.

Our business model
Creating value  
for our Customers
This has led to the Group building 
leading market positions in land-based 
casino and bingo venues, culminating  
in the acquisition of 19 casinos from  
Gala Coral in 2013. With the acquisition, 
Grosvenor Casinos became the largest 
casino operator in Great Britain by 
number of venues and by revenue. Mecca, 
with 96 bingo venues, remains the second 
largest land-based bingo operator behind 
Gala Bingo. With a ﬁnite number of 
casino licences in issuance and the high 
capital costs of building casinos or bingo 
clubs, we believe the Group is well placed 
with regards to venue-based gaming in 
the UK. 
Organic growth
Whilst our venue-based businesses 
contribute the majority of the Group’s 
revenue and proﬁt, it is unlikely that  
we will undertake further signiﬁcant 
acquisitions of UK venue-based bingo  
or casino companies in the foreseeable 
future. Instead, we see growth coming 
from both our digital business and from 
improving revenues and proﬁtability  
in our existing estate of venues and 
through some organic new openings.
Rank’s priority over the last 10 years 
has been to move from a diversiﬁed 
leisure and entertainment group  
to one that is focused on gaming. 
Customer engagement
Rank has more than three million 
customers who come to our venues  
every year. Our customers come for 
entertainment, typically stay for  
multiple hours and engage with our  
staff. We operate a membership policy, 
meaning that we know who our 
customers are, and our widely-used 
loyalty scheme in Grosvenor Casinos 
allows us to understand customer 
behaviour, trends and preferences. 
These attributes and our scale arguably 
put us in a unique position in the wider 
betting and gaming industry.  The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 15

STRATEGIC  
UPDATE
We have been reporting our 
performance against three 
critical areas for a number 
of years, demonstrating 
strong progress. 
As a result of the review carried out by our new 
chief executive, we have reﬁned this strategy into 
ﬁve new areas of focus. These are introduced on 
page 18, and we will be reporting against them 
from next year. This year, we have continued to 
report our progress against our long-standing focus 
areas, and that progress can be seen on this page 
and in our KPIs on pages 20 to 21.

During 2013/14 we carried out the following insight activities:
• Brand awareness and consideration studies
• Net promoter scoring (‘NPS’)
The following are key examples of where our insight programmes 
have driven key business decisions.
Insight Action Outcome
Mecca retail: Paper playing customers 
disliked the disadvantage of playing amongst 
multi-ticket players on Mecca Max units
Introduction of paper only sessions Increase in customer visits for paper 
only sessions
Mecca retail: Against peer operators Mecca 
scored the lowest regarding value for money
Introduction of a ﬂexible pricing structure,  
‘pay as you play’
Increase in NPS scores since 
introduction
Grosvenor retail: Customer demand for 
greater value for money
Numerous actions taken including increased 
promotions; higher return to slots players in the 
acquired casinos; introduction of higher free bets
Positive impact on customer visits
Grosvenor retail: New table games showcase 
event feedback
16 new games were selected for further 
evaluation with our customers
Four new table games introduced into 
Grosvenor Casino’s suite of table games
As part of the integration of the acquired casinos we rolled  
out Empathica, which is our retail casino customer satisfaction 
survey tool. 
During 2013/14, Rank invested £39.4m in making improvements 
to its venues. The majority of this was expended in Grosvenor 
Casinos, with major refurbishments being carried out in our 
Leicester and London St Giles casinos and the opening of our  
new London Poker Room. £8.9m of new gaming product was 
invested to upgrade and replace poor performing product in the 
acquired casinos. 
We invested a total of £4.0m in our Mecca venues. This low level 
of reinvestment reﬂected uncertainty in trading during the ﬁrst  
half of the year and disappointing returns on major venue 
re-modelling projects in previous years. However, the reduction  
in bingo duty from 30 June 2014 will result in increased capital 
investment in future years.
The Group continued the roll-out of the Enracha brand across  
its Spanish venues, with the Don Pelayo and Continental venues 
converted in the year at a cost of £0.9m.
During 2013/14, we achieved 15% growth in revenue from 
venues and 2% growth from digital media (desktop, tablet and 
mobile). Mobile continues to be our fastest growing channel with 
revenues up 43% to £18.9m in the period, with 53% of our digital 
customers in Great Britain playing with our brands on mobile 
devices (2012/13: 30%).

Both Mecca and Grosvenor Casinos successfully grew the number 
of customers experiencing their brands through both the digital

Speciﬁc actions:
• Grosvenorcasinos.com successfully launched its live casino 
product during Q2 2013/14. To ensure the online live casino 
experience mirrored that found in our venues all live casino 
dealers were trained by our experienced venue dealers;
• Grosvenor Casinos rolled out a cross-channel loyalty scheme 
(“Play Points”) during the year, improving our casino 
customers’ cross-channel experience. The acquired casinos 
are to be included in the scheme during 2014/15; and
• Successful marketing campaigns have led to a 46% increase 
in venue customers playing on grosvenorcasinos.com.

2 18 The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014
Strategic report
While Rank has built strong positions 
in venue-based gaming, we have not 
yet been able to replicate this across our 
digital channels (online and mobile). 
In 2013/14, our digital operations 
generated just 10% of Group revenue 
whereas digital channels now represent 
around 30% of Great Britain’s gambling 
market (excluding National Lottery). 
We recognise that we need to step up 
our capability in this area if we are to 
meet the changing needs of our 
customers and to capture a greater 
share of the digital market.
Priority for 2014/15
This year, we will put in place a 
number of building blocks to support 
this aim including the appointment of 
Colin Cole-Johnston as group director 
of digital and cross-channel services.
In the markets where we operate, Rank 
is one of the few gaming companies 
in a position to offer customers a 
genuine multi-channel gaming offer. 
We have a number of key assets, 
including a portfolio of more than 
160 venues, our membership systems 
and rewards programmes and the 
high levels of engagement that our 
team members enjoy with customers.
Priority for 2014/15
We will build on this position by 
investing in a range of improvements 
designed to make it simpler, more 
convenient and more rewarding for 
customers to engage with us across 
multiple channels. These improvements 
include the development of a single 
customer account, a single customer 
wallet and a single customer rewards 
programme. These are large and 
complex programmes which will take 
time to deliver but which we believe 
will give Rank an important 
competitive advantage. 
Our strategy continued
Our future  
priorities
OUr aim is to be the uk’s leading multi-channel gaming 
operator. In order to achieve this, we are focused on 
building brands with the ability to deliver them via 
the channels that they prefer – whether venues, online 
or mobile.

Over the course of the year we will map 
our existing KPIs to our new strategy, 
and will report against them in 2015. 
For this year, we have continued to 
report on our KPIs against our previous 
strategy. These KPIs can be found on 
pages 20 to 21.
We will focus in particular on building 
engagement with customers across 
multiple channels, where research  
tells us we are likely to generate  
more durable and valuable  
customer relationships. 
We have identiﬁed ﬁve inter-related 
priorities essential to the 
accomplishment of our aims. The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 19
At Rank, the customer is at the heart 
of our focus on efﬁciency. By speeding 
up processes we can remove customer 
frustrations and by removing costs  
we can offer better value. Together, 
these will create important competitive 
advantages. We have identiﬁed  
a number of opportunities to  
harness technological developments 
to offer our customers more engaging 
experiences and to achieve sustainable 
growth in operating margins. 
Priority for 2014/15
This year we will look to deploy  
more cashless payment methods in 
our venues – such as the extension  
of ticket-in-ticket-out (‘TiTO’) slot 
machines to our Mecca venues; and  
to allow customers to use their own 
smartphones and tablets to play 
games in-venue. The increasing use of 
digital technologies in our venues will 
also support our ambition to provide 
customers with a seamless multi-
channel offer. 
During 2013/14, the Group also 
commenced a project to outsource 
operational IT services to Tata 
Consultancy Services (‘TCS’). The 
transition to TCS is expected to be 
completed by October 2014.
The development of a family of 
well-deﬁned, relevant and resonant 
brands is critical for the success  
of our ambition. At Rank, we enjoy 
ownership of a number of well-known 
brands with strong levels of afﬁnity 
amongst certain customer segments, 
but in the past we have not invested 
sufﬁciently in either the development 
of those brands or the marketing 
support required to release  
their potential.
Priority for 2014/15
This year, we will seek to step up  
our brand marketing programme, 
providing appropriate support for  
our established brands and investing 
in the development of new brands  
for the digital market.
Our casinos and bingo venues remain 
the bedrock of Rank’s business, 
providing entertainment for millions 
of customers each year and generating 
the majority of the Group’s revenue 
and proﬁts. By continuing to invest  
in our venues (in terms of product, 
environment and service) and by 
creating new ones, we are constantly 
evolving and enhancing the 
experiences that we offer to customers, 
and in doing so growing our revenue.
Priority for 2014/15
This year we plan to invest £26.0m  
of capital in maintaining and 
improving our venues, which includes 
£3.5m in completing a new casino 
in Southend. In order to maintain a 
modern ﬁt-for-purpose estate, we may 
be required to close a limited number 
of venues but we will also seek to 
develop new venue concepts as we 
move forward through innovation.

Principal risks and uncertainties
Addressing  
our risks
Risk Potential impact
Regulatory and tax risk
Regulation
Adverse regulatory changes in legislation continue to represent a  
signiﬁcant risk. Changes in political and social attitudes to gambling in  
our key markets and negative publicity surrounding the gambling industry 
could inﬂuence regulators’ perception of gambling and could lead to  
increased gambling regulation. 
Regulatory changes could increase the cost  
of doing business.
Taxation
Adverse change in ﬁscal legislation continues to be a signiﬁcant risk.  
We are subject to gambling taxation and levies in Great Britain and the  
other countries in which we operate. From December we will also be required 
to pay UK Remote Gaming Duty 2014, a point of consumption tax for remote 
digital gaming. 
Any increases in the levels of taxation  
or levies to which we are subject, or the 
implementation of any new taxes or levies  
to which we will be subject, could have a 
material adverse effect on our business,  
ﬁnancial condition and results of operations.
Operational risk 
New online gaming platform – transition and implementation
The Group is in the course of planning to replace its online gaming platform, 
which is of signiﬁcant strategic importance to the Group. This will be the  
single largest IT project that it has undertaken in recent years. The key risks  
for this project include failure to: (a) select the optimum supplier; (b) specify 
correctly the Group’s requirements with the result that the platform is not  
ﬁt for purpose; (c) deﬁne clearly the governance structure for the project;  
(d) deliver the project on time and on budget; (e) manage adequately the 
transition from the existing platform; and (f) provide for an appropriate  
exit strategy. 
This project is a key strategic enabler, so any 
failures in the delivery of the project risk having 
an adverse effect on the ability to optimise the 
digital platform and its associated business,  
consequently impacting proﬁtability. 
Volatility of gaming win
Win percentages for gambling activities can vary over a short period of time, 
although they will stabilise over a longer period. The business is also vulnerable 
to the potential impact of a small number of customers who can create 
volatility from the level of their gaming win.
Gaming win directly impacts proﬁtability. The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 23
Mitigation Further information
We participate actively in trade bodies’ presentations to Government 
and opposition parties. As we have done in previous years, during the 
period under review, we have arranged key stakeholder familiarisation 
visits to some of our sites in order that stakeholders can have an 
opportunity to see our businesses in operation. This enables 
stakeholders to gain a better understanding of the positive effect of 
our business activities, including the provision of a safe environment 
within which adults can enjoy gambling, the creation of employment 
and the generation of revenues for the Exchequer.

The project is in its planning stages and is engaging experienced

Strategic report
Principal risks and uncertainties continued
Risk Potential impact
Loss of licences
Rank’s gaming licences are fundamental to its operation. In the British 
venues part of the business there is a requirement to hold an operator’s 
licence from the Gambling Commission (the body responsible for regulating 
commercial gambling in Great Britain) in respect of each of the licensed 
activities undertaken. Additionally, it is necessary to hold premises licences 
from the relevant local authority in which each venue is situated, one for 
gambling activities and one for the sale of alcohol. Our UK customer facing 
transactional websites require a licence from the Alderney Gambling Control 
Commission, the body responsible for the regulation of eGambling in the 
States of Alderney where our remote gambling operations are based. 
Additionally, with effect from 1 October 2014, an operator’s licence  
for our remote operations will be required from the Gambling Commission. 
Our operations in Spain and Belgium are also subject to licensing 
requirements in the jurisdictions and local areas in which they operate.
The loss of licences could have an adverse effect 
on our business and proﬁtability and prevent us 
from providing gambling services.
External events
Customers may be prevented or deterred from accessing our clubs due to 
factors such as extreme weather, illness or disease epidemics, terrorist threats, 
strikes and public transport system failures. 
This could have an adverse effect on our 
business and proﬁtability. As reported in our 
2013/14 half year results, the hot weather in  
July 2013 adversely affected our results. 
Business continuity and disaster recovery
Due to the venues based nature of much of the business, the Group’s 
signiﬁcant reliance on technology, and the criticality of staff in serving 
customers and running the business, serious disruptive events such as 
building ﬁre, pandemic or serious technology failure may cause an 
interruption to the ability to operate elements of the business if business 
continuity and disaster recovery plans failed to operate successfully.
If business continuity and disaster recovery 
plans failed to operate successfully the business 
would experience delays in recovering critical 
revenue generating activities or operational 
processes, such as ﬁnancial reporting, causing 
both ﬁnancial and reputational damage. 
Wage rise inﬂation
We employ a large number of employees at or just above the minimum  
wage. Signiﬁcant increases to the national minimum wage or other 
signiﬁcant changes to employment regulation could have an adverse  
impact on the Group’s results.
Changes generating signiﬁcant employment 
cost inﬂation could negatively impact the 
Group’s proﬁtability.
Information technology risk
IT outsourcing – transition and implementation
Rank is in the process of outsourcing certain of its IT services including 
helpdesk, desktop support, server administration and network operations. 
There are inherent risks in undertaking a project of this nature and 
importance, including supplier selection, implementation, the impact  
on employee morale and retention during the consultation and transition 
periods, and effective communication with the supplier. 
Issues with the provision of core IT services may 
affect the smooth operation of business activities 
and consequently revenue.
Reliance on technology
The Group is highly dependent on complex technology and advanced 
information systems, with many interfaces and a signiﬁcant number of 
separate suppliers. The pace of business change and development means  
that IT changes such as new software coding, systems enhancements and 
new software application integrations are undertaken continually and 
consequently these systems are inherently vulnerable to experiencing 
malfunctions, failures, or cyber attacks such as viruses or hacker intrusion. 
Comprehensive technology resilience and systems protection measures  
are in place but it is difﬁcult to detect all threats and vulnerabilities in  
order to prevent all service interruptions and problems.
If our prevention measures for technology 
attacks should fail our reputation may be 
harmed and customers deterred from using  
our services, which may in turn have a material 
adverse effect on our ﬁnancial performance. 
Failures in service provision could also render 
the Group unable to serve customers during 
such service interruptions, again having an 
adverse effect on revenue and proﬁt. The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 25
Mitigation Further information
Rank has a dedicated compliance function that is independent of 
operations and a separate internal audit function that is independent 
of both operations and the compliance function. Rank maintains a 
strong and open relationship with the Gambling Commission. Since 
entering the online gaming market, Rank has worked hard to build a 
similarly strong and open relationship with the Alderney Gambling 
Control Commission.
 51 Corporate governance
Whilst these matters are outside our direct sphere of inﬂuence,  
we continue to work hard to better prepare ourselves for such 
eventualities, particularly in terms of co-ordinating with our  
digital businesses and making sure that employees can get to work.
A Group business continuity plan is in place and regularly reviewed. 
Departmental plans are required for all critical departments and 
premises, and managed by the director of security. IT plans in 
particular are being continually reviewed in light of the transfer  
of risk being experienced as part of the IT outsourcing project.
Rank maintains continual monitoring of the regulatory environment 
to ensure that changes are identiﬁed and prepared for as early  
as possible.
 35 Operating responsibly
The formal supplier selection process was audited by the Group’s 
internal audit function and was found to have been properly 
conducted. A supplier has been selected who has extensive  
experience in similar transition projects. Knowledge transfer plans  
are in place to mitigate any issues with losing existing employees,  
and alternative job roles have been made available where suitable  
to help manage morale and retention.
 35 Operating responsibly 
In September 2013, a chief information ofﬁcer started with the  
Group and he has also implemented a security improvement 
programme which is underway, including measures such as 
enhancing the existing information security team with additional 
expert staff and adding a further range of detective and preventative 
measures to improve the security of technology based assets. The IT 
outsourcing currently being conducted also adds to the resources for 
providing business support and resilience around key systems.

Unique customers shown on a moving annual total (‘MAT’) basis.
Our brand teams served more than three million customers  
in the year with customer visits increasing by 4% due to the 
addition of the acquired casinos.
The Group’s net promoter score, which measures the 
propensity of customers to recommend our brands, decreased 
by 5 percentage points to 43%. Customer feedback indicates 
their increasing focus on value for money in bingo and a 
greater demand for promotions and bonuses in our casinos.  
As a result, the Group has taken actions to address our 
customers increasing desire for greater value, details of  
which are provided in the brand operating reviews below. 
Summary of ﬁnancial results
The Group achieved 13% growth in continuing business 
revenue; with 15% growth in venues and 2% in digital (online 
and mobile). Like-for-like revenue for the Group fell by 4%. 
The fastest-growing channel of distribution continues to be 
mobile, where revenue increased by 43% to £18.9m.
Revenue from Grosvenor Casinos increased by 30% to £391.2m, 
driven by the £107.2m revenue contribution from the acquired  
casinos. Consequently, operating proﬁt rose by 20% to £56.8m.
Mecca’s revenue decreased by 3% to £288.2m as customer visits 
decreased in the year. Lower revenue and higher digital IT costs 
resulted in total brand proﬁt declining 16% to £37.0m.
Enracha’s euro revenue decreased by 1% as customer visits fell 
by 2%. Sterling operating proﬁt rose by 14%. 
Central costs were marginally lower at £22.2m.
During the year Rank invested £44.3m of capital across the 
Group. More than 70% of this was deployed in our Grosvenor 
Casinos venues. 
The Group’s adjusted net ﬁnancing charge of £9.9m was higher 
than the prior period, primarily due to the ﬁnancing costs 
associated with the acquisition of the former Gala casinos. 
Adjusted earnings per share at 12.4p was in line with the  
prior period.

VAT claims
On 30 October 2013, Rank received notice that the Court  
of Appeal had found in favour of HM Revenue and Customs 
(‘HMRC’) regarding claims for overpaid VAT on certain types  
of amusement machines between 2002 and 2005. Following 
the Court of Appeal decision Rank repaid amounts received  
to HMRC on 30 May 2014.
Rank applied for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court in 
connection with these claims and was subsequently granted 
permission to appeal on 16 April 2014. The appeal hearing will 
be held on 20 April 2015.  The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 29

Supply
As of July 2014 the number of casino licences operating  
in Great Britain was 149. All but two of these casinos were 
licensed under the 1968 Act and when the 1968 Act was 
superseded by the 2005 Gambling Act (“the 2005 Act”)  
the rights of these casinos were ‘grandfathered’.
During 2013/14, there has been one further opening of an 
awarded 2005 Act casino in Milton Keynes. Two 2005 Act 
licences have been awarded since the end of the prior period; 
the small Luton licence was awarded to Grosvenor Casinos and 
the small Wolverhampton licence was awarded to Casino 36. 
The local authority in Southampton is currently in the process 
of reviewing applications. 
Grosvenor Casinos is the largest operator, by venues and 
revenue, of licensed casinos in Great Britain.

On 8 November 2013, the new London Poker Room opened 
which incorporates a 350 capacity poker room. The capital  
cost of the Poker Room casino licence and associated ﬁt-out 
costs was £11.6m.
The integration of the acquired casinos was completed in  
the year with £17.8m of capital invested. The investment 
included the conversion of three venues to the G Casino 
format, which included a major refurbishment of the  
Leicester casino, and the rollout of new gaming product  
across the acquired estate. The Group also carried out a  
major refurbishment at the London St Giles (formerly the 
Tottenham Court Road) venue in addition to major IT 
upgrades across both the acquired and existing venues. 
Upcoming investments include the opening of a new  
casino in Southend in autumn 2014 and the refurbishment  
of the acquired venues in Nottingham and Bournemouth.
During the year the brand successfully extended its venues 
loyalty scheme, Play Points, across the digital channel and 
introduced an exclusive Black Card VIP reward scheme.  
Work is currently underway to continue the Play Points  
rollout across the acquired casinos and should be completed  
by December 2014. 
As part of the brand’s strategy to further develop its casino  
offer, a trial sports betting offer has recently been introduced 
alongside the refurbished Leicester casino. There are plans  
to extend the trial into a further three venues in 2014/15.

Venues revenue of £229.3m was down 2% and 5% on a 
like-for-like basis. The decline in revenue was principally 
driven by a fall in customer visits. A major review of costs  
was carried out in the year resulting in a £4.1m reduction  
in labour costs.
One underperforming venue was closed in the year, and there 
are plans to close two further loss-making venues in 2014/15. 
As a consequence of the cut in bingo duty to 10% the Group 
has committed to develop three new venues and to re-start its 
venues refurbishment programme. The Group continues with 
its review of suitable locations and developing new concepts. 
The highly competitive digital market contributed to a 4% 
decline in digital revenue. A reallocation of shared IT and other 
overhead costs from the disposed Blue Square business, and 
increased investment in technology contributed to a fall in 
operating proﬁt, down 25%. 
During the year over 100 new games were released by Mecca’s 
digital channel, along with signiﬁcant upgrades to its mobile 
app; despite total digital revenues falling in the period, mobile 
revenues continue to grow, up 41%.

The decline in Q1 customer visits prompted a detailed review 
of all venues, session by session, which concluded that certain 
offers were uncompetitive. As a result, numerous initiatives 
were launched focussed on improving value for money; 
these included the introduction of lower priced sessions,  
a ‘refer a friend’ reward programme and various food and 
beverage promotions. These actions have contributed to  
an improvement in the second half, with full year customer

Making  
people happy
our role in society
At Rank, our aim is to make an overwhelmingly positive 
contribution to the quality of life in the communities we serve, 
by bringing people together, creating fun experiences and 
making people happy. We understand that our success as a 
business is dependent upon society’s view of our effectiveness 
in doing this – and that the value that we generate from  
our operations is a measure of the value that we add to  
people’s lives.
In this section, we look in greater detail at our business from 
the perspective of our customers, our team members and the 
communities that we serve. 
Customers – Keeping it Fun
Rank’s purpose is to bring enjoyment to the lives of our 
customers through thrills, socialisation and entertainment. 
How it affects our performance and position
The success of our brands is predicated on our ability to  
“keep it fun”. However, with gambling – as with most forms  
of leisure – excessive or uncontrolled consumption will lead  
to harm. The fact that the vast majority of our customers  
gain enjoyment from gambling must not be used to mask  
or marginalise the incidence of harm. 
Problem gambling is a complex issue, involving a web of 
psychological, sociological and economic factors. Sadly, it is  
an issue where objective discussion is skewed by narrow self- 
interest or deep-lying views on the basic morality of gambling. 
Our policies and actions
At Rank, our approach is to seek a more sophisticated 
understanding of the problem and to use that understanding 
to tackle gambling-related harm.
• Understand through research and engagement
• Inﬂuence customer behaviour through communication
• Provide safeguards and intervene where problems arise 
• Support treatment and counselling
Team members – creating thrilling careers
Rank is made up of nearly 11,000 talented individuals, who 
have a desire to entertain. 
How it affects our performance and position
These are the people who bring our brands to life by creating 
memorable experiences for our customers – they are the most 
important reasons why people choose our brands and stay  
with us. 
For more information see pages: 
139 Keep it fun
We recognise that it is critical to support our team  
members through the provision of the training necessary  
to accomplish their jobs, development opportunities in  
line with their career aspirations and clarity in terms  
of leadership. 
Our policies and actions
Training
During 2013/14, we invested £497,000 in delivering 246,000 
hours of training to our team members, helping them to 
develop the skills required to do their jobs.
Career development
Our career development programme is designed to enable  
our employees to progress within Rank, offering mobility 
between brand and Group teams, and the opportunity to  
work within different areas of operation and to participate  
in cross-Group projects.
During 2013/14, nearly all team members participated in career 
development training. In addition, 6% of our team members 
achieved a promotion in the period.
Leadership and engagement
Rank’s senior management team has an obligation to the 
Group’s team members to set clear direction and expectations 
and to provide regular and motivational feedback. Our team 
member engagement scores tell us how effective we are in 
meeting this need. In 2013/14, team member engagement 
increased slightly from 78% to 79%. 
Health & safety
The Group ensures the health, safety and welfare of all our 
employees by providing safe working conditions to prevent 
injury or ill health. Rank regards legislative compliance as a 
minimum, and whenever possible will seek to implement 
higher health and safety standards throughout the business 
with a focus on continual improvements of these standards.
The directors and senior management of the Group recognise 
the importance of providing all employees and visitors to our 
premises with a safe and healthy environment in which to 
work or enjoy our venues.
During the year, a two-day audit of the Group’s support ofﬁce 
was carried out by the British Safety Council, and the Group 
retained its prestigious ﬁve star accreditation status for 
Occupational Health & Safety.  36 The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014

Diversity
Rank is committed to providing equal opportunities for all  
of our employees. Our diversity policy ensures that every 
employee is treated equally and fairly and that all employees 
are aware of their responsibilities.
The policy conﬁrms that there will be no direct or indirect 
discrimination in respect of age, disability, religious belief, 
gender, sexual orientation, race, colour, marital status, political 
belief and nationality, or any other category deﬁned by law in 
all aspects of employment including recruitment, promotion, 
and opportunities for training, pay and beneﬁts.

planning, directing or controlling the activities of the company, or a strategically 
signiﬁcant part of the company, other than company directors and ii) any other 
directors of undertakings included in the consolidated accounts.
Disability
Rank is committed to ensuring that people with disabilities are 
supported and encouraged to apply for employment with the 
Group and to achieve progress whilst employed. Disabled 
persons will be treated so that they have an equal opportunity, 
so far as is justiﬁable, to be selected, trained and promoted. 
In order that people with disabilities may have an equal 
opportunity of being recruited, the Group strictly applies its 
Equal Opportunities and Recruitment Policies. In particular, 
Rank takes reasonable steps to ensure that interview 
arrangements are such that disabled persons may attend 
without embarrassment or difﬁculty. It also ensures that any 
enquiries made about an applicant’s health prior to offering  
a job are limited to establishing whether the applicant will be 
able to comply with a requirement to undergo an interview  
or other assessment; whether a duty to make reasonable 
adjustments is, or will be, imposed on the Group in relation to 
the applicant in connection with a requirement to undergo an 
interview or other assessment; whether the applicant will be 
able to carry out a function that is intrinsic to the work 
concerned; or for the purpose of monitoring diversity in the 
range of persons applying to the Group to work. The Group is 
also committed to making such reasonable adjustments to 
premises, work practices and equipment as are necessary to 
enable a disabled person to take up employment with Rank.
Career development opportunities are communicated as 
appropriate to all employees and those with disabilities are 
encouraged to apply as detailed in the Group’s Equal 
Opportunities Policy. Both internal and external training 
opportunities are provided where they are appropriate to 
employees’ current occupations or potential opportunities and 
to the needs of the business. Where appropriate, outside 
training providers are required to demonstrate that they are 
able to accommodate persons with a disability before the 
Group will approve their usage. The provision of internal 
courses is relocated as necessary in order to ensure that persons 
with disabilities may attend, and the human resources 
department is responsible for making suitable arrangements 
with regard to the venue of the event or to the format in which 
any supporting course materials are provided.
During performance appraisal meetings in particular, managers 
are required to pay special attention to the views of disabled 
employees on career development issues such as access to 
training/development events and/or opportunities, and are 
expected to enquire whether there is anything that the Group 
may reasonably do to help the person develop and use their 
abilities at work.
Where an employee becomes disabled, whether through 
accident, illness or injury, every reasonable and practicable 
consideration will be given to ensuring that they may remain 
in employment. Any situations involving an employee who 
becomes disabled require the involvement of human resources, 
who monitor the employee’s disability and provide advice 
during their on-going employment. The Group may take a 
variety of steps to enable continuing employment, for example 
making adjustments to premises; transfer to an alternative 
position which is vacant or to a different location/place of work; 
alteration of working hours; time off during working hours for 
rehabilitation, assessment or treatment; training and/or 
re-skilling; modiﬁcation or purchase of appropriate equipment;  
and provision of supervision and assistance. All necessary 
advice and counselling will be provided for the employee 
concerned by human resources, who will also consult external 
specialist organisations as appropriate. The Group welcomes 
suggestions from disabled employees regarding adjustments 
which could assist with their ability to undertake their role.

Human rights
Given the nature of our business and its geographical spread 
we have not included information on human rights issues as 
required by The Companies Act 2006 Regulations 2013.
Communities – Rank Cares
Rank and its brands have a long history of community 
involvement and charitable fund-raising. 
How it affects our performance and position
Our venues are often cited as “community hubs” – particularly 
our Mecca bingo venues. We challenge all of our teams to 
consider what they can contribute to the communities that 
they serve.
Our policies and actions
In February 2014, we launched Rank Cares to support the work 
of the Carers Trust to help those who help others in need of 
care. Around one-in-ten people in Britain today provide care 
for another – often a sick or elderly relation. The Carers Trust 
provides support, advice and relief for those undertaking what 
is often very physically and emotionally draining work.
We have set ourselves a target of raising £0.5m for the Carers 
Trust and at 30 June 2014 we had already passed the £0.2m 
mark. The funds are distributed within the communities in 
which they are raised, via a series of grant panels.
In addition, Rank Cares provides a framework for team 
members to volunteer their time to help the Carers Trust, often 
utilising hidden talents to bring relief and happiness to these 
selﬂess carers.
During 2013/14, Rank also participated in activities to support 
the following organisations:
• Marie Curie Cancer Care
• Dame Kelly Holmes Trust

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
The following GHG emission data has been calculated using 
the DECC/Defra emission factors provided by Defra in June 
2013. Subsequent years’ emissions will be based on an annually 
revised set of factors. 
We have continued to communicate effectively our overall 
consumption levels for electricity, gas and waste, to the venues 
by means of our dedicated environmental website and 
automatic meter readings which produce weekly consumption 
reports direct to the venues. This has been successfully 
integrated into the 19 casinos acquired in 2013.

controls on all chiller replacements and running trials on 
various control systems to improve our energy efﬁciency.
Over the last period we have carried out additional R&D  
on various other energy opportunities.
Our new sites at Reading and Southend (under construction) 
have our latest control systems and LED lighting throughout.
We are continuing to replace existing lighting with LEDs where 
viable and available as technology progresses with these units.

Increased stakes and prizes at Mecca  
and Grosvenor Casinos
The Government conﬁrmed in January that the stake limits and, in some cases,  
the prize limits could be increased on certain gaming machines. Machines in both 
the Group’s bingo and casino venues were able to take advantage of these increases.

Strategic report
Financial review
continuing to 
deliver results
Following a challenging H1 and the successful execution of 
certain proﬁt improvement actions in H2, Group revenue for 
the 12 month period from continuing operations rose by 13% 
to £707.7m, while Group operating proﬁt before exceptionals 
of £72.4m was 4% higher than the prior period.
The growth in Group revenues reﬂects the income from the  
19 acquired casinos offset by a highly competitive trading 
environment and a lower, more normal, win margin in our 
London casinos. 
Adjusted net interest payable for the 12 months was above the 
prior period due to the additional facilities used to fund the 
acquisition of the 19 casinos from Gala.
The Group’s proﬁt for the year was £20.2m, down 25% from 
the prior year.
Adjusted earnings per share was ﬂat year-on-year at 12.4p.
Acquisition of the former Gala casinos 
The acquisition accounting relating to the acquisition of the  
19 casinos from Gala on 12 May 2013 has now been ﬁnalised.  
In the prior year, provisional fair values of the assets and liabilities 
acquired were disclosed due to the proximity of the acquisition  
to the Group’s year end and the completion accounts process 
outlined by the sale and purchase agreement extended beyond the 
ﬁnalisation of the ﬁnancial statements. Details of the adjustments 
made to the provisional accounting are outlined in note 25.
The acquisition has now been successfully integrated and the 
initial capital investment plan has been completed on time 
and within budget. Since acquisition, the casinos have 
performed in line with management’s expectations.
Taxation
The Group’s effective corporation tax rate on continuing 
operations was 22.2% (2012/13: 25.5%) and the Group had  
an effective cash tax rate of 16.7% on adjusted proﬁt. 
For further detail on our effective corporation tax rate and cash 
tax rate please refer to our Tax Fact File on pages 42 to 45.
The gaming machine case concerning overpaid VAT (previously 
refunded to Rank) was decided on 30 October 2013 by the 
Court of Appeal in favour of HMRC. Rank has appealed the 
decision to the Supreme Court and the case will be heard on  
20 April 2015. In H2, Rank had to repay amounts received  
in advance of the case being heard.
The Group previously participated in a disclosed tax avoidance 
scheme which has been included in the recently published list 
of Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes (“DOTAS”). Under 
new tax rules implemented this year, HMRC can request 
payment of the amounts under dispute in advance of any  
Tax Tribunal. The Group has not yet received any request for 
payment, with the amounts at dispute worth up to £22.0m. 
This potential tax outﬂow is included within the income tax 
payable balance; please refer to note 18.
Exceptional items
In order to give a full understanding of the Group’s ﬁnancial 
performance and aid comparability between periods, the 
Group reports certain items as exceptional to normal trading. 
During the year, the Group recognised impairment charges  
and onerous lease provisions which principally related  
to underperformance of the Group’s New Brighton casino  
and three Enracha venues.
As outlined above, the Group repaid amounts to HMRC following 
the decision at the Court of Appeal. As recovery is not virtually 
certain, this outﬂow has been expensed in the current period.
Full details of the Group’s exceptional items are provided in note 4.
Going concern
In adopting the going concern basis for preparing the ﬁnancial 
information the directors have considered the issues impacting 
the Group during the period as detailed in the business review 
above and have reviewed the Group’s projected compliance 
with its banking covenants. Based on the Group’s cash ﬂow 
forecasts and operating budgets, and assuming that trading 
does not deteriorate considerably from those projected levels, 
the directors believe that the Group will generate sufﬁcient 
cash to meet its requirements for at least the next 12 months 
and comply with its banking covenants. Accordingly, the 
adoption of the going concern basis remains appropriate.

At the end of June 2014, net debt was £137.0m compared  
with net debt of £104.1m at the end of June 2013. The net 
debt comprised £140.0m in bank term loans in respect of  
the acquisition of the former Gala casinos, £20.0m drawn 
revolving-credit facilities, £8.4m in ﬁxed rate Yankee bonds, 
£14.9m in ﬁnance leases and £0.8m in overdrafts, offset by  
cash at bank and in hand of £47.1m.
The Group’s banking facilities comprise two £70.0m bi-lateral 
term loans and four £20.0m bi-lateral revolving credit facilities 
with its relationship banks totalling £220.0m. These facilities 
require the maintenance of a minimum ratio of earnings 
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (‘EBITDA’) 
to net interest payable; a minimum ratio of EBITDA plus 
operating lease charges to net interest payable plus operating 
lease charges; and a maximum ratio of net debt to EBITDA, 
tested quarterly and biannually depending on the facility.  
The Group has complied with its banking covenants.
The Group has a strong balance sheet, with a conservative 
leverage of 1.2 times net debt to EBITDA.

During 2013/14, Rank invested £39.4m in making improvements 
to its venues, with the majority being expended in the enlarged 
Grosvenor Casinos estate. £17.8m was invested in the acquired 
estate, which included £2.5m on the refurbishment of the 
Leicester and London St Giles casinos and £8.9m on new gaming 
equipment. In the existing estate, the new London Poker Room 
opened at a cost of £11.6m and £1.4m was spent on the new 
Southend casino which is due to open in autumn 2014.
We invested £4.0m in our Mecca venues. This low level of venues 
investment reﬂected uncertainty following trading during the 
ﬁrst half of the year and disappointing returns on major venue 
re-modelling projects in previous years.
On developing our digital capability we invested a total of £1.9m 
in Mecca and £1.4m in Grosvenor Casinos.
During 2014/15, we plan to spend between £40.0m and £45.0m. 
Of this, £5.5m will be invested in refurbishing further our 
Grosvenor Casinos venues and £3.5m to complete the 
development of our new casino in Southend, £4.7m on 
improving our digital capability and £7.6m on Group-wide IT 
investments. We will increase our capital investment in Mecca 
venues, in keeping with commitments made to HM Treasury  
and heightened return expectations from the reduced rate of 
bingo duty. 
Capital committed at 30 June 2014 includes £3.1m for the new  
G casino in Southend. Mecca had no material commitments  
at the year end. 42 The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014

£189.4m (2012/13: £176.9m) for the UK Exchequer and local 
government in VAT, gaming taxes, income tax, National 
Insurance contributions and local business rates. Rank has 
provided employment to nearly 11,000 (2012/13: 9,500) people 
across the Group. The broader impact of Rank’s operations, 
including taxes paid by supplier companies, is harder to 
quantify but no less signiﬁcant.

to consultations which may have a material impact upon  
the business, actively pursuing opportunities to meet with 
government ofﬁcials and discuss the tax environment 
applicable to Rank’s operating companies, expressing 
considered opinions to government and industry on the 
current tax environment and how it may be improved and 
actively participating in forums designed to comment on  
and inform government policy on taxation. 
Taxation represents a signiﬁcant proportion of the Group’s 
total outgoings, as can be seen from the chart below: The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 43
It remains Rank’s objective to ensure that all taxes are correctly 
accounted for and that tax returns are completed accurately 
and on time and that any tax liabilities are paid. There are 
sufﬁcient processes and controls in place to ensure that this 
objective is met. Rank has resolved a number of historic tax 
issues in the UK and abroad in the past year through working 
co-operatively with the local tax authorities. The Group aims 
to conclude tax audits as quickly as possible whilst also 
defending its position robustly with a view to protecting 
shareholder value and taking into account the cost of 
defending audits in relation to the amounts of tax at stake. 
The Group’s tax strategy is regularly reviewed and approved  
by the Board and supported by the use of appropriate advisors. 
Where disputes arise over the interpretation and application  
of tax legislation, the Group will seek to resolve any differences 
by discussing the merits of its position with the relevant tax 
authority. In the event that agreement cannot be reached, 
Rank will consider litigation provided that the grounds of 
appeal stand a good chance of success in litigation and that 
there is sufﬁcient tax at stake to warrant the cost of litigation.
Effective tax rate
The Group’s effective corporation tax rate in 2013/14 was 
22.2% (2012/13: 25.5%) based on a tax charge of £13.9m on 
adjusted proﬁt before taxation. This is lower than the Group’s 
anticipated effective tax rate due to prior year tax credits.  
The effective corporation tax rate for 2015 and future periods is 
expected to be 22% to 24% reducing in line with the reduction 
to UK corporation tax rates but remaining 2% to 4% above the 
UK statutory tax rate as a result of overseas proﬁts being taxed 
at higher rates and depreciation of assets that do not qualify 
for capital allowances. Further details on the taxation charge 
are provided in note 7.
Cash tax rate
In the year ended 30 June 2014 the Group had an effective 
cash tax rate of 16.7% on adjusted proﬁt, reﬂecting the 
utilisation of capital allowances and losses in the Group  
(14.8% in the year ended 30 June 2013). The Group is expected 
to have a cash tax rate of approximately 17.5% to 20% in the 
year ended 30 June 2015, excluding any tax payable on the 
resolution of legacy issues.
Gaming tax reform
Rank considers that the current tax regime for gaming in Great 
Britain is unduly complex, which has resulted in volatility in 
the past. Rank is in favour of a simpler regime that encourages 
sustained growth and investment. 
More details of Rank’s position are detailed in our paper 
‘Responsible Taxation: Fairness, Responsibility and 
Sustainability’, which is available at www.rank.com.
In April 2013 Rank published ‘GamePlan – A candid exposition 
of Rank’s approach to regulatory and ﬁscal reform’ (available at 
www.rank.com). GamePlan considers the positive contribution 
that Rank makes to life in Britain today as well as considering 
how Rank can make a greater contribution in the future with  
a little support from our government.

Strategic report
Tax fact file continued
‘GamePlan – A candid update on Rank’s approach to regulatory 
and ﬁscal reform Volume II’ (available at www.rank.com)  
was published by Rank in November 2013. In GamePlan 
Volume II Rank called for a reduction in bingo duty, believing 
that this would enable bingo operators to offer customers a 
richer experience through a combination of increased prizes 
and greater innovation, resulting in economic growth and  
job creation. 
In Budget 2014, the UK Government announced a reduction  
in the rate of bingo duty from 20% to 10% with effect from  
30 June 2014. The announcement will provide an important 
boost for Britain’s bingo clubs, which provide a range of social 
and economic beneﬁts for the communities they serve. By 
reducing the rate of bingo duty, the government has created  
a basis for renewed investment and innovation in the bingo 
sector and Rank has committed to a programme of investment 
and job creation in its bingo venues as a direct consequence of 
the reduction in duty.
In Budget 2014 it was also conﬁrmed that remote gambling 
will be taxed on a place of consumption basis from 1 December 
2014. Tax at 15% will become due on any gambling revenue 
generated from consumers in the UK. 
Spain
In 2011, the Spanish government invited online operators  
to apply for remote gaming licences and introduced tax 
changes which levied gaming duty on a place of consumption 
basis. Remote gaming duty was introduced at a rate of 20%  
of revenue. This differs from the taxation of land-based 
businesses, which, although taxed at similar rates (of between 
13.5% to 25%), are taxed on stakes received rather than 
revenue generated. 
Belgium
The Belgium government introduced a taxation and licensing 
framework for online gaming companies in 2011. Companies 
may only apply for an online gaming licence in Belgium if 
they already hold a land-based gaming licence and are subject 
to remote gaming duty at a rate of 11%.
VAT claims
Since 2006, Rank has invested signiﬁcant resource in pursuing 
litigation to reclaim overpaid VAT. In all, Rank has received 
£284.2 million of VAT and interest relating to this litigation. 
Following ﬁve rulings in Rank’s favour from the UK courts, 
Rank’s case was referred to the Court of Justice of the European 
Union (ECJ). The decision of the ECJ was published on  
10 November 2011. The decision led HM Revenue & Customs 
to concede the bingo element of Rank’s claims. However,  
the element of Rank’s claim relating to amusement machines 
(totalling £30.7m) has been referred back to the UK courts. 
Rank’s case was heard at the Court of Appeal in May 2013, 
with the decision being found in HMRC’s favour. Following  
the Court of Appeal decision, Rank has repaid amounts to 
HMRC in respect of the claim.
Rank has, however, been granted permission to lodge an 
appeal to the Supreme Court. The Appeal hearing will be  
held on 20 April 2015. 
Depending on the outcome of the Supreme Court decision,  
it is possible that certain other points in relation to the case 
will need to be considered further by the First Tier Tribunal.
Rank has submitted several further claims pursuant to the 
principle of ﬁscal neutrality, pertaining (in the main) to VAT 
overpaid on amusement machine income. Rank estimates that 
these claims total more than £275m including interest but the 
delay in the conclusion of Rank’s current case has delayed the 
determination of these additional claims. Rank considers that 
the outcome of the Supreme Court should determine some of 
the claims included within the £275m (in particular the 
amusement machine claim for the period 31 January 1976 to 
30 September 1996). However, it is also possible that further 
litigation will be required in connection with part of these 
claims. These delays have not altered Rank’s appraisal of its 
chances of success in this matter.
At present, HMRC accepts that taxpayers are entitled to receive 
interest on repayments caused by HMRC’s error. Such interest 
is calculated on a simple basis. However, there is ongoing 
litigation that such interest should be calculated on a 
compound basis. Rank has protected its position with regard  
to such claims as other tax payers are bringing litigation on 
this point. The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 45

corporate governance
GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
The board is committed to ensuring that the Group is well 
managed and that rigorous and transparent procedures allow 
this to happen.
The principal governance rules applying to UK companies 
listed on the London Stock Exchange are contained in the  
UK Corporate Governance Code, revised by the Financial 
Reporting Council in September 2012 (the “Code”). This report 
also includes the information that is required by the Financial 
Conduct Authority’s Listing Rules (“LR”) and Disclosure Rules 
and Transparency Rules (“DTR”) to be contained in the 
Company’s annual report.
Save in relation to Code provisions A.2.1 (roles of  
chairman and chief executive not to be exercised by the  
same individual), A.3.1 (chief executive not to become 
chairman), A.4.1 (requirement for a senior independent 
director), C.3.1 (audit committee to comprise at least three 
independent non-executive directors) and B.6.2 (triennial 
externally-facilitated board evaluation), the board conﬁrms 
that it has complied with the provisions of the Code 
throughout the year ended 30 June 2014. Please see pages  
52 to 56 for an explanation as to why the board has not 
complied with Code provisions A.2.1, A.3.1, A.4.1, C.3.1  
and B.6.2. 
This statement explains how we have applied the principles  
of the Code, our governance policies and practices and how  
we run the business for the beneﬁt of shareholders. 
In this statement the following abbreviations are used:
“FCA” – Financial Conduct Authority
“Guoco” – Guoco Group Limited
“Hong Leong” – Hong Leong Company (Malaysia) Berhad
CODE MAIN PRINCIPLES
Leadership
The role of the board
Board composition
As at the date of this report, the board consists of:
• a non-executive chairman;
• four independent non-executive directors; and
• two executive directors – the chief executive and the  
ﬁnance director.
The names and biographies of all directors are published  
on pages 48 to 49.
Key board responsibilities
The board is responsible for:
• Group strategy, objectives and policies; 
• general and long-term progress of the Group within the 
political, economic, environmental and social setting  
of the day;
• ﬁnancial performance, annual budgets and business plans;
• major capital expenditure, acquisitions and divestments;
• annual and half-year ﬁnancial results and interim 
management statements;
• board committees and their terms of reference;
• internal controls and risk management;
• responsible gambling and ethical behaviour;
• sound governance, health and safety, and environmental 
policies;
• board and company secretary appointments;
• senior management structure, remuneration and  
succession; and
• investor relations.
Speciﬁc responsibilities are delegated to our four board 
committees – audit, remuneration, nominations and ﬁnance. 
They report to the board and operate within deﬁned terms  
of reference, which can be obtained from our website at 
www.rank.com/governance/index.jsp or by writing to  
the company secretary.
The executive directors conduct the Company’s business 
within clearly deﬁned limits delegated by the board and 
subject to those matters reserved to the board.
Board meetings
Board meetings allow for regular and frank discussion on 
strategy, trading, ﬁnancial performance and risk management. 
There were nine scheduled meetings during the year and one 
further meeting. 
During the period under review, the board’s committees also 
met regularly to discharge their duties.
In exceptional circumstances when a director is unable to 
attend a meeting, their comments on brieﬁng papers are  
given in advance to the relevant chairman. 52 The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014
Directors’ report
Insurance and indemnity
The Company has arranged insurance cover and indemniﬁes 
directors in respect of legal action against them to the extent 
permitted by law. Neither applies in situations where a director 
has acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
Conﬂicts of interest
The directors have a statutory duty to avoid conﬂicts of interest. 
In accordance with our articles of association, we have adopted 
a policy and procedure for managing and, if appropriate, 
authorising actual or potential conﬂicts of interest.
Directors are required to disclose any other new appointments 
before agreeing to take them on, so that any conﬂicts of 
interest can be identiﬁed and addressed.
The board also assesses conﬂicts of interest before making any 
new appointments.
Division of responsibilities
Between 15 July 2011 and 6 May 2014 the Company’s then 
chief executive also assumed the role of executive chairman. 
Given the size of Guoco’s shareholding in Rank, the board  
was of the view that it was important for there to be a clear 
line of communication between the Company and its majority 
shareholder and that this would be for the beneﬁt of all 
shareholders. The board was of the view that this would be 
best achieved by combining the role of chairman and chief 
executive. When Mr Burke indicated that he would like to 
retire from executive management of the business, the board 
wished to retain the established line of communication with 
Guoco and so was pleased when Mr Burke agreed to become 
non-executive chairman. The board is aware that this is not  
in compliance with Code provision A.3.1, but believes it to  
be in the best interests of all shareholders at this time. Since  
the appointment of Henry Birch as chief executive on 6 May 
2014, the role of chairman and chief executive has been split. 
We have now approved a clear division of responsibilities for 
the chairman and chief executive.
Chairman
The chairman is charged to:
• manage the business of the board, preside over meetings  
and seek prompt and appropriate decisions;
• work with the company secretary to ensure directors receive 
accurate and clear information for the proper execution of 
their duties;
• oversee effective communication with shareholders;
• keep the Group’s progress and development under review;
• ensure the chief executive’s Group objectives, policies and 
strategies are consistent with lasting shareholder value;
• evaluate the board and its committees; and
• ensure the Group’s governance is effective and in line with 
best practice.

• make sure the Group complies with all relevant  
legislation; and
• lead ongoing communication with employees.
Non-executive directors
The directors are satisﬁed that there are proper procedures  
in place to ensure that:
• they are receiving accurate and clear information for  
the proper execution of their duties;
• the Group’s objectives, policies and strategies are  
consistent with enhancing shareholder value;
• they are able to keep the Group’s progress and  
development under review;
• they have an opportunity to challenge constructively,  
and help develop, proposals on strategy;
• there are effective communications with all  
shareholders; and
• the Group’s governance is effective.
Senior independent director
Since the resignation of Colin Child on 18 March 2014,  
the Company has been endeavouring to recruit a senior 
independent director. This has proved more challenging  
than anticipated and, as at the date of this report, no suitable 
candidate has been identiﬁed. The Company is therefore in 
breach of Code provision A.4.1. The committee continues  
to seek candidates for the role of senior independent director.

More than half of our board excluding the chairman  
is independent:

from the board on 28 June 2011 and was reappointed on 3 July 2011. On 15 July 
2011 he became executive chairman. On 6 May 2014 he resigned his role as chief 
executive and became non-executive chairman with effect from that date.
2 Until 30 April 2012, Tim Scoble was not independent – he was an appointee  
of Guoco, a parent company of Rank’s largest shareholder. Tim Scoble has been 
independent since 30 April 2012 when he ceased to be an appointee of Guoco. 
The principal terms and conditions of appointment for each 
director are set out on pages 70 and 73 to 76 and their interests  
in Rank shares are detailed on page 76. 
Committees
The composition and chairmanship of our board committees 
are considered annually and have been considered twice 
during the period under review. 
Commitment
The terms of appointment of non-executive directors are 
outlined on page 70 of the directors’ remuneration report.  
All non-executive directors are required to disclose their  
other signiﬁcant commitments both before appointment and 
following subsequent changes so that the board can satisfy 
itself that each of the directors has sufﬁcient time to allocate  
to the Company to discharge their responsibilities effectively.
Neither Henry Birch nor Clive Jennings currently holds any 
directorships outside the Rank Group. Executive directors are 
not permitted to take up non-executive directorships outside 
the Group. Henry Birch was a non-executive director of the 
AIM-listed PLUS 500 Limited until 12 May 2014 and received 
fees in respect of such directorship. He was permitted to retain 
the fees relating to the six days that such directorship 
overlapped with his employment by the Company. 54 The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014
Directors’ report
Development
Induction
During the period under review, no new non-executive directors 
were appointed to the board. The chief executive was appointed 
to the board and he was given a comprehensive induction. 
Skills and knowledge
All directors are given regular written brieﬁngs with regard to 
matters affecting the Group’s businesses, such as the political 
and regulatory environment. Additionally, at the board’s 
request, the Group’s auditor keeps the board abreast of key 
impact items such as political and regulatory initiatives with 
regard to narrative reporting, executive remuneration, going 
concern and the role of the audit committee. 
Directors are invited to identify to the company secretary  
or human resources director any desired skills and knowledge 
enhancements that they require so that appropriate training 
can be arranged.
Additionally, once a year, the directors have an opportunity  
to review and agree their respective training and development 
needs during their one-on-one meetings with the chairman.
Information and support
Assisted by the company secretary, the chairman is responsible 
for ensuring that directors receive accurate and timely 
information on all relevant matters. 
The directors receive a monthly report of current and forecast 
trading results and treasury positions, as well as updates on 
shareholder views. 
A rolling programme of items sets the agenda for board 
discussion. This is regularly reviewed and updated to cover 
topical issues and developments.
Comprehensive brieﬁng papers on substantive agenda items 
are circulated at least ﬁve working days before meetings where 
possible. These contain detailed background information, thus 
freeing time for informed debate.
We operate an open-door policy between the board and the 
management team. Members of the management team also 
make regular board presentations to ensure a ﬂow of 
operational information reaches the directors in a timely way.
All directors have access to the advice and services of the 
company secretary and, if required, may take independent 
advice and/or professional development at the  
Company’s expense.
Evaluation
To monitor overall board performance, we use off-the-record 
questionnaires between the chairman and each director to 
evaluate individuals, the committees and the board as a whole. 
The chairman conducted individual interviews with each 
board member to discuss their contributions during the year. 
The non-executive directors met privately to discuss the 
effectiveness of the board and its committees during the year 
and agreed that, overall, the board had functioned effectively 
during the period under review and that its committees 
continued to discharge their duties in line with their respective 
terms of reference. The non-executive directors also met 
privately without the chairman present to discuss how the 
transition to the new chief executive was going and, although 
it was too early to make a full assessment, there was nothing 
that had emerged that was of concern to the board thus far. 
The board is mindful of the requirement to have conducted an 
externally-facilitated board evaluation by 30 June 2014. Given 
the recent board changes, it was thought that to conduct an 
evaluation now would serve little useful purpose and that more 
beneﬁt would be gained from conducting one slightly later. 
The board therefore intends conducting an evaluation during 
the ﬁnancial year ended 30 June 2015 and in this respect the 
chairman has already engaged with several board evaluation 
consultants. The Company has therefore not complied with 
Code provision B.6.2.

Re-election
All new directors must stand for election at the ﬁrst annual 
general meeting after their appointment and, thereafter, at 
intervals of no more than three years. Non-executive directors 
are engaged for an initial period of three years and must stand 
for election and re-appointment in the same way. Rank’s 
articles of association require one third of serving directors  
to retire annually.
The Company complies with the Code’s requirement  
for annual re-election of directors of FTSE 350 companies. 
Therefore all directors will also submit themselves for  
re-election at the forthcoming annual general meeting.
Relations with shareholders
Dialogue with shareholders
The board as a whole takes responsibility for ensuring that 
satisfactory dialogue with shareholders takes place. As at  
30 June 2014, 69.3% of our shares were held by our majority 
shareholder, Guoco, and its connected parties and a further 
23.5% were held by 15 institutional shareholders.
Rank’s chairman takes the lead on dialogue with the 
Company’s largest shareholder, Guoco. Additionally, given  
that Rank is a 68.9% subsidiary of Guoco, the chief executive 
and other members of Rank’s executive management team 
meet with representatives of Guoco four times a year to discuss 
business performance and other issues that could impact their 
ﬁnancial statements.
We speak with our institutional shareholders and city analysts 
through a programme of investor relations and regular 
meetings with principal shareholders conducted by our chief 
executive, ﬁnance director and director of investor relations. 
All directors receive reports to keep them in touch with 
shareholder opinion. During the period under review, a total 
of 23 meetings with 11 shareholders were attended by one or 
more of the chairman, chief executive and ﬁnance director.  
Formal brieﬁngs on shareholder opinion are circulated to  
the board after presentation of the Company’s interim and 
annual results.
The principal method of communicating with all our 
shareholders is via our corporate website, www.rank.com. 
Information can be provided in paper format but only when 
shareholders speciﬁcally request this.
Constructive use of the annual general meeting
All shareholders are welcome to attend our annual general 
meeting (“AGM”). Private investors are encouraged to ask 
questions following a summary business presentation of the 
Group’s results and development plans. 
The chairman, chief executive and chairmen of the audit, 
remuneration and nominations committees are all present. 
Shareholders are invited to vote on the formal resolutions 
contained in the notice of meeting, which is published at least 
20 working days beforehand. The business presentation and 
voting results are made available at www.rank.com, or in 
printed format on request. 
Shareholders may also use electronic means to vote – or 
appoint a proxy to vote on their behalf – at the annual and 
other general meetings of the Company.

Audit committee
Chairman
Owen O’Donnell
Other Members 
Tim Scoble, Ian Burke
Role of the audit committee
The audit committee assists the board in reviewing and 
maintaining internal controls, the management of risk  
and our compliance with law and regulation.
It monitors and reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal audit function.
It also assesses the integrity of all public ﬁnancial statements 
before their submission to the board, ensuring we present a  
fair assessment of the Group’s ongoing position and prospects. 
Any changes in accounting policies are authorised by the 
committee, which also reviews the objectivity and effectiveness 
of our external auditor every year.
The committee oversees the Company’s internal code of 
conduct and monitors our whistleblowing procedures, through 
which employees may, in conﬁdence, raise concerns about 
possible improprieties in areas of ﬁnancial reporting, ﬁnancial 
control and other ethical matters. 
The committee is regularly updated on accounting and 
legislative changes through brieﬁng papers from the auditor, 
ﬁnance director and others.
The committee’s terms of reference are available from the 
Company’s website at www.rank.com/downloads/terms 
_of_reference/tor_audit_committee.pdf, or by writing  
to the company secretary.
Audit committee membership and meetings
Until 18 March 2014 the board had an audit committee 
comprised of three independent non-executive directors. 
However, upon the resignation of the former audit committee 
chairman on 18 March 2014, the audit committee membership 
reduced to two independent non-executive directors, chaired 
by Owen O’Donnell. Pending recruitment of a new non-
executive director to serve on the audit committee, the 
Company’s chairman has joined the committee on a 
temporary basis so that there are three committee members. 
This is in breach of Code provision C.3.1 which requires the 
audit committee to consist of at least three independent 
non-executive directors.
A rolling agenda and topical items determine the committee’s 
discussions. The committee met formally three times in the 
period under review. 
Members of the audit committee as at the date of this document 
are Owen O’Donnell (chair), Tim Scoble and Ian Burke. The 
board is satisﬁed that the committee has recent and relevant 
ﬁnancial experience. 
At the invitation of the audit committee chairman, the chief 
executive, ﬁnance director, company secretary, director of 
group ﬁnancial control and director of internal audit normally 
attend committee meetings, as does the external auditor. Other 
directors are encouraged to attend at least one committee 
meeting a year at which the external auditor is present.
The internal and external auditors also meet the committee 
without executive directors and other employees being present.
Risk management
As part of its risk oversight role, the board as a whole, 
including the audit committee, satisﬁes itself that the necessary 
steps are taken to foster a culture of risk-adjusted decision-
making throughout the Group. The board strives to ensure  
that risk management is an integral component of the  
Group’s corporate strategy, culture and value generation 
process. The board’s view is that risk management should be 
neither an impediment to the conduct of business nor a mere 
supplement to the Group’s overall compliance programme.
The risk management process is reviewed by the audit 
committee on behalf of the board and monitored regularly  
by the chief executive, supported by the company secretary. 
corporate governance continued The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 57
During the year under review the audit committee has 
examined the Group’s approach to assessment of risk by 
reviewing evidence of current and emerging risk and the 
Group’s risk management processes and also by reviewing 
action plans to manage signiﬁcant risks. At its meeting in  
May 2014 the board considered and discussed its appetite  
for risk, which remained unchanged from previous years.
The Company’s risk management reporting provides 
knowledge of current and emerging risks, trends and 
opportunities that may colour strategic decisions.  
Rank communicates with regulators, Government, non-
governmental organisations and other bodies that have 
opinions about Rank’s business, its future and effects.
Compliance with the Bribery Act 2010 and HM Treasury 
Financial Sanctions forms part of the general risks and  
internal controls reported to the board. Our audit committee 
also reviews management’s bi-annual reports on anti money 
laundering, internal and external fraud, whistleblowing,  
code of conduct and inadvertent breaches of legislation.
An external risk management review of the Group’s digital 
businesses was completed in the second quarter of the 2013/14 
ﬁnancial year. That review focused on information security, 
fraud and payments, customer management and afﬁliates.  
The board considered the conclusions and recommendations 
of that review and delegated follow-up of management’s 
actions in relation to information security to the audit 
committee. The audit committee has reviewed management’s 
information security improvement programme and continues 
to monitor progress against the plan. 
During the year under review the board, through  
the former chair of the audit committee, assessed its  
understanding of and approach to so-called cyber risk.  
As a result of that assessment the board has resolved to  
work with management to understand better the importance 
of cyber risks to the business and the actions necessary to 
protect against such risks.
Internal control framework
Our system of internal control is designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, 
and provides reasonable, not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. It controls, rather than 
eliminates, any human error, deliberate misconduct or 
uncertain events. 
To maintain control and direction over strategic, ﬁnancial, 
operational and compliance issues, the board has put in  
place formally deﬁned lines of responsibility and delegation  
of authority. 
Established procedures are geared to identify, evaluate and 
manage signiﬁcant risks and to monitor the Group’s businesses 
and performance.
This framework is reviewed annually and is designed to 
safeguard shareholders’ investments and the Group’s assets, 
while ensuring that proper accounting records are maintained. 
Senior management is responsible for making sure that 
controls and procedures are enforced and that the board  
is informed of any risks and control issues that arise.
Financial control: there is a comprehensive system for 
reporting ﬁnancial results to the board, a budgeting process 
incorporating an approved budget and bi-annual re-forecasts. 
The chief executive and ﬁnance director hold monthly review 
meetings with brand managing directors and their respective 
directors of ﬁnance.
Financial reporting control: detailed policies and procedures 
are in place to ensure the accuracy and reliability of  
ﬁnancial reporting. 
Strategic control: the board reviews the Group’s strategic plans 
annually and regularly reviews strategic progress.
Operational control: our procedures are laid down in detailed 
manuals and reinforced by employee training. Each business 
unit carries out a monthly self-audit to test key controls and 
report weaknesses to operational management.
Compliance control: Across the Group we have teams whose 
responsibility it is to ensure day-to-day adherence to all 
legislation to which our operations are subject, including 
gambling, anti money laundering and health and safety.  
Senior executives and the internal audit team are responsible 
for monitoring overall compliance. They report to the audit 
committee and the board. 
The executive directors and senior management meet regularly 
with representatives from the businesses to address ﬁnancial, 
human resource, risk management and other control issues.
At its meetings in the year to 30 June 2014 the audit 
committee examined the effectiveness of the Group’s approach 
to internal control by reviewing changes to controls made 
during the year, including the implementation of a new 
general ledger system for our digital channel; approving a 
revised 2013/14 internal operational audit plan, a revised 
corporate and systems audit cycle; reviewing the structure of 
the internal audit department and the level of internal audit 
resource. The committee also reviewed action plans to address 
failings or weaknesses identiﬁed in the Group’s system of 
internal control. 58 The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014
Directors’ report
This process has been in place during the period and up to the 
date of approval of this annual report and ﬁnancial statements. 
It has been reviewed by the board and meets the Financial 
Reporting Council’s internal control guidance to directors.
Internal audit
The audit committee has responsibility for the internal audit 
function and the director of internal audit reports directly  
to the chairman of the audit committee. Our internal audit 
team provides an objective and continuous stream of data  
and opinion on risk management and control. To avoid bias,  
it is entirely independent of the business operations under 
audit, and line management is to the chairman of the audit 
committee. The audit committee agrees the annual audit plan 
and reviews audit reports produced by the internal audit team. 
The scope of the audit coverage is deﬁned by the audit 
committee and covers all systems, procedures and activities  
of all operations, departments and functions within the  
Group, including projects, policy developments, ﬁnancial  
and non-ﬁnancial processes. 
The internal audit team seeks to determine whether the system 
of risk management, control and governance processes, as 
designed and operated by management, is adequate and 
functioning in such a manner as to ensure that:
• risks are appropriately identiﬁed and managed in line with 
the Company’s risk appetite;
• operations are run with sufﬁcient and adequate controls  
and in an efﬁcient and effective manner;
• signiﬁcant ﬁnancial, managerial and operating information 
is accurate, reliable and timely;
• employee actions are in compliance with policies, standards, 
procedures, and applicable laws and regulations; and
• relevant laws, rules and regulations are complied with  
in the operation of the business.
To embed control further, the scores used by internal audit to 
monitor each business unit’s reporting performance also affect 
operational management bonuses. 
The director of internal audit makes regular presentations  
to the audit committee and reporting includes comparative 
and trend analysis. During the period under review the audit 
committee had three closed sessions with the director of 
internal audit without executive management being present.
Risk committee
During the year a risk committee was established in order to 
improve the Group’s approach to risk management. This is  
not a committee of the board. It comprises the chief executive, 
ﬁnance director, company secretary, chief information ofﬁcer 
and director of internal audit. Other employees attend 
meetings of the risk committee by invitation, as appropriate, 
depending on the speciﬁc agenda items to be discussed at the 
meeting. The risk committee meets monthly and its primary 
purpose is to:
• review the corporate risk register;
• carry out ‘deep-dive’ reviews into speciﬁc departments’ and 
functions’ risk registers; and
• provide a forum to remedy lack of progress in making agreed 
risk-mitigation actions happen.
Code of conduct
Rank has an employee code of conduct that sets out our values 
and principles and guides everyone’s behaviour. Adherence to 
the code is important. It upholds our reputation and 
relationships, inside and outside the Company.
The audit committee is responsible for monitoring 
management reports on employee conduct, including our 
whistleblowing procedures.
Financial reporting and signiﬁcant ﬁnancial issues
The committee assesses whether suitable accounting policies 
have been adopted and whether management has made 
appropriate estimates and judgements. The committee reviews 
accounting papers prepared by management which provide 
details of the main ﬁnancial reporting judgements. The 
committee also reviews reports by the external auditor on the 
full-year and half-year results which highlight any issues with 
respect to the work undertaken on the full year audit and the 
half year review.
Signiﬁcant accounting issues considered by the committee 
during the year included:
• impairment review of intangible assets and property, plant 
and equipment;
• review of provisions, including those in relation to property 
leases and indirect tax;
• review of ongoing direct tax issues;
• treatment of exceptional items; and
• contingent assets and liabilities.
corporate governance continued The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 59
Audit committee activity in 2013/14
In addition to those items detailed under internal control, risk 
management and ﬁnancial reporting and signiﬁcant ﬁnancial 
issues, during the year under review the committee’s business 
has included the following:
• full- and half-year results;
• principal judgemental accounting matters affecting the Group;
• external audit plans and reports including auditor 
observations and recommendations as a result of controls 
testing completed for the purposes of the 2012/13 and 
2013/14 audits;
• internal audit plans and key reports;
• information security and cyber risk;
• external and internal theft and fraud;
• anti money laundering;
• responsible gambling;
• litigation; and
• whistleblowing and code of conduct reports.
The committee and the board also reviewed the recently 
published formal guidance to boards with regard to cyber risk 
that had been prepared by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries 
& Administrators (ICSA) with the assistance of industry experts 
from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) 
and other industry experts on cyber risk.
Signiﬁcant ﬁnancial judgements
Before recommending the half-year and full-year ﬁnancial 
statements to the board for approval, the committee reviewed 
the following key accounting issues that rely on signiﬁcant 
ﬁnancial judgements.
Impairments – for indeﬁnite life assets not subject to 
amortisation, the Group performs an annual impairment 
review. In addition, the Group also reviews assets that are 
subject to amortisation or depreciation for events or changes  
in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount  
of an asset or cash-generating unit may not be recoverable.  
The Group considers each venue to be a cash-generating unit 
and therefore the review covers in excess of 160 individual 
cash-generating units.
The committee reviewed management’s impairment review 
process including, where applicable, the cash ﬂow projections 
and discount rate used to derive a value in use. This included 
considering the impairment charge arising in Spain of £7.5m 
where performance at three clubs has not seen the expected 
recovery following the introduction of the smoking ban in 
2011, which has been compounded by a period of prolonged 
difﬁcult economic conditions in Spain. In addition, the 
committee considered the £4.1m impairment charge at the 
Grosvenor Casinos venue in New Brighton, where performance 
has not developed as expected.
The committee was of the view that the exceptional 
impairment charges recognised of £12.9m and exceptional 
impairment reversals of £1.5m were appropriate. Further 
details of the impairment charges and reversals are disclosed  
in note 4.
Property lease provisions – at both the half and full year,  
the committee considered the Group’s approach to property 
lease provisions, the discount rate applied and management’s 
recommendations, in order to satisfy itself how management 
came to its best estimate of property lease obligations.
The committee noted that the Group has a number of property 
leasehold contracts and was of the view that appropriate 
provision had been made against those property leases where 
the unavoidable costs exceed the expected economic beneﬁt 
expected to be derived from the property. Further details of the 
property lease provision held are disclosed in note 22 and the 
exceptional adjustments made in the current year are disclosed 
in note 4.
In addition, the committee was also updated in respect of 
certain property leasehold contracts where the rights and 
obligations but not the legal titles have been transferred to 
third parties such that the Group remains potentially liable  
in the event of default by the third party. Should default  
occur then the Group would normally have recourse to one  
or more guarantor entities. These leasehold contracts include 
16 remaining property leases, with lease durations of between 
one month and 99 years and a current annual obligation  
(net of sub-let income) of approximately £1.5m, that were 
transferred concurrent to the £211m sale and leaseback in 
2006. The committee noted the risk associated with the 
transfer of such property leasehold contracts but that the 
Group has not to date been notiﬁed of any default, or intention 
to default, in respect of the transferred leases. Further details  
of this contingent liability are disclosed in note 31.
Indirect tax provisions – the committee receives and 
considers an update paper covering the Group’s indirect tax 
issues at both the half and the full year. This covers both the 
accounting treatment of the Group’s various VAT claims and 
other indirect tax issues. 
The committee was of the view that management’s best estimate 
of the liability for the issues that remained outstanding was 
appropriate. Details of the indirect tax liability recognised are 
disclosed in note 22. 60 The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014
Directors’ report
Direct tax – the committee receives and considers an update 
paper covering the Group’s ongoing direct tax issues at both 
the half and the full year. These issues cover both discontinued 
operations with historic tax audits and continuing operations 
where tax returns submitted have been, or are likely to be, 
challenged by the relevant tax authority. The committee noted 
that a number of these issues were successfully concluded 
during the year by working co-operatively with the relevant 
tax authorities.
The committee was of the view that management’s best 
estimate of the liability for the remaining issues was 
appropriate. See note 18 for details of the direct tax  
liability recognised.
Contingent assets and liabilities – the Group, as noted in  
the areas of signiﬁcant judgement above, has had to consider 
the accounting treatment of a number of potential assets and 
liabilities. This requires management to apply judgement in 
assessing the probability of occurrence or non-occurrence of 
one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the 
control of the Company.
The audit committee receives tri-annual updates from 
management, incorporating legal advice as appropriate, on  
the accounting treatment for potential assets and liabilities  
in relation to disclosure or recognition. The committee is  
of the view that management has appropriately treated such 
items in the ﬁnancial statements. Details of the contingent 
liabilities disclosed are included in note 31.
Principal risks and uncertainties
Details of the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties, and 
what we are doing to address them, can be found on pages 22 
to 25. Additionally, details of the ﬁnancial risks that the Group 
faces can be found in note 20 to the ﬁnancial statements.
Assessment of effectiveness of external audit process
Agreement on how best to assess the effectiveness of the 
external audit process was discussed and agreed between  
the audit committee and senior management. Part of the 
effectiveness of the external audit process was assessed by  
the use of a questionnaire, which posed questions in relation 
to different aspects of the external audit process. Those 
individuals employed by Rank most actively involved with the 
day-to-day aspects of the audit provided responses to certain 
questions asked of them. The responses were provided to audit 
committee members for discussion amongst themselves. 
Additionally, the audit committee considered the Financial 
Reporting Council’s audit quality review ﬁndings of Ernst & 
Young LLP’s group and subsidiary audit of Rank in respect of 
the 18-month period ended 30 June 2012 as outlined in its 
letter of 25 November 2013 to Ernst & Young LLP. 
In addition to a private meeting between the audit committee 
chair and the external audit partner, the committee met  
with the auditor following each audit committee meeting  
in a closed session without executive directors to assess the 
objectivity and accuracy of ﬁnancial reporting and to hear  
any other observations that the auditor had to make.
Audit tendering
The committee has noted the requirements regarding audit 
tender and rotation of the audit engagement partner. The 
Company’s external audit was most recently tendered during 
2009, resulting in a change of external auditors and the 
appointment of Ernst & Young LLP at the Company’s annual 
general meeting on 22 April 2010. The committee will 
continue to give consideration to the timing of the next  
formal tender in the light of the then prevailing regulatory 
requirements. The committee does not anticipate that a  
tender will be undertaken during the 2014/15 ﬁnancial  
year. There are no contractual obligations that restrict the 
choice of external auditors.
Auditor
Having reviewed their performance throughout the period,  
our conclusion that Ernst & Young LLP’s effectiveness is 
satisfactory enables us to recommend their reappointment  
for 2014/15.
The auditor, Ernst & Young LLP, is willing to continue in ofﬁce 
and a resolution that they be re-appointed, at a remuneration 
to be agreed by the audit committee, will be proposed at the 
forthcoming annual general meeting. 
Relations with external auditor
Our auditor is employed to express an opinion on the ﬁnancial 
statements. It reviews the systems of internal ﬁnancial control 
and the data contained in the ﬁnancial statements to the 
extent necessary to express its opinion. 
It discusses with management the reporting of operational 
results and the ﬁnancial position of the Group, and presents 
ﬁndings to the audit committee.

Information
The directors in ofﬁce at the date of this report are not aware  
of any relevant information that has not been made available 
to the auditor and each director has taken steps to be aware  
of all such information and to ensure it is available to the 
Company’s auditor.
Non-audit work
The audit committee oversees the nature and amount of  
any non-audit work undertaken by the auditor to ensure  
it remains independent. Consequently, the committee is 
required to approve in advance all non-audit services above  
a speciﬁed value. 
When seeking external accountancy advice in relation to 
non-audit matters, the Group’s policy is to invite competitive 
tenders where appropriate. It is also the Group’s policy to 
balance the need to maintain audit independence with the 
desirability of taking advice from the leading ﬁrm in the area 
of advice being sought and the desirability of being efﬁcient.
Details of the fees paid to Ernst & Young LLP throughout the 
period under review can be found in note 3.
Rank has used the services of other accounting ﬁrms for 
non-audit work during the period under review.
Rank is satisﬁed that the objectivity and independence of the 
audit partner and the audit engagement team have not been 
compromised by the fees paid for the non-audit work 
undertaken by Ernst & Young LLP. 
Assurance
The internal audit function and the external auditor presented 
their ﬁndings to the committee in August 2013 and in January, 
June and August 2014. We conﬁrm that action plans to remedy 
identiﬁed weaknesses in internal control have been in place 
throughout the period.

Appointments to the board
Nominations committee
The formal terms of reference of the nominations committee 
are available on our website at www.rank.com/downloads/
terms_of_reference/tor_nominations_committee.pdf, or by 
written request to the company secretary. 
The nominations committee is responsible for identifying 
relevant talent and nominating all board appointments  
with due regard for the beneﬁts of diversity on the board, 
including gender.
During the year under review the committee met formally  
on three occasions. The main issues which it discussed were:
• succession planning;
• chairmanship and membership of board committees;
• board composition; and
• board diversity. 62 The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014
Directors’ report
Mr Burke also advised the majority shareholder that he was 
considering retiring from executive management of the 
Company. The majority shareholder decided to engage an 
executive search ﬁrm, Forza International Australia Pty Ltd, to 
assist them in identifying suitable candidates that the board 
might consider. From that process, the majority shareholder 
identiﬁed Mr Birch as a suitable candidate and introduced him 
to the committee so that it might consider him for the role.
The committee agreed that Mr Birch’s experience met the 
committee’s speciﬁcation and each board member then 
interviewed Mr Birch individually. The board met to discuss 
their individual views on Mr Birch’s suitability for the role and 
concluded that he was an excellent candidate who possessed 
all the skills and attributes that it would look for in a successor 
to the chief executive. The board concluded that it should 
appoint Mr Birch to the Rank board as chief executive.
The role of chairman
The committee also considered the role of chairman. Mr Burke 
had indicated that he would, if so invited by the board, be 
willing to continue to act as chairman of Rank in a non-
executive capacity. The committee was mindful of the general 
principle that a chief executive should not go on to become 
chairman of the same company. 
However, given Mr Burke’s particular strengths, knowledge  
of the existing business and ability to manage communication 
with all shareholders, the board formed the view that it would 
be beneﬁcial for all Rank’s shareholders if Mr Burke were to 
continue as chairman but in a non-executive capacity so as  
to ensure a smooth transition of executive responsibilities.
Re-appointment of non-executive directors / appointment 
of new non-executive directors
On 11 September 2014 Owen O’Donnell will have served six 
years on the board. Mindful of Code provision B.2.3 which 
provides that any term beyond six years for a non-executive 
director should be subject to particularly rigorous review, and 
should take into account progressive refreshing of the board, 
the committee considered carefully the re-appointment of  
Mr O’Donnell for a further term. 
Board and committee composition
The nominations committee keeps the board’s size and 
structure under review. The nominations committee is of the 
view that the board is well balanced, providing a collective 
competence to suit the Group’s developing needs and an 
appropriate blend of executive and non-executive skill. We 
believe that all our directors are suitably qualiﬁed to help steer 
and challenge Group strategy.
The composition and chairmanship of our board committees 
are considered annually and have been considered twice 
during the period under review. 
Board diversity
During the period under review, the nominations committee 
has continued to consider the issue of diversity in the context 
of the board and is mindful of the beneﬁts that diversity brings 
to the board. 
The board’s diversity policy is to recruit the best candidate 
having regard to the skills and experience required, but with  
a mind to diversity, including gender diversity. The directors 
aspire to achieving 25% female representation on Rank’s board 
by 30 June 2016. 
Details of the gender breakdowns of directors, senior 
management and the Group as a whole can be found  
on page 36 of the strategic report.
Appointment of chief executive
When Mr Burke indicated to the board that he was considering 
retiring from executive management of the Company, the 
nominations committee considered the skills and attributes 
that it would look for in a potential successor to Mr Burke. The 
committee concluded that any successor to Mr Burke would, in 
addition to the typical skills and experience expected of a chief 
executive, need to have signiﬁcant expertise in digital gaming 
as this had been identiﬁed as a major strategic opportunity for 
the Group. The committee was of the view that there were no 
suitable internal candidates with the required experience on 
the Group’s succession plan to put through a formal 
assessment process. 
corporate governance continued The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 63
In this respect the committee had regard to the fact that, with 
the exception of the chairman, Mr O’Donnell was the longest 
serving member of the board and that it was desirable to retain 
some corporate memory. Additionally, it had proven challenging 
to recruit an independent director to join the audit committee 
and that it would be best for the Company if Mr O’Donnell 
served a further term. Therefore, on the recommendation  
of the nominations committee, the board re-appointed  
Mr O’Donnell as a director of the Company for a third 
three-year term commencing 11 September 2014.
The nominations committee also considered the re-appointment 
of Tim Scoble as a director. Mr Scoble served for approximately 
two years as an appointee of Rank’s majority shareholder and, by 
the time of this year’s annual general meeting in October 2014, 
will have served as an independent director for approximately 
30 months. Mr Scoble’s breadth of experience as a leisure 
operator and his prior experience as a chief executive of a listed 
company are attributes which are of beneﬁt to the Rank board 
and therefore, on the recommendation of the nominations 
committee, the board re-appointed Mr Scoble for a term of three 
years commencing 16 October 2014.
Senior independent director
The committee continues to seek candidates for the role of 
senior independent director since the resignation of Colin 
Child on 18 March 2014.
The board has established a ﬁnance committee which is 
comprised of the chairman, chief executive, ﬁnance director 
and one non-executive director, and which is authorised to 
approve capital expenditure and make ﬁnancing decisions for 
the Group up to authorised limits. On behalf of the board, the 
ﬁnance committee’s role includes setting, monitoring and 
reporting on:
• operating plans;
• monthly comparison of operating divisions’ actual ﬁnancial 
performance against budget; and
• year-end forecasts.
The committee’s terms of reference are available from the 
Company’s website at http://www.rank.com/downloads/
terms_of_reference/tor_ﬁnance_committee.pdf, or by 
writing to the company secretary.
The committee met on nine occasions during the year and the 
issues it discussed included insurance cover and uninsured 
risks and some lease renewals within its delegated authority.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
ANNUAL STATEMENT
Introduction
On behalf of the board, I have pleasure in presenting Rank’s 
directors’ remuneration report for the year ended 30 June 
2014. There are two parts to the report:
• the ﬁrst sets out Rank’s intended executive remuneration 
strategy and policy which will take effect immediately 
following the 2014 annual general meeting (the “Policy 
Report”); and
• the second describes how the remuneration policy has  
been implemented during the year ending 30 June 2014  
(the “Annual Remuneration Report”).
At the Company’s forthcoming annual general meeting on  
16 October 2014, shareholders will be invited to approve the 
Policy Report (by way of a binding vote) and the Annual 
Remuneration Report (by way of a non-binding advisory vote).
Performance outcome
Rank experienced a challenging ﬁrst half to the ﬁnancial year 
and, although performance improved in the second half, the 
improvement was not sufﬁcient to make up the lost ground  
in the ﬁrst half. Although revenue and operating proﬁt have 
grown during the year, this was due to the contribution of the 
acquired casinos. On a like-for-like basis, revenues declined 
during the year. Against this backdrop, targets for bonus 
purposes were not achieved and therefore no annual cash 
bonuses have been awarded to the executive directors.
Committee activity during the year
The key focus of the committee during the year has  
been to ensure alignment of remuneration policy with  
the Group’s business strategy and to ensure that the 
Company’s remuneration policy will continue to be 
motivating, performance-related and retention-focused.  
With this in mind the committee has embarked on a review  
of remuneration arrangements for the senior management 
team, in particular long-term incentive arrangements. The 
committee is reviewing the suitability of the current plan  
and potential changes to the plan over the course of the year. 
We will consult with shareholders regarding any new plan,  
or changes to the current plan, towards the end of the year.
Responsible gambling 
The committee gave consideration to whether it was appropriate 
to include measures tied to ‘responsible gambling’ within the 
remuneration framework in light of shareholder feedback.  
The Rank board ﬁrmly believes that responsible operation is a 
fundamental part of each employee’s day job and that to link a 
component of remuneration to responsible gambling measures 
would detract from that principle. Therefore, the committee 
and the board do not currently believe it appropriate to link 
aspects of Rank’s executive remuneration to responsible 
gambling measures. Further information with regard to Rank’s 
approach to responsible gambling can be found on page 139 
and at www.keepitfun.rank.com.
Balancing shareholder feedback
During the year the committee received feedback from 
shareholders, largely on the use of ‘end-to-end’ or ‘block’ 
awards under the long-term incentive plan. Not all 
shareholders hold the same views on executive remuneration 
and the committee has to balance the different perspectives. 
Above all, the committee needs to ensure that the 
remuneration arrangements enable Rank to attract, retain and 
motivate skilled directors and other senior executives of the 
highest calibre so as to deliver optimal returns for shareholders 
which are sustainable. In conclusion, the committee will 
continue to be mindful of the concerns of shareholders and 
other stakeholders, and welcomes shareholder feedback on 
issues related to executive remuneration.

POLICY REPORT
Remuneration and its components
The committee reviews the Company’s remuneration 
philosophy and structure each year to ensure that the 
remuneration framework remains effective in supporting  
the Company’s strategic objectives and fairly rewards 
individuals for the contribution that they make to the 
business, having regard to the size and complexity of the 
Group’s operations and the need to motivate and attract 
employees of the highest calibre.
The policy on remuneration of directors (the “Policy”) is  
set out on pages 65 to 70. A binding resolution will be put  
to shareholders at the annual general meeting to approve  
the Policy which, if approved, will take effect immediately 
following the annual general meeting on 16 October 2014.
The performance of Rank is dependent upon the quality of its 
directors, senior executives and employees and therefore the 
Group seeks to attract, retain and motivate skilled directors 
and senior executives of the highest calibre, without paying 
more than is necessary. In order to attract such individuals the 
committee needs to ensure that the remuneration packages 
properly reﬂect an individual’s duties and responsibilities, are 
appropriate and competitive, sensitive to pay elsewhere within 
the Group and directly linked to performance.
Committee approach to setting pay policy
The committee intends that the base salary and total 
remuneration of executive directors should be in line with 
market median. Remuneration is benchmarked against rewards 
available for equivalent roles in suitable comparator companies, 
with the aim of paying neither signiﬁcantly above nor below 
the median for each element of remuneration at par target 
performance levels.
The committee also considers general pay and employment 
conditions of all employees within the Group and is sensitive 
to these, to prevailing market and economic conditions and  
to governance trends when assessing the level of salaries and 
remuneration packages of executive directors and other 
members of the executive committee. 
The total remuneration package links corporate and individual 
performance with an appropriate balance between short-  
and long-term elements, and ﬁxed and variable components.  
The policy is designed to incentivise executives to meet the 
Company’s key objectives, and so a signiﬁcant proportion  
of total remuneration is performance-related.
The committee considers that the targets set for the different 
components of performance-related remuneration are both 
appropriate and sufﬁciently demanding in the context of the 
business environment and the challenges facing the Group. 66 The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014
Directors’ report
Future policy table
The key components of executive directors’ remuneration, as applicable from 16 October 2014, are summarised below:
Component
Purpose and link to  
business strategy Mechanics, operation and performance framework
Base salary To attract and retain 
skilled, high-calibre 
individuals to deliver  
the Group’s strategy.
Base salaries are reviewed annually and are appropriately set to reﬂect: 
• the role’s scope, responsibility and accountabilities;
• market data; 
• general rates of increase across the Group; and 
• the performance and effectiveness of the individual.
Any increase will take effect on 1 January of the following year.
Insured and 
other benefits
Insured and other 
beneﬁts are offered to 
executive directors as 
part of a competitive 
remuneration package.
Insured beneﬁts comprise private healthcare insurance for executive directors  
and dependants, life assurance and permanent health insurance. 
Other beneﬁts comprise a cash car allowance and the fuel cost of all mileage  
(private and business). The amount of the cash car allowance is reviewed  
periodically by the committee in the light of market conditions. 
Retirement 
provisions
Rewards sustained 
contribution and 
encourages retention.
Executive directors are automatically enrolled in The Rank Group Workplace Pension  
Scheme (the “Pension Scheme”) in accordance with the Company’s obligations under  
the Pensions Act 2008. The Company will contribute into the Pension Scheme at the  
rate of 10% of the executive director’s base salary. If the executive director chooses  
to opt out of his automatic enrolment in the Pension Scheme he is entitled to receive  
a cash allowance of an annual amount equivalent to 10% of basic salary. 
Annual bonus Motivates the 
achievement of  
annual strategic,  
ﬁnancial and personal 
performance. Rewards 
individual contribution 
to the success of the 
Company.
Rank operates an annual cash bonus scheme in which executive directors participate.  
Under the scheme an annual bonus pool is created based on the return on shareholder  
funds over a one-year period. 
The bonus plan operates on a pool system with sharing rates varying based on performance 
above a threshold. The mechanics of the plan are set by the committee at the start of the  
year with payment made after year end following the committee’s assessment of performance 
relative to targets. The primary performance measure is the return on shareholder funds, as  
this determines the size of the pool. The allocation of the pool between individuals is at the 
committee’s discretion in light of the achievement of annual ﬁnancial and strategic goals as 
well as individual performance. A full description of the performance measures in place and 
how these determine the bonus pool will be provided in the Annual Remuneration Report. 
The scheme operates a threshold level of performance below which no bonus is paid.  
However, the resulting pay-out, as a percentage of salary, will vary year-on-year in  
line with bonus pool funding. 
Long-term 
incentive plan
The long-term  
incentive plan is 
intended to align  
the interests of the 
executive directors  
and shareholders 
through the creation  
of shareholder value  
over the long term. 
The Rank Group Plc 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan is currently the only  
long-term equity-based incentive scheme in place for the executive directors and  
other senior executives. 
Executive directors may receive contingent share awards which have the ability to  
vest after a three-year period based on the achievement of speciﬁed performance targets.  
The committee may apply a further holding period to all or part of the award to further align 
directors’ interests with those of shareholders. 
The committee will determine measures and targets at the beginning of each cycle  
to ensure continuing alignment with strategy. Performance targets may relate to both 
ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial measures linked to the Company’s long-term business  
strategy, including: 
• Group EBITDA
• Group proﬁt after tax
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT continued The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 67
Maximum
Ordinarily any increases in executive directors’ base 
salaries will be limited to those received by the wider 
workforce during the year (except for reasons of 
promotion or salary being determined to be 
signiﬁcantly out of line with market median).
The committee retains the discretion to offer relocation assistance in  
the form of an allowance or otherwise to support the movement of  
executive talent across the business. If provided, the committee aims to  
ensure payments are not excessive and support business needs. As such, 
relocation assistance will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis taking into 
account factors such as the individual’s circumstances and the geographies 
involved, meaning that there is no prescribed formula for calculating the  
level or structure of payments.
It is anticipated that the provision of insured  
and other beneﬁts will not exceed 10% of salary. 
The committee may exceed this should the cost  
of the beneﬁts provided change in accordance with 
market conditions or in the event of the payment of 
relocation assistance.
The committee retains the discretion to honour all contractual pension 
arrangements agreed prior to the application of this Policy. Details of  
such arrangements are disclosed in the Annual Remuneration Report.
For all new appointments the maximum  
pension contribution (deﬁned contribution  
or cash supplement) will be 10% of base salary. 
Legacy arrangements to be honoured  
(% of salary): 
FD: 15%
The measures governing the allocation of the pool to executive directors  
will be set and disclosed retrospectively on an annual basis, to the extent  
this is not commercially sensitive. 
The annual bonus plan is discretionary and the committee reserves the right  
to adjust payments up, or down. Any such adjustment would only be in 
exceptional circumstances which would be outlined in the relevant year’s  
annual remuneration report. 
To allow the committee to assess the quality of earnings over the year and  
to introduce an element of retention into the scheme, any cash bonuses  
earned by the executive directors will be subject to a six-month deferral  
period and will be paid in the December following the 30 June ﬁnancial  
year end.
CEO: 100% of base salary 
FD: 80% of base salary
• Group annual active customers
• Group digital revenue
• Strategic objectives of the Group
The following amounts will vest in accordance with performance:
• There is no threshold level of performance under the plan.
• Maximum: 100%.
• Other points on the vesting schedule will be determined by the committee 
when the performance targets are set.
At the end of the performance period, the committee will have absolute 
discretion to determine the extent to which the awards will vest, if at all,  
on account of underlying Company performance. If discretion is applied,  
the level and reasons for its application will be fully disclosed in the 
following year’s annual report on remuneration. 
Per annum award levels (% of base salary):
CEO: 200% 
FD: 133% 
(to date three-year block awards have been granted to 
the CEO and FD at 600% and 400% of base salary 
respectively) 68 The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014
Directors’ report
Additional notes to the Policy table
Setting of performance measures and targets 
The committee reviews and selects performance measures at 
the beginning of each award cycle under both the annual 
bonus plan and the long-term incentive plan, being informed 
by the short- and long-term priorities of the Group at the time. 
The committee considers the Group’s key performance 
indicators and strategic business plan when selecting measures 
and calibrating targets. Details of these are included in the 
Annual Report each year. Factors that the committee may 
consider include the benchmark return rate on shareholder 
funds, strategic plan, the annual budget, analysts’ forecasts, 
economic conditions, individuals’ areas of responsibilities, the 
committee’s expectations over the relevant period and input 
from the major shareholder.
Differences in the remuneration policy for executives relative to the 
broader employee population
The remuneration policy in place for the executive directors is 
informed by the structure operated for the broader employee 
population. Pay levels and components vary by organisational 
level but the broad themes and philosophy remain consistent 
across the Group:
• salaries are reviewed annually with regard to the same factors 
as set out in the Policy table for executive directors;
• consistent with executive directors, senior executives 
together with general and some operational managers of  
our business units participate in the annual bonus plan, with 
bonus pool funding dependent on proﬁt performance of the 
Group or brand depending on their level;
• members of the senior management team can be considered 
for awards under the long-term incentive plan. This is 
intended to encourage share ownership in the Company  
and align the management team with the strategic business 
plan; and
• eligibility for and provision of beneﬁts and allowances varies 
by level and local market practice. It is standard for senior 
management team members to receive a company car 
allowance. Pension provision below board level is overall  
at lower contribution rates, with the majority of Rank’s 
eligible employees now being automatically enrolled into 
the Pension Scheme. However, a signiﬁcant proportion of 
employees remain in The Rank Group Stakeholder Pension 
Plan, where the standard contribution rates are the same as  
those offered to board-level members.
Potential reward opportunities at different levels of performance
The following graphs exhibit the Policy for existing executive 
directors and show indicative total remuneration levels under 
different performance scenarios. The remuneration policy 
results in a high portion of total remuneration being 
dependent on performance, with a majority tied to the 
long-term performance of the Group. 
The annual bonus and long-term incentive schemes do not 
operate an ‘on-target’ award level. Under the bonus scheme 
awards will depend on bonus pool funding and as such are 
variable year-on-year. A maximum cap is in place under the 
scheme. Under the long-term incentive plan performance is 
considered against each selected metric independently with 
committee discretion applied as to the level of overall vesting. 
Given the structure of incentive arrangements we have not 
provided an ‘on-target’ scenario in the following charts, rather 
a minimum and maximum only which better reﬂects the 
operation of the incentive schemes at Rank. The two 
performance scenarios are calculated as follows:
• Minimum – performance below target which results in no 
variable remuneration being payable. 
• Maximum – 100% of the maximum annual cash bonus and 
full vesting of the long-term incentive award achieved.

Assumptions:
Fixed elements comprise base salary, pension and beneﬁts. Base salary and pension 
levels are as at 1 July 2014. Beneﬁt levels are assumed to be the same as those 
provided during the last ﬁnancial year. As Henry Birch became chief executive 
during 2013/14, his beneﬁt levels have been annualised.
The long-term incentive award values depicted in the charts above represent the 
annualised opportunity to directors under the currently-operated remuneration policy.
The graph depicting policy for the chief executive represents policy as applied  
to Henry Birch, the new chief executive of the Company. Ian Burke, the former 
chief executive, now acts as chairman and is not subject to the executive director 
remuneration policy going forward.
No account is made for share price growth or the payment of dividends.
No element of pay for the chairman or non-executive directors varies with 
performance and so no separate graphs are included. 
Approach to recruitment remuneration
The committee will apply the Policy to new executive directors 
in respect of all components of remuneration. As such, the 
maximum level of variable remuneration which may be 
granted is 300% of base salary on an annualised basis for the 
CEO and 213% of base salary on an annualised basis for other 
executive directors.
The committee may also make an additional award of cash  
or shares on the appointment of a new director in order to 
compensate for the forfeiture of an award from a previous 
employer. Such awards would be made on a comparable  
basis, taking account of performance, the proportion of  
the performance period remaining and the type of award.  
The committee will set appropriate performance conditions 
and vesting would be on the same time horizon as the  
forfeited award.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT continued The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 69
For both internal and external appointments, the committee 
may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation 
expenses, as set out in the Policy table.
New non-executive directors will be appointed on the same 
remuneration elements as the existing non-executive directors. 
It is not intended that variable pay, day rates or beneﬁts in 
kind be offered.
Approach to termination payments
The Company does not believe in reward for failure.  
The circumstances of a director’s termination (including the 
director’s performance) and an individual’s duty to mitigate 
losses are taken into account in every case. Rank’s policy  
is to stop or reduce compensatory payments to former 
executive directors to the extent that they receive remuneration 
from other employment during the compensation period. 
Compensatory payments are limited to 12 months’ base  
salary, cash car allowance and deﬁned pension contributions 
(or salary supplements).
Annual bonus awards will lapse in their entirety in the event 
an individual is no longer employed or serving their notice 
period at the time of pay-out.
If the holder of a long-term incentive award ceases, for any 
reason, to be an executive director or employee of a Rank 
Group company, that holder’s long-term incentive award  
shall lapse immediately upon him ceasing to be an executive 
director or employee. However, the committee may in its 
absolute discretion allow awards to continue until the normal 
vesting date and be satisﬁed, subject to the achievement of  
the relevant performance conditions. In such circumstances, 
awards vesting will be prorated on a time-apportioned basis, 
unless the committee determines otherwise. Any such 
discretion in respect of leavers would only be applied by the 
committee to ‘good leavers’ where it considers that continued 
participation is justiﬁed, for example, by reference to past 
performance to the date of leaving. 
Change of control
In the event of a change of control, the committee has 
absolute discretion as to whether and on what basis awards 
should vest under the long-term incentive plan. The committee 
would normally allow awards to vest upon a change of control 
subject to satisfaction of performance conditions and reduction 
on a time-apportioned basis.
Executive directors’ service agreements
It is the Company’s policy that executive directors have rolling service agreements.
The current executive directors’ service contracts contain the key terms shown in the table below:
Provision Detailed terms
Remuneration • Base salary, pension and beneﬁts
• Cash car allowance
• Private health insurance for director and dependants
• Life assurance
• Permanent health insurance
• Participation in annual bonus plan, subject to plan rules
• Participation in long-term incentive plan, subject to plan rules
• 25 days’ paid annual leave
Notice period • 12 months’ notice from both the Company and from the director
Termination payment Payment in lieu of notice equal to:
• 12 months’ base salary
• Cash car allowance (chief executive only)
• Pension supplement (chief executive only)
All of the above would be paid in monthly instalments, subject to an obligation on the part of the 
director to mitigate his loss such that payments would either reduce, or cease completely, in the event 
that the director gained new employment.
Restrictive covenants During employment and for nine months (chief executive) and 12 months (ﬁnance director)  
after leaving.
Service agreements outline the components of remuneration paid to the individual director but do not prescribe how 
remuneration levels may be adjusted from year to year.
The executive directors have served on the board for the periods shown below and have service agreements dated

Directors’ report
Chairman
The Company separated the role of chairman and chief 
executive with effect from 6 May 2014. 
The chairman, Ian Burke, has a letter of engagement dated  
22 April 2014 which is effective from 6 May 2014 and which 
replaced his service agreement dated 6 March 2006 in respect 
of his former role as chief executive. He has initially been 
engaged as non-executive chairman for a period of three years. 
His appointment is terminable without compensation on three 
months’ notice from either side. The chairman receives a fee of 
£150,000 per annum which includes his chairmanship of the 
nominations and ﬁnance committees. This fee will be reviewed 
annually by the committee, with reference to the size and 
complexity of the role and external market comparisons, in  
the ﬁnal quarter of each calendar year with any increase taking 
effect on 1 January. The chairman is not entitled to any beneﬁts 
in kind and is not eligible for pension scheme membership, 
bonus or incentive arrangements.
Non-executive directors’ remuneration
The fees for the non-executive directors are generally reviewed 
and determined by the ﬁnance committee in the ﬁnal quarter 
of each calendar year to reﬂect appropriate market conditions. 
Non-executive director annual base and additional fees for the 
year ended 30 June 2014 comprise:
• Base non-executive annual fee  £40,000
• Audit committee chair   £8,500
• Remuneration committee chair  £7,500
• Senior independent director  £2,500
The base fee includes membership of the audit, remuneration, 
nominations and ﬁnance committees. Non-executive directors 
are not entitled to any beneﬁts in kind and are not eligible for 
pension scheme membership, bonus or incentive arrangements.
The Company reserves the right to review fee levels annually 
with reference to the size and complexity of the role and 
external market comparisons. Any increases to fee levels will be 
effective from 1 January the following year. The aggregate fees 
will not exceed the maximum permitted by the Company’s 
articles of association, which is currently £500,000. 
Non-executive directors have letters of engagement setting out 
their duties and the time commitment expected. They are 
appointed for an initial period of three years, after which the 
appointment is renewable by mutual consent at intervals of

Shareholder engagement 
The table on page 78 shows the voting outcome for the 
2012/13 directors’ remuneration report at the 2013 annual 
general meeting, both including and excluding the Company’s 
majority shareholder.
The voting outcome for the 2013 directors’ remuneration 
report, although disappointing, was not wholly unexpected 
given the feedback received from the institutional shareholder 
consultation that had taken place regarding proposals for the 
2012/13 long-term incentive award. Whilst the committee had 
been mindful of the reservations of some shareholders with 
regard to ‘end-to-end’ schemes (also known as ‘block’ awards), 
the committee had also considered the views of the majority 
shareholder. The majority shareholder was of the view that 
Rank’s historical long-term incentive awards based on 
incremental earnings per share targets were not incentivising 
management to deliver transformational growth and therefore 
superior returns for the beneﬁt of all shareholders. The 
majority shareholder had experience elsewhere in its group  
of companies of ‘end-to-end’ schemes working well to deliver 
exceptional performance and urged the committee to consider 
the beneﬁts to all shareholders of incentivising executives  
in a different way. The committee will be re-considering  
this approach in 2014 and anticipates undertaking a further 
shareholder consultation in the latter part of the 2014 calendar 
year for the purposes of implementing a new long-term 
incentive scheme.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere  
in the Company
As described in the notes to the Policy table on page 68 the 
overarching themes of the Policy in place for executive 
directors are broadly consistent with those applied to the wider 
employee population. The committee does not use any 
comparison metrics when reviewing pay in relation to the 
wider employee population, other than the consideration of 
the general rates of increase across the Group, nor does it deem 
it to be appropriate to consult with employees on the 
remuneration policy for executive directors. The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 71

Annual remuneration report
The directors’ remuneration report has been prepared on 
behalf of the board by the remuneration committee (the 
“committee”), under the chairmanship of Tim Scoble.
The committee has applied the principles of good governance 
set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code and, in 
preparing this report, has complied with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006 and the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2013 (the “Regulations”). 
Rank’s external auditor is required to report to shareholders on 
the audited information contained in this report and to state 
whether, in its opinion, it has been prepared in accordance 
with the Regulations. The audited information in the Annual 
Remuneration Report is as follows: directors’ single 
remuneration ﬁgure, contingent share awards with a 
performance period ended on 31 December 2013, active 
contingent share awards and targets as at 30 June 2014, 
pensions, other payments and obligations, share ownership 
guidelines and directors’ interests in shares.
Total shareholder return
The following graph illustrates the Company’s total 
shareholder return (“TSR”) performance (shown in red on  
the following charts) compared with the FTSE 350 index 
(excluding investment companies) for the ﬁve years to  
30 June 2014. The committee has selected this index as the 
Company was a constituent of the FTSE 350 for the entirety of 
this period. In addition, the committee feels it also appropriate 
to provide a view of TSR for the ﬁve years to 31 December 
2013, allowing for the fact that the performance period of the 
contingent share award made in 2011 was the three calendar 
years ended 31 December 2013. 72 The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014

1 This included an exceptional discretionary bonus equal to 100% of base salary to reward exceptional efforts on behalf of the then chief executive in creating additional 
sustainable long-term shareholder value via the transformation of the Company’s balance sheet that was paid by three equal instalments in September 2012, April 2013 
and December 2013.
1 In the Company’s 2012/13 annual report, the bonus pool available for distribution was stated as being £450,000. That ﬁgure was total cost to the 
Company in the event that the available bonus pool was paid out (ie: it was inclusive of associated employer’s national insurance contributions).
Base salary
There were no increases to base salary for the executive 
directors or other members of the executive committee during 
the year ended 30 June 2014. Base salaries for the executive 
directors as at 1 July 2014 are:
• Chief executive £450,000
• Finance director £300,000
Annual bonus plan
The annual bonus plan is structured as a pool, funded each 
year as a percentage of adjusted proﬁt for the year with the 
sharing rate dependent on performance. Performance is based 
on the rate of return achieved on opening shareholder funds 
for the year. Shareholder funds is determined by the market 
value of the Group when the scheme was introduced in July 
2012, inﬂated annually by the difference between proﬁt after 
tax, exceptionals and discontinued operations for the year and 
cash dividends paid to shareholders. The target rate of return is 
set at the beginning of each year by the committee. If the 
target rate of return is achieved a bonus pool of 2% of 
shareholder funds is created. A modiﬁer is applied to the bonus 
rate for below target performance. At the minimum rate of 
return, the bonus pool modiﬁer is set at 50% up to 100% at the 
maximum rate of return. The remuneration committee has the 
discretion to exclude items reported as discontinued or 
exceptional. The bonus pool is allocated at the discretion of 
the committee with regard to individual, corporate and relative 
performance to peers.
2012/13 annual cash bonus
At the time of publication of last year’s report, the committee 
had not determined the extent to which the executive directors 
had earned a bonus. The committee is therefore reporting in 
this year’s report the outcome of that year’s bonus scheme. 
The target Group adjusted proﬁt after tax in order to trigger 
creation of a bonus pool in that year was £38.2m, with  
the target required for maximum bonus entitlement being 
£54.5m. The Group achieved £39.2m adjusted proﬁt after tax 
which resulted in the creation of a bonus pool of £391,540
1
 
(equal to 1% of the Group adjusted proﬁt after tax) for 
distribution amongst the executive directors and other 
members of the executive committee at the discretion of  
the committee. 
Taking into consideration the performance of the Group as a 
whole, the executive directors were of the view that it would 
not be appropriate to receive a bonus in respect of ﬁnancial 
year 2012/13 and recommended to the committee that  
no bonus be paid for the year. The committee accepted  
this recommendation. 
2013/14 annual cash bonus
The target Group proﬁt after tax in order to trigger creation  
of a bonus pool for that year was £43.6m, with the target 
required for maximum bonus entitlement being £62.3m.  
The Group did not achieve the minimum rate of return  
and consequentially no bonus pool has been created  
for distribution. 74 The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014

Contingent share awards with a performance period ended on 31 December 2013
Following the half year end on 31 December 2013, the committee considered whether the 2011 three-year contingent share 
awards should vest. The details and targets for those awards were:

Mean consensus EPS forecast prior to grant 11.7p 11.7p
Adjusted EPS at end of performance period  
on 31 December 2013 11.8p 11.8p
Given that the adjusted EPS at the end of the performance period on 31 December 2013 was less than the minimum required for 
threshold vesting, the contingent share awards made in 2011 lapsed in full.
The table below, which is unaudited, sets out the vesting percentage of each LTIP award made to executive directors within the 
last ﬁve years and the vesting percentage of the sole extant award, had it vested on 30 June 2014:

Group proﬁt after tax £63.3m
Group annual active customers 3,175,000
Group digital revenue £109.2m
Strategic objectives of the Group Speciﬁc objectives deemed to be commercially sensitive 
by the committee
1 Henry Birch’s award was made on the same basis of that to Ian Burke but pro-rated so as to reﬂect his joining part way through the three-year performance period.
As reported last year, in 2013 the committee resolved to make ‘block’ contingent share awards to the executive directors and 
other senior executives covering the period 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2015. The award sizes for the chief executive and ﬁnance 
director were, respectively, 6.0x and 4.0x base salary, equivalent to an annual award of 2.0x base salary for the chief executive 
and 1.33x for the ﬁnance director. Ian Burke’s contingent award over 2,022,978 shares, made on 26 June 2013 lapsed in full 
upon his ceasing to be an executive director on 6 May 2014.
The performance targets for the Award, which are set out in the table above, will be measured against the audited consolidated 
results of the Company for the ﬁnancial year ended 30 June 2015. To the extent that achievement of a performance target  
would not ordinarily be readily identiﬁable from the published audited consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the Company  
for the ﬁnancial year ended 30 June 2015, the auditor of the Company will be requested to include a review of the relevant 
performance target as part of its year-end audit procedures for the ﬁnancial year ended 30 June 2015.
Where not all of the performance targets are met, the committee will determine the extent to which the Awards shall vest,  
if at all, based upon the performance against the set objectives.
Notwithstanding achievement of all or any part of the performance targets, the directors have absolute discretion to determine 
the extent to which the Awards will vest, if at all, having regard to the Company’s TSR performance over the performance period 
as compared with the comparable TSR performance of companies within the FTSE 350 Index. 76 The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014

Pensions
Ian Burke received a salary supplement equal to 35% of his 
base salary in lieu of pension until 16 May 2014. Henry Birch 
received a salary supplement equal to 10% of his base salary 
from the date of his appointment on 6 May 2014. Until 30 
March 2014, Clive Jennings was a member of The Rank Group 
Stakeholder Pension Plan and received a Company pension 
contribution of 15% of base salary less the statutory ‘lower 
earnings limit’. Since 1 April 2014 he has received a cash 
supplement in lieu of those Company contributions.

Other payments and obligations
No payment for compensation for loss of ofﬁce was paid  
to, or receivable by, Ian Burke upon his resignation as chief 
executive. No other executive directors left the Company 
during the year ended 30 June 2014 and therefore no payments 
for compensation for loss of ofﬁce were paid to, or receivable 
by, any director (30 June 2013: £nil). With the exception of  
a payment to the widow of John Garrett, a former executive 
director who resigned on 2 February 1998, who received 
£44,035 (2012/13: £42,855) in respect of an unfunded pension 
obligation, no payments were made during the year ended  
30 June 2014 to any past director of the Company.
External appointments 
Executive directors are not permitted to take up non-executive 
directorships outside the Group. Henry Birch was a non-
executive director of the AIM-listed PLUS 500 Limited until  
12 May 2014 and received fees in respect of such directorship. 
He was permitted to retain the fees relating to the six days  
that such directorship overlapped with his employment  
by the Company.
Share ownership guidelines and directors’ interests in shares
Below we set out details of the share ownership guidelines in 
operation until October 2011. In light of the Company’s free 
ﬂoat position (see page 80), these have been suspended until a 
higher free ﬂoat position is achieved.
Until October 2011, independent non-executive directors were 
using between 30% and 40% of their base net fees (after tax) to 
purchase ordinary shares in the Company at quarterly 
intervals, with the intention that such shares be retained 
throughout their tenure of service. 
Similarly, the Group had guidelines for executive shareholding 
which were set as a percentage of base salary and in respect of 
which executives had ﬁve years from appointment to build up. 
These guidelines were as follows:
Chief executive 150%
Finance director 100%
Other executive committee members 50%
Shareholdings of directors of the Company and its subsidiaries 
are not considered to be in public hands for the purposes  
of determining the sufﬁciency of the percentage of shares in 
public hands (the “free ﬂoat”) in the context of qualiﬁcation 
for a listing on the UKLA’s premium market. In view of the  
low level of free ﬂoat following the completion of Guoco 
Group Limited’s general offer for Rank in July 2011, the 
non-executive director quarterly share purchase programme 
and the shareholding guidelines for executive directors and 
other members of the executive committee who are directors 
of Rank subsidiary companies were suspended pending  
a restoration of the Company’s free ﬂoat to a higher level.  
For further information with regard to the Company’s free  
ﬂoat position, please see page 80.

The LTIP, being the Company’s only equity-based incentive 
plan, incorporates the current ABI guidelines on headroom 
which provide that overall dilution under all plans should not 
exceed 10% over a 10-year period in relation to the Company’s 
issued share capital, with a further limitation of 5% in any 
10-year period for executive plans.
The committee regularly monitors the position and prior to 
the making of any award considers the effect of potential 
vesting of awards to ensure that the Company remains within 
these limits. Any awards which are required to be satisﬁed by 
market purchased shares are excluded from the calculations. 
No treasury shares were held or utilised in the year ended  
30 June 2014.
Relative importance of spend on pay
The table below shows the expenditure and percentage change 
in overall spend on employee remuneration and distributions 
paid to shareholders through the dividend paid in the year and 
share buybacks.

The table below sets out the chief executive’s base salary, 
beneﬁts and annual bonus amounts for the period from when 
he joined on 6 May 2014 to 30 June 2014. As the chief 
executive was appointed during the year, no year-on-year 
change can be reported. We show the average change in gross 
earnings for all UK employees across the Group.

1  Mr Birch joined the Group on 6 May 2014 and therefore has not had a pay 
increase during the year under review. His predecessor, Mr Burke, who stood 
down as chief executive on 6 May 2014, did not have a pay increase during the 
year under review.
2 For the avoidance of doubt ‘all UK employees’ includes the former and current 
chief executives. Individual compensation elements for the wider employee 
population are not readily available to compare separately, hence providing gross 
earnings as our main comparison metric.
3 ‘Gross earnings’ excludes insured beneﬁts and pension payments. Gross earnings 
for employees of the former Gala casinos, acquired in May 2013, are also 
excluded from this value, as 2012/13 gross earnings ﬁgures are unavailable for 
comparison to 2013/14 ﬁgures.
Role and remit of the committee
The committee assists the board in setting the remuneration 
packages for the Company’s executive directors and other 
executive committee members.
The committee has three scheduled meetings a year to discuss 
a rolling agenda of items and additional meetings are 
convened as necessary. By invitation, the chief executive, 
human resources director, company secretary and, since 6 May 
2014, the chairman attend and contribute to meetings, but are 
not present at discussions regarding their own remuneration.
The committee’s formal terms of reference are available on 
Rank’s website at www.rank.com/downloads/terms_of_
reference/tor_remuneration_committee.pdf, or by written 
request to the company secretary.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT continued
Advisers to the committee
The committee has access to external information and research 
on market data and trends from independent consultants. 
After a tender process Towers Watson were appointed as 
external remuneration advisers to the committee. They have 
been sole advisers to the committee since January 2007. Towers 
Watson is a member of the Remuneration Consultants’ Group, 
the body which oversees the code of conduct in relation to 
executive remuneration consulting in the United Kingdom.
The current and former chief executives, the company 
secretary and the human resources director provided assistance 
to the committee during the year. They attended meetings of 
the committee, although none of them was involved in any 
decisions relating to his or her own remuneration.
Towers Watson attended two out of the committee’s seven 
meetings during the year. During the year, the committee 
requested Towers Watson to advise on matters including 
remuneration of the combined role of the chairman and  
chief executive and the roles of the ﬁnance director and other 
executive committee members. Towers Watson also provided 
the TSR performance graph for the directors’ remuneration 
report. Towers Watson was paid fees totalling £38,884 for 
services provided to the committee during the year (fees are 
based on hours spent). Towers Watson did not provide any 
other services to the Group during the period under review. 
The committee remains satisﬁed that Towers Watson’s advice 
was objective and independent and that Towers Watson’s 
provision of other services in no way compromises  
its independence.
Committee evaluation
The committee’s performance during the period under review 
was assessed via conﬁdential questionnaires with committee 
members and other individuals who support its work. Results 
were then reviewed by the committee chairman and discussed 
with the board. The board agreed that the committee 
continued to perform effectively.
Implementation of policy in 2014/15
For the following ﬁnancial year it is not anticipated that the 
Policy outlined on pages 65 to 70 will change and therefore  
the committee will manage pay decisions within the set Policy.
Salaries will be reviewed with any changes effective 1 January 
2015. The executive directors will participate in the annual 
bonus plan as per the Policy. It is the view of the committee 
that the absolute targets, as well as the targets governing 
individuals’ allocations, are commercially sensitive. The proﬁt 
growth targets and actual performance will be disclosed in next 
year’s report as they have been this year. 
As reported on page 64, the committee is mindful of the 
concerns of shareholders with regard to the use of ‘block’ awards 
as long-term incentives for management. The committee is 
considering whether or not a further ‘block’ award should be 
made or whether it should revert to the more usual practice of 
annual awards. It is anticipated that the committee will engage 
with its largest shareholders on this subject towards the end of 
the calendar year 2014.
We believe that our policy continues to be aligned with our 
strategic goal of creating long-term sustainable value for 
shareholders. We welcome shareholder feedback on issues 
related to executive remuneration.

the percentage voting rights reach, exceed or fall below 3%

Under Listing Rule 6.1.19R, shares held by persons who have 
an interest in 5% or more of a listed company’s share capital 
are not regarded as being held in public hands (the “free ﬂoat”). 
Under this rule, the shares held by Hong Leong and Prudential 
plc and subsidiary companies (“Prudential”) may not be 
regarded as being in public hands, with the result that the 
number of Rank’s shares distributed to the public is below the 
25% threshold set out in Listing Rule 6.1.19R. Under Listing 
Rule 6.1.20A, the FCA may modify Listing Rule 6.1.19R to 
accept a percentage below 25% if it considers that the market 
will operate properly with a lower percentage. Under Listing 
Rule 5.2.1R, the FCA has the power to cancel the listing of 
securities if it is satisﬁed that there are special circumstances 
that preclude normal regular dealings in them. On 3 July 2013 
Guoco announced that it had declared a special interim 
dividend in specie of approximately 88.84 million Rank  
shares representing 22.74% of Rank (the “Distribution”).  
That Distribution reduced the overall interest of Hong Leong 
from 74.5% to 68.9%. However, due to the fact that Prudential’s 
shares are not regarded as being in public hands, the free  
ﬂoat remains below the 25% threshold. The Company  
has made a formal submission to the FCA requesting it to 
modify LR 6.1.19 R, so it can continue to be a premium listed 
company with a slightly lower free ﬂoat percentage than 25%.
Directors’ interests in shares
Please see page 76 of the directors’ remuneration report  
for details of the directors’ interests in shares.
Rights and restrictions attaching to shares
Voting rights
Each ordinary share carries the right to one vote at general 
meetings of the Company.
Meeting rights
Registered holders of ordinary shares are entitled to attend  
and speak at general meetings and to appoint proxies.
Information rights
Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive the 
Company’s annual report and ﬁnancial statements.
Share transfer restrictions
There are no speciﬁc restrictions on the transfer of shares 
contained in the Company’s articles of association.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between the 
holders of Rank shares that may result in restrictions on  
the transfer of shares or that may result in restrictions on 
voting rights.
Variation of rights
Subject to applicable legislation, the rights attached to Rank’s 
ordinary shares may be varied with the written consent of  
the holders of at least three-quarters in nominal value of those 
shares, or by a special resolution passed at a general meeting  
of the ordinary shareholders.
Directors’ powers in relation to shares
Allotment and issue of shares
Subject to the provisions of the CA 2006, and subject to any 
resolution passed by the Company pursuant to the CA 2006 
and other shareholder rights, shares in Rank may be issued 
with such rights and restrictions as the Company may by 
ordinary resolution decide. If there is no such resolution or  
so far as the Company does not make speciﬁc provision, they 
may be issued as Rank’s board of directors may decide. Subject 
to the Company’s articles of association, the CA 2006 and 
other shareholder rights, unissued shares are at the disposal  
of the board.  The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 81
The Company currently has no shareholder authority to  
allot and grant rights over any proportion of the Company’s 
unissued share capital, nor does it have shareholders’ authority 
to allot and grant rights over ordinary shares without ﬁrst 
making a pro rata offer to all existing ordinary shareholders. 
Neither of these authorities is required for the purpose of 
allotting shares pursuant to employee share schemes. Since the 
board has no present intention of allotting shares for any other 
reason, these shareholder authorities will not be sought at the 
forthcoming annual general meeting.
Market purchases of own shares
The Company currently has no shareholder authority  
to make market purchases of its own shares and it has no 
present intention of making any such purchases. Therefore  
the Company does not intend to seek such authority at the 
forthcoming annual general meeting.
Directors’ other powers
Subject to legislation, the directors may exercise all the powers 
permitted by the Company’s memorandum and articles of 
association. A copy of these can be obtained by writing to  
the company secretary, or from Companies House.
The articles contain provisions to empower the directors  
on certain speciﬁc matters, including:
• appointment of directors, subject to subsequent  
shareholder approval;
• delegation of powers to a director, secretary or committee  
of one or more persons;
• the Company’s powers to borrow money; and
• the ability of a director to vote on matters in which he has 
an interest.
Changes to the Company’s articles of association can only be 
made by a resolution passed by a majority of no less than 75% 
of shareholders.
Change of control
Our principal term loan and credit facility agreements  
contain provisions that, on a change of control of Rank, 
immediate repayment can be demanded of all advances  
and any accrued interest.
The provisions of the Company’s share schemes and incentive 
plans may cause options and awards granted to employees  
to vest in the event of a takeover.
A change of control may also affect licences to operate, as 
speciﬁed in the provisions of the Gambling Act 2005 and  
the Alderney eGambling Regulations 2009 (as amended)  
and the Belgian Games of Chance Act 1999 (as amended).
Political donations
We made no political donations during the period  
under review.
It has been Rank’s long-standing practice not to make cash 
payments to political parties and the board intends that this 
will remain the case. However, the Companies Act 2006 is  
very broadly drafted and could catch activities such as funding 
seminars and other functions to which politicians are invited, 
supporting certain bodies involved in policy review and  
law reform and matching employees’ donations to certain 
charities. Accordingly, as in previous years, the directors will  
be seeking shareholders’ authority for political donations and 
political expenditure at the forthcoming annual general 
meeting in case any of Rank’s activities are inadvertently 
caught by the legislation.
Dividend
Please see the chairman’s statement on page 9 for details of the 
ﬁnal dividend being recommended.
Going concern
The going concern statement can be found in the ﬁnancial 
review on page 40.
Employees with disabilities
Please see the operating responsibly section of our strategic 
report on page 36 for the disclosure required by Part 3 of 
Schedule 7 to the 2008 Regulations relating to the employment 
of disabled persons.
Greenhouse gas emissions
Please see the operating responsibly section of our strategic 
report on page 37 for the disclosure required by Part 7 of 
Schedule 7 to the 2008 Regulations relating to greenhouse 
gas emissions.

Financial Statements
Annual report and ﬁnancial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report 
(including the directors’ report, the strategic report, the 
directors’ remuneration report and the corporate governance 
statement) and the ﬁnancial statements of the Group and the 
Company, in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law 
and regulations. Company law requires the directors to prepare 
Group and Company ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial 
year. Under that law, the directors are required to prepare 
Group ﬁnancial statements under IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union. As permitted by the Companies Act 2006,  
the directors have elected to prepare the Company ﬁnancial 
statements under IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. 
Under company law the directors must not approve the Group 
and Company ﬁnancial statements unless they are satisﬁed 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Group and Company and of the proﬁt or loss of the Group  
for that period. In preparing the Group and Company  
ﬁnancial statements, the directors are required to:
• present fairly the ﬁnancial position, ﬁnancial performance 
and cash ﬂows of the Group and Company;
• select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8: 
Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors 
and then apply them consistently;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
• make judgements that are reasonable; 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
speciﬁc requirements in IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union is insufﬁcient to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, other events and 
conditions on the Group and Company’s ﬁnancial position 
and ﬁnancial performance; and
• state whether the ﬁnancial statements have been prepared  
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained  
in the ﬁnancial statements.
The directors conﬁrm that they have complied with all of  
the above.
Accounting records 
The directors must keep proper accounting records that 
disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the ﬁnancial 
position of the Company and the Group and ensure that the 
Group ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006 and, for the Group ﬁnancial statements, Article 4 of the 
International Accounting Standard (IAS) Regulation. 
Safeguarding assets
The directors are also accountable for safeguarding the assets of 
the Company and the Group and, therefore, for taking reasonable 
steps to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Corporate website
The maintenance and integrity of Rank’s corporate website,  
on which this annual report and ﬁnancial statements are 
published, is the board’s responsibility. We would draw 
attention to the fact that legislation in the UK on the 
preparation and publication of ﬁnancial statements may  
differ from that in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibilities’ statement

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 85
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements
In our opinion:
• the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the  
state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs  
as at 30 June 2014 and of the Group’s proﬁt for the year  
then ended;
• the Group ﬁnancial statements have been properly  
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union; and 
• the parent company ﬁnancial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union and as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• the ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and,  
as regards the Group ﬁnancial statements, Article 4 of  
the IAS Regulation.
What we have audited 
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements of The Rank Group 
Plc for the year ended 30 June 2014 which comprise the Group 
income statement, the Group statement of comprehensive 
income, the Group and Company balance sheets, the Group 
and Company statements of changes in equity, the Group and 
Company statements of cash ﬂow, and the related notes 1 to 
33. The ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been applied in 
their preparation is applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union 
and, as regards the parent company ﬁnancial statements,  
as applied in accordance with the provisions of the  
Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members,  
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so 
that we might state to the Company’s members those matters 
we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for 
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do 
not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities’ 
statement set out on page 84, the directors are responsible  
for the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements and for being 
satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility 
is to audit and express an opinion on the ﬁnancial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards 
for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts  
and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to give 
reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.  
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent 
company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of signiﬁcant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. In addition, we read 
all the ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial information in the annual 
report and accounts to identify material inconsistencies with 
the audited ﬁnancial statements and to identify any 
information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or 
materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in 
the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we 
consider the implications for our report.
Our assessment of risk of material misstatement
We identiﬁed the following risks that have the greatest impact 
on our audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit 
and directing the efforts of the engagement team:
• inaccuracy of revenue reported from casino and  
bingo venues;
• inaccuracy of revenue reported from casino and bingo  
digital channels;
• identiﬁcation and assessment of impairment of intangible 
and tangible assets and goodwill and investments; 
• incorrect provisions made in relation to property leases; and
• inaccurate provisions made in relation to direct and indirect 
tax risk exposures and claims/reclaims in relation to 
continuing and discontinuing businesses.
Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and 
performing our audit, and in evaluating the effect of 
misstatements on our audit and on the ﬁnancial statements. 
For the purposes of determining whether the ﬁnancial 
statements are free from material misstatement we deﬁne 
materiality as the magnitude of misstatement that makes  
it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably 
knowledgeable person, relying on the ﬁnancial statements, 
would be changed or inﬂuenced. We also determine a level of 
performance materiality which we use to determine the extent 
of testing needed to reduce, to an appropriately low level, the 
probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected 
misstatements exceeds materiality for the ﬁnancial statements 
as a whole.
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF THE RANK GROUP PLC 86 The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014
Financial Statements
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF THE RANK GROUP PLC continued
When establishing our overall audit strategy, we determined  
a magnitude of uncorrected misstatements that we judged 
would be material for the ﬁnancial statements as a whole.  
We determined planning materiality for the Group to be 
£3.2m, which is 5% of adjusted proﬁt before tax for the year 
ended 30 June 2014. We used adjusted proﬁt before tax to 
exclude those items classiﬁed as exceptional items within  
the ﬁnancial statements.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our 
assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our 
judgement is that overall performance materiality (i.e. our 
tolerance for misstatement in an individual account or 
balance) for the Group should be 50% of planning materiality, 
namely £1.6m. Our objective in adopting this approach is to 
ensure that total detected and undetected audit differences do 
not exceed our planning materiality of £3.2m for the ﬁnancial 
statements as whole. This provided a basis for determining  
the nature, timing and extent of risk assessment procedures, 
identifying and assessing the risk of material misstatement  
and determining the nature, timing and extent of further  
audit procedures.
We agreed with the audit committee that we would report to 
the committee all audit differences in excess of £0.1m, as well 
as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds.
An overview of the scope of our audit 
We used a risk-based approach for determining our audit 
strategy, ensuring that our audit teams performed consistent 
procedures and focused on addressing the risks that are 
relevant to the business. This approach focused our audit effort 
towards higher risk areas, such as signiﬁcant management 
judgements, and on locations that were considered material 
based upon size, complexity and risk.
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and 
our allocation of that materiality determined our audit scope.
The factors that we considered when assessing the scope of the 
Group audit and the level of work to be performed at each 
location included the following: the ﬁnancial signiﬁcance and 
speciﬁc risks of the location, the effectiveness of the control 
environment and monitoring activities, including Group-wide 
controls and recent internal audit ﬁndings.
Our Group audit scope focused on two locations, of which one 
was subject to a full scope audit, whilst the remaining location 
was subject to speciﬁc audit testing based on our judgement of 
risk and materiality. These locations represent the principal 
business units within the Group’s six reportable segments and 
accounted for 91% of the Group’s adjusted proﬁt before tax.
The Senior Statutory Auditor oversaw all planning at the full 
scope location including discussion of the potential for 
material fraud and error, reviewed key working papers, 
participated in the planning and execution of the responses to 
the risks, and attended the audit closing meetings.
For the remaining locations, we performed other procedures 
to conﬁrm there were no signiﬁcant risks of material 
misstatement in the Group ﬁnancial statements. The Senior 
Statutory Auditor attended the audit closing meeting for the 
speciﬁc scope location by conference call. 
Our response to the risks of material misstatement identiﬁed 
above included the following procedures:
Inaccuracy of revenue reported from casino and bingo venues
• we updated our understanding of the revenue processes  
and tested key management controls for recognition and 
measurement of revenue, both at a site level and head  
ofﬁce level;
• we veriﬁed the recognition and measurement of revenue by 
re-performing cash counts throughout the year at a sample 
of casino and bingo venues; and
• we performed substantive analytical review procedures, 
which included comparing actual results against forecasted 
win rates and substantiating deviations from expectations. 
In addition we performed journal testing speciﬁcally 
focusing on revenue accounts.
Inaccuracy of revenue from casino and bingo digital channels 
• we updated our understanding of the revenue processes  
and controls and tested key management manual and IT 
controls for recognition and measurement of revenue;
• we veriﬁed the recognition and measurement of revenue  
by tracing a sample of transactions throughout the year to 
source data to verify the accuracy of reported revenue; and
• we performed substantive analytical review procedures, 
which included comparing actual results against forecasted 
win rates and substantiating deviations from expectations. 
In addition, we performed journal testing speciﬁcally 
focusing on revenue accounts. The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 87
Identiﬁcation and assessment of impairment of intangible  
and tangible assets, goodwill and investments
• we updated our understanding of management’s annual 
impairment testing process, including the controls that 
management has in place to validate assumptions in relation 
to impairment; 
• we ensured that the methodology of the impairment  
exercise continues to comply with the requirements of IFRS 
as adopted by the European Union, including evaluating 
management’s assessment of indicators of impairment  
and their assessment of what the Group considers a cash 
generating unit (CGU) to be compared to other existing 
industry practice;
• we challenged the forecasts underlying the impairment 
review and agreed to budgets approved by the board, 
reviewing these against actual performance and historic 
accuracy of forecasting; 
• we agreed other key assumptions such as discount rates  
to supporting evidence and corroborated these to industry 
averages/trends with the assistance of EY internal experts; and
• we challenged the individual CGU projections with 
appropriate ﬁnance and commercial personnel. 
Inaccurate provisions made in relation to property leases
• we updated our understanding of management’s processes 
and controls for identifying and calculating property  
lease provisions;
• we checked underlying calculations and agreed key inputs  
to supporting evidence including lease agreements and, for 
trading properties, corroborated management’s assumptions 
to underlying audit work performed; and
• we challenged management’s assumptions, through 
discussions with the ﬁnance team and the property 
management responsible for the management of the 
Group’s estate.
Inaccurate provisions made in relation to direct and indirect tax risk 
exposures in relation to continuing and discontinuing businesses
• we understood the latest position in all material open direct 
and indirect tax matters including any conclusions reached 
during the year, with the assistance of EY internal experts;
• we read all material correspondence with HMRC and other 
tax authorities in the period for entities in scope for tax to 
form our view on the appropriate tax treatment of 
judgemental items; 
• we tested the calculations of all current and deferred tax 
assets and liabilities to support the valuation, presentation 
and appropriateness of all direct tax balances at year  
end; and
• we concluded on the appropriateness of the indirect tax 
balances, presentation and disclosures.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies  
Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the ﬁnancial year for which the 
ﬁnancial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
ﬁnancial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the ISAs (UK and Ireland), we are required to report  
to you if, in our opinion, information in the annual report is: 
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
ﬁnancial statements; or 
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired  
in the course of performing our audit; or 
• is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have 
identiﬁed any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired 
during the audit and the directors’ statement that they 
consider the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable 
and whether the annual report appropriately discloses those 
matters that we communicated to the audit committee which 
we consider should have been disclosed. 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have  
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company ﬁnancial statements and the part of  
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not  
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration speciﬁed by 
law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
• the directors’ statement, set out on page 40, in relation  
to going concern; and
• the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to 
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code speciﬁed for our review.

General information
The Rank Group Plc (‘the Company’) and its subsidiaries 
(together ‘the Group’) operate gaming and betting services  
in Great Britain (including the Channel Islands), Spain  
and Belgium.
The Company is a public limited company which is listed on 
the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled 
in England and Wales under registration number 03140769. 
The address of its registered ofﬁce is Statesman House, 
Stafferton Way, Maidenhead, Berkshire, SL6 1AY.
In accordance with IFRS3 ‘Business Combinations’, the prior 
year comparatives for the Group balance sheet and Group  
cash ﬂow statement have been restated for the adjustments  
to the provisional amounts recognised on the acquisition of 
Gala Casino 1 Limited (now Grosvenor Casinos (GC) Limited). 
There is no impact on the income statement reported in the 
prior year. The amounts disclosed in the prior year were 
provisional due to the proximity of the acquisition to the 
Group’s year end and the completion account process outlined 
by the sale and purchase agreement extending beyond the 
ﬁnalisation of the prior year ﬁnancial statements. Further 
details are provided in note 25. 
On 2 April 2013, the Group sold the assets and trademarks of 
its Blue Square Bet business. In accordance with IFRS5 
‘Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued 
Operations’ the results of Blue Square Bet have been classiﬁed 
as discontinued in the prior period. 
Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation  
of these consolidated and Company ﬁnancial statements are 
set out below. These policies have been consistently applied  
to all periods presented.
1.1 Basis of preparation
The consolidated and Company ﬁnancial statements have 
been prepared under the historical cost convention. 
1.1.1 Statement of compliance
The consolidated and Company ﬁnancial statements have 
been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) and IFRIC Interpretations as 
adopted by the European Union, and the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
Notes to the financial statements
1.1.2 Going concern
In adopting the going concern basis for preparing the 
consolidated and Company ﬁnancial statements, the directors 
have considered the issues impacting the Group during the 
period as detailed in the strategic report on pages 4 to 45 and 
have reviewed the Group’s projected compliance with its 
banking covenants detailed in the ﬁnance review on page  
41. Based on the Group’s cash ﬂow forecasts and operating 
budgets, and assuming that trading does not deteriorate 
considerably from these projected levels, the directors  
believe that the Group will generate sufﬁcient cash to meet  
its borrowing requirements for at least 12 months from the 
date of approval of the ﬁnancial statements and comply with 
its banking covenants.
1.1.3 Accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with IFRS 
requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also 
requires management to exercise its judgement in the process 
of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The resulting 
accounting estimates will, by deﬁnition, seldom equal the 
actual results. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement 
or complexity, where assumptions and estimates are signiﬁcant 
to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, are set out below.
(a) Estimated impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and 
property, plant and equipment
The Group tests annually whether assets that have an 
indeﬁnite useful life, including goodwill and gaming licences, 
have suffered any impairment. The Group also reviews assets 
that are subject to amortisation or depreciation for events or 
changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount  
of the asset may not be recoverable. Further details of the 
Group’s accounting policy in relation to impairment are 
disclosed in note 1.13.
The application of the policy requires the use of accounting 
estimates and judgements in determining the recoverable 
amount of cash-generating units to which the intangible  
assets and property, plant and equipment are associated.  
The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less  
costs to sell and value in use. Estimates of fair value less costs 
to sell are performed internally by experienced senior 
management supported by knowledge of similar transactions 
and advice from external estate agents or, if applicable, offers 
received. Value in use is calculated using estimated cash ﬂow 
projections from ﬁnancial budgets, discounted by selecting an 
appropriate rate for each cash-generating unit. Further details 
of the assumptions and estimates are disclosed in note 13. 94 The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014
Financial Statements
1 General information and accounting 
policies (continued)
(b) Classiﬁcation of casino and other gaming licences as intangible 
assets with an indeﬁnite life
As disclosed in note 1.12, certain casino and other gaming 
licences have been classiﬁed as intangible assets with an 
indeﬁnite life. This assumption is based on management’s 
belief that there is no foreseeable limit to the period over 
which the licences are expected to generate net cash inﬂows 
and that each licence holds a value outside the property in 
which it resides. As a consequence, each licence is reviewed 
annually for impairment. 
(c) Recoverability of deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable future taxable proﬁt will be available against which 
the temporary differences can be utilised. The key area of 
judgement is therefore an assessment of whether it is probable 
that there will be suitable taxable proﬁts against which any 
deferred tax assets can be utilised. Further details of deferred 
tax assets recognised are disclosed in note 21.
(d) Income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous 
jurisdictions, including jurisdictions of now discontinued 
operations. There are many transactions and calculations  
for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.  
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit  
issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will  
be due. Where the ﬁnal outcome of these matters is different 
from the amount recognised, such differences will impact the 
ﬁnancial statements in the period such determination is made. 
Further details of income tax are disclosed in note 18. 
(e) Provisions
Provisions are recognised in accordance with the policy 
disclosed in note 1.10. In calculating property lease provisions, 
estimates are made of the discounted cash ﬂows associated 
with the property and its associated operations including 
sub-let income together with estimates of any dilapidation 
obligations. Estimates have been made in determining the 
amount and timing of disposal provisions, including legacy 
industrial disease and personal injury claims. Estimates have 
also been made in determining the amount and likelihood of 
settlement of indirect tax provisions and restructuring provisions. 
Further details of provisions made are disclosed in note 22.
(f) Contingent assets and liabilities
Management is required to apply judgement in assessing  
the probability of the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or 
more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of 
the Company. This judgement is supported by external advice 
and precedent case law where appropriate and is continually 
assessed to ensure that developments are appropriately 
reﬂected in the ﬁnancial statements. Further details of 
contingent liabilities are disclosed in note 31.
(g) Acquisition
The Group made an acquisition in the prior year. Establishing 
the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities, notably  
the valuation of the casino licences and property contracts, 
required a number of estimates and judgements to be made. 
The main judgements made in valuing the casino licences 
include using estimated cash ﬂow projections, discounted  
by selecting an appropriate rate. The main judgement used in 
valuing property contracts is the estimation of the open market 
rent at the date of acquisition for each property. Open market 
rent was determined by a third party ﬁrm of property valuation 
experts. See note 25 for further details. 
1.1.4 Changes in accounting policy and disclosures
(a) Standards, amendments to and interpretations of existing 
standards adopted by the Group

Notes to the financial statements continued The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 95
It is not anticipated that the adoption of the above standards, 
amendments and interpretations will have a material impact 
on the Group or Company ﬁnancial statements in the period 
of initial application.
1.2 Consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power  
to govern the ﬁnancial and operating policies, generally 
accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of  
the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential  
voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible  
are considered when assessing whether the Group controls 
another entity. All subsidiaries are fully consolidated from  
the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They  
are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains  
on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction 
provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. 
Accounting policies as applied to subsidiaries have been 
changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the 
policies adopted by the Group.
The Group has no material associates or joint ventures.
1.3 Business combinations and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition 
method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the 
aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at 
acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-
controlling interest in the acquiree. Acquisition costs incurred 
are expensed and included in administrative expenses within 
exceptional items. 
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the ﬁnancial 
assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classiﬁcation  
and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, 
economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at  
the acquisition date. 
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the 
aggregate of the acquisition date fair value of the consideration 
transferred over the fair value of the net identiﬁable amounts 
of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in exchange 
for the business combination. Identiﬁable intangible assets  
are recognised separately from goodwill.
If the aggregate of the acquisition date fair value of the 
consideration transferred is lower than the fair value of the 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities in the business 
acquired, the difference is recognised in proﬁt and loss. 
1.4 Revenue recognition 
Revenue consists of the fair value of sales of goods and services 
net of VAT, rebates and discounts.
(a) Gaming win
Revenue for casinos includes the gaming win before deduction 
of gaming related duties. Revenue for bingo is net of prizes 
before deduction of gaming related duties. Revenue for digital 
products, including interactive games and sports betting 
(discontinued in prior year), represents gaming win. The fair 
value of free bets, promotions and customer bonuses are also 
deducted from all revenue streams.
Although disclosed as revenue, gaming win is accounted for 
and meets the deﬁnition of a gain under IAS39 Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
(b) Food and beverage
Revenue from food and beverage sales is recognised at the 
point of sale. 
1.5 Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with 
the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision 
maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible 
for allocating resources and assessing performance of the 
operating segments, has been identiﬁed as the management 
team (the composition of which is disclosed on page 50)  
that makes strategic and operational decisions.
1.6 Foreign currency translation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements are presented in UK 
Sterling, which is also the Company’s functional currency. 
Items included in the ﬁnancial statements of each of the 
Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the entity operates 
(‘the functional currency’). 
(a) Transactions and balances 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional 
currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from 
the settlement of such transactions and from the translation  
at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the 
income statement in ﬁnance costs or income.
(b) Group companies
The results and ﬁnancial position of all the Group companies 
(none of which has the currency of a hyper-inﬂationary 
economy) that have a functional currency different from  
the presentation currency are translated into the presentation 
currency as follows: 96 The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014
Financial Statements
1 General information and accounting 
policies (continued)
(i) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are 
translated at the closing rate on the balance sheet date. The 
closing euro rate against UK Sterling was 1.25 (30 June 2013: 
1.17) and the closing US Dollar rate against UK Sterling was 
1.70 (30 June 2013: 1.53);
(ii) income and expenses for each income statement are 
translated at average exchange rates unless this average is not a 
reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates 
prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and 
expenses are translated at the rates prevailing on the dates of 
the transactions. The average euro rate against UK Sterling was 
1.20 (year ended 30 June 2013: 1.21) and the average US Dollar 
rate against UK Sterling in the year was 1.64 (year ended 30 
June 2013: 1.57); and
(iii) all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a 
separate component of equity.
When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences 
are recognised in the income statement, net of hedging,  
as part of the gain or loss on sale. Goodwill and fair value 
adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity  
are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the closing rate.
1.7 Financial assets
Financial assets within the scope of IAS39 are classiﬁed as 
ﬁnancial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss, loans and 
receivables, held to maturity investments, available for sale 
ﬁnancial assets or as derivatives designated as hedging 
instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. The Group 
determines the classiﬁcation of its ﬁnancial assets at  
initial recognition.
A ﬁnancial asset is derecognised when the rights to receive the 
cash ﬂows from the asset have expired, been transferred or an 
obligation to pay the cash ﬂows received to a third party 
without material delay has been assumed, and either:
• substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have 
been transferred; or
• substantially all the risks and rewards have neither been 
retained nor transferred, but control has been transferred.
The Group’s ﬁnancial assets include loans and receivables and 
cash and cash equivalents.
(a) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets  
with ﬁxed or determinable payments that are not quoted  
in an active market. They are included in current assets,  
when the asset is expected to be realised in the normal 
operating cycle, otherwise they are classiﬁed as non-current 
assets. Loans and receivables are classiﬁed as other receivables 
in the balance sheet.
Other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, less provision for impairment. 
(b) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet include cash 
at banks and in hand and short-term deposits with an original 
maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the cash ﬂow statement, cash and cash 
equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits as deﬁned 
above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are 
shown within loans and borrowings in current liabilities on 
the balance sheet.
1.8 Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities within the scope of IAS39 are classiﬁed  
as ﬁnancial liabilities at fair value through proﬁt or loss, loans 
and borrowings or as derivatives designated as hedging 
instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. The Group 
determines the classiﬁcation of its ﬁnancial liabilities at  
initial recognition.
A ﬁnancial liability is derecognised when the obligation under 
the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
The Group’s ﬁnancial liabilities include trade and other 
payables, loans and borrowings (including bank overdrafts), 
and ﬁnancial guarantee contracts. Financial liabilities also 
include onerous contracts, a policy for which is included  
in note 1.10.
(a) Trade and other payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
(b) Loans and borrowings
After initial recognition at fair value, interest bearing loans  
and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest rate method. Gains and losses are 
recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are 
derecognised as well as through the effective interest rate 
method amortisation process.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any 
discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that  
are an integral part of the effective interest rate method.  
The effective interest rate method amortisation is included  
in ﬁnance costs in the income statement.
(c) Financial guarantee contracts (Company only)
Financial guarantee contracts issued by the Company are  
those contracts that require a payment to be made to 
reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the speciﬁed 
debtor fails to make a payment when due in accordance with 
the terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts 
are initially measured at fair value by applying the estimated 
probability of default to the cash outﬂow should default occur 
and subsequently amortising over the expected length of  
the guarantee.
Notes to the financial statements continued The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 97
1.9 Leases
Leases are tested at inception to determine whether the lease  
is a ﬁnance or operating lease and treated accordingly. For 
leases entered into prior to 1 January 2005, inception is deemed 
to be 1 January 2005 in accordance with the transitional 
requirements of IFRIC4. Property leases comprising a lease of 
land and a lease of buildings within a single contract are split 
into their two component parts before testing.
(a) Finance leases
Leases of property, plant and equipment which transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
Group are classiﬁed as ﬁnance leases. Finance leases are 
capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower of the  
fair value of the leased property, plant and equipment or the 
present value of minimum lease payments. Each lease payment 
is allocated between the liability and ﬁnance charges so as to 
achieve a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining 
balance of the liability for each period. The corresponding 
rental obligations, net of ﬁnance charges, are included in  
loans and borrowings. Finance charges are recognised in the 
income statement. Property, plant and equipment acquired 
under ﬁnance leases is depreciated over the shorter of the 
useful life of the asset or the lease term.
(b) Operating leases
Leases of property, plant and equipment which do not transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
Group are classiﬁed as operating leases. Operating lease 
payments (including any lease incentives or premiums) are 
recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight 
line basis over the lease term.
1.10 Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal 
or constructive obligation as a result of past events if it is more 
likely than not that an outﬂow of resources will be required to 
settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. 
Provisions are measured at the best estimate of the 
expenditures required to settle the obligation. If the effect of 
the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted 
using a pre-tax rate that reﬂects, where appropriate, the risks 
speciﬁc to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase 
in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a 
ﬁnance cost.
1.11 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of 
accumulated depreciation and impairment. Such cost includes 
expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of 
the items. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying 
amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only 
when it is probable that future economic beneﬁts associated 
with the item will ﬂow to the Group and the cost of the item 
can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are 
charged to the income statement during the ﬁnancial period in 
which they are incurred. 
Depreciation is calculated on assets using the straight line 
method to allocate their cost less residual values over their 
estimated useful lives, as follows: 
• freehold and leasehold 50 years or lease term if less 
property
• refurbishment of property 5 to 20 years
• ﬁxtures, ﬁttings, plant 3 to 20 years 
and machinery
Land is not depreciated.
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed at each balance 
sheet date, and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised 
upon disposal or when no future economic beneﬁts are 
expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on 
derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between 
the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) 
is included in the income statement. 
Pre-opening costs are expensed to the income statement  
as incurred.
1.12 Intangible assets
(a) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition 
over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identiﬁable 
assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. 
Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is included in 
intangible assets. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment 
and carried at amortised cost as at 1 January 2004 plus cost  
for any acquisition completed after 1 January 2004 less 
accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses on the 
disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill 
relating to the entity sold, except where goodwill has been 
previously written off directly to reserves under previous GAAP. 98 The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014
Financial Statements
1 General information and accounting 
policies (continued)
Goodwill is allocated to the relevant cash-generating unit or 
group of cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment 
testing. A cash-generating unit is the smallest identiﬁable 
group of assets that generates cash inﬂows that are largely 
independent of the cash inﬂows from other assets or groups  
of assets. 
(b) Casino and other gaming licences and concessions
The Group capitalises acquired casino and other gaming 
licences and concessions. Management believes that licences, 
with the exception of the two casino concessions in Belgium, 
have indeﬁnite lives as there is no foreseeable limit to the 
period over which the licences are expected to generate  
net cash inﬂows and each licence holds a value outside  
the property in which it resides. Each licence is reviewed 
annually for impairment. 
In respect of the two casino concessions in Belgium, their 
carrying value is amortised over the expected useful life  
of the concessions.
Any costs in renewing licences or concessions are expensed  
as incurred.
(c) Other
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the 
basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the 
speciﬁc software. These costs are amortised on a straight line 
basis over their estimated useful lives (three to ﬁve years).
Costs associated with maintaining computer software 
programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred.  
Costs that are directly associated with the production and 
development of identiﬁable and unique software products 
controlled by the Group, and that will probably generate 
economic beneﬁts exceeding costs beyond one year, are 
recognised as intangible assets for both externally purchased 
and internally developed software. Direct costs include  
speciﬁc employee costs for software development.
Computer software development costs recognised as assets are 
amortised over their estimated useful lives (three to ﬁve years). 
1.13 Impairment of intangible assets and property, plant  
and equipment 
Assets that have an indeﬁnite useful life are not subject to 
amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets 
that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that  
the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised as the amount by which  
an asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.  
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value 
less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing 
impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which 
there are separately identiﬁable cash inﬂows (cash-generating 
units). The expected cash ﬂows generated by the assets are 
discounted using appropriate discount rates that reﬂect the 
time value of money and risks associated with the groups  
of assets.
If an impairment loss is recognised, the carrying amount  
of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable 
amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an exceptional 
expense in the income statement immediately.
Any impairment is allocated equally across all assets in a 
cash-generating unit unless there is an indication that a  
class of assets should be impaired in the ﬁrst instance or a  
fair market value exists for one or more assets. Once an asset 
has been written down to its fair value less costs to sell then 
any remaining impairment is allocated equally amongst all 
other assets. 
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying 
amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the 
revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the 
extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed  
the carrying amount that would have been determined had no 
impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating 
unit) in prior years. 
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised within 
exceptional items in the income statement immediately.
1.14 Employee beneﬁt costs 
(a) Pension obligations
The Group operates a deﬁned contribution plan under  
which the Group pays ﬁxed contributions to a separate  
entity. The Group has no further payment obligations once  
the contributions have been paid. The contributions are 
recognised as employee beneﬁt expense when they are due.
The Group also has an unfunded pension commitment  
relating to three former executives of the Group. The amount 
recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the commitment 
is the present value of the obligation at the balance sheet  
date, together with adjustment for actuarial gains or losses.  
The Group recognises actuarial gains and losses immediately  
in the statement of comprehensive income. The net cost 
arising on the commitment is recognised in net ﬁnance costs.
Notes to the financial statements continued The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 99
(b) Share-based compensation
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees for 
awards granted after 7 November 2002 is measured by 
reference to the fair value at the date on which they are 
granted. The fair value is determined by using an appropriate 
pricing model, further details of which are given in note 28.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together 
with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in 
which the performance and/or service conditions are fulﬁlled. 
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled 
transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date 
reﬂects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and 
the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments 
that will ultimately vest. The income statement charge or 
credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative 
charge recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately 
vest, except for equity-settled transactions where vesting is 
conditional upon a market or non-vesting condition, which 
are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market 
or non-vesting condition is satisﬁed, provided that all other 
performance and/or service conditions are satisﬁed.
Where the terms of an equity-settled transaction award are 
modiﬁed, the minimum expense recognised is the expense  
as if the terms had not been modiﬁed, if the original terms  
of the award are met. An additional expense is recognised  
for any modiﬁcation that increases the total fair value of the 
share-based payment transaction, or is otherwise beneﬁcial  
to the employee as measured at the date of modiﬁcation.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as  
if it vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense  
not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately. 
This includes any award where non-vesting conditions within 
the control of either the entity or the employee are not met. 
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, 
and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is 
granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they 
were a modiﬁcation of the original award, as described in the 
previous paragraph. All cancellations of equity-settled 
transaction awards are treated equally.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reﬂected as 
additional share dilution in the computation of diluted 
earnings per share.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable 
transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) 
and share premium when the options are exercised.
The cost of cash-settled transactions is measured at fair value 
with the recognition of a corresponding liability. The liability 
is re-measured to fair value at each reporting date up to and 
including the settlement date. 
When an award is modiﬁed from an equity-settled to a 
cash-settled basis, the total expense recognised comprises  
the total of the grant date fair value that would have been 
recognised under the original equity-settled basis, any 
incremental fair value arising from the modiﬁcation of the 
award and any re-measurement of the liability between its fair 
value at the modiﬁcation date and the amount ﬁnally settled. 
If the amount of the liability recognised on modiﬁcation is 
higher than the amount previously recognised as an increase 
in equity then the increase in the liability is recognised as a 
debit to equity.
(c) Share-based compensation – Company
The Company operates share-based payment schemes for 
employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. The fair value 
of shares awarded to employees of the Company are recognised 
as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in 
equity. The Company also makes awards of its own shares to 
employees of its subsidiaries and as such recognises an increase 
in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the 
equity-settled share-based payment charge recognised in its 
subsidiaries’ ﬁnancial statements, with the corresponding 
credit being recognised directly in equity.
When an award is modiﬁed from an equity-settled to a 
cash-settled basis, the Company retains the obligation to settle 
such awards. Consequently, on the recognition of a liability by 
the parent, the corresponding debit is recognised directly in 
equity. In the event that subsidiaries of the Company settle the 
obligation on the parent company’s behalf, such a payment is 
treated as a distribution to the parent.
(d) Bonus plans
The Group recognises a liability in respect of the best estimate 
of bonuses payable where contractually obliged to do so or 
where a past practice has created a constructive obligation. 100 The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014

1 General information and accounting 
policies (continued)
1.15 Inventories 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net  
realisable value. Cost of inventory is determined on  
a ‘ﬁrst-in ﬁrst-out’ basis.
The cost of ﬁnished goods comprises goods purchased  
for resale.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the 
ordinary course of business. When necessary, provision  
is made for obsolete and slow-moving inventories.
1.16 Taxation
(a) Current tax
Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior 
periods are measured as the amount expected to be paid or  
to be recovered from the taxation authorities. The tax rates  
and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are 
enacted or substantively enacted, by the reporting date.
Current tax relating to items recognised directly in equity  
is recognised in equity and not the income statement.
Management evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with 
respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are 
subject to interpretation at each reporting date and establishes 
provisions where appropriate.
(b) Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on 
temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the ﬁnancial 
statements. However, if deferred tax arises from the initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other  
than a business combination, that at the time of the 
transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable proﬁt or 
loss, it is not accounted for. Deferred tax is determined using 
tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply 
when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred 
tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable proﬁt will be available against 
which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is  
a legally enforceable right to set off current taxation assets 
against current taxation liabilities and it is the intention  
to settle these on a net basis.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on 
investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the 
timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled 
by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
(c) Sales tax
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the 
amount of sales tax except:
• where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or 
services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in 
which case the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of 
acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as 
applicable; and
• receivables and payables that are stated with the amount  
of sales tax included.
The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable  
to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables  
or payables in the balance sheet.
1.17 Share capital
Ordinary shares are classiﬁed as equity. 
1.18 Discontinued operations and held for sale assets
Operations of the Group are recognised as discontinued 
operations if the operations have been disposed of or meet the 
criteria to be classiﬁed as held for sale and represent a separate 
major line of business or geographic area of operations. 
Operations held for sale are held at the lower of their carrying 
amount on the dates they are classiﬁed as held for sale and fair 
value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classiﬁed as held for 
sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale 
transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition 
is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and 
the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in 
its present condition. Management must be committed to the 
sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a 
completed sale within one year from the date of classiﬁcation.
1.19 Dividends
Dividends proposed by the board of directors and unpaid at 
the period end are not recognised in the ﬁnancial statements 
until they have been approved by shareholders at the annual 
general meeting. Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
1.20 Exceptional items
The Group deﬁnes exceptional items as those items which,  
by their size or nature in relation to either the Group or 
individual segments, are separately disclosed in order to give  
a full understanding of the Group’s ﬁnancial performance  
and aid comparability of the Group’s result between periods.

The Group reports segmental information on a brand-led basis, which is consistent with the means by which the chief  
operating decision maker utilises internal reporting within the business. This brand-led structure better enables management  
to reﬂect the needs of our customers throughout the various activities of the business. These activities are both venues-based and 
digital-based casino operations in Grosvenor Casinos, plus venues-based and digital-based bingo operations both in Mecca and 
in its Spanish bingo brand Enracha. Further information about each brand is disclosed on pages 31 (Grosvenor Casinos),  
33 (Mecca) and 34 (Enracha).
Assets and liabilities have not been segmented as this information is not provided to the chief operating decision maker  
on a regular basis.
Capital expenditure comprises expenditure on property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets, including those 
acquired under ﬁnance leases.

Impairment charges
The Group recognised an impairment charge of £5.4m in the UK of which £4.3m relates to Grosvenor Casinos venues and £1.1m 
to Mecca venues. The only individually signiﬁcant charges are £4.1m in respect of a single club in Grosvenor Casinos venues and 
£0.7m in respect of a single club in Mecca venues. Performance at these clubs has not been in line with expectations. 
A further impairment charge of £7.5m has been recognised in respect of three clubs in the Enracha venues business which have 
not performed in line with expectations. This has followed a prolonged period of difﬁcult economic conditions in Spain.
A further impairment charge of £1.0m is included within integration costs relating to essential post-acquisition capital 
expenditure, including signage, at a small number of casinos that were fully impaired as part of the acquisition accounting.
Impairment reversals
The Group has reversed previous impairment charges of £0.7m in the UK, all of which relates to Mecca venues. The reversal is in 
respect of two clubs where changes in the competitive and commercial environment have led to improvements in performance. 
A further reversal of £0.8m has been made in respect of a casino in Belgium, which has shown continuing improved 
performance above expectations. 106 The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014

4 Exceptional items (continued)
Net charge to provisions for property leases
The Group has recognised a net charge of £6.6m in relation to provisions for property leases in the year. This includes a charge 
of £6.8m in two Grosvenor Casinos venues and three Mecca venues for unavoidable dilapidation costs and where expected 
income no longer exceeds the unavoidable costs associated with these sites. A further charge of £1.6m has been made in respect 
of property lease costs directly attributable to the restructuring activities outlined below.
A release to the income statement of £1.8m has been recognised in respect of two Mecca venues where anticipated performance, 
following the reduction in bingo duty, means that expected income will exceed the unavoidable costs associated with these sites.
Acquisition and integration costs
In the prior year the Group acquired 19 casinos and 3 non-operating licences from Gala Coral Group Limited (see note 25).  
The Group has expensed the resulting costs of integration during the year of £1.7m. 
The integration was successfully completed during the year and no further integration costs are expected.
Restructuring costs
During the year the Group recognised an exceptional cost of £0.7m relating to the closure of one Mecca venue and one Enracha 
venue and the provision for the further cost associated with the closure of two further Mecca venues and exit of one Enracha 
venue in early 2014/15. Included within the charge to provisions for property leases is a further charge of £1.6m connected  
with remaining property lease obligations at these venues.
Net charge to provision for indirect taxation
In the prior year the Group disclosed a contingent liability in respect of a claim for repayment of output VAT on amusement 
machines. In May 2010, the Group received £30.7m (VAT of £26.4m plus interest of £4.3m) in respect of the claim, which has 
been the subject of ongoing litigation. During the year, the Court of Appeal found in favour of HMRC and consequently  
an amount of £26.4m was provided to cover the expected outﬂow, together with associated interest of £4.3m. In May 2014  
a payment was made to HMRC in respect of these claims, with the remaining balance being the directors’ best estimate of the 
outﬂow likely to arise. The Group has been granted leave to appeal to the Supreme Court, and it therefore remains possible that 
the Group will not ultimately be liable for these amounts. This appeal will be held in April 2015.
The Group also released £0.3m following the settlement in the year of the indirect taxation balances provided for in the prior year.
Year ended 30 June 2013 exceptional items
Continuing operations
Impairment charges
The Group recognised an impairment charge of £3.4m in the UK of which £1.8m related to Grosvenor Casinos venues and 
£1.6m to Mecca venues. The only individually signiﬁcant charges in Grosvenor Casinos venues were £1.1m in respect of  
a non-operating licence, to reﬂect local market conditions, and £0.5m in respect of an E-casino which had not performed  
in line with expectations. The only individually signiﬁcant charge in Mecca venues was £0.6m in respect of a club which  
had not performed in line with expectations. 
A further impairment charge of £1.9m was recognised in respect of a casino in Belgium and £4.1m in respect of two clubs  
in the Enracha venues business which had not performed in line with expectations. 
Impairment reversals
The Group reversed previous impairment charges of £1.9m in the UK, of which £1.2m related to Grosvenor Casinos venues  
and £0.7m related to Mecca venues. The reversal in Grosvenor Casinos was in respect of two casinos where changes in the 
competitive environment led to improvements in performance. The reversal in Mecca venues was in respect of three clubs  
which saw a sustained improvement in performance and an uplift in the freehold value of a further property.
A further reversal of £2.4m was made in respect of a casino in Belgium, which had shown improved performance following 
agreement of a third party digital licence agreement. The Enracha venues business had an impairment reversal of £4.4m 
following better than expected recovery from the effects of the smoking ban at two venues.
Notes to the financial statements continued The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 107
Property leases
The Group recognised a charge of £1.5m in relation to provisions for property leases. A charge of £1.1m was made in respect of one 
Mecca lease where the unavoidable costs exceeded the expected income. The remaining charge of £0.4m was in respect of leases 
where there had been a change in expected sub-let income as a consequence of the ﬁnancial position of associated tenants.
Acquisition and integration costs
During the prior year the Group acquired 19 casinos and 3 non-operating licences from Gala Coral Group Limited (see note 25). 
The Group expensed the costs of the acquisition and resulting integration incurred during the prior year of £8.5m. Further 
details are provided in the table below:

Factors affecting future taxation
UK corporation tax is calculated at 22.5% (year ended 30 June 2013: 23.75%) of the estimated assessable proﬁt for the period. 
Taxation for overseas operations is calculated at the local prevailing rates.
On 20 March 2013, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced the reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax to 21% with 
effect from 1 April 2014 and a further 1% reduction to 20% from 1 April 2015. These changes were substantively enacted in July 2013.

Total 13.5p (8.3)p 5.2p 10.9p (4.0)p 6.9p
(b) Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue to assume 
conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The only category of dilutive potential ordinary shares is share options.  
For share options, a calculation is made to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value 
(determined as the average annual market share price of the Company’s shares) based on the monetary value of the subscription 
rights attached to outstanding share options. The number of shares calculated is compared with the number of shares that would 
have been issued assuming exercise of the share options.
There is no difference in the proﬁt used to determine diluted earnings per share from that used to determine basic earnings  
per share. There is no dilutive impact of share options on the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue or on  
earnings per share.
(c) Adjusted earnings per share
Adjusted earnings is calculated by adjusting proﬁt attributable to equity shareholders to exclude discontinued operations, 
exceptional items, other ﬁnancial gains or losses, unwinding of the discount in disposal provisions and the related tax effects. 
Adjusted earnings is one of the business performance measures used internally by management to manage the operations of the 
business. Management believes that the adjusted earnings measure assists in providing a view of the underlying performance of 
the business.

13 Impairment review
The pre-tax discount rate applied to all cash ﬂow projections is 10.0% (30 June 2013: 10.0%). The discount rate calculation is 
based on the speciﬁc circumstances of the Group and its cash generating units (CGU) and is derived from its weighted average 
cost of capital. Management believes that the discount rate is appropriate for each CGU as they operate in gaming markets 
with similar risks as set out below. As the Group operates in Great Britain (including the Channel Islands), Spain and Belgium, 
country risk has been recognised in the cash ﬂow forecasts, rather than adjusting the discount rate.
(a) Impairment review of goodwill and intangible assets with indeﬁnite lives
Assets that have an indeﬁnite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. In accordance 
with IAS36, goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment. In addition, the Group classiﬁes casino licences (with the exception 
of its concessions in Belgium) and Spanish bingo licences as intangible assets with an indeﬁnite life.
(i) Goodwill
At 30 June 2014, the Group has goodwill with a carrying value of £134.3m (30 June 2013: £134.3m). £80.9m of this goodwill 
arose on the acquisition of 19 casinos during the prior year, further details of which are provided in note 25. 
The remaining £53.4m of goodwill arose on the acquisition of Rank Digital Limited. All of this goodwill is allocated to the  
Mecca digital CGU for the purposes of impairment testing. 
In respect of the Mecca digital CGU, the recoverable amount has been determined based on a value in use calculation using  
cash ﬂow projections based on the Group’s budget for 2014/15, the Group’s strategic plan for the following two years and a 
growth rate of 2.0% (30 June 2013: 2.0%) thereafter. Both the Group’s budget and strategic plan have been approved by the 
board of directors.
The key assumptions in the calculation of value in use are settled stakes, gaming win margins, gaming duty and the discount 
rate. Settled stakes represent monies placed by customers for interactive games and are estimated taking into account the  
product mix and industry developments. Gaming win margins are based on values achieved in the past and amended for any 
anticipated changes in the budget period. Gaming duty is based upon statutory rates enacted at the balance sheet date. The 
calculation includes the impact of the introduction of remote gaming duty at a rate of 15% on a place of consumption basis 
from December 2014.  116 The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014
Financial Statements
13 Impairment review (continued)
As a result of the impairment testing, the directors do not believe that the carrying value of the goodwill was impaired  
as the value in use exceeded the carrying value of goodwill. The key factors which impact the calculation of the carrying  
value include:
Key factors Key assumption impacted
Increased or improved competition Settled stakes, Gaming win margin
Poor or decreased marketing Settled stakes
Failure to respond to technological advances Settled stakes
Deterioration in economic environment Settled stakes
Changes in regulation Settled stakes, Gaming win margin
Changes in taxation Remote gaming duty
Based on these key assumptions and resulting projections, the recoverable amount of the CGU exceeds its carrying amount by in 
excess of £30.0m. A decrease of approximately 8% in either settled stakes or win margin would be required for the recoverable 
amount to equal the carrying value of the CGU. A rise in remote gaming duty from 15% to approximately 19% would be 
required for the recoverable amount to equal the carrying value of the CGU. These calculations assume all other assumptions 
remain constant and therefore do not reﬂect any cost saving measures that may be identiﬁed should a key assumption be 
impacted to this magnitude.
In respect of the goodwill which arose on the acquisition of 19 casinos in the prior year, the combined casinos acquired are 
treated as a single CGU. The recoverable amount has been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash ﬂow 
projections of the combined casinos from the Group’s budget for 2014/15, the Group’s strategic plan for the following two years 
and a growth rate of 2.0% thereafter. Both the Group’s budget and strategic plan have been approved by the board of directors.
The key assumptions in the calculation of value in use are customer visits, spend per visit, casino duty, machine games duty  
and the discount rate. Customer visits are the number of discrete visits by members to casinos and have been based on historic 
trends. Spend per visit comprises the average amount of money (net of winnings) spent per visit on gaming tables, machines  
and food and beverages. This has also been determined by historic trends. Casino duty is levied in bands of between 15% and 
50% depending upon the level of gaming win at each casino. The bands and rates have been assumed to remain at current levels 
without indexation. Machine games duty is levied at rates of 5% or 20% depending upon certain criteria.
The table below outlines the possible changes in key assumptions that would cause the carrying value of the individual licences 
to exceed their recoverable amount. These are:
Key factors Key assumption impacted
Increased or improved competition Customer visits
Poor or decreased promotional activity Customer visits
Failure to respond to technological advances Customer visits, Spend per visit
Deterioration in economic conditions Customer visits, Spend per visit
Changes in regulation Customer visits, Spend per visit
Changes in taxation Casino duty, Machine games duty
Based on these key assumptions and resulting projections, the recoverable amount of the CGU exceeds its carrying amount  
by in excess of £89.0m. A decrease of approximately 8% in either customer visits or spend per visit would be required for the 
recoverable amount to equal the carrying value of the CGU. A rise in gaming related taxes from the current blended rate of 
18.0% to 24.5% across the combined casinos would be required for the recoverable amount to equal the carrying value of the 
CGU. These calculations assume all other assumptions remain constant and therefore do not reﬂect any cost saving measures 
that may be identiﬁed should a key assumption be impacted to this magnitude.
(ii) Casino licences
The carrying value of indeﬁnite life casino licences as at 30 June 2014 was £231.3m (30 June 2013: £225.4m). £150.1m  
of this value arose on the acquisition of 19 casinos during the prior year, further details of which are provided in note 25.  
The remaining £81.2m of this balance (30 June 2013: £75.3m) relates to existing Grosvenor casinos.
Notes to the financial statements continued The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 117
The inherent value of a casino licence is deemed to be an intrinsic part of the value of the operation of a casino as a whole  
and are therefore not split out from each casino in an impairment review. Each Grosvenor casino, including the casinos  
acquired during the prior year, has been treated as a separate CGU, and tested for impairment on that basis. The recoverable 
amount of each Grosvenor casino, including the licence, has been determined based on the higher of fair value less costs to  
sell and value in use. The value in use has been determined using cash ﬂow projections, over the length of the associated lease  
or 50 years for freehold properties, based on the Group’s budget for 2014/15, the Group’s strategic plan for the following two 
years and a growth rate of 2.0% (30 June 2013: 2.0%) thereafter. Both the Group’s budget and strategic plan have been approved 
by the board of directors. Estimates of the fair value less costs to sell are performed internally by experienced senior management 
supported by knowledge of similar transactions or, where applicable, offers received.
The key assumptions in the calculation of value in use are customer visits, spend per visit, casino duty, machine games duty  
and the discount rate. Customer visits are the number of discrete visits by members to the casino and have been based on 
historic trends. Spend per visit comprises the average amount of money (net of winnings) spent per visit on gaming tables, 
machines and food and beverages. This has also been determined by historic trends. Casino duty is levied in bands of between 
15% and 50% depending upon the level of gaming win at each casino. The bands and rates have been assumed to remain at 
current levels without indexation. Machine games duty is levied at rates of 5% or 20% depending upon certain criteria. 
The table below outlines the possible changes in key assumptions that could cause the carrying value of individual licences  
to exceed their recoverable amount. These are:
Key factors Key assumption impacted
Increased or improved competition Customer visits
Poor or decreased promotional activity Customer visits
Failure to respond to technological advances Customer visits, Spend per visit
Deterioration in economic conditions Customer visits, Spend per visit
Changes in regulation Customer visits, Spend per visit
Changes in taxation Casino duty, Machine games duty
The Group operates 56 venues in the UK each of which is treated as a single CGU for the purposes of impairment testing.  
The level by which the recoverable amount of each CGU exceeds its carrying amount therefore varies at each venue and the 
impact of changes in key assumptions that would be required for the recoverable amount to equal its carrying amount also  
varies at each casino. For UK casino licences at venues, excluding the 19 casinos acquired in the prior year, the directors do  
not believe that, with the exception of a prolonged non-operation of a UK casino licence, there are any reasonably foreseeable 
changes to the key assumptions that would result in a material impairment. The initial carrying value of each of the 19 casinos 
acquired in the prior year was established based on its fair value at the date of the acquisition. Accordingly, should performance 
of any individual casino acquired in the prior year fall below expectations, future impairment charges may arise. A fall in 
expected cash ﬂow projections of at least 18% would be required for the recoverable amount to equal the carrying value of  
any individual CGU.
No impairment charges were made during the year against indeﬁnite life casino licences (year ended 30 June 2013: £1.1m).
The two casino concessions in Belgium are being amortised over their expected useful life. At 30 June 2014 these concessions 
had a carrying value of £4.8m (30 June 2013: £5.3m). Each of the casino concessions has also been treated as a separate CGU  
for impairment testing purposes. As a result of this review an impairment reversal of £0.8m has been recognised in respect  
of one concession.
(iii) Spanish bingo licences
The carrying value of Spanish bingo licences as at 30 June 2014 was £3.8m (30 June 2013: £10.2m).
The inherent value of each Spanish bingo licence is deemed to be an intrinsic part of the value of a club as a whole and is  
not therefore split out from the assets of each individual bingo club in an impairment review. Each individual bingo club has 
been treated as a separate CGU, and tested for impairment on that basis. The recoverable amount of each Spanish bingo club, 
including the licence, has been determined based on the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The value in  
use calculation has been determined using cash ﬂow projections, over the length of the associated lease or 50 years in the case  
of freehold properties, based on a zero growth assumption from 2013/14 results (30 June 2013: 2.0% growth), reﬂecting the 
prolonged period of difﬁcult economic conditions in Spain. 118 The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014
Financial Statements
13 Impairment review (continued)
The key assumptions in the calculation of value in use are customer visits, spend per visit, bingo duty and the discount  
rate. Customer visits are the number of discrete visits to the bingo club and have been based on recent trends. Spend per  
visit comprises the average amount of money (net of winnings) spent by a member on bingo games, machines and food and 
beverages. This has been determined by recent trends. Bingo duty is based upon statutory rates enacted at the balance sheet date. 
As a result of the impairment review, impairment charges of £6.1m have been recognised against the value in use of three bingo 
licences. However, there are possible changes in the key assumptions that could cause further impairments. These are:
Key factors Key assumption impacted
Increased or improved competition Customer visits
Poor or decreased promotional activity Customer visits
Failure to respond to technological advances Customer visits, Spend per visit
Deterioration in economic conditions Customer visits, Spend per visit
Changes in regulation Customer visits, Spend per visit
Changes in taxation Bingo duty
As outlined above, each Spanish bingo licence has been tested for impairment as part of the club as a whole. Accordingly, the 
sensitivity of each licence to future impairments, arising from changes in the key assumptions, varies at each club. For the clubs 
previously impaired, each one percentage point reduction in expected future cash ﬂow projections would generate an 
incremental impairment of £0.2m. 
(b) Impairment review of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are grouped into CGUs which are deﬁned as individual venues for Mecca, 
Enracha and Grosvenor Casinos and as the Grosvenor Casino digital and Mecca digital businesses.
The key assumptions and sensitivities in the impairment reviews are the same as outlined above for intangible assets.
The recoverable amount of each CGU, including the licence if applicable, has been determined based on the higher of fair value 
less costs to sell and value in use. Other than in Spain, the value in use has been determined using cash ﬂow projections from 
the Group’s budget for 2014/15, the Group’s strategic plan for the following two years and a growth rate of 2.0% (30 June 2013: 
2.0%) thereafter. Both the Group’s budget and strategic plan have been approved by the board of directors. In Spain, the value in 
use has been determined using a zero growth assumption from the 2013/14 actual results due to the prolonged period of difﬁcult 
economic conditions in Spain. Estimates of the fair value less costs to sell are performed internally by an experienced surveyor 
supported by external estate agent advice or, where applicable, offers received. 
(c) Impairment recognised during the period
Details of impairment charges and reversals recognised during the current and prior periods are disclosed in note 4.

• cash and short-term deposits, other receivables, bank overdrafts and other ﬁnancial liabilities approximate their carrying 
amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments;
• the fair value of ﬁxed rate borrowings is based on price quotations at the reporting date;
• the fair value of ﬂoating rate borrowings and obligations under ﬁnance leases approximates to their carrying amounts; and
• the fair value of property leases and lease disposal settlements approximates to their carrying amount as they are discounted  
at current rates.

20 Financial risk management objectives and policies
Financial risk factors
The Group’s principal ﬁnancial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings and trade and other payables. The main purpose of 
these ﬁnancial liabilities is to ﬁnance the Group’s operations. The Group has other receivables and cash and short-term deposits 
that derive directly from its operations.  
The Group is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group’s overall ﬁnancial risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of ﬁnancial markets and seeks to 
minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s ﬁnancial performance.
The Group’s senior management oversees the management of these risks. The ﬁnance committee is supported by the Group’s 
senior management which advises on ﬁnancial risks and the appropriate ﬁnancial risk governance framework for the Group.  
The ﬁnance committee provides assurance that the Group’s ﬁnancial risk-taking activities are governed by appropriate policies 
and procedures and the ﬁnancial risks are identiﬁed, measured and managed in accordance with Group policies and Group  
risk appetite.
The board of directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
(a) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash ﬂows of a ﬁnancial instrument will ﬂuctuate because of changes in market 
prices. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings and deposits.
The sensitivity analyses in the following sections relate to the positions at 30 June 2014 and 30 June 2013.
The sensitivity analyses have been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of ﬁxed to ﬂoating rates of the 
debt and the proportion of ﬁnancial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant.
(i) Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash ﬂows of a ﬁnancial instrument will ﬂuctuate because of changes 
in foreign exchange rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the Group’s 
operating activities (when revenue or expense is denominated in a different currency from the Group’s functional currency) and 
the Group’s net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
Group policy is not to hedge foreign currency risk.
Foreign currency sensitivity
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of a possible change in the US Dollar and euro, with all other variables held 
constant, to the Group’s proﬁt before tax and the Group’s equity. The effect on equity includes the impact of translation of 
overseas subsidiaries. The Group’s exposure to foreign currency changes for all other currencies is not material.

(ii) Cash ﬂow and fair value interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash ﬂows of a ﬁnancial instrument will ﬂuctuate because of changes  
in market interest rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s 
long-term debt obligations with ﬂoating interest rates.
Historically, the Group had managed its interest rate risk by having a balanced portfolio of ﬁxed and variable rate loans and 
borrowings. Due to the current economic climate the Group has exercised its right to operate outside the Group policy of 
maintaining between 40% and 60% of its borrowings at ﬁxed rates of interest. At 30 June 2014, 13% of the Group’s borrowings 
were at a ﬁxed rate of interest (30 June 2013: 15%). 124 The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014

(iii) Interest rate sensitivity
The table below demonstrates the sensitivity to a possible change in interest rates on income and equity for the year when this 
movement is applied to the carrying value of loans, borrowings, cash and short-term deposits.

There was no impact on equity in either year as a consequence of loan arrangements.
Due to current low interest rates, any further decline would not have a material impact on income and equity for the year.  
As such, sensitivity to a decrease in interest rates has not been presented.
The Group did not enter into any ﬁxed-to-ﬂoating or ﬂoating-to-ﬁxed interest rate swaps in either year.
(b) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a ﬁnancial instrument or customer contract, leading 
to a ﬁnancial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily for other receivables) and from its 
ﬁnancing activities, including deposits with banks and ﬁnancial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other  
ﬁnancial instruments.
Financial instruments and cash deposits
Credit risk from balances with banks and ﬁnancial institutions is managed by the Group’s treasury department in accordance 
with the Group’s policy. Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits 
assigned to each counterparty. Counterparty credit limits are reviewed by the ﬁnance director, and may be updated throughout 
the year subject to the approval of the Group’s ﬁnance committee. The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and 
therefore mitigate ﬁnancial loss through potential counterparty failure.
The credit worthiness of each counterparty is checked against independent credit ratings on at least a weekly basis, with a 
minimum rating of ‘BB’ required. The Group predominantly invests with its lending banks when appropriate.
Sales to retail customers are settled in cash or using major credit cards and therefore the exposure to credit risk is not  
considered signiﬁcant.
No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period and management does not expect any material losses from non-
performance of its counterparties.
(c) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not have sufﬁcient funds to meet its liabilities. Long-term cash forecasts identifying 
the liquidity requirements of the Group are produced tri-annually. The cash forecasts are sensitivity tested for different scenarios 
and are reviewed regularly. Forecast ﬁnancial headroom and debt covenant compliance are reviewed monthly during the 
month-end process to ensure sufﬁcient ﬁnancial headroom exists for at least a 12-month period.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying business, Group treasury aims to maintain ﬂexibility in funding by keeping 
committed credit lines available. A three-year strategic forecast is prepared annually to facilitate planning for future ﬁnancing 
needs. Management actively manages the Group’s ﬁnancing requirements and the range of maturities on its debt.
The Group’s core debt facilities are the £80.0m (30 June 2013: £80.0m) bank facility comprising four £20.0m bi-lateral bank 
facilities that expire in January 2017 and the £140.0m (30 June 2013: £140.0m) bank facility comprising two £70.0m bi-lateral 
bank facilities that expire in May 2016. The Group proactively manages its relationships with its lending group.
The funding policy of the Group is to maintain, as far as practicable, a broad portfolio of debt diversiﬁed by source and maturity, 
and to maintain committed facilities sufﬁcient to cover seasonal peak anticipated borrowing requirements.

Capital management
As a result of the difﬁcult conditions that developed in the global capital markets in recent years, the Group’s objectives when 
managing capital have been to ensure continuing access to existing debt facilities and to manage the borrowing cost of those 
facilities in order to minimise the Group’s interest charge.
Consistent with others in the gaming industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of leverage ratio. The ratio is calculated 
as net debt divided by EBITDA. Net debt is calculated as total loans and borrowings as shown in the consolidated balance sheet 
less cash and short-term deposits, accrued interest and unamortised facility fees. EBITDA is calculated as operating proﬁt before 
exceptional items, depreciation and amortisation from continuing operations.
The leverage ratios at 30 June 2014 and 30 June 2013 were as follows:

Taking into consideration both the Group’s capital investment requirements and the stability of the wider economic 
environment, the Group considers its progressive dividend policy to be appropriate.  126 The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014

20 Financial risk management objectives and policies (continued)
Collateral
The Group did not pledge or hold any collateral at 30 June 2014 (30 June 2013: £nil).
Company
The Company is exposed to credit risk on amounts owed by related undertakings. The performance of all subsidiary 
undertakings of the Group is monitored at Group level, including frequent projections of future performance to ensure funding 
to related undertakings provides a suitable return and remains recoverable. Where losses are forecast, actions are taken to 
mitigate the loss and maximise the recoverability of receivables.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of its receivables of £44.2m (30 June 2013: £42.9m).
The Company does not have any other signiﬁcant exposure to ﬁnancial risks.

Notes to the financial statements continued The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 127
The Group has overseas tax losses of £22.9m (30 June 2013: £22.9m) that are carried forward for offset against suitable future 
taxable proﬁts. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses as their utilisation is not currently anticipated.

The Group has UK capital losses carried forward of £792.0m (30 June 2013: £787.0m). These losses are available for offset against 
future UK chargeable gains. No deferred tax asset (30 June 2013: £nil) has been recognised in respect of these capital losses  
as no further utilisation is currently anticipated.
Temporary differences associated with Group investments
There was no deferred tax liability recognised (30 June 2013: £nil) for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings  
of certain subsidiaries. The Group has determined that any unremitted earnings that do not fall within the dividend exemption 
introduced in the Finance Act 2009 will not be distributed in the foreseeable future and the parent company does not foresee 
giving such consent at the balance sheet date.

Provisions have been based on management’s best estimate of the future cash ﬂows, taking into account the risks associated  
with each obligation.
Property lease provisions
The Group is party to a number of leasehold property contracts. Provision has been made against those leases where the property 
or part of the property is now vacant and the unavoidable costs under the lease exceed the economic beneﬁt expected to be 
derived from potential sub-letting arrangements. Provision has also been made against leases where impairment testing has 
indicated that, after recognising an impairment charge, the estimated discounted cash ﬂows derived from the property and its 
associated operations are insufﬁcient to cover the unavoidable lease costs and the lease is therefore deemed onerous. The Group 
also provided for the unavoidable costs to restore a property to its original condition under contractual obligations. These leases 
have a weighted average unexpired life of 24 years (30 June 2013: 25 years). Of the provision totalling £52.8m, £26.1m will be 
utilised over periods ranging from one to 14 years; and the remaining £26.7m will be utilised over periods from one to in excess 
of 25 years. 
Disposal provisions
Provision has been made for legacy industrial disease and personal injury claims, deferred payments arising from the settlement 
of property lease obligations and other directly attributable costs arising as a consequence of the sale or closure of the businesses. 
The timing of any personal injury claims is uncertain and therefore these claims have been included in the maturity analysis 
based on management’s best estimates. The disposal provisions held comprise the following:

30 June 
2014

Deferred payments arising on lease settlement and related costs 0.1 0.8
Legacy industrial disease and personal injury claims 4.0 4.4

Total disposal provisions 4.6 5.9
Restructuring provisions
The restructuring provisions relate to the costs associated with the closure of two Mecca venues and exit of one Enracha venue 
early in 2014/15.
Indirect tax provisions
The Group has recognised provisions for a number of historic indirect taxation issues including the Group’s output VAT claim on 
amusement machines (see note 31). Payments of £37.1m were made against these provisions during the year and the remaining 
balance of £1.2m represents the directors’ best estimate of the outﬂow likely to arise.

25 Acquisition of subsidiary
On 12 May 2013, the Group acquired a 100% interest in Gala Casino 1 Limited (now Grosvenor Casinos (GC) Limited) for a base 
cash consideration, subject to completion adjustments, of £179.0m. The acquisition included 19 operating casinos and three 
non-operating casino licences.
Fair values
In accordance with IFRS3 ‘Business Combinations’, the prior year comparatives for the Group balance sheet and Group cash ﬂow 
statement have been restated for the adjustments to the provisional amounts recognised on the acquisition of Gala Casino 1 
Limited (now Grosvenor Casinos (GC) Limited). There is no impact on the income statement reported in the prior year. The 
amounts disclosed in the prior year were provisional due to the proximity of the acquisition to the Group’s year-end and the 
completion account process outlined by the sale and purchase agreement extending beyond the ﬁnalisation of the prior year 
ﬁnancial statements.
The ﬁnal fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired in respect of the acquisition, along with the provisional fair values 
disclosed in the prior year, are outlined in the following table:

Goodwill
Goodwill comprised deferred tax liabilities recognised on certain fair value adjustments arising on acquisition and the synergy 
beneﬁts arising from the exclusion of all central management functions previously associated with the operation of the casinos 
from the acquisition. The Group operates the acquired casinos with only a small incremental cost increase in its existing casino 
central management functions. None of the goodwill recognised is deductible for tax purposes.
Notes to the financial statements continued The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 131
Acquisition related costs
In the prior year the Group recognised an exceptional operating expense of £7.8m in the income statement in respect of 
acquisition related costs. This included additional costs incurred by the Group due to the referral of the acquisition to the 
Competition Commission and a £0.4m loss associated with the disposal of the Group’s non-operating licence in Edinburgh 
required by the Competition Commission. The amount was in addition to the £5.0m exceptional operating expense recognised 
in the income statement in the 18 month period ending 30 June 2012 in respect of acquisition related costs.
The Group also recognised in the prior year the £140.0m term loans raised to part ﬁnance the acquisition at their fair value less 
£1.8m of costs directly attributable to the issue of the debt. 
Income statement
The following amounts, representing the results from the date of acquisition to 30 June 2013, have been included in the Group’s 
income statement in the prior year:
£m
Revenue before adjustment for free bets, promotions and customer bonuses 15.5
Free bets, promotions and customer bonuses (0.4)

have been included had the acquisition completed at the beginning of the Group’s reporting period:

During the year ended 30 June 2014, the Company operated an equity settled Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’). Further details 
of the LTIP are included in the remuneration report on pages 66 and 67. In the prior year, the Save-As-You-Earn (‘SAYE’) share 
option scheme previously offered to all UK employees and the Executive Share Option Scheme (‘ESOS’) both lapsed. All of these 
schemes were equity-settled other than the 2010 grant under the LTIP which was cash settled in the prior year.

The fair value of LTIP awards granted is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation which allows for the incorporation of market 
performance conditions. For grants made subject to non-market based performance conditions, the expense recognised is based 
on expectations of these conditions being met, which are reassessed at each balance sheet date.
The following table lists the inputs used for the LTIP grants during the years ended:
30 June

Expected volatility (%) 31.0 33.0
Vesting period (Years) 1-3 2-4
Weighted average share price (p) 140.50 160.50
The expected volatility reﬂects the assumption that the historical volatility over a period similar to the life of the award is 
indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.
The number of LTIP awards and the fair value per share of the LTIP awards granted during the year were as follows:

The Group recognised a £0.5m credit (year ended 30 June 2013: £0.2m charge) in operating proﬁt from accounting for share-
based payments and related National Insurance in accordance with IFRS2.
National insurance contributions are payable in respect of some share-based payments. These contributions are payable  
on the date of exercise based on the intrinsic value of the share-based payments, and as such are treated as cash-settled awards. 
The Group has recorded liabilities at 30 June 2014 of £nil (30 June 2013: £0.1m). The Group has a further liability of £nil  
(30 June 2013: £0.1m) in respect of outstanding cash-settled share options.
29 Retirement benefits
Deﬁned contribution schemes
The Group operates The Rank Group Stakeholder Pension Plan and The Rank Group Workplace Pension Scheme (‘the Plans’) 
which are externally funded and the Plans’ assets are held separately from Group assets. During the year ended 30 June 2014,  
the Group contributed a total of £5.1m (year ended 30 June 2013: £3.6m) to the Plans. There were no signiﬁcant contributions 
outstanding at the balance sheet date in either year.
Other pension commitment
The Group has an unfunded pension commitment relating to three former executives of the Group. At 30 June 2014, the 
Group’s commitment was £3.4m (30 June 2013: £3.1m). The Group paid £0.1m (year ended 30 June 2013: £0.1m) in pension 
payments during the year. The net cost arising on the commitment of £nil (year ended 30 June 2013: £nil) has been recognised 
in other ﬁnancial losses in the income statement. The actuarial loss arising on the commitment, resulting from the changes in 
assumptions outlined below in the year, was £0.4m (year ended 30 June 2013: gain of £0.2m) before taxation and £0.3m after 
taxation (year ended 30 June 2013: £0.2m).

Discount rate 4.2 4.5
Pension increases 3.4 3.0
The obligation in the current year has been calculated using the S1 mortality tables with a 1.5% per annum improvement in life 
expectancy. In the prior year the obligation was calculated using the PA92 (YOB) mc mortality table with a 1.5% per annum 
improvement in life expectancy.

31 Contingent liabilities 
Group
Fiscal neutrality case
In previous periods the Group disclosed a contingent liability in respect of a claim for repayment of output VAT on amusement 
machines. In May 2010, the Group received £30.7m (VAT of £26.4m plus interest of £4.3m) in respect of the claim, which has 
been the subject of ongoing litigation. During the year, the Court of Appeal found in favour of HMRC and consequently an 
amount of £26.4m was provided to cover the expected outﬂow, together with an accrual for interest of £4.3m. In May 2014,  
a payment was made to HMRC in respect of these claims, with the remaining balance being the directors, best estimate of the  
outﬂow likely to arise. The Group has been granted leave to appeal to the Supreme Court, and it therefore remains possible  
the Group will not ultimately be liable for these amounts. The appeal will be held in April 2015.
Other VAT and duty
In previous periods the Group has disclosed contingent liabilities in respect of a limited number of VAT and duty issues.  
At 30 June 2013 the Group estimated its total exposure to be approximately £29.0m (plus interest), of which £12.2m (plus 
interest) was provided. During the year the Group has paid £11.9m (plus interest of £0.8m) as settlement of these VAT and  
duty issues.
Property leases
Concurrent to the £211.0m sale and leaseback in 2006, the Group transferred the rights and obligations but not the legal titles of 
44 property leases to a third party. The Group remains potentially liable in the event of default by the third party. Should default 
occur then the Group would have recourse to two guarantors. It is understood that, of the original 44 leases transferred, 16 of 
these have not expired or been surrendered. These 16 leases have durations of between one month and 99 years and a current 
annual rental obligation (net of sub-let income) of approximately £1.5m.
During the year, the Group became aware of certain information in respect of a deterioration in the ﬁnancial position of the 
third party and one of the guarantors. However, the Group has not to date been notiﬁed of any default, or intention to default, 
in respect of the transferred leases.
Company
At 30 June 2014, the Company has made guarantees to subsidiary undertakings of £170.3m (30 June 2013: £150.9m).

Entities with signiﬁcant inﬂuence over the Group
On 7 June 2011, Guoco Group Limited (Guoco), a company incorporated in Bermuda and listed on the Hong Kong stock 
exchange, acquired a controlling interest in The Rank Group Plc. The ultimate parent undertaking of Guoco is Hong Leong 
Company (Malaysia) Berhad (Hong Leong) which is incorporated in Malaysia. At 30 June 2014, entities controlled by Hong 
Leong owned 68.9% of the Company’s shares, including 51.8% through Guoco and its wholly owned subsidiary Rank Assets 
Limited, the Company’s immediate parent undertaking.
During the year, The Gaming Group Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary within the Group, purchased three non-operating 
casino licences from Clermont Leisure (UK) Limited for consideration of £5.8m, and has subsequently begun operating one  
of these licences. An agreement is in place, subject to the satisfaction of certain legal conditions, to purchase a further non-
operating casino licence for a maximum total consideration of £0.2m. Clermont Leisure (UK) Limited is an entity subject to 
common control. The total consideration of £6.0m includes an option to purchase one further licence for a nominal amount. 
The valuation of the casino licences was carried out by a third party on an arms length basis.

Keep it fun
A key aim for the Group is to ensure that our business 
understands and limits problem gambling, where possible.
The following outlines actions carried out during the year  
to help us achieve this aim.
Understand through research and engagement
Problem gambling is a complex and poorly understood 
subject. Its roots lie within a complex web of psychological, 
sociological and economic factors with the problematic 
gambling behaviour often a symptom of deeper-lying issues.
In the absence of a clearer understanding of the subject it  
is likely that measures designed to tackle problem gambling 
(whether prohibitive or restrictive regulations or operator 
policies) will prove insufﬁciently effective.
During 2013/14, we engaged in a number of programmes 
designed to further our – and the industry’s – understanding  
of problem gambling:
Rank–University of Salford research project – work on  
the University of Salford’s research programme to understand 
better the behaviour of problem gamblers started in earnest 
in 2013/14. We donated data processing equipment  
and provided data sets from the Grosvenor Casinos’ ‘Play 
Points’ rewards card programme, while the Responsible 
Gambling Trust (‘RGT’) provided research funding. We  
expect to be in a position to review (with RGT) the  
ﬁrst-stage ﬁndings during 2014/15.
Separately, we have agreed to extend the research programme 
to incorporate a study of the effect of January’s changes to 
stakes and prizes on casino slot machines. This component  
of the programme also involves the social policy research 
provider, The National Centre for Social Research (‘NatCen’).
RGT–NatCen machines research programme – we 
participated in stage 1 of RGT’s study of player behaviours on 
slot machines. We have signalled our willingness in principle 
to participate in subsequent stages of this programme.
GamePlan – in addition to formal research, we believe that  
we can enhance our understanding of problem gambling  
via engagement with a wide variety of interested parties. 
Through our GamePlan programme we met with a broad  
roster of government and shadow government departments, 
regulatory bodies, problem gambling treatment providers, 
researchers and academics, trade associations, pressure groups 
and international peers to discuss the effects of our operations 
and the consequences of our ambitions. The list of 
organisations included HM Treasury, Shadow Department  
of Culture Media and Sport, the Gambling Commission, 
GamCare
1
, RGT, the British Columbia Lottery Corporation  
and the Campaign for Fairer Gambling.
Other information
1 GamCare are the leading provider of information, advice, support and free counselling for the prevention and treatment of problem gambling.
How big a problem is problem gambling?
A number of large scale studies of the 
prevalence of problem gambling in Great 
Britain conducted since 1999
1
 found that 
between 0.4% and 0.9% of adults are problem 
gamblers
2
. Not only does this represent a low 
proportion of the population but it is also 
relatively low by international standards. 
However, these statistics tell only part of  
the story.
Firstly, these studies also classify 4.2% of 
adults as being ‘at risk gamblers’ (deﬁned as 
“Those who experience some gambling-related 
problems but remain below the threshold for 
‘problem’ gambling”).
Secondly, while the proportion of people  
who are problem gamblers is low, the absolute 
number (it is estimated that in 2012, around 
180,000 adults in England and Scotland were 
problem gamblers) is substantial. 
Thirdly, a study by Professor David Forest  
of the University of Salford (based upon  
data from the British Gambling Prevalence 
Survey) has shown that people with gambling 
problems experience signiﬁcant distress and 
unhappiness. While the gambling problem  
is generally understood to be a symptom  
of distress and a secondary impact rather  
than the primary cause, the level of distress 
involved suggests to us that statistical 
prevalence should not be the sole measure  
of the impact of problem gambling. 
During 2014/15, we will be undertaking 
further research to a) understand the 
prevalence of problem gambling within our 
brands and b) identify methods for measuring 
our performance in tackling the issue.

and 2010; Scottish Health Survey 2012; English 
Health Survey 2012.

Other Information
Rank Research Dinners – during the year, we held a series of 
Rank Research Dinners, designed to develop our understanding 
of problem gambling. These dinners, which were held under 
‘Chatham House Rules’, involved participants from the 
Gambling Commission, RGT, IGT, Ernst and Young, the 
University of Salford, NatCen, the Mail on Sunday and 
GamblingCompliance.com. 
In February 2014, we hosted an international round-table 
discussion on problem gambling involving JOA Groupe 
(France), Loto de Quebec (Canada), The Hippodrome Casino 
(Great Britain), the Association of Gaming Equipment 
Manufacturers and the University of California Los Angeles. 
We plan to repeat this event in 2015. 
Rank Executive Awareness Programme – during the year,  
we re-launched the Rank Executive Awareness programme  
with GamCare. Designed to promote greater understanding 
amongst key decision-makers of the realities of problem 
gambling, the programme involves mandatory visits to 
GamCare (and completion of the ‘Keep it Fun’ training)  
for all members of Rank’s executive committee. 
Responsible Gambling Trust – Rank was one of the ofﬁcial 
sponsors of RGT’s Harm Minimisation Conference 2013. The 
conference featured an impressive line-up of problem gambling 
research experts from around the world, including Great 
Britain, Australia, the USA and Sweden.
Inﬂuence customer behaviour through communication
During the year, we invested approximately £50,000 in our 
‘Keep it Fun’ programme to encourage healthy consumer 
attitudes towards gambling. We have been assisted in this 
programme by the British Columbia Lottery Corporation’s 
GameSense team, who have generously shared insights  
and ideas.
During 2014/15 we plan to test machine-based advertising  
to promote healthy relationships with slots play.
Provide safeguards and intervene where problems arise
Since 2006, we have worked with GamCare to test the 
effectiveness of our customer protection measures, gaining 
accreditation for our venues and digital businesses. During 
2013/14, we invested £10,000 in achieving GamCare 
accreditation for Grosvenor Casinos and Mecca and  
we expect to invest a similar amount in the year ahead.
Through our ‘Keep it Fun’ training programme we  
help our teams to identify signs of problem gambling  
and – where appropriate – to intervene in order to  
provide support.
• during 2013/14, 35 of our team members undertook  
our ‘Keep it Fun’ course, totalling 140 hours of training.
• our teams helped 4,000 customers to agree self-exclusions 
(by which customers elect to be refused access to our brands 
in venue and/or online).
• the vigilance of our teams helped customers to adhere  
to these self-exclusions with a 11% reduction in reported 
breaches
1
, and our teams continue to refer our customers  
to counselling support via GamCare.
During 2014/15, we will be undertaking trials of machine-
based interventions that will allow customers to set limits  
on play.
Support treatment and counselling
We believe that our role in tackling problem gambling should 
not include the direct provision of counselling services; but 
that in tandem with our industry peers we have a responsibility 
for funding such services.
During the year, we contributed £296,000 to RGT, which  
in turn allocates 68% of its funds to counselling and  
treatment providers.
In addition to funding, we also promote GamCare’s helpline 
and netline as well as the Gambleaware website, which also 
provides helpful guidance for those in need.

reference number 1235) and clearly state the registered 
shareholder’s name and address. Please write to The Rank Group 
Plc Registrar, Equiniti Limited, Aspect House, Spencer Road,

Shareview
The Shareview portfolio service from the Company’s registrar 
gives shareholders more control of their Rank shares and other 
investments, including:
• direct access to data held for them on the share register 
including recent share movements and dividend details;
• a recent valuation of their portfolio; and
• a range of information and practical help for shareholders 
including how they can elect to receive communications 
electronically.
It is easy and free to set up a portfolio – shareholders will just 
need the shareholder reference printed on their proxy form or 
dividend stationery. Please visit the following website for more 
details: www.shareview.co.uk.
Payment of dividends
The Company is no longer operating a dividend re-investment 
plan. Shareholders may ﬁnd it more convenient to make 
arrangements to have dividends paid directly to their bank 
account. The advantages of this are that the dividend is 
credited to a shareholder’s bank account on the payment date, 
there is no need to present cheques for payment and there is 
no risk of cheques being lost in the post.
To set up a dividend mandate or to change an existing 
mandate please contact Equiniti Limited, our registrar, whose 
contact details are above. Alternatively, shareholders who use 
Equiniti’s Shareview can log on to www.shareview.co.uk and 
follow the online instructions.

Frequently asked questions
We have a shareholder ‘frequently asked questions’ section  
on our website which provides answers to many questions that 
shareholders have: www.rank.com/investors/shareholder_
faqs.jsp
Capital gains tax
For the purpose of calculating UK capital gains tax on a 
disposal of ordinary shares in the Company held since 31 
March 1982 (including shares held in the predecessor 
company, The Rank Organisation Plc), the price of the 
Company’s ordinary shares at that date was 190p per share. 
This price should be adjusted for the effects of the rights issue 
in January 1990, the enhanced share alternative in July 1993, 
the sub-division and consolidation of shares in March 1994, 
the enhanced scrip dividend in March 1998, and the 18 for 25 
sub-division and share consolidation (aligned with the 65p 
special dividend payment) which took place in March 2007. 
More information regarding these adjustments is available on 
the www.rank.com website.
Shareholder security
We are aware that some of our shareholders have received 
unsolicited telephone calls concerning their Rank shares.  
These communications tend to be from overseas-based 
‘brokers’ who offer a premium price for your Rank shares but 
ask you to make an upfront payment, typically in the form  
of an insurance bond. We recommend that before paying  
any money you:
• obtain the name of the person and ﬁrm contacting you;
• check the FCA Register at www.fca.org.uk/register/ to 
ensure they are authorised;
• use the details on the FCA Register to contact the ﬁrm;
• call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768 if there 
are no contact details on the FCA Register or you are told 
they are out of date; and
• search the FCA’s list of unauthorised ﬁrms and individuals to 
avoid doing business with: www.fca.org.uk/consumers/
protect-yourself/unauthorised-ﬁrms/unauthorised-ﬁrms-
to-avoid
If you use an unauthorised ﬁrm to buy or sell shares or other 
investments, you will not have access to the Financial 
Ombudsman Service or Financial Services Compensation 
Scheme (FSCS) if things go wrong. 142 The Rank Group Plc: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014

Action Fraud’s helpline is 0300 123 2040.
We recommend that you report any attempted share frauds to 
the authorities since providing information with regard to how 
the fraudsters have contacted and dealt with you will assist the 
authorities in understanding the fraudsters’ way of operating 
so as to enable them to disrupt and prevent these activities and 
prosecute them.
ShareGift
Shareholders with a very small number of shares, the value of 
which may make it uneconomical to sell, may wish to consider 
donating them to charity through ShareGift, a registered 
charity administered by The Orr Mackintosh Foundation.

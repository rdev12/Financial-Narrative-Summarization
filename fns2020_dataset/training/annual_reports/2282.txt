CORE TECHNOLOGIES
THERMAL PROCESSING
Bodycote provides thermal processing services which improve material
properties such as strength, durability and corrosion resistance, enabling
manufacturers’ components to work more efficiently with significantly
extended operational lifetimes. Bodycote’s treatment services consist
of a number of core technologies: heat treatment and metal joining,
hot isostatic pressing (HIP) and surface technology.
HEAT TREATMENT AND METAL JOINING
Heat treatments are controlled processes used to alter the
microstructure of materials, such as metals and alloys, to impart
properties which benefit the working life of a component, for example:
increased surface hardness, temperature resistance, ductility and
strength. Metal joining includes specialist processes such as electron
beam welding, vacuum and honeycomb brazing - complex operations
requiring a fusion of expertise and technology.
Bodycote offers an extensive range of heat treatment services and
specialist metal joining techniques from facilities around the world.
With unmatched capacity and computerised systems, Bodycote
facilities can process a wide range of component sizes to exacting
standards with reliable, repeatable results.
HOT ISOSTATIC PRESSING (HIP)
HIP combines very high temperature (up to 2,000°C) with inert gas
under very high pressure (up to 30,000 psi - equivalent to that found
at an ocean depth of 11,000m such as at the bottom of the Mariana
Trench in the Pacific Ocean). HIP can be used to eliminate porosity
in castings and consolidate encapsulated powders to dense materials.
Dissimilar materials can be bonded together to manufacture unique,
cost effective components. Every week a typical Bodycote HIP plant
will process many tons of titanium, aluminium, steel and super-alloy
castings, removing porosity and improving the performance of parts
such as turbine blades and oilfield components.
With the largest operational capacity in the world and a wide variety of
sizes of equipment, Bodycote HIP is able to accommodate large volumes
of small product as economically as large individual components.
SURFACE TECHNOLOGY
Surface technologies are used extensively to prolong the working life
of components and protect them from environmental factors such as
corrosion and abrasion. The range of surface treatments available from
Bodycote covers a wide variety of applications, providing manufacturers
with solutions to meet requirements such as durability, wear resistance,
improved hardness and electrical conductivity.
Bodycote is a provider of specialist plasma spray, high velocity oxy
fuel (HVOF) and thermally formed ceramic treatments and is able to
surface engineer components (including complex geometric shapes
and internal bores) that are designed to operate in the most demanding
of industrial applications. 
...thermal processing is a vital part of any manufacturing process
and includes a variety of techniques and specialist engineering
processes which improve the properties of metals and alloys to
extend the life of components

THE OUTSOURCING PRINCIPLE
THE PARTNER OF CHOICE
Bodycote has become the partner of choice for the world’s most
respected and innovative engineering companies by providing highly
efficient, cost-effective services to the highest quality standards
through strategic investment in people and the latest technology,
equipment and quality systems.
By outsourcing non-core but vitally important thermal processing
requirements to Bodycote, customers are able to concentrate their
business resources where they are needed most. Bodycote's
services offer tangible benefits to customers such as reduced
equipment maintenance, capital expenditure, energy costs,
people costs and a major reduction in CO 2 emissions. 
Bodycote has a long history of successful outsourcing partnerships,
from global to local manufacturers. In many cases, subcontracting
relationships lead to component and service-specific long-term
agreements, or strategic partnering arrangements, which embody
protection and freedom from risk for the customer and Bodycote.
These are often exclusive in character and provide the basis for
mutual business development, with both companies freed to
concentrate capital and other resources on core competencies.
MAKING INNOVATIONS POSSIBLE
Bodycote’s extensive facilities and expertise mean R&D projects can
expand far beyond customers’ in-house capabilities, helping to realise
goals quicker and more cost-effectively.
Around the globe, Bodycote has dedicated R&D teams working on
a variety of projects. When required, this may include the development
of specific processes and equipment for a customer or verification
of materials or designs, prior to their application.
In-house development and improvement of standard processes
has led to Bodycote offering a range of proprietary processes such
as Kolsterising
®
, Corr-I-Dur
®
and SheraCote
®
, which far outperform
their standard counterparts.

OUR GLOBAL NETWORK
OVERVIEW
As the only truly global provider of subcontract thermal processing
services, Bodycote is able to offer a significant advantage to its
customers. Through an international network of plants, Bodycote can
effectively utilise a wealth of knowledge, experience and specialist
expertise to deliver quality service when and where it is needed.
The network operates from 178 locations, with customers able to
benefit from Bodycote’s comprehensive range of services from
multiple locations. Customers know that if their business expands,
Bodycote will have the capability to meet their needs. They know
that if they were to broaden their manufacturing footprint, Bodycote
would be able to assist them. They know that they can obtain the
same process to the same quality standards from multiple locations. 
Such a large network brings economies of scale, with technology
developed at one location being available globally if the market
requires it.
The Bodycote network has a wealth of technical accreditations,
some industry or customer specific, others more general. Individual
operations concentrate on the accreditations suited to their market.
Although Bodycote is headquartered in the UK, 88% of the Group’s
business is outside the UK. With facilities in 27 countries, Bodycote
is truly global.
NORTH AMERICA
Bodycote has 40 facilities in North America, concentrated where
manufacturing and technical industries are located. The network
includes five specialist operations, four offering hot isostatic pressing
(HIP), and the other offering surface technology. HIP capacity has
recently been expanded to ensure that Bodycote is best positioned to
satisfy its customers’ needs when the economic climate improves.
Low pressure carburising capability has been similarly expanded.
This energy efficient technology can, for example, enable automotive
manufacturers to produce 7- and 8-speed automatic transmissions of
modest weight and compact dimensions, which assist in the quest
for lower emissions.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
OVERVIEW 
In 2008, the Board indicated that the Group was already experiencing
the effects of what might become a deep economic downturn.
Looking at the situation one year on, the recession has proved
to be every bit as bad as anticipated and while the worst seems
to be over, there is little sign yet of any meaningful improvement
in trading conditions.
Following the disposal of the Testing division in the final quarter
of 2008, the Board announced the appointment of Stephen Harris
as the new Chief Executive with effect from the start of 2009.
In his first year he has led a major transformation exercise
concentrating to date on three specific areas:
Following an in-depth strategic review, the Group’s operations
and organisation are now focused on its core technologies and
key markets. 
A major restructuring programme has taken place, addressing
the sharp reduction in demand and reducing the fixed and variable
cost base. The results of this are now contributing to the
improved operational results.
Linked to the strategic review, a full evaluation of management
strength in all disciplines has been carried out. This has resulted
in a number of new appointments already, as part of delayering
the organisation, and several positions will be filled in the first
half of 2010.
In the absence of any significant trading upturn, it is still too early
to see the full impact of these initiatives. Nevertheless, the Board
expects that with a revitalised management team focused on key
markets and core technologies, together with a reduction in the
proportion of low value-added activities, the Group should soon
be reporting improved results. The full benefit will only be realised
when sustainable growth returns to our major areas of activity.

Chairman
ID4874_Bc_AR2009_14.qxp  5/3/10  16:06  Page 8 BUSINESS REVIEW : CORPORATE GOVERNANCE : ACCOUNTS BODYCOTE ANNUAL REPORT 2009 9
GROUP RESULTS
The difficulties encountered by most of the businesses are clearly
reflected in the 2009 results. Revenue from operations declined
by 21.1% to £435.4m. At constant rates of exchange, the sales
reduction exceeded 29%. To compensate for the loss of business,
employee numbers have been reduced by a similar proportion and
25 of the original 203 operating sites have been closed. The profit
recovery in the second half of 2009 has started to reflect these
adjustments to the cost base, although the full effect of the changes
will not be evident until the second half of 2010.
It was pleasing to note that the focus on cash management resulted
in a satisfactory year end position. The cash cost of re-organising the
Group’s activities was largely funded by a sharp reduction in working
capital such that the £20.8m increase in net debt during 2009 was
entirely accounted for by the tax paid following the successful disposal
of the Testing division in 2008. It is also reassuring to report that the
Group’s major borrowing facility has, in January 2010, been renewed
with existing banks through until March 2013. This will ensure that
Bodycote can complete its restructuring programme while providing
the fixed and working capital resources which will enable the Group
to fully benefit from the anticipated recovery in major markets over
the next three years. 
SUSTAINABILITY
Despite the enormous efforts made during the year to reposition
the Group’s operations, management recognise that sustainability
must be a key element of the business strategy to deliver future
growth. A responsible approach to the environment is important
to ensure that Bodycote has a sustainable long-term future. Already
over 75% of the facilities have met the ISO 14001 standard which
helps minimise the risk of adverse environmental effects and the aim
is to achieve 100% accreditation in all plants during the coming years. 
Health and Safety statistics are closely monitored and are the subject
of review at each Board and executive meeting. As a business,
Bodycote is committed to providing its employees with a safe working
environment while supporting and enhancing their health and wellbeing.
BOARD
The Non-executive Directors play a vital role in the governance
of the Company and a key measure of Bodycote’s success is their
ability to provide wise counsel to the members of the executive
team. The Board pays great attention to its corporate governance
responsibilities and each year undertakes a review of its own
performance. It is pleasing to report that after a number of changes
in 2007 and 2008 the new Board is performing well, with each member
contributing positively. 
DIVIDEND
The Board considered carefully the level of dividend to be paid
out to shareholders following the 2009 results. Having maintained
the half year payout at the 2008 level, Board members felt that
recent improving trading conditions, linked to the renewal of the
major banking facility, enabled a final dividend of 5.35p per share
to be recommended, giving a total of 8.3p for the year, unchanged
from 2008. Although the disappointing result in 2009 means that
the dividend will not be covered by earnings, the Board is confident
that the actions taken to improve the operating performance,
underpinned by a strong year end balance sheet, should enable
the Group to fully cover the payout in 2010. The final dividend will
be paid to shareholders in May following approval at the Annual
General Meeting. 
SUMMARY
Over the last two years the Non-executive Directors have visited
a large number of Group facilities and met with employees
at all levels. They have been impressed by the dedication and
professionalism of the Group’s staff and would like to thank them
for their contribution in what has been an extremely turbulent
and challenging period. The Board believes that Stephen and his
colleagues have taken the right decisions to ensure that Bodycote
emerges from this unprecedented recession in a position to deliver
enhanced value to shareholders.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
FOCUSED
1
A detailed reconciliation is provided on page 13.
STEPHEN HARRIS
Chief Executive
TRADING OVERVIEW
2009 was undoubtedly one of the fiercest economic storms that
Bodycote, and indeed most other companies, has endured. In the
face of rapidly declining demand on almost every front, volumes fell
at the worst point to nearly 37% below prior year levels. The storm
started to abate in the fourth quarter of the year and the final picture
for the whole of 2009 was a year-on-year revenue decline of
£116.4m, or 29.6% in constant currencies, to £435.4m.
Aided by significant and rapid restructuring actions, the fall in
headline operating profit
1
was contained to £63.2m, so that the year
end figure finished at £8.0m (2008: £71.2m), notwithstanding the
loss that was incurred in the first half. This represents an operational
gearing of 40%, at constant currencies, well below that exhibited by
Bodycote in previous downturns. The restructuring actions led to an
exceptional charge of £25.4m, of which £12.8m was cash and £12.6m
was asset write-downs. In addition, the impairment of goodwill and
investments amounted to £31.5m.
The restructuring programme has involved the closure of 25 facilities
in total, the permanent decommissioning of some inefficient process
lines and mothballing of others at a number of the remaining plants,
together with the matching of headcount to demand throughout the
organisation. The benefit has been a cost reduction of £30.4m in
2009 - equivalent to £43.0m on an annualised basis. In addition to these
restructuring actions, all costs were critically examined and reduced
where possible, leading to further substantial savings. The number
of employees has been reduced by 29% since the peak in July 2008,
to a total of 5,512. 
The savings achieved from closing or consolidating plants and
decommissioning lines are permanent. Other savings are largely volume
related and can be expected to reverse to some degree as volumes rise. 
Capital expenditure at £32.2m was well controlled and yielded a
capital expenditure to depreciation ratio of 0.6, net of £4.3m of asset
sales. This was 57% lower than in 2008. Headline operating cash
flow
1
was £34.7m, well above headline operating profit. Year end
net debt was £85.5m (2008: £64.7m). The increase in net debt was
effectively due to £22.4m of tax paid in the year relating to the disposal
of the Testing division that occurred in 2008.
A new £110m debt facility, extending until 2013, was put in place
in January 2010, replacing the expiring 2010 facility. A second facility for
$20m, which was also due to expire in 2010 was renewed in February
2010 and also extends to 2013. The covenant terms are unchanged,
and the facilities provide headroom for expansion opportunities.

RESHAPING BODYCOTE
As the restructuring activities have progressed, great care has been
taken to ensure that operational excellence and customer service
have been maintained and that the business is ready for the upturn.
In addition, a detailed strategic review has been carried out that has
enabled us to refine our future strategy and reshape the business
along specific strategic lines. The Group has now been organised as
two business areas, each facing a different customer set with different
characteristics and different requirements. 
The Aerospace, Defence & Energy (ADE) business consists of 63
facilities and is organised on a global basis. It includes the Group’s
aerospace, defence and energy certified heat treatment activities,
hot isostatic pressing and surface technology services. The latter two
of these technologies are predominantly used in the aerospace, defence
and energy markets and the total available market is overwhelmingly
in these end-user sectors.
The Automotive & General Industrial (AGI) business consists of
115 facilities organised into four geographically based sub-divisions.
The geographic organisation reflects the predominance of local
work that is carried out for customers in the automotive and general
industrial sectors.
It is worth noting that all of Bodycote’s facilities in the emerging
markets (Eastern Europe, Brazil and Asia), with the exception of the
facilities in Singapore and Dubai, are part of the Automotive & General
Industrial business. While this does not impede our ability to expand
in the ADE sectors when it is required in these geographies, it does
reflect the growth of core manufacturing activities in the emerging
markets that the AGI customers are driving. So far, our customers
from the developed markets in the ADE sectors have moved (or are
in the process of moving) primarily activities such as assembly to
these markets. Little or none of this ADE assembly activity requires
the thermal processing services that Bodycote offers.
One of the refinements to the strategy is to be more selective about
which emerging markets we pursue, and to drive harder in those
we target. As a consequence of this approach, we have consolidated
our facilities in India into one (from three) and have exited Thailand.
The small associate venture in Thailand was sold back to the original
owners in late 2009. 
In total, the new divisional structure allows the Company to
discriminate much more readily between different types of customer
needs and to focus activity and investment in a more deliberate way.
In keeping with the new organisational structure, the executive
committee has been expanded from five to nine members with
the addition of two new global Divisional Presidents, a Director
of Human Resources and a Director of Business Development.
THE FUTURE
Irrespective of the pace of the recovery, in the short term the tighter
business disciplines and more focused capital investment procedures
which were put in place in 2009 will enhance shareholder value in
2010 and beyond. The business process improvement and customer
service enhancement programmes initiated during the year are another
part of the drive for value creation.
Bodycote’s recovery will be driven not only by general global demand
but also by our own ability to gain market share. In addition, in the
longer term, Bodycote stands to benefit from two trends.
The first is a likely acceleration in the trend for customers to outsource.
In 2009 many have seen the problems associated with having high
fixed cost thermal processing operations in-house that are entirely
dependent on their own product throughput. Outsourcing this type of
activity, which is often not core to our customers’ business, is becoming
a hotter topic as a result of the recession.
The second significant factor that will help to drive Bodycote’s business
in the coming years is the growing awareness of environmental
sustainability and the need for carbon reduction. One of Bodycote’s
core competences as specialists in thermal processing is the efficient
use of energy. The ability to aggregate work from multiple customers
and process the work in a more energy efficient way helps reduce
costs for customers and also lowers their aggregate carbon footprint.
Clearly, the key to Bodycote’s future success is its employees. The
difficulties of 2009 have been demanding, and the Group’s employees
have risen to the challenge that the world economy threw at us and
moved the business a long way forward, even in the face of adversity.
SUMMARY & OUTLOOK
2009 was a year of transition for Bodycote, with a major cost reduction
programme implemented, a new strategy defined and the Group
reshaped accordingly. End markets were very challenging with sharply
lower volumes, the impact of which was addressed by significant cost
reductions. We delivered a headline operating profit for the full year,
more than offsetting the losses incurred in the first half. Many of our
automotive and general industrial markets have already started to recover
but we do not expect the aerospace, defence and energy markets to
strengthen until later in 2010. The pace of recovery remains uncertain
and potentially uneven. We anticipate that full recovery in demand may
take several years. This notwithstanding, we enter 2010 with a reshaped
business and renewed vigour.

BUSINESS PERFORMANCE
BUSINESS PERFORMANCE
Group revenue from continuing operations was £435.4m,
a decrease of £116.4m (21.1%) on 2008 (£551.8m). The decline in
revenues at constant exchange rates amounted to £163.3m (29.6%),
which included revenues of £12.5m (2.3%) lost due to plant closures. 
The restructuring of the Group was largely completed in 2009,
but required a further charge of £25.4m, of which asset write-downs
accounted for £12.6m and cash costs for £12.8m. No further
restructuring charges are expected in 2010.
An impairment charge of £31.5m was made following the
management’s review of the carrying value of assets. Of the total
charge, £29.0m related to goodwill and the balance of £2.5m arose
following the unwinding of the associate venture in Thailand. 
Consequently the Group is reporting an operating loss of £50.2m
(2008: loss £51.7m).
Headline operating profit for the Group’s continuing operations
was £8.0m, a decrease of £63.2m compared to 2008. Foreign
currency movements increased profits by £1.1m (1.5% on 2008).
Headline operating margins from continuing operations declined
from 12.9% to 1.8%. 
Headline Operating cash flow of £34.7m is made up of £57.4m
EBITDA, a positive contribution from reduced working capital of £9.0m,
and net capital expenditure of £32.2m.
After interest and tax payments, the headline free cash flow was £26.8m.
The outflow on exceptional items totalled £41.6m, of which £22.4m
was the tax payable on the Testing disposal, and £19.2m was the
cash spend on the restructuring programme, of which £6.4m had
been accrued in the previous year.
Capital expenditure was restricted to necessary items of renewal
along with the completion of expansion projects started before the
downturn. Capital spend (net of asset sales) in 2009 was £32.2m,
being 0.6 times depreciation compared to 1.3 times in 2008.
There has been a continued focus on cash collection and debtor days
have been reduced to an average of 66 days in 2009, compared to
68 days in 2008 which, along with the decline in revenue, accounts
for the reduction in working capital.

Reducing the environmental impact of the
Group’s activities is taken very seriously.
Compliance with the requirements of ISO 14001
helps minimise the risk of adverse environmental
effects at Bodycote locations. At the end of
2009, 77% of our plants had ISO 14001
accreditation - 137 plants out of a total of
178 (2008: 137 out of 193).
Bodycote works tirelessly to reduce workplace
accidents and is committed to providing a
safe environment for anyone who works at,
or visits, our locations. The major restructuring
programme has not made this an easy task in
2009. Nevertheless, the Accident Frequency

Incorporating HIP and Surface Technology
Within the ADE sectors, our customers tend to think
and operate globally and increasingly expect Bodycote
to service them in the same way. Consequently,
the ADE business is organised globally. This gives
Bodycote a notable advantage as the only thermal
processing company with a global footprint and
knowledge of operating in all of the world’s key
manufacturing areas. A number of Bodycote’s
most important customers fall within the compass
of ADE and Bodycote intends to continue to leverage
its unique market position to increase revenues in
these market sectors. The business incorporates
the Group’s activities in hot isostatic pressing and
surface technology as well as the relevant heat
treatment services.
AUTOMOTIVE & GENERAL INDUSTRIAL (AGI)
Incorporating Speciality Stainless Steel
Processes – S3P
Whilst the AGI marketplace has many multinational
customers, it also has very many medium sized and
smaller businesses, with the large multinationals
tending to operate on a more regionally focused
basis, as opposed to globally. Generally, there are
more competitors to Bodycote in AGI and much
of the business is very locally oriented, meaning
that proximity to the customer is very important
and excellent service is vital. 
Bodycote’s uniquely large network of 115 AGI
facilities enables the business to offer the widest
range of technical capability and security of supply.
The AGI business aims to increase the proportion
of technically differentiated services it offers.
Bodycote has a long and successful history of
serving this wide-ranging customer base and the
newly established AGI business serves our North
America, Western Europe and Emerging markets.
The activities and management of the Group
have been reorganised into two market-facing
business areas that reflect the differing
market and customer characteristics in two
broadly defined groupings.

Like aircraft turbine blades and vanes,
land-based gas turbine components used
for power generation must withstand extreme
temperatures in operation. These materials frequently operate
at temperatures approaching their melting point – heat treatment,
HIP and the use of surface technology allows these blades to operate reliably
at these high temperatures for extended periods of time.

BUSINESS REVIEW - AEROSPACE, DEFENCE & ENERGY 
INCORPORATING HIP AND SURFACE TECHNOLOGY
RESULTS
Revenues for ADE were £189.5m in 2009 compared to £220.1m
in 2008, a reduction of 13.9%. Revenues in constant currencies
were lower by 23.5% reflecting reduced aerospace after-market
requirements, some postponement of large power generation
projects and the impact of lower oil prices on oil & gas exploration
and production. Revenues benefited by 9.6% as a consequence
of the weakness of sterling compared to most of the currencies
in the countries in which the Group operates.
Headline operating profit for ADE was £24.7m (2008: £45.5m),
with margins weakening from 20.7% to 13.0%. The restructuring
programme delivered cost savings of £9.8m in 2009 and the
annualised rate as we enter 2010 is expected to amount to £14.5m.
2009 was characterised by a significant reduction in capital
expenditure across the Group, including in ADE, as widespread
reduction in customer demand left capacity available for medium-term
development. Long lead-time projects which were started before the
recession, most notably the installation of a new large HIP unit in
Sweden, were, however, completed or largely completed in 2009. 
Capital employed in ADE in 2009 was £244.2m (2008: £249.8m).
The reduction reflects the effects of the restructuring programme,
which included the closure of facilities and the removal of assets
from service in a number of other locations, partly offset by investment
to enhance the capabilities of the business. Net capital expenditure
in 2009 was £19.1m (2008: £20.2m) which represents 1.1 times
depreciation (2008: 1.2 times depreciation). Return on capital employed
in 2009 was 10.1% (2008: 18.2%).
MARKETS 
Aerospace demand declined at a steady rate throughout the year with
after-market requirements falling in response to reduced flying hours
by airlines. Business with OEM airframe and engine manufacturers
remained solid, especially for wide-body programmes. Defence demand
has remained good.
Power generation requirements softened as the year progressed and
in Europe demand fell substantially in the second half. This impacted
both heat treatment and hot isostatic pressing and reflects customer
inventory adjustments and some push-back in major power station build
programmes around the world.
Oil & gas suffered significant decline as global energy prices fell
and with them exploration and production activity, although work for
production activity started to strengthen towards the end of the year.

ACHIEVEMENTS IN 2009
2009 saw the formation of the global Aerospace, Defence & Energy
business. This has resulted in the realignment of some 63 facilities
into a single, market-focused organisation targeted at meeting the
requirements of major OEMs and their supply chains throughout
the world. The ADE business has 34 Nadcap accredited facilities.
Many facilities are also approved to the aerospace quality standard
AS 9100. An important area of development in 2009 was to position
the business to benefit from the impending growth in build programmes
for the Airbus A380 and Boeing Dreamliner for airframe, engine and
landing gear components.
ORGANISATION AND PEOPLE
The establishment of the ADE business required a number of
organisational changes to enable the new market-focused approach
to operate efficiently. At the same time, management implemented
significant cost cutting measures, including the closure of six locations
to deal with the effects of reduced demand. The majority of the
processing capability and sales were transferred to other facilities.
The objective has been to reduce the cost base and, at the same
time, improve the efficiency of service. Although this resulted in a
headcount reduction of 439 during the year and 489 since July 2008,
the business is now positioned to be more effective in meeting
customer requirements.
LOOKING AHEAD
The key objective for ADE in 2010 is to realise the benefits of
the new market-facing organisation and drive the expansion of its
proprietary and differentiated technologies. The new market-facing
organisation is targeted at improving the customer experience of
Bodycote and increasing the business’s understanding of the
requirements of prime manufacturers. This, in turn, is expected
to increase sales to existing clients and to improve the conversion
rate of potential into actual business.

INCORPORATING SPECIALITY STAINLESS STEEL PROCESSES – S3P
RESULTS
Automotive & General Industrial revenues were £245.9m in 2009,
which compares to £331.7m in 2008, a reduction of 25.9%. In constant
currencies revenues were down by 33.1%, reflecting the widespread
reduction in manufacturing output in all geographies. Revenues benefited
by 7.2% as a result of the weakness of sterling compared to 2008.
Demand began to improve slowly in the fourth quarter of 2009, but had
only a modest impact on the year as a whole. 
Headline operating loss in AGI was £13.3m compared to a headline
operating profit of £29.8m in 2008. Margins fell from 9.0% to minus
5.4%. The restructuring programme has been substantial and the
AGI business realised savings of £20.6m in 2009. This is expected
to increase to £28.5m in 2010.
Net capital expenditure in 2009 was £12.5m (2008: £34.9m), which
represents 0.4 times depreciation (2008: 1.1 times depreciation).
Return on capital employed in 2009 was minus 4.2% (2008: 7.9%).
On average, capital employed in 2009 was £315.1m (2008: £377.6m).
The major part of the reduction was due to the effects of the
restructuring programme, including the various plant closures.
The business is increasingly focusing on higher added-value activities.
MARKETS AND GEOGRAPHIES
The Automotive & General Industrial business serves an extensive
variety of customers and has been impacted by the wide-ranging
recession that began to affect Bodycote’s business in the fourth
quarter of 2008. This has only recently begun to abate, albeit at
a modest pace. The largest reductions were in the heavy truck
sector (down by 48.1%), followed by automotive (down by 29.0%).
General industrial sectors were down by an average of 22.7%.
Overall, the business recorded sales down by 25.9% compared to
2008, a notable part of which was the result of supply chain destocking.
In North America, automotive demand began to fall early in this
recession (during the middle of 2008) and the year-on-year reduction
in 2009 was 15.5%. Demand began to improve in the second half
of 2009. General industrial sales declined by 17.7% in 2009 and
have remained at these reduced levels in the latter part of 2009.
In Western Europe, sales in the automotive sector were down by
over 40.0% and this had a significant impact on Bodycote’s business,
particularly in France, Germany and Italy. The most severe impact of
the downturn, however, was felt in the heavy truck sector, in which
Bodycote has a concentration in Sweden and Germany. Sales to
this sector were down by approximately 60%, with only a modest
recovery to date. Across Western Europe sales were down by 27.7%
compared to 2008.

automotive & general industrial
The impact of the recession has been quite varied in Bodycote’s
emerging market territories. In Eastern Europe, the Czech Republic
was down 40.5% year-on-year, reflecting its reliance on German
manufacturing. By contrast, Polish sales declined by 30.9% as heavy
machinery and mining demand was less severely impacted than
automotive. In Brazil, sales are split broadly evenly between automotive
and general industrial markets and, although year-on-year revenues
were down 25.9%, sales have started to recover. In Asia (China and
India) the downturn was short-lived and recovery is well underway.
As a consequence, 2009 sales were only 5.2% below those of 2008.
ACHIEVEMENTS IN 2009
During the year, the Group has reinforced the geographically oriented
management structure within the Automotive & General Industrial
business. The nature of the markets has some distinct differences
in each of the North American, Western European and emerging
economies, particularly in the level of the maturity of thermal
processing requirements. This, along with the typically local nature
of customer requirements, means the business is organised to focus
on geographic areas. As a consequence of reductions in demand,
restructuring of the AGI’s cost base has been critical and has been
pursued vigorously.
The business has continued to increase capacity in several
specialist technologies which have all suffered less than average
reductions in demand during the downturn and, in some cases,
sales have increased in 2009. Low pressure carburising, which
is being used increasingly for high-end automotive gears, in both
North America and Europe, recorded growth as new transmissions
were introduced by power train manufacturers. 2009 also saw the
first full year of production for Speciality Stainless Steel Processes
(a sub-division of the AGI business) in southern Germany, to
complement existing capability in the Netherlands, France and the USA.
A new facility in Finland is now operational and able to service the
wind energy market for deep case carburising of very large gears.
ORGANISATION AND PEOPLE
In July 2008, the AGI business employed 5,201 people, but by
the end of 2009 this had been reduced to 3,505. At the same time,
19 facilities were shut permanently and in many locations equipment
and production lines have been mothballed. In addition, many pieces
of equipment from closed sites have been transferred to new
locations or placed in storage for future use, as and when customer
demand increases. 
LOOKING AHEAD
The major objectives for the Automotive & General Industrial
business are to realise the full benefits of the extensive restructuring
programme of 2009, expand the use of Bodycote’s proprietary
technologies and drive migration of technology from the developed
to the emerging markets. Additionally, the business will continue
to reduce the amount of low-return work it processes and increasingly
focus on delivering value to customers.

FINANCE DIRECTOR’S REPORT
FINANCIAL OVERVIEW
Group results for 2009 were severely impacted by the economic
downturn, with revenue falling by 21.1% from £551.8m to £435.4m
and, as a consequence, headline operating profit fell from £71.2m
to £8.0m. To deal with the changed circumstances an impairment
charge of £31.5m was made and a wide ranging restructuring of the
Group’s activities, aimed at better aligning the cost base with these
lower demand levels, resulted in an exceptional charge for facility
closures of £25.4m. In 2010 these restructuring initiatives, begun in
2008 and extended in 2009, can be expected to generate annualised
savings of £43.0m for the Group, of which £36.2m are cash savings.
Consequently the Group reported an operating loss for the year of
£50.2m (2008: £51.7m).
Despite the much reduced headline operating profit, the Group was
still able to report a positive operating cash flow of £15.5m (2008:
£61.0m), mainly because net capital expenditure in 2009 fell to £32.2m
compared to £74.9m in 2008. After deducting interest, tax and lump
sum pension contributions, the Group reported a negative free cash
flow of £14.8m (2008: positive £11.5m).
Bodycote begins 2010 with its funding position secured. Two of the
three bank facilities were due to mature during 2010. These have been
refinanced in line with the Group’s funding requirements following
the disposal of the Testing division and taking into account the cost
of holding undrawn funds. Total funding now available to Bodycote
under its committed facilities is £233.4m (2008: £359.8m).

EXCEPTIONAL COSTS
The total exceptional costs charged to the income statement amounted
to £58.2m (2008: £122.9m) and were made up of the following elements:
Amortisation of acquired intangible fixed assets £1.3m (2008: £1.3m)
The charge relates to the amortisation of intangible assets arising from
acquisitions. There were no acquisitions during 2009 and, as a result,
there was no change to the charge compared to 2008.
Impairment Charge £31.5m (2008: £44.0m)
The impairment charge arose as a result of the write-down of goodwill
(£29.0m) and a further £2.5m arose in respect of the unwinding of the
associate venture in Thailand. The Group tests goodwill semi-annually
and the charge relates to goodwill for businesses that have been
discontinued or where management has concluded that book value
of goodwill was in excess of its recoverable amount. The largest
impairment was for goodwill attributable to the 2001 Lindberg acquisition
in the North American heat treatment business, amounting to £25.0m.
Major Facility Closure Costs £25.4m (2008: £77.6m)
The major facility closure costs of £25.4m relate to the 2009
restructuring programme and includes asset write-downs of £12.6m
and cash costs of £12.8m. The restructuring programme was started
in 2008 in response to the economic downturn that began in the last
quarter of that year. It became clear early in 2009 that the downturn
was deeper than anticipated and additional restructuring initiatives
were launched across the Group, with the most significant being
in Brazil, France, Germany and Sweden. The total cost of the
restructuring programme since 2008 has been £103.0m, of which
£55.3m related to the write-down of assets and £47.7m to cash
costs including redundancies, dismantling and site clean-up.
As at 31 December 2009, £21.3m of the cash costs had been spent.
Of the remaining £26.4m cash costs, £17.7m is expected to be spent
in 2010 and £8.7m in 2011 and later. Of these costs, £6.2m is to
cover redundancy payments, £10.7m for site closure and £9.5m
for environmental remediation. 
Annual savings compared to pre-restructuring base
The restructuring initiatives delivered savings of £30.4m in 2009,
of which £25.6m are cash savings. The level of savings will increase
to £43.0m in 2010, as Bodycote sees the benefits of the completion
of the restructuring programme.
Restructuring provisions outstanding at 31 December 2009 total
£27.1m, being £26.4m related to the 2008/2009 programme and
£0.7m related to environmental remediation from earlier initiatives.
OPERATING LOSS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS
After charging exceptional items of £58.2m (2008: £122.9m),
the operating loss from continuing operations was £50.2m
(2008: loss of £51.7m). 
LOSS BEFORE TAX FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS
Headline profit before tax for the continuing operations was £3.7m
(2008: £67.6m). The loss before tax for the continuing operations
was £54.5m (2008: loss of £55.3m).
Headline profit before tax is derived as follows: 
FINANCE CHARGE
The net finance charge from the continuing operations of the Group
was £4.3m compared to £3.6m in 2008. The increase arose from a
combination of higher average net debt and higher pension finance
costs offset by lower interest rates.

FINANCE DIRECTOR’S REPORT
CONTINUED
TAXATION
Total taxation was a credit of £3.4m for the year compared to a credit
of £17.2m for 2008. The effective tax rate for the Group of 6.2%
resulted from the impact of blending profit-making jurisdictions with
loss-making jurisdictions and of differing tax rates in each of the
countries in which the Group operates (2008: 31.1%).
The headline tax rate on continuing operations for 2009 was 108.1%
(2008:18.3%), being stated before amortisation of goodwill and acquired
intangibles (both of which are generally not allowable for tax purposes)
and before exceptional items. The unusual tax rate in 2009 results from
the impact of combining the results of profit-making and loss-making
entities that have different underlying tax rates and from the de-recognition
of certain tax losses. A revival in economic conditions should enable
utilisation and recognition of these tax losses in future years. The average
underlying tax rates for Bodycote’s profit and loss making subsidiaries
were 28.8% and 24.9% respectively.
ASSOCIATED COMPANY – SSCP COATINGS SARL (SSCP)
SSCP is a highly leveraged private equity controlled business.
Bodycote currently owns 24.4% of the share capital of SSCP,
but the Group has previously fully impaired its equity and loans
to this business. There is no impact in the Group’s accounts in
2009 (2008: impairment charge of £12.1m).
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Bodycote has not discontinued any business streams during 2009.
In 2008, the Group sold its Testing division, which recorded sales
of £164.9m and an operating profit of £19.9m in 2008.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic headline earnings per share (as defined in note 10) decreased
to 0.4p from 17.5p. Basic (loss)/earnings per share for the year are
shown in the table below: 
DIVIDEND
The Board has recommended a final dividend of 5.35p (2008: 5.35p)
bringing the total dividend to 8.30p per share (2008: 8.30p). In December
2008 an additional, special distribution of 40p per ordinary share (from
the proceeds from the disposal of the Testing division) was paid in
December 2008. The 2009 dividend is not covered by basic headline
earnings per share, as defined in note 10 (2008: 2.1 times).
If approved by shareholders, the final dividend of 5.35p per share
for 2009 will be paid on 7 May 2010 to all shareholders on the register
at close of business on 9 April 2010.
CAPITAL STRUCTURE
The Group’s balance sheet at 31 December 2009 is summarised below:
Net assets decreased by £74.3m (15.0%) to £422.6m (2008: £496.9m).
The major movements compared to 31 December 2008 were due to
a decrease in property, plant and equipment (£71.5m), and goodwill
and intangible assets (£35.6m), which were partly offset by an increase
in net current assets (£41.7m).
The largest decrease in property, plant and equipment came from
foreign exchange translation losses (£37.7m) as a consequence of the
stronger sterling rates on 31 December 2009 compared to 31 December
2008, particularly for the Euro and the US Dollar. Furthermore, net
capital expenditure of £32.2m was exceeded by depreciation of £50.9m,
while asset write-downs, as part of the restructuring programme,
accounted for £12.6m.
The decrease in the goodwill asset resulted largely from the impairment
testing performed by management.
Large movements were reported for net current assets. The reduced
level of trading activity in 2009 compared to 2008 meant that trade
receivables and other receivables decreased by £37.3m and trade
and other payables decreased by £25.7m. Current tax liabilities
decreased by £22.2m because the 2008 figure included a taxation
liability which was settled during 2009 in respect of gains on disposal
of the US Testing business of £22.4m.

Net liabilities for derivative financial instruments decreased by
£26.0m due to a combination of instrument maturity and changes
in exchange and interest rates.
NET DEBT
Group net debt was £85.5m (2008: £64.7m). During the year, loans of
£209.1m under committed facilities were repaid and as a consequence
gross cash decreased by £238.8m to £19.6m. The Group continues to
be able to borrow at competitive rates and, therefore, currently deems
this to be the most effective means of funding.
CASH FLOW
The net decrease in cash and cash equivalents was £231.6m (2008:
net increase of £209.4m), made up of net cash from operating activities
of £11.0m, less investing activities of £27.3m and less cash used in
financing activities of £215.3m, following the use of surplus cash
balances to reduce debt.
The total cash generated by the Group during 2009 was £441.0m
lower than last year. In 2008 the Group benefited from the £400.1m
received from the disposal of the Testing division, of which £128.8m
was distributed to shareholders as a special dividend. Furthermore,
in 2009 the Group also suffered from lower cash generated from
operating activities of £91.5m compared to 2008, mainly because the
EBITDA for 2009 was lower by £73.7m (62.3% lower than 2008).
This reduction in cash generation from operations was largely
mitigated by lower net expenditure on capital expenditure and
acquisitions (down £84.0m). The net cash outflow arising from loan
repayments and new bank loans raised amounted to £192.8m.
There has been a continued focus on cash collection with debtor days
at 31 December 2009 falling to 63 days from 68 days a year earlier.
Net interest payments for the year were £4.4m (2008: £8.0m) and tax
payments were £24.4m (2008: £20.5m), of which £22.4m related to
the disposal of the Testing division.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
Net capital expenditure (capital expenditure less proceeds from asset
disposals) for the year was £32.2m (2008: £74.9m). The multiple of
net capital expenditure to depreciation was 0.6 times (2008: 1.3 times),
which was a reflection of the Group’s response to the economic
environment by reducing non-essential capital expenditure.
A proportion of the capital expenditure was incurred to support
the restructuring programme in the consolidation of plants and the
re-installation of furnaces transferred from closed plants. However,
to increase capacity the Group continued to invest in a small number
of long-lead time projects such as the new large HIP unit in Surahammar
(Sweden) and a new Corr-I-Dur plant in Krnov (Czech Republic).
BORROWING FACILITIES
At 31 December 2009, Bodycote had three committed bank facilities:
£225.0m (2008: £225.0m), expiring August 2010; ?125.0m (2008:
?125.0m), expiring July 2013; and US$20.0m (2008: US$20.0m),
expiring July 2010, totalling £348.4m (2008: £359.8m). At the same
date, the three facilities were drawn £0.0m (2008: £194.8m), £96.2m
(2008: £107.3m) and £6.5m (2008: £10.5m) respectively, totalling
£102.7m (2008: £312.6m).
On 8 January 2010 the £225m Revolving Credit Facility was refinanced
with a committed facility at a lower amount of £110m to reflect the
Group’s lower expected funding requirements, with a maturity date of
31 March 2013. In addition, on 18 February 2010, the US$20m Revolving
Credit Facility was also refinanced to a maturity date of 31 March 2013.
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group
will be able to continue as a going concern, while maximising the
return to shareholders. The capital structure of the Group consists
of debt which includes borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and
equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising capital,
reserves and retained earnings.
The capital structure is reviewed regularly by the Group’s Board of
Directors. The Group’s policy is to maintain gearing, determined as
the proportion of net debt to total capital, within defined parameters,
allowing movement in the capital structure appropriate to the business
cycle and corporate activity. The gearing ratio at 31 December 2009
was 20.2% (2008: 13.0%).
The Group’s debt funding policy is to borrow centrally (where it
is tax efficient to do so), using a mixture of short-term borrowings,
longer-term loans and finance leases. These borrowings, together
with cash generated from operations, are lent or contributed as equity
to certain subsidiaries. The aim of the Group’s funding policy is to
ensure continuity of finance at reasonable cost, based on committed
facilities from several sources, arranged with a spread of maturities.
The current market for bank funding is restricted to shorter tenors
than have been available in the past and, therefore, steps will be taken
in due course to extend the maturity profile of the Group’s funding
(currently 3.3 years).
DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION ARRANGEMENTS
The Group has defined benefit pension obligations in the UK,
Germany, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, USA and Brazil and cash lump
sum obligations in France, Italy and Turkey, the entire liabilities for which
are reflected in the Group balance sheet. In the UK, the Group has a
final salary scheme which was closed to new members in April 2001,
but continues to accrue benefits for the 131 current employee members.
The deficit, as calculated by the scheme actuary at 31 December
2009, using the principles of IAS 19, is £3.7m (2008: £0.7m).
ID4874_Bc_AR2009_14.qxp  5/3/10  16:08  Page 29 30 BODYCOTE ANNUAL REPORT 2009    BUSINESS REVIEW : CORPORATE GOVERNANCE : ACCOUNTS
FINANCE DIRECTOR’S REPORT
CONTINUED
The Group’s heat treatment business in Germany has inherited several
small defined benefit arrangements. They are all unfunded and are closed
to new members but the existing members continue to accrue benefits.
The IAS 19 liability at 31 December 2009 was £3.5m (2008: £3.3m).
In Liechtenstein the IAS 19 liability at 31 December 2009 was
£0.2m (2008: £0.3m) and in Switzerland was £0.1m (2008: £0.1m).
Arrangements in both countries are funded. In Sweden, the last
remaining defined benefit arrangement was bought out in full in
July 2009 at a cost of £1.5m. The Company now only has a defined
contribution liability. In France, the Group operates a plan which pays
a cash lump sum on retirement and also for long service. The plan is
open to new employees but by its nature is not mortality dependent.
It is unfunded and the IAS 19 liability at 31 December 2009 was £5.7m
(2008: £6.8m). Italy and Turkey also have unfunded cash lump sum
obligations which are open to new members. The IAS 19 liability
is £0.8m for Italy (2008: £0.8m) and £0.2m for Turkey (2008: £0.1m).
The Group sponsors three defined benefit pension arrangements
in the USA which were inherited with the acquisition of Lindberg
and these had a total IAS 19 deficit at 31 December 2009 of £0.6m
(2008: £1.2m). There is no further accrual of benefits. In Brazil,
Bodycote operates a defined benefit plan for three senior members
of staff. It is funded and the members continue to accrue benefits.
At 31 December 2009 it had a deficit of £0.2m (2008: £0.2m surplus).
POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS
On 8 January 2010, the Group concluded the refinancing of a new
£110m Revolving Credit Facility replacing the larger, £225m facility,
which was set to mature in August 2010. The lower facility size
reflects the reduced borrowing requirement following the disposal
of the Testing division in 2008. On 18 February 2010 the Group also
concluded the refinancing of its $20m Revolving Credit Facility.
CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The changes in accounting policies are detailed in the Accounting
Policies on page 61 of this report.
GOING CONCERN
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to
affect its future development, performance and position are set out
in this Group Review. The review includes an overview of the Group’s
financial position, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities.
In addition, there is a description of the Group’s objectives, policies
and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management
objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities;
and its exposures to credit and liquidity risk.
The Group meets its working capital requirements through a
combination of committed and uncommitted facilities and overdrafts.
The overdrafts and uncommitted facilities are repayable on demand
but the committed facilities are due for renewal as shown right. 
There is sufficient headroom in the committed facility covenants
to assume that these facilities can be operated as contracted for the
foreseeable future.
US$20m Revolving Credit Facility maturing 31 March 2013
£110m Revolving Credit Facility maturing 31 March 2013
?125m Revolving Credit Facility maturing 31 July 2013
The current economic conditions create uncertainty, particularly over
the levels of demand for the Group’s services and the availability of
bank and capital market finance in the future. However, the Group’s
forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonable potential
changes in trading performance, show that the Group should be
able to operate within the level of its current committed facilities.
After making enquiries, the Directors have formed a judgement,
at the time of approving the financial statements, that there is a
reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason the Directors continue to adopt the going concern
basis in preparing the financial statements.
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
Operational
Markets
The key risk faced by the Group is a reduction in end market demand.
Forecasting this demand, given short visibility and the macro uncertainty
faced by much of Bodycote’s customer base, is difficult and means
the Group must remain constantly ready to adapt to the changing
environment. However, during 2009 the Group has demonstrated that
it is able to react quickly to any change in external demand. Regular
dialogue with customers and monitoring of macro-economic forecasts
help alert the Group to likely changes in demand. A proportion of the
workforce is employed on temporary contracts to ensure that the cost
base can be changed quickly. Bodycote has excellent long-term
relationships with its major customers and the Group’s network of
strategically located facilities ensures that it is the supplier of choice
to these major manufacturers.
Commercial relationships
The Group benefits from many long-term and partnership agreements
with key customers. Damage to, or loss of, any of these relationships
may be detrimental to Group results, although management believe
this is highly unlikely. Given that Bodycote’s top ten customers
account for less than 12% of sales, with the balance made up by
many thousands of customers, revenue concentration risk is low
and, therefore, there is no significant customer dependency.
ID4874_Bc_AR2009_14.qxp  5/3/10  16:08  Page 30 BUSINESS REVIEW : CORPORATE GOVERNANCE : ACCOUNTS BODYCOTE ANNUAL REPORT 2009 31
Competitors
Bodycote’s markets are fragmented, although less so in Aerospace,
Defence & Energy, and this means that the actions of competitors
are typically felt locally, rather than across the Group.
Human resources
People are Bodycote’s greatest asset and also form its largest cost.
The Group works hard at maintaining a respectful and trusting
relationship with all employees. Individually tailored training and
development is conducted to enhance employee effectiveness,
and assessment prior to recruitment is rigorous. However, Bodycote
is mindful that there must be strong control on people costs, which
can be adjusted more easily in North America, the UK and some
emerging economies, but much less so in continental Europe where
the Group strives to keep a portion of its workforce flexible against
a background of more restrictive employment laws. 
Defined benefit pension arrangements
The Group provides retirement benefits for its former and current
employees through a number of pension schemes in the UK and
overseas. Future actuarial valuations and annual funding checks for
these arrangements may require increased employer contributions,
the level of which will depend on investment performance, mortality
rates, annuity rates and changes in other actuarial assumptions.
The arrangements in France, Italy and Turkey, which offer a lump
sum payable on retirement, are not subject to mortality risk and
are open to new and existing employees. The final salary scheme
in the UK was closed to new entrants in 2001 but allows future
accrual to its 131 active members. No new defined benefit schemes
will be established, and other schemes in the Group have modest
liabilities – for more detail refer to page 93.
Safety and health
The Group’s work environment has numerous and varied risks.
Bodycote strives to mitigate these by providing specific systems,
equipment, training and supervision relating to different working
environments. Risk is evaluated by internal and external resources
so that it is continuously managed and mitigated.
Brand and reputation 
As the world leader in the provision of thermal processing services,
Bodycote is a valuable and well-known business-to-business brand.
Any damage to the brand because of the breakdown of commercial
relationships, non-compliance with laws and regulations, misuse
of human or other resources in breach of the Group’s corporate
ethos could have an adverse impact on the business as a whole.
For these reasons Bodycote has instituted an effective programme
under which employees can and do use the Group’s Open Door Policy
to report legitimate concerns about business conduct to the most
senior executives and Non-executive Directors. 
Energy
An increase in energy cost is a risk which the Group is largely able
to mitigate, although with some time lag, through price adjustments
or surcharges. Bodycote expects to be able to continue this practice.
An Energy Risk Management Committee operates to oversee the
purchasing of all the Group’s energy requirements.
Operations
The Group’s stringent quality systems, along with internal and external
audits and as well as customers’ verification of results, minimises
the risk of releasing into use work which is not in compliance with
specification, which could arise as a result of system or human failure.
Environment
Bodycote is mindful of the need to reduce its impact on the
environment to a minimum. Some of the Group’s heat treatment
plants use solvents and other hazardous chemicals in small quantities
and, where such substances are used, there is the potential for ground
contamination. Past exposures are provided for and remediated as
and when required. The likelihood of future problems is mitigated by
stringent procedures, typically under the requirement of ISO 14001
environmental systems.
Financial 
The Group’s treasury function provides a centralised service to the
Group for funding, foreign exchange, interest rate management and
counterparty risk. Treasury activities have the objective of minimising
risk and treasury operations are conducted within a framework of
policies and guidelines authorised and reviewed by the Board. 
The Group uses a number of derivative instruments that are transacted,
for risk management purposes only, by specialist treasury personnel.
The use of financial instruments, including derivatives, is permitted
when approved by the Board, where the effect is to minimise risk
for the Group. Speculative trading of derivatives or other financial
instruments is not permitted. There has been no significant change
during the financial year, or since the end of the year, to the types
or scope of financial risks faced by the Group. However, the Group
no longer actively hedges the risk that foreign exchange rate
movements have on the translation of overseas net assets as the
Board has chosen to manage the sterling value of the Group’s net
debt in preference to the value of shareholders’ funds. There is no
significant change to the scope and management of the remaining
financial risks faced by the Group.
ID4874_Bc_AR2009_14.qxp  5/3/10  16:08  Page 31 32 BODYCOTE ANNUAL REPORT 2009    BUSINESS REVIEW : CORPORATE GOVERNANCE : ACCOUNTS
FINANCE DIRECTOR’S REPORT
CONTINUED
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group might not be able
to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price.
Liquidity risk arises as a result of mismatches between cash inflows
and outflows from the business. This risk is monitored on a centralised
basis through regular cash flow forecasting, a three-year rolling strategic
plan, an annual budget agreed by the Board each December and a
quarterly re-forecast undertaken during the financial year. To mitigate
the risk, the resulting forecast net debt is measured against the
liquidity headroom policy which, at the current net debt levels, requires
committed facilities (plus term loans in excess of one year) to exceed
net debt by 50%.
As at 31 December 2009, the Group had committed facilities of
£348.5m (2008: £359.7m) which exceeded net debt of £85.5m
(2008: £64.7m) by 307.6% (2008: 456.0%). The Group also uses
uncommitted short-term bank facilities to manage short-term liquidity
but these facilities are excluded from the liquidity headroom policy.
The Group manages longer-term liquidity through committed bank
facilities and will, if appropriate, raise funds on capital markets.
Following the completion of the £110m Revolving Credit Facility and
the completion of the US$20m Revolving and Letter of Credit Facility
on 8 January 2010 and 18 February 2010 respectively, the Group’s
principal committed bank facilities have the following maturity dates:
US$20m Revolving and Letter of Credit Facility
31 March 2013 (3.3 years)
£110m Revolving Credit Facility 31 March 2013 (3.3 years)
?125m Revolving Credit Facility 31 July 2013 (3.6 years)
In addition, cash management pooling, netting and concentration
techniques are used to minimise borrowings. 
As at 31 December 2009, the Group had reduced gross cash to
£19.6m (2008: £258.4m), primarily as a result of sterling cash being
used to repay currency gross debt during the year.
Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk arises on borrowings and cash balances (and
derivative liabilities and assets) which are at floating interest rates.
Changes in interest rates could have the effect of either increasing
or decreasing the Group’s net profit. Under the Group’s interest rate
management policy, the interest rates on each of the Group’s major
currency monetary assets and liabilities are managed to achieve the
desired mix of fixed and variable rates for each major net currency
exposure. These major currencies currently include the US Dollar,
Euro, Sterling and Swedish Krona. Measurement of this interest
rate risk and its potential volatility to the Group’s reported financial
performance is undertaken on a monthly basis and the Board uses
this information to determine, from time to time, an appropriate mix
of fixed and floating rates.
As at 31 December 2009, 3% of net financial liabilities were at fixed
rates (2008: 23%). The decrease is primarily due to a change in the
currency mix of the Group’s interest rate derivatives and movements
in exchange rates. The average tenor of the fixed rate derivatives
and debt was 3.9 years (2008: 3.7 years).
Currency risk 
Bodycote has operations in 27 countries and is therefore exposed
to foreign exchange translation risk when the profits and net assets
of these entities are consolidated into the Group accounts.
Nearly 88% of the Group’s sales are in currencies other than sterling
(EUR 41.1%, USD 28.0%, SEK 4.9% and BRL 4.4%). Cumulatively
over the year, sterling was weaker than the prior year such that
the sales for the year were £45.5m higher than if sales had been
translated at the rates prevailing in 2008. Taking the 2009 sales
by currency, a +/-10% movement in the 2009 cumulative average
rates for all currencies versus sterling would have given rise to a
£42.3m movement in sales. The impact on headline operating profit
is affected by the mix of losses and profits in the various currencies.
However, taking the 2009 operating profit mix, a +/- 10% movement
in 2009 cumulative average rates for all currencies would have given
rise to a £0.2m movement in headline operating profit.
It is Group policy not to hedge exposure for the translation
of reported profits.
The Group’s current translation policy is that currency net assets
are not actively hedged. However, where appropriate, the Group will
still match centrally held currency borrowings and financial derivatives
to the net assets. The Group principally borrows in the US Dollar,
Euro, Swedish Krona and Sterling, consistent with the location of the
Group’s assets. The Group recognises foreign exchange movements
in equity for the translation of net investment hedging instruments
and balances. As a result of the Group’s change of translation policy,
during the year sterling gross cash was used to repay currency debt.
Accordingly at 31 December 2009, £28.2m of gross debt (2008:
£321.6m) and £84.6m of foreign exchange and cross currency swap
liabilities (2008: £90.5m) were in currencies other than sterling and
gross cash of £0.1m (2008: £229.8m) and cross currency swap assets
of £81.2m (2008: £60.2m) were in sterling. 
Transaction foreign exchange exposures arise when entities within
the Group enter into contracts to pay or receive funds in a currency
different from the functional currency of the entity concerned.
It is Group policy to hedge exposure to cash transactions in foreign
currencies when a commitment arises, usually through the use of
foreign exchange forward contracts. Even though approximately 88%
of the Group’s sales are generated outside the UK, the nature of the
business is such that cross border sales and purchases are limited
and, other than interest, such exposures are immaterial for the Group.

Market risk sensitivity analysis 
The Group has measured the estimated charge to the income
statement and equity of either an instantaneous increase or decrease
of 1% (100 basis points) in market interest rates or a 10% strengthening
or weakening in sterling against all other currencies from the applicable
rates as at 31 December 2009, for all financial instruments with all
other variables remaining constant. This analysis is for illustrative
purposes only. The sensitivity analysis excludes the impact of market
risks on net post employment benefit obligations.
Interest rate sensitivity 
The interest rate sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions:
changes in market interest rates affect the interest income
or expense of variable interest financial instruments;
changes in market interest rates only affect the income statement
in relation to financial instruments with fixed interest if these are
recognised at their fair value; and
changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of derivative
financial instruments designated as hedging instruments.
Under these assumptions, a one percentage point fall or rise in
market interest rates for all currencies in which the Group has
variable net cash (and derivative assets) or net borrowings (and
derivative liabilities) at 31 December 2009 would reduce or increase
profit before tax by approximately £0.9m (2008: £0.7m). There is
no material impact on equity.
Currency sensitivity 
The currency risk sensitivity analysis is based on the assumption that
changes in exchange rates affect the non-sterling financial assets and
liabilities and the interest relating to those financial assets and liabilities.
Under this assumption, a 10% strengthening or weakening of sterling
against all exchange rates at 31 December 2009 for non-sterling financial
assets and liabilities would have reduced or increased profit before tax
and equity (before tax effects) as follows:
Non-sterling financial liabilities offset the exchange rate impact on
non-sterling net assets.
Counterparty risk 
Counterparty risk encompasses settlement risk on derivative financial
instruments and money market contracts and credit risk on cash,
time deposits and money market funds. The Group monitors its credit
exposure to its counterparties via their credit ratings (where applicable)
and through its policy, thereby limiting its exposure to any one party
to ensure there is no significant concentration of credit risk. Group
policy is to enter into such transactions only with counterparties
with a long-term credit rating of A-/A3 or better. However, acquired
businesses occasionally have dealings with banks with lower credit
ratings. Business with such banks is moved as soon as practicable.
The counterparties to the financial instruments transacted by the
Group are major international financial institutions and, whilst these
counterparties may expose the Group to credit losses in the event of
non-performance, it considers the risk of material loss to be acceptable.
The notional amounts of financial instruments used in interest rate and
foreign exchange management do not represent the credit risk arising
through the use of these instruments. The immediate credit risk of these
instruments is generally estimated by the fair value of contracts with
a positive value. The maximum exposure to credit risk for time deposits
and other financial assets is represented by their carrying amount.
Credit risk 
Credit risk arises from the possibility that customers may not be able
to settle their obligations as agreed. To manage this risk, the Group
periodically assesses the financial reliability of customers. The majority
of the Group’s trade receivables are due for maturity within 60 days.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are
limited. The Group has a diverse customer base of many tens of
thousands of customers and is not reliant on any one business sector,
end market or client. The largest customer represents less than 4%
of total Group revenue. The Group’s trade and other receivable balance as
at 31 December 2009 amounted to £94.1m and the top 10 accounts
amounted to approximately 12%. Bodycote’s diverse client base provides
the Group with balanced demand from a number of sectors. Management
is mindful of the continuation of the difficult trading conditions being
experienced in a number of sectors in which Bodycote trades and
has reviewed the provisions for bad and doubtful debt accordingly.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY
The Group takes its responsibilities as a good citizen seriously.
The policies below explain how the Group has successfully
implemented these.
PEOPLE
The strength of the Group primarily rests in its people and one
of the key challenges for management is to ensure availability
of appropriately qualified people to support its continued growth.
Bodycote is fortunate to have a competent and committed
international team that is well respected in technical and business
circles. Most acquisitions are based on historical relationships with
Bodycote personnel which is a testament to the integrity of the
Group’s people. The Board has established a remuneration policy
which rewards performance while offering competitive base
packages. In line with the policy of continuous improvement,
the Group has added further resources in this area to assess
management performance and to improve the succession pipeline
for future business leadership. Bodycote’s employment policies are
non-discriminatory, complying with all current legislation to engender
equal opportunity irrespective of race, gender, religion, disability,
sexual orientation or nationality. Harassment is not tolerated.
ETHICAL STANDARDS
All Bodycote personnel are expected to apply a high ethical standard,
consistent with an international UK-listed company.
COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS 
Bodycote has systems in place designed to ensure compliance with
all applicable laws and regulations and conformity with all relevant
codes of business practice.
COMPETITION
Bodycote aims to win business in a differentiated high-value manner.
The Group does not employ unfair trading methods and it competes
vigorously but fairly within the requirements of the applicable laws.
Employees are prohibited from either giving or receiving any inducements.
RESPONSIBLE
ID4874_Bc_AR2009_14.qxp  5/3/10  16:08  Page 34 BUSINESS REVIEW : CORPORATE GOVERNANCE : ACCOUNTS BODYCOTE ANNUAL REPORT 2009 35
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
Directors and employees are expected to ensure that their personal
interests do not at any time conflict with those of Bodycote. Shareholder
employees are advised of and comply with share trading codes.
POLITICS
Bodycote does not make political donations. 
SAFETY & HEALTH 
Appropriate safety and health policies and procedures are in force
in the Group. In 2004 the Group commenced reporting its performance
internally in terms of lost time, frequency and severity of accidents
in a uniform manner. As a result, each facility is now able to benchmark
its safety and health performance and formulate strategies for
improvements. Bodycote is committed to the highest practicable
standards of safety and health management. Bonus payments to
Directors and senior executives are, in part, dependent on achievement
of these targets, which are now key performance indicators. 
ENVIRONMENT
Bodycote operates modern, efficient equipment around the clock.
The Group aggregates demand from a wide range of customers
to maximise efficiency and minimise energy costs. By replacing
under-utilised in-house thermal processing operations with Bodycote’s
state-of-the-art equipment, the overall amount of energy used by
industry can be dramatically reduced, as is explained in the following
two pages. 
The replacement, where possible, of harmful materials has reduced
the need for disposal of waste products. Additionally, the adoption of
recuperative heating and closed water cooling systems has reduced
energy consumption and emissions.
The success of Bodycote’s processes in addressing these issues is
key to its environmental credentials. The Group does not simply aim
to minimise its own energy consumption, but also to effect substantial
reductions in its customers’ energy use.
The Group has begun to participate in carbon reduction schemes
and is making the necessary preparations to enable disclosures
on greenhouse gas emissions to be made in advance of the Climate
Change Act 2008 and more generally for the Company to report
on the sustainable and efficient use of energy and other resources.
...the Group does not simply aim to minimise its
own energy consumption, but also to effect substantial
reductions in its customers’ energy use

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY
CONTINUED
CARING FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT
Bodycote is totally committed to achieving environmental best
practice throughout its business activities, ensuring that these
meet relevant laws and regulations, that they are acceptable to the
community at large and that their environmental impact is reduced
to a minimum. The Company recognises that the pursuit of economic
growth and a healthy environment are closely linked.
Ever at the forefront of technology, Bodycote was one of the first
thermal processing companies to use microprocessor controls to
tightly control furnace atmosphere and emissions and introduced
its first load-forecasting systems over 20 years ago to reduce peak
energy demand and minimise waste.
A proactive approach to improving energy efficiency means that
Bodycote has implemented a variety of systems to reduce water
and gas consumption and re-use energy. This continuing focus on
lessening its impact on the environment has resulted in Bodycote
advancing toward ISO 14001 environmental accreditation at all its
facilities, with more than three quarters of the Group having already
achieved this standard.
At every stage where Bodycote is involved in the manufacturing cycle,
its operational aim is to lessen the overall impact on the environment.
The key to Bodycote’s positive contribution lies in efficiency. As an
aggregator of specialised engineering services, Bodycote reduces the
carbon footprint of its customers’ activities by increasing the lifespan
of their products and using modern, energy efficient equipment.
Without Bodycote, companies would be using older technology and
running their equipment at reduced capacity, both of which are a drain
on energy and financial resources. Working with Bodycote enables
customers to commit more easily to carbon reduction initiatives.
In many geographic jurisdictions this can lead to additional value
generation as carbon reduction legislation is brought into force.

HOW CAN ENERGY INTENSIVE THERMAL PROCESSING
BE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY?
When you first consider the science of thermal processing
from an environmental point of view, you may ask the question,
‘How can such an energy intensive process help the environment?’ 
However, if we consider a world without heat treatments, HIP or
coatings the advantages become immediately apparent. Take an
average car, for example – whether diesel, petrol, electric or gas,
all need parts that are heat treated, HIPed and coated. For the wheels
to turn, bearings are needed, yet few people realise that it is thanks
to heat treatment that the humble wheel bearing lasts the lifetime
of the car and beyond. Certainly, better design and improved lubricants
assist with this extended life, but without heat treatment a wheel
bearing would be lucky to last a week. The same applies to gearboxes,
final drives, engines and, in fact, all the moving parts of the vehicle.
But it does not end there. Modern thermal processing techniques
have allowed design engineers and manufacturers to use much
lighter materials, such as aluminium, and have significantly prolonged
component lifetimes. By treating the aluminium used for castings
and suspension components, the weight of the vehicle is reduced,
which in turn leads to reduced fuel consumption and improved
efficiency. Without thermal processing, the average car would weigh
substantially more and require frequent replacement of parts due
to wear resulting in more mining, more transport, more machining,
more waste – in short, a significant environmental impact.
So, whilst thermal processing is an energy intensive business, it is
a vital part of the manufacturing chain and its use saves the energy
it consumes many times over. The alternative would require the use
of energy on such a scale that many of the things that we consider
an essential part of modern day life would be economically unviable.

The Directors are pleased to submit their report and the audited
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2009.
The Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Review, the
Finance Director’s Report, and all the information contained on
pages 8 to 55 together comprise the Directors’ Report for
the year ended 31 December 2009.
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES
The Company is a holding company with subsidiaries carrying
on business in the provision of thermal processing services.
The activities and locations of the principal subsidiary undertakings
are set out on pages 109 and 110.
GROUP REVIEW
The Group Review, which encompasses: 
the Chairman’s Statement, 
the Chief Executive’s Review, 
Strategy and Objectives, 
Business Performance and Key Performance Indicators,
Business Overview,
Business Review,
the Finance Director’s Report; and
Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability
is provided on pages 8 to 37 of this annual report.
This is a review of the development of the businesses of the Group,
the financial performance during the year ended 31 December 2009,
key performance indicators and a description of the principal risks
and uncertainties facing the Group, and information about the use
of financial instruments. The Group review has been prepared solely
to assist the shareholders in assessing the Group’s strategies and
the potential of those strategies. It should not be relied on by any
other party for any other purpose. Forward-looking statements have
been made by the Directors in good faith using information available
up to the date of this report and such statements should be regarded
with caution because of the inherent uncertainties in economic
trends and business risks. Since the end of the financial year,
with the exception of the re-financing as detailed on page 32,
no important events affecting the business of the Group have occurred.
DIVIDENDS
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 5.35p per ordinary
share making a total for the year of 8.30p per share (2008: 8.30p).
The final dividend, if approved, will be paid on 7 May 2010 to
shareholders on the register at the close of business on 9 April 2010.
SHARE CAPITAL
The Company’s issued ordinary share capital as at 31 December
2009 was £32.5m and during the year was increased by the issue
of 636,588 ordinary shares between 30 April and 9 December 2009
for a total consideration of £383,297 in connection with the Company’s
executive share incentive schemes. At the Annual General Meeting
on 27 April 2009 the shareholders authorised the Company to purchase
up to 18,753,112 of its own shares. This authority expires at the
conclusion of the forthcoming Annual General Meeting to be held
on 28 April 2010, at which time a further authority will be sought
from shareholders. 
CAPITAL STRUCTURE
Details of the authorised and issued share capital are shown
in note 25. The Company has one class of ordinary shares which
carry no right to fixed income. Each share carries the right to one
vote at general meetings of the Company. There are no specific
restrictions on the size of a holding nor on the transfer of shares,
both of which are governed by the general provisions of the Articles
of Association and prevailing legislation. The Directors are not aware
of any agreements between holders of the Company’s shares that
may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting
rights. Details of employee share schemes are set out in note 28
and shares held by the Bodycote Employee Benefit Trust abstain
from voting and waive dividend. No person has any special rights
of control over the Company’s share capital and all issued shares are
fully paid. The appointment and replacement of Directors is governed
by the Company’s Articles of Association, the Combined Code,
the Companies Act and related legislation. The Articles of Association
may be amended by a special resolution of shareholders. The powers
of the Directors are described in the Corporate Governance statement
on page 40. Under the Articles of Association the Company has
authority to issue ordinary shares with a nominal value of £1,619,586.
There are also a number of other agreements that take effect, alter,
crystallise or terminate upon a change of control of the Company
following a takeover bid such as commercial contracts, bank loan
agreements, property lease agreements, employment contracts
and employee share plans. None of these are considered to be
significant in terms of their likely impact on the business of the
Group as a whole, and the Directors are not aware of any agreements
between the Company and themselves or employees that provide
for compensation for loss of office or employment that occurs
because of a takeover bid. 
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
ID4874_Bc_AR2009_14.qxp  5/3/10  16:09  Page 38 BUSINESS REVIEW : CORPORATE GOVERNANCE : ACCOUNTS BODYCOTE ANNUAL REPORT 2009 39
DIRECTORS
The current Directors and their biographical details are listed on
page 55 and all served throughout the year. Messrs J.D. Hubbard
and D.R. Sleight both retired on 27 April 2009 at the Annual General
Meeting. Messrs D.F. Landless and J.A. Biles are retiring by rotation,
and both being eligible, offer themselves for re-election by shareholders
at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. The service agreement
for Mr Landless is terminable by 12 months’ notice. Mr Biles does
not have a service agreement with the Company and his appointment
is terminable by six months’ notice. 
PROPOSALS FOR RE-ELECTION
Messrs Landless and Biles were re-elected by shareholders
in 2007 and 2008 respectively and, in accordance with the Articles
of Association, now stand for re-election by the shareholders of the
Company. The Board recommends to shareholders that they re-elect
the two directors offering themselves for re-election. The performance
of Mr Biles as a non-executive director was evaluated in October 2009
by the Chairman, who confirms that his performance continues to
be effective and that he has continued throughout to demonstrate
commitment to the roles of Non-executive Director and Chairman
of the Audit Committee. The performance of Mr Landless as Group
Finance Director was evaluated in January 2010 by the Chief Executive,
who confirms that his performance continues to be effective.
DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS IN CONTRACTS & SHARES
Details of the Executive Directors’ service contracts and details
of the Directors’ interests in the Company’s shares, share option
schemes and share incentive plans are shown in the Board Report
on Remuneration on pages 46 to 53. No Director has had any dealings
in any shares or options in the Company since 31 December 2009.
Qualifying third party indemnity provision (as defined by section 234
of the Companies Act 2006) has remained in force for the Directors
for the year ended 31 December 2009 and, as at the date of this
report, remains in force for the benefit of the current Directors in
relation to certain losses and liabilities which they may incur (or have
incurred) to third parties in the course of their duties. Apart from
these exceptions, none of the Directors had a material interest
in any contract of significance in relation to the Company and its
subsidiaries at any time during the financial year.
POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
During 2008 the duties owed by directors to a company were
codified and extended by the Companies Act 2006 so that directors
not only had to declare actual conflicts of interests in transactions
as they arose but also had a duty to avoid such conflicts whether
real or potential. Potential conflicts of interest could arise where a
single director owes a fiduciary duty to more than one organisation
(a ‘Situational Conflict’) which typically will be the case where a
non-executive director holds directorships in more than one company.
In order to ensure that each Director was complying with the new
duties, each Director provided the Company with a formal declaration
to disclose what Situational Conflicts affected him. The Board reviewed
the declarations and approved the existence of each declared
Situational Conflict until October 2010 and permitted each affected
Director to attend and vote at Bodycote Directors’ meetings,
on the basis that each such Director continued to keep Bodycote’s
information confidential, and provided overall that such authorisation
remained appropriate and in the interests of shareholders. Where such
authorisation becomes inappropriate or not in the interests of Bodycote
shareholders, the Chairman, or the Nomination Committee, can revoke
an authorisation. No such revocations have been made.
EMPLOYMENT
The Group recognises the value that can be added to its
future profitability and strength by the efforts of employees.
The commitment of employees to excel is key to the Group’s
continued success. Through their attendance at, or participation
in strategy, production, safety and health meetings at site level,
employees are kept up to date with the performance and progress
of the Group, the contribution to the Group made by their site and
are advised of safety and health issues. The Group publishes in
eleven languages, via the Group extranet, an electronic magazine
for all staff detailing the Group’s activities, performance and some
of its personalities and has also featured the Group’s open door policy
under which employee concerns can be voiced on a confidential
basis. Approximately 1,800 Bodycote employees are connected to
the Bodycote Extranet, which improves knowledge of Group activities,
and assists greatly with technology exchange and co-ordination.
It is the Group’s policy to give full and fair consideration to applications
for employment from disabled persons, having regard to their particular
aptitudes and abilities, and to encourage the training and career
development of all personnel employed by the Group, including
disabled persons. Should an employee become disabled the Group,
where practicable, will seek to continue the employment and arrange
appropriate training. An equal opportunities policy is in operation
in the Group.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Product development and quality improvement at all Group companies
is a continuous process. The Group has a policy of deploying the best
technology available and actively seeking improvements. It also conducts
research programmes with its customers.
DONATIONS
Charitable donations during the year net of income tax amounted
to £2,750 (2008: £11,050). There were no political contributions
in 2008 or 2009.

CREDITORS’ POLICY
Group operating companies are responsible for agreeing the terms
and conditions under which business transactions are conducted.
It is Group policy that payments to suppliers are made in accordance
with the terms agreed, provided that these suppliers have also
complied with applicable terms and conditions. Creditor days
at the year end for the Company were 46 days (2008: 45 days). 
SHAREHOLDERS
An analysis of the Company’s shareholders and the shares in issue
at 18 February 2010 and details of the interests of major shareholders
in voting shares notified to the Company pursuant to chapter 5
of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules are given on page 111.
AUDITORS
In accordance with the provisions of section 489 of the Companies
Act 2006, a resolution for the reappointment of Deloitte LLP as
Auditors is to be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General
Meeting. Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of
approval of this Annual Report confirms that:-
so far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit
information of which the Company’s Auditors are unaware, and;
each Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have
taken as a Director to make himself aware of any relevant audit
information and to establish that the Company’s Auditors are
aware of that information.
This statement is given and should be interpreted in accordance
with the provisions of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The 2010 Annual General Meeting will be held on 28 April 2010 in
accordance with the notice being sent to Shareholders with this report. 
By order of the Board:
J. R. Grime
Secretary
25 February 2010
COMPLIANCE WITH 2008 COMBINED CODE
Bodycote complies with the provisions of The Combined Code on
Corporate Governance published by the UK Financial Reporting Council
in June 2008 (‘the Code’), save that the Board has taken the view
that generally it is the responsibility of the Chief Executive and the
Finance Director to manage relationships with institutional investors.
The Chairman also meets institutional investors to discuss overall
strategy, governance and any concerns that shareholders may have.
Only where these more usual channels of communication have failed
would the Board expect the Senior Independent or other Non-executive
Directors to become involved, notwithstanding that the Code specifies
attendance of the Senior Independent Non-executive Director at
meetings with major shareholders. Regular feedback by the Company’s
advisers on investor meetings and results presentations is circulated
to all Directors. 
Apart from this distinct area, Bodycote was in compliance with the
provisions of the Code throughout 2009.
OPERATION OF THE CODE
Taken together with the Audit Committee Report, the Nomination
Committee Report and the Board Report on Remuneration presented
on pages 43 to 53, this statement explains how Bodycote has applied
the principles of good corporate governance set out in the Code.
LEADERSHIP
The Board is responsible to shareholders for good corporate governance,
setting the Company’s strategic objectives, values and standards and
ensuring the necessary resources are in place to achieve the objectives.
The Board met on ten occasions during 2009 including a specific
meeting to review and update the Company’s long-term strategy. 
The Board of Directors comprises six members, of whom four are
Non-executive Directors and two are Executive Directors led by the
Company’s part-time Non-executive Chairman, Mr A.M. Thomson,
who also chairs the Nomination Committee. The Chief Executive
is Mr S.C. Harris and the Senior Independent Non-executive Director
is Mr J. Vogelsang, who also chairs the Remuneration Committee.
The Audit Committee is chaired by Mr J.A. Biles. Brief biographical
details of all Directors are given on page 55.

the Group’s overall financial position and its achievement against prior
year, budgets and forecasts. They are also supplied with the latest
available information on safety, health and environmental and risk
management issues and details of the safety and health performance
of the Group, and each Division, in terms of severity and frequency
rates for accidents at work. 
Where required, a Director may seek independent professional advice,
the cost of which is reimbursed by the Company. All Directors have
access to the Company Secretary and they may also address specific
issues to the Senior Independent Non-executive Director. In accordance
with the Articles of Association, all newly appointed Directors and any
who have not stood for re-election at one of the two previous Annual
General Meetings, if eligible, must submit themselves for re-election.
Non-executive Directors, including the Chairman, are appointed for
fixed terms not exceeding three years from the date of first election
by shareholders, after which the appointment may be extended by
mutual agreement. A statement of the Directors’ responsibilities is set
out on page 54. The Board also operates three committees. These are
the Nomination Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the
Audit Committee.
INDEPENDENCE OF NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Board considers that Messrs J.A. Biles, J. Vogelsang and
Dr K. Rajagopal are all independent for the purposes of the Code.

Messrs Thomson, Harris and Landless attended the whole or part
of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committee meetings.
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
Messrs S.C. Harris and D. F. Landless were appraised internally
in February and January 2010 respectively. In October 2009 the
Board carried out its own evaluation of the Board as a whole, and
the evaluation of Board Committees. The Remuneration and Audit
Committees reviewed their own performance in December 2009 and
the Nomination Committee reviewed its performance in October 2009.
Led by the Senior Independent Non-executive Director, the Directors
have carried out an evaluation of the Chairman’s performance.
INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control
and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system is designed to
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business
objectives, and can only provide reasonable and not absolute
assurance against material misstatement or loss. The Board has
applied Principle C.2 of the Code by establishing a continuous process
for identifying, evaluating and managing the Group’s significant risks,
including risks arising out of Bodycote’s corporate and social engagement.
The Board continuously and regularly reviews the process, which has
been in place from the start of 2000 to the date of approval of this
report and which is in accordance with Internal Control: Guidance for
Directors on the Combined Code published in September 1999 and
which is in accordance with revised guidance on internal control
published October 2005.
ID4874_Bc_AR2009_14.qxp  5/3/10  16:09  Page 41 42 BODYCOTE ANNUAL REPORT 2009    BUSINESS REVIEW : CORPORATE GOVERNANCE : ACCOUNTS
The Board’s monitoring covers all controls, including financial,
operational and compliance controls and risk management systems.
It is based principally on reviewing reports from management
and from internal audit to consider whether any significant
weaknesses are promptly remedied and indicate a need for more
extensive monitoring. The Audit Committee assists the Board in
discharging these review responsibilities.
The Group prepares a comprehensive annual budget which is closely
monitored and updated quarterly. The Group’s authority matrix clearly
sets out authority limits for those with delegated responsibility and
specifies what can only be decided with central approval.
The Internal Audit department monitors the Group’s internal financial
control system and its reviews are conducted on the basis of plans
approved by the Audit Committee, to which Internal Audit reports are
submitted on a regular basis.
Each Division provides assurance on specified financial and non-financial
controls and these are reported twice-yearly to the Audit Committee.
During 2009, in compliance with provision C2.1, the Board also
performed a specific assessment for the purpose of this annual report.
The assessment considered all significant aspects of internal control
arising during the period covered by the report including the work
of Internal Audit. In addition, the President of each of the Divisions
reported on the existing internal control procedure and any failings
or weaknesses. They identified and made an assessment of the
risks affecting the businesses they control, in each case with the
assistance of input from those reporting directly to them. Such risks
were measured against their own stated objectives, and actions
for any improvements were scheduled against a timetable for later
verification by Internal Audit. The Board also conducted a review
of risks which principally affected the head office functions and
reviewed these with the Group Finance Director, Group Financial
Controller, Group Treasurer and the Head of Tax. The risk areas
reviewed included pensions, information services, treasury, investor
relations, capital expenditure, acquisitions, intellectual property,
insurance, human resources, financial control, external reporting
and succession planning. No significant previously unidentified risks
were uncovered as part of this process, and the necessary actions
have been or are being taken to remedy any significant failings or
weaknesses identified as part of the reviews.
INVESTOR RELATIONS
The Chief Executive and Finance Director regularly talk with
and meet institutional investors, both individually and collectively,
and this has enabled institutional investors to increase their
understanding of the Group’s strategy. The business of the Annual
General Meeting comprises a review of the Group’s operations for
the benefit of shareholders attending. In addition, since 1998,
internet users have been able to view up-to-date news on the Group
and its share price via the Bodycote website at www.bodycote.com.
Users of the website can access news of all recent announcements
and copies of results presentations and can enrol to hear live
presentations. On a regular basis, Bodycote’s financial advisers,
corporate brokers and financial public relations consultants provide
the Directors with opinion surveys from analysts and investing
institutions following visits and meetings with the Chief Executive
and Finance Director. As stated on page 40 the Chairman and Senior
Independent Non-executive Director are available to discuss any
issues not resolved by the Chief Executive and Finance Director.
On specific issues, such as the introduction of long-term incentive
and share matching schemes in 2006 and changes thereto in 2009,
and in 2008 the return of cash, the Company will seek the views of
leading investors.

The Audit Committee is a sub-committee of the Board whose main role
is to encourage and safeguard the highest standards of integrity, financial
reporting, risk management and internal controls. The Committee’s
responsibilities are set out in written terms of reference which include
all matters indicated by the Disclosure and Transparency Rules and the
Code, which are available for inspection on the Company’s website
and include:
reviewing the form and content of interim and full year accounts
and results announcements of the Company, interim management
statements and any other formal announcements relating to the
Company’s financial performance, including monitoring their integrity
and reviewing significant reporting issues and judgements contained
therein, and recommending them to the Board for approval;
reviewing the Group’s systems of risk management and internal
financial control;
monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal audit function and considering regular reports from
Internal Audit on internal financial controls and risk management;

and to approve their remuneration and terms of engagement;
agreeing the nature and scope of the external auditor’s work and
considering their reports on the Company’s accounts, reports
to shareholders and their evaluation of the systems of internal
financial control and risk management; and
monitoring and reviewing the external auditors’ independence,
objectivity and effectiveness, taking into account professional and
regulatory requirements.
COMPOSITION OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee comprises Messrs J.A. Biles, J. Vogelsang
and Dr K. Rajagopal who are all independent Non-executive Directors.
Their biographical details are set out on page 55 and their remuneration
is shown on page 50. The Chairman of the Audit Committee since
16 August 2007 has been Mr J.A. Biles, who was appointed a Director on
that date, following a recommendation from the Nomination Committee.
The Audit Committee Chairman is considered to have recent and
relevant financial experience. Mr Biles is a chartered accountant, who
served as a plc finance director (FKI plc from 1998 to 2004 and Chubb
Security plc from 1991 to 1997) and is currently also the Chairman of
the Audit Committees of Charter International plc (2005) and Hermes
Fund Managers Limited (2005). The Company Secretary is secretary to
the Audit Committee. The Chairman, Chief Executive, Finance Director,
Senior Internal Auditor, Group Financial Controller, Group Treasurer,
Head of Tax, other senior finance personnel and external auditors
attend Audit Committee meetings as appropriate by invitation.
MAIN ACTIVITIES OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee met four times during 2009, and in February 2010
to consider this financial report and all Committee members attended
the maximum number of meetings they were scheduled to attend.
The Committee also meets separately with the Senior Internal Auditor
and with the external auditors, without management being present,
after the end of most formal meetings.
In addition, the Committee Chairman has preparatory meetings
with the external auditors and, where necessary, with Group senior
management, prior to committee meetings.
At their meetings, the Audit Committee considers an agenda of
items including the minutes of the last meeting and a list of action
points from previous meetings, to ensure that these are progressed.
In addition, a number of specific items were reviewed:
At their February and July meetings, the Audit Committee reviewed
respectively the preliminary and interim announcements of results
and the draft reports and accounts for the financial year and the
half year. On these occasions the Committee reviewed reports from
the external auditors, identifying any accounting or judgemental
items requiring its attention (including approval of the processes,
assumptions and outcomes to assess fair values and impairments)
and commenting on risk management and control matters.
A quarterly report from the Senior Internal Auditor was presented
at each meeting and the findings discussed. During the year the
plan for the ensuing year’s work was considered.
The external auditors also presented their audit plan at the
December and April meetings covering scope of work to be done
and during the year there was a detailed review of their management
letter covering the auditors’ findings in respect of 2008.
The Audit Committee has also been presented with an update
on material litigation in which the Group is involved.
At each meeting an update is presented of any new accounting
developments and requirements and any changes in corporate
governance arrangements that may affect the Group.
On a regular basis, the Committee reviewed papers on liquidity,
banking arrangements and the going concern assumptions for
preparation of the financial statements. This response to the
current global financial and economic circumstances, which affects
all businesses, took account of the impact on the Bodycote
business of the current financial and economic environment.
The Committee’s activities supported the Directors in their
assessment of the going concern position of the Group,
which is set out on page 30.
REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
ID4874_Bc_AR2009_14.qxp  5/3/10  16:09  Page 44 BUSINESS REVIEW : CORPORATE GOVERNANCE : ACCOUNTS BODYCOTE ANNUAL REPORT 2009 45
During 2009 the Audit Committee also:
assessed the independence of the external auditors;
having reviewed the effectiveness of the audit, the performance
and capabilities of the External Auditors and having taken into
account their tenure of office from 2002 and when the position
was last open for tender, recommended to the Board to reappoint
the Auditors and agreed their fees;
approved the Group’s accounting policies;
approved the management representations to the Auditors;
reviewed arrangements for reporting and investigating fraud
and employee concerns;
reviewed the effectiveness of internal controls and risk
management process;
reviewed the terms of reference for the Audit Committee; and
assessed the Committee’s own effectiveness.
INDEPENDENCE OF EXTERNAL AUDITORS
The Audit Committee has put in place safeguards to ensure that the
independence of the audit is not compromised. In this respect, the
Audit Committee reviewed:
the external auditors’ plan for the current year, noting the role of
the senior statutory audit partner, who signs the audit report and
who, in accordance with the professional rules, has not held office
for more than five years, and any changes in the key audit staff;
the arrangements for day-to-day management of the audit
relationship; and
the overall extent of non-audit services provided by the external
auditors as referred to below.
The policy in respect of services provided by the external auditors
is as follows:
Audit related services. The external auditors are invited to
provide services where their position as auditors renders them
best placed to undertake the work. This includes reporting and
certification connected with borrowings, shareholders and other
circulars, regulatory requirements and work in respect of
acquisitions and disposals.
Tax consulting. Where the external auditors are best suited
to carry out the work they are asked to do so. This particularly
applies to work relating to tax compliance. Major exercises and
any work where conflicts would arise are put out to tender.
General consulting work. In general and where conflicts arise, the
work is not awarded to the external auditors and is put out to tender.
There are no contractual restrictions on who the Audit Committee
can choose as external auditors.
INTERNAL AUDIT
Internal Audit independently reviews the risk and control processes
operated by management. It carries out independent audits in
accordance with an internal audit plan which is agreed with the
Audit Committee before the start of the financial year. This plan
takes account of the risk management framework surrounding major
business risks in each operation and provides a high degree of
financial and geographical coverage. Internal Audit reports include
recommendations to improve internal controls together with agreed
managerial action plans to resolve issues raised. Internal audit follows
up the implementation of recommendations and reports progress to
senior management and the Audit Committee. The effectiveness of
the Internal Audit function is reviewed and discussed on an annual
basis with the Group Financial Controller and Senior Internal Auditor.
As a result of its work during the year, the Audit Committee has
concluded that it has acted in accordance with its items of reference
and has ensured the independence and objectivity of the external auditors.
On behalf of the Audit Committee:

ID4874_Bc_AR2009_14.qxp  5/3/10  16:09  Page 45 46 BODYCOTE ANNUAL REPORT 2009    BUSINESS REVIEW : CORPORATE GOVERNANCE : ACCOUNTS
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for remuneration policies
that aim to create value for shareholders. 
Remuneration structures and packages therefore include competitive
basic salaries, a high potential for variable pay that is clearly linked with
superior performance and absolute value delivered in the business,
with key business value drivers used as a basis for measuring performance
and a significant proportion of variable pay in restricted conditional shares.
This report sets out the policy and disclosures on Directors’ remuneration
as required by the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 issued under the Companies
Act 2006 (the ‘Act’), the Listing Rules and the Combined Code, in
accordance with the Act, a resolution to approve this report will be
proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the Company.
The vote will have advisory status in respect of the remuneration
policy and overall remuneration packages and will not be specific to
individual levels of remuneration. The Chairman of the Remuneration
Committee will be available at the Annual General Meeting to answer
questions about Directors’ remuneration. 
The sections of this report dealing with Directors’ emoluments
paid, pensions and share options and incentives have been audited.
The remaining sections are not subject to audit.
THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Committee determines the remuneration of Executive Directors
and senior executives, and the terms of the service contracts and all
other terms and conditions of employment of the Executive Directors. 
The Committee’s full terms of reference are available on the Group’s
website. The members of the Remuneration Committee during
2009 were J. Vogelsang (Chairman), J.A. Biles, A.M. Thomson and
Dr K. Rajagopal. During the year, the Committee has taken advice
from Ernst & Y oung LLP to provide independent advice on remuneration.
In addition, the Company received actuarial and other pensions advice
from KPMG LLP in relation to the management of risk arising from
the UK final salary pension scheme.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest (other than
as shareholders), conflict of interest, cross-directorships or day-to-day
involvement in the running of the Business.
REMUNERATION POLICY
The Committee aims to provide a remuneration policy consistent
with the Group’s overall business strategy and thereby attract and
retain high calibre executives, align executives’ rewards with the
creation of shareholder value and motivate executives to achieve and
maintain challenging levels of company and individual performance.
Market rates are determined by reference to other companies of
similar size, activities and complexity. At the same time, policy in
this area is sensitive to the remuneration structure within the Group.
The Committee keeps both the fixed and variable elements of each
Executive Director’s and senior executive’s overall package under
review. In recent years, the Committee has progressively increased
the proportion of variable as opposed to fixed element of pay, so that
currently the total potential from variable performance related pay is
now substantially in excess of basic pay. 
The Committee also considers the targets set for the variable element
of Executive Directors’ and senior executives’ remuneration which
at all times aim to encourage appropriate behaviours and deliver
exceptional and sustainable financial performance measured against
the Group’s strategic plans. With this in mind, during the year the
Committee conducted a review of the long-term incentive arrangements
last amended in 2006 as the business is now significantly different
to when the Bodycote Incentive Plan (‘BIP’) and the Bodycote Share
Match Plan (‘BSMP’) were first introduced. Following the review
it was decided to:
undertake a period of consultation with major shareholders
on what the Committee considered to be the most appropriate
performance conditions for future awards under the BIP, more
detail on which is included in the section headed Bodycote
Incentive Plan; and
propose changes to the current structure of the BSMP so
as to (i) permit executives to make additional contributions
out of their own monies (up to 40% of their base salary) and
(ii) change the performance conditions to be applied to the
matching awards. The necessary amendments to the BSMP
are to be put to shareholders for approval at the Annual General
Meeting and are set out below and in the notice of meeting
sent to shareholders with this annual report. 
BOARD REPORT ON REMUNERATION
ID4874_Bc_AR2009_14.qxp  5/3/10  16:09  Page 46 BUSINESS REVIEW : CORPORATE GOVERNANCE : ACCOUNTS BODYCOTE ANNUAL REPORT 2009 47
FIXED ELEMENTS OF PAY
The fixed elements of remuneration are salaries, pensions
and other benefits.
Basic salary
The basic salaries for each Executive Director and the senior executives
are reviewed annually by the Committee and are determined by taking
into account the responsibilities and performance of the individual,
having regard to current market practice. In the light of the difficult
economic conditions and historic low level of inflation the Committee
has decided in consultation with the Executive Directors that there
will be no increase in basic salaries in 2010 for Executive Directors.
Pension 
The Committee reviews the pension arrangements for the Executive
Directors to ensure that the benefits provided are consistent with
those provided by other similar companies.
Mr Harris joined the Group’s defined contribution arrangement
from 1 November 2008 and receives contributions from the Group
at a rate of 22% of basic salary. In addition, in the event of death a
death-in-service benefit of eight times basic salary will become payable.
The pension for Mr Landless is provided under the Group’s UK
contributory defined benefit pension scheme which has a normal
retirement age of 65 and which is closed to new members. Increases
in his pensionable salary are capped under this scheme at 3% per
annum. As a consequence Mr Landless receives an additional
contribution of 16% of salary to a defined contribution arrangement.
The defined benefit scheme also provides lump sum death-in-service
benefits and pension benefits based on final pensionable salary.
Arrangements for Mr Hubbard, who retired as a Director on 27 April
2009 were for a contribution to a defined contribution arrangement
of 16% of his basic salary (including any payments being made by
the Group into the Group’s US 401k retirement plan) from January
2007 to April 2009.
An analysis of the accrued pension entitlements for Mr Landless
under the final salary scheme during 2009 is given on page 53.
Other fixed elements
The Company provides other benefits in line with market practices.
These include the provision of a company car (or an allowance in lieu),
private medical insurance for the Executive Directors and their families,
relocation assistance where appropriate, and long-term disability insurance.
VARIABLE ELEMENTS OF PAY
There are essentially three variable elements of pay.
Annual bonuses
As a consequence of the unprecedented economic uncertainty that
began in late 2008 and continued into 2009, Group profits in 2009
fell a long way short of budget and 2008 profits, so the Committee
took the decision that in 2009 a bonus would only be payable to the
Executive Directors and senior executives in respect of performance
against safety measures up to a maximum of 10% of basic pay.
As a result, each of the Executive Directors received a cash bonus
of 5% of basic salary.
The Committee’s intention is that for 2010 an annual bonus of up
to 100% of basic salary will be payable to all Executive Directors
and senior executives, subject to meeting targets based upon Group
and individual performance. For those senior executives with divisional
responsibilities, part of the performance-related bonus is based on
their relevant sphere of responsibility.
Share awards
Bodycote Incentive Plan (‘BIP’)
The Company operates the BIP under which Executive Directors and
senior executives are rewarded for the delivery of the Company’s
strategic plan. As a result of the business now being significantly
different in terms of size, focus and strategy since the BIP was first
introduced, the Committee informally consulted shareholders during
the year regarding changes to the performance measures that they
believed should apply to future BIP awards. Following the consultation,
awards will be based upon two performance measures, over a three
year period:
half of the award will be subject to a return on capital
employed (‘ROCE’) performance condition; and
half of the award will be subject to an earnings per share
(‘EPS’) performance condition.
Each of the measures is to be calculated independently and failure
to achieve a pre-determined minimum EPS level will mean that no
part of the award will vest. A sliding scale will apply between minimum
and maximum levels.
For awards made in previous years, the performance targets will
not change and vesting of awards will remain subject to an economic
profit target. 
Following completion of the performance period, the Remuneration
Committee has determined that none of the BIP awards made in
2007 shall vest.

BOARD REPORT ON REMUNERATION
CONTINUED
Deferred share awards
Bodycote Share Match Plan (‘BSMP’)
The Company operates the BSMP which provides a link between
the Company’s short and long-term incentive arrangements.
The BSMP allows the grant of awards of matching shares to
participants on an annual basis. Under the existing terms of the plan,
annual bonus up to the value of 20% of base salary may be deferred
into Company shares for three years. 
Under the BSMP, the maximum level of matching is calculated by
reference to the gross bonus deferral on a one to one basis subject
to the achievement of a robust and challenging ROCE target. Details
of the awards under the BSMP are noted on page 52. This includes
details of the joining award made to S.C. Harris in October 2008 which
is subject to the same performance criteria as the other awards made
under the BSMP. 
Following completion of the performance period, the Remuneration
Committee has determined that none of the share match awards made
in 2007 shall vest.
Shareholder approval is being sought to allow participants to purchase
additional shares for deferral from salary or other monies to bring their
overall annual contribution up to a total amount equal to 40% of their
base salary, subject to annual Remuneration Committee approval.
The Committee intends to allow such a level of investment in 2010
subject to shareholder approval of the new matching plan.
For the matching awards to be made in 2010, it is proposed that
whilst the level of match will be the same, subject to shareholder
approval, the ROCE performance condition will be replaced with
an absolute Total Shareholder Return (TSR) measure (i.e. share price
plus dividends). 
Historic arrangements
In addition to the above, the following are legacy plans which
were superseded by the BIP and BSMP in 2006.
The Bodycote Short Term Stock Bonus Plan (‘STSBP’)
Under the STSBP, Executive Directors and senior executives
received the maximum awards as a consequence of Bodycote
in 2005 being in the upper quartile of TSR achieved by companies
within the FTSE 350 Engineering & Machinery Index and certain
other comparator companies. The shares that constitute this award
vested in March 2009 at the end of the holding period, and the awards
were enhanced by an amount reflecting dividends paid on the award
shares over the three-year period. No further awards will be made
under the STSBP following the introduction of the BIP and BSMP. 
Details of the shares awarded to Directors under the STSBP are
noted on page 51.
Option Arrangements
The Committee also manages share incentive schemes established
between 1994 and 2003. Following adoption of the BIP no further
share options have been granted to Executive Directors and staff
pursuant to the 2003 executive share option scheme, but share
options granted before this decision will continue to be capable of
exercise. At the time each scheme was approved by shareholders,
institutional guidelines were followed and latterly leading investors
were consulted. All outstanding share options are now capable of
exercise because the relevant performance criteria were achieved. 
The market price of Bodycote’s ordinary shares at 31 December 2009
was £1.59, the range during 2009 was £1.04 to £1.98 and the average
was £1.45. Details of the outstanding share options granted to
D. F. Landless are provided on page 51.
ID4874_Bc_AR2009_14.qxp  5/3/10  16:09  Page 48 BUSINESS REVIEW : CORPORATE GOVERNANCE : ACCOUNTS BODYCOTE ANNUAL REPORT 2009 49
TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN (TSR)
The graph on page 53 illustrates the Company’s TSR performance
since 2004 relative to the FTSE All Share Industrial Index of which
the Company is a component part. This sector is considered the most
appropriate comparator group over the five-year period to December
2009. In line with market practice the calculation for TSR assumes
reinvestment of dividends and is based on data provided by Datastream.
SERVICE CONTRACTS
It is the Company’s policy that Executive Directors have service
contracts with a one-year notice period. All the Executive Directors
have service agreements which are terminable by one year’s
notice by the employer at any time, and by payment of one year’s
remuneration in lieu of notice by the employer, and by one year’s
remuneration in the event of a change in control of the Company
(save for Mr Harris where the change of control provision does not
apply). Legally appropriate factors would be taken into account to
mitigate any compensation payment, covering basic salary, annual
incentives and benefits, which may arise on the termination of
employment of any Executive Director, other than payments made
on a change in control or for payments in lieu of notice. Mr Harris’
service agreement is dated 6 October 2008 and Mr Landless’
contract is dated 26 September 2001. 
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ SHAREHOLDING RETENTION POLICY
In 2005 the Committee introduced a shareholding retention
policy under which Executive Directors and other senior executives
are required, within five years of that date or commencement of
employment if later, to build up a shareholding in the Company.
In respect of Executive Directors the requirement is to hold at least
100% of basic salary.
EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS
The Company believes that there are benefits to the individual
and the Company for Executive Directors holding one non-executive
directorship in another organisation, provided that they do not conflict
with the Company’s interests. Provided the Executive Director’s
performance is not impaired, he can retain the fees earned in
connection with such an appointment. 
In the financial year, Mr Harris earned £25,333 from one
external appointment. 
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The remuneration of Non-executive Directors is determined by
the Chairman and the Executive Directors. Remuneration for the
Chairman is determined by the whole Board (excluding the Chairman).
Remuneration for the Chairman and Non-executive Directors takes
into account the time commitments and duties and responsibilities
involved. The Chairman and each Non-executive Director hold letters
of appointment for terms of three years (or 41 months in respect
of the Chairman). Each is terminable under the Company’s Articles
of Association, the Act, the Director’s resignation or otherwise on
six months’ notice (twelve months in the case of the Chairman)
if termination occurs before expiry of the term. 
To determine the fees it pays to Non-executive Directors, the Board
takes into account the need to attract individuals of appropriate
calibre and expertise, the fees paid to Non-executive Directors
by other companies of a similar size and the time commitment
attached to each appointment. The Board keeps fees under review.
The Chairman and Non-executive Directors are not entitled to any
pension or other employment benefits or to participate in any
incentive scheme. 
Approved by the Board:

RESPONSIBILITY OF DIRECTORS FOR THE PREPARATION
OF THE ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report,
the Board Report on Remuneration and the financial statements
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements
for each financial year. The Directors are required by the IAS Regulation
to prepare the group financial statements under International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
The group financial statements are also required by law to be properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4
of the IAS Regulation. 
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that IFRS financial
statements present fairly for each financial year the Group’s financial
position, financial performance and cash flows. This requires the
faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events
and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition
criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the
International Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the
preparation and presentation of financial statements’. In virtually
all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance
with all applicable IFRSs. However, Directors are also required to:
properly select and apply accounting policies;
present information, including accounting policies, in a manner
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable
information; and
provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific
requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions
on the Group’s financial position and financial performance.
The Directors have elected to prepare the parent company financial
statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and
applicable law). The parent company financial statements are required
by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company.
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained
in the financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records
that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the parent
company financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection
of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the
corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation
in other jurisdictions.
RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT OF THE DIRECTORS IN RESPECT
OF THE ANNUAL REPORT AND THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant
financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the assets,
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Review, the
Finance Director’s Report, all the information contained on pages
8 to page 55 together comprise the Directors’ Report for the
year ended 31 December 2009. It includes a fair review of the
development and performance of the business and the position
of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks
and uncertainties that they face.
This responsibility statement was approved by the Board of Directors
on 25 February 2010 and is signed on its behalf by:

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF BODYCOTE PLC
We have audited the group financial statements of Bodycote plc for
the year ended 31 December 2009, which comprise the Consolidated
Income Statement, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated
Cash Flow Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Recognised
Income and Expense, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity,
the Statement of Accounting Policies and the related notes 1 to 30.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. We have also
audited the information in the Board Report on Remuneration that is
described as having been audited. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body,
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them
in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement,
the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the group financial
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit the group financial statements in accordance
with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices
Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether
caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances
and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the
Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
OPINION ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In our opinion the group financial statements:
give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as
at 31 December 2009 and of its loss for the year then ended;
have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs
as adopted by the European Union; and
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements
of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
OPINION ON OTHER MATTER PRESCRIBED
BY THE COMPANIES ACT 2006
In our opinion:
the part of the Board Report on Remuneration to be audited
has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 2006; and
the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial
year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent
with the group financial statements.
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED
TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if,
in our opinion:
certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified
by law are not made; or
we have not received all the information and explanations
we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
the Directors’ statement contained within the Group Review
in relation to going concern; and
the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating
to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the
June 2008 Combined Code specified for our review.
OTHER MATTER
We have reported separately on the parent company financial
statements of Bodycote plc for the year ended 31 December 2009.

During the prior year the Group issued £129.4m of B shares out of the share premium account. The B shares could be converted into deferred
shares with a negligible value in return for a dividend of 40p per share or redeemed for 40p per share in cash. £0.2m of associated costs were
charged to the share premium account.
321.9 million B shares were redeemed on 16 December 2008, including 70.3 million B shares which had been converted into deferred shares and,
as a result, £128.7m was transferred from retained earnings to a capital redemption reserve. A further 1.7 million shares were redeemed in 2009.
Included in other reserves is the capital redemption reserve arising on redemption of the Group’s B shares of £129.4m (2008: £128.7m). The own
shares reserve represents the cost of shares in Bodycote plc purchased in the market. At 31 December 2009 2,100,427 (2008: 2,490,760) ordinary
shares of 17 3/11p each were held by the Bodycote International Employee Benefit Trust to satisfy share-based payments under the Group’s
incentive schemes (see note 28).

GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The financial statements of the Group have been prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with
IFRS adopted by the European Union and therefore the group
financial statements comply with article 4 of EU IAS Regulation as
adopted for use in the EU.
The Group has adopted Standards and Interpretations issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee of the
IASB (IFRIC). Individual standards and interpretations have to be
adopted by the European Commission (EC) and the process leads to
a delay between the issue and adoption of new standards and in
some cases amendment by the EC.
International Financial Reporting Standards are subject to ongoing
amendment by the IASB and subsequent endorsement by the EC
and are therefore subject to change.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost
basis, with the exception of accounting for share-based payments
and certain financial instruments. The principal accounting policies
adopted are set out below.
ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED STANDARDS
In the current year, the following new and revised Standards and
Interpretations have been adopted and have affected the amounts
reported in the financial statements.
IAS 1 (revised 2007)
Presentation of financial statements. IAS 1 (revised 2007)
has introduced a number of changes in the format and content
of the financial statements.
Specifically, IAS 1 requires an entity to present a statement of
financial position as at the beginning of the earliest comparative
period in a complete set of financial statements when the entity
applies an accounting policy retrospectively or makes a retrospective
restatement, or when the entity reclassifies items in the financial
statements. During the current year, the Group adopted IFRS 8
‘Operating Segments’. However, the Directors consider that
because the adoption of the standard has no impact on the balance
sheet, no presentation of a third balance sheet is required.
IFRS 8
Operating Segments. IFRS 8 is a disclosure Standard that has resulted
in a re-designation of the Group’s reportable segments (see note 2).
Amendments to IFRS 7
Financial Instruments: Disclosures. The amendments to IFRS 7
expand the disclosures required in respect of fair value measurements
and liquidity risk. The Group has elected not to provide comparative
information for these expanded disclosures in the current year in
accordance with the transitional reliefs offered in these amendments.
GOING CONCERN
The Directors have at the time of approving the financial statements,
a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the
foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern
basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Further
detail is contained in the Finance Director’s Report on page 30.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial
statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company
(its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control is
achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and
operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its
activities except to the extent that the minority has a binding obligation
and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities
of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of
acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values
of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values
of the identifiable net assets acquired (i.e. discount on acquisition)
is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition.
The interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minority’s
proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised.
Subsequently, any losses applicable to the minority interest in excess
of the minority interest are allocated against the interests of the parent.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the
year are included in the consolidated income statement from the
effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal,
as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the
financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies
used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses
are eliminated on consolidation.
INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position
to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control,
through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions
of the investee.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated
in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as
adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net
assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual
investments. Losses of the associates in excess of the Group’s
interest in those associates are not recognised.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the
fair values of the identifiable net assets of the associate at the date of
acquisition is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within
the carrying amount of the investment. Any deficiency of the cost of
acquisition below the Group’s share of the fair values of the identifiable
net assets of the associate at the date of acquisition (i.e. discount on
acquisition) is credited in profit and loss in the period of acquisition.
Where a group company transacts with an associate of the Group,
profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest
in the relevant associate. Losses may provide evidence of an
impairment of the asset transferred, in which case appropriate
provision is made for impairment.

GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES
CONTINUED
NON-CURRENT ASSETS HELD FOR SALE
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for
sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value
less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held
for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale
transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is
regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset
(or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present
condition. Management must be committed to the sale which
should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale
within one year from the date of classification.
GOODWILL
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost
of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary
or associate at the date of acquisition. If after restatement, the Group’s
interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets,
liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business
combination, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment
at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit
or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary or associate, the attributable amount of
goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS
has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts, subject to being
tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves
under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not
included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received
or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services
provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and
other sales-related taxes. Revenue is recognised on the completion
of services rendered.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the
principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable,
which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts
through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net
carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the
shareholder’s rights to receive payment have been established.
THE GROUP AS LESSEE
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the
lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership
to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the
Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the
minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the
lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the
balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are
apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease
obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the
remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged
directly against income.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income
on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into
an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over
the lease term.
THE GROUP AS LESSOR
Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded
as receivables at the amount of the Group’s net investment in the
leases. Finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods so
as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the Group’s net
investment outstanding in respect of the leases.
FOREIGN CURRENCIES
Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded
at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates
prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items that are
measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not
retranslated. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included
in net profit or loss for the period.
Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period
in which they arise except for:
Exchange differences on transactions entered into to hedge
certain foreign currency risks (see below under financial
instruments/hedge accounting); and
Exchange differences on monetary items receivable from or
payable to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither
planned nor likely to occur (therefore forming part of the net
investment in the foreign operation) which are recognised
initially in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense
and reclassified from equity to profit or loss on disposal or partial
disposal of the net investment.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas
operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance
sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average
exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate
significantly. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified
as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as
expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition
of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign
entity and translated at the closing rate. The Group has elected
to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions
before the date of transition to IFRS as sterling-denominated assets
and liabilities.
BORROWING COSTS
Borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in
which they are incurred. Borrowing costs directly attributable to the
acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets are added
to the cost of those assets.
ID4874_Bc_AR2009_14.qxp  5/3/10  16:09  Page 62 BUSINESS REVIEW : CORPORATE GOVERNANCE : ACCOUNTS BODYCOTE ANNUAL REPORT 2009 63
GOVERNMENT GRANTS
Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment
are treated as deferred income and released to profit and loss
over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned. 
OPERATING PROFIT
Operating profit is stated after charging restructuring costs, goodwill
impairment, amortisation of acquired intangible assets and after the
post-tax share of results of associates but before investment income
and finance costs. Amounts presented in the income statement for
acquisitions relate to businesses acquired during the current or prior year.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
In accordance with IFRS 5, non-current assets held for sale and
discontinued operations, the Group has separately disclosed the
results of the Testing division as discontinued following the disposal
of the business in October 2008. 
RETIREMENT BENEFIT COSTS
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes
are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made
to state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with
as payments to defined contribution schemes where the Group’s
obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in
a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme. 
For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is
determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial
valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. Actuarial
gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they
occur. They are recognised outside profit or loss and presented in
the statement of recognised income and expense. 
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that
the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on
a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits
become vested. 
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet
represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as
adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by
the fair value of the scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this
calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value
of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the
scheme.
TAXATION
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable
and deferred tax. 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that
are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items
that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current
tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used
in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the
balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally
recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax
assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable
profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences
can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the
temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition
(other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a
transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates,
and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to
control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that
the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply
in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement,
except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity
in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each
balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow
all of part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally
enforceable right to set-off current tax assets against current tax
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same
taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax
assets and liabilities on a net basis.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation and any recognised impairment loss. 
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets,
other than land and properties under construction, less their
residual values, over their estimated useful lives, using the
straight-line method, on the following bases:
Freehold buildings 2%
Leasehold property over the period of the lease
Fixtures and fittings 10% - 20%
Plant and machinery 5% - 20%
Motor vehicles 20% - 33%
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected
useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter,
over the term of the relevant lease. The gain or loss arising on the
disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference
between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset
and is recognised in income.
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost less any
recognised impairment loss. Depreciation commences when the
assets are ready for their intended use.

GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES
CONTINUED
IMPAIRMENT OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
EXCLUDING GOODWILL
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts
of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is
any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset
is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss
(if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are
independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable
amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and
value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash
flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and
the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash
flows have not been adjusted. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is
estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount
of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable
amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately. 
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying
amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the
revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased
carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would
have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised
for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of
an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately. 
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour
costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the
inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value
represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of
completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s
balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual
provisions of the instrument. 
Trade Receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their
nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated
irrecoverable amounts. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand
deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are
readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject
to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
Financial Liabilities and Equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according
to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual
interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Bank Borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the
proceeds received, net of transaction costs. Finance charges,
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct
issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to the income
statement using the effective interest method and are added to
the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are
not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade Payables
Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at their
nominal value.
Equity Instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each
balance sheet date. Financial assets are impaired where there is
objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that
occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the
estimated future cash flows of the investment have been impacted.
Objective evidence of impairment could include:
significant financial difficulty of the customer or counterparty; or
default or delinquency in payments
For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables,
assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are subsequently
assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective evidence
of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the Group’s
past experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number
of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period of
66 days, as well as observable changes in national or local economic
conditions that correlate with default on receivables. 
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the
impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception
of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through
the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable is
considered uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance
account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off
are credited against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying
amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, in particular interest
rate swaps, foreign currency swaps and forward exchange contracts,
to manage the financial risks arising from the business activities and
the financing of those activities. The Group does not use derivative
financial instruments for speculative purposes. 
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies
approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles
on the use of financial derivatives. 
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and
liabilities measured at their fair value on the balance sheet date.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do
not fulfil the criteria for hedge accounting contained in IAS 39 are
recognised immediately in the income statement. A derivative
is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the
remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and
it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months.
HEDGE ACCOUNTING
The Group uses foreign currency debt and cross currency swaps
to hedge its exposure to changes in the underlying net assets of
overseas operations arising from foreign exchange rate movements. 
The Group maintains documentation of the relationship between
the hedged item and the hedging instrument at the inception of a
hedging transaction together with the risk management objective
and the strategy underlying the designated hedge. The Group also
documents its assessment, both at the inception of the hedging
relationship and subsequently on an ongoing basis, of the effectiveness
of the hedge in offsetting movements in the fair values or cash
flows of the hedged items. 
When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging
relationships are classified as fair value hedges, cash flow
hedges or net investment hedges. 
Note 20 sets out the details of the fair values of the derivative
instruments used for hedging purposes.
Fair Value Hedge
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and
qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement,
together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset
or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
Cash Flow Hedge
Cash flow hedging matches the cash flows of hedged items against
the corresponding cash flow of the derivative. The effective part of
any gain or loss on the derivative is recognised directly in equity and
the hedged item is accounted for in accordance with the policy for
that financial instrument. Any ineffective part of any gain or loss is
recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument
expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies
for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on
the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity
until the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no
longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised
in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the period.
Net Investment Hedge
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for
similarly to cash flow hedges. To the extent the hedge is effective,
changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument arising from the
hedged risk are recognised in the Statement of Recognised Income
and Expense and accumulated in the hedging and translation reserve.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised
immediately in the Income Statement.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income
statement in the event that the foreign operation is disposed of. 
PROVISIONS
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation
(legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, when it is probable
that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and when
a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the
consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance
sheet date, taking into account, the risks and uncertainties surrounding
the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows
estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the
present value of those cash flows.
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group
has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid
expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring
by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features
to those affected by it. The measurement of a restructuring provision
includes only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring
which are those amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the
restructuring and not associated with the ongoing activities of the entity.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based
Payments. In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has
been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November
2002 which were unvested as of 1 January 2005. 
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain
employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at
fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant
date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a
straight-line basis over the vesting period. At each balance sheet date,
the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments
expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market based vesting
conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates,
if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative
expense reflects the revised estimates with a corresponding
adjustment to the equity-settled employee benefits reserve.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model.

GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES
CONTINUED
CRITICAL JUDGEMENTS IN APPLYING THE GROUP’S
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are
described above, management has made the following judgements
that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised
in the financial statements (apart from those involving estimations,
which are dealt with below).
Provisions for environmental liabilities
The Group provides for the costs of environmental remediation
that have been identified, either as part of acquisition due diligence,
or in other circumstances where remediation by the Group is
required. The provision is reviewed annually.
KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources 
of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have
a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year,
are discussed below.
Impairment of Goodwill and Fixed Assets
Determining whether goodwill and fixed assets are impaired requires
an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to
which the assets have been allocated. The value in use calculation
requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to
arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in
order to calculate present value. 
Retirement Benefit Schemes
Accounting for retirement benefit schemes under IAS 19 requires
an assessment of the future benefits payable in accordance with
actuarial assumptions, which are set out in note 30.

2. Business and geographical segments
The Group has adopted IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ with the effect from 1 January 2009. IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be
identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive to allocate
resources to the segments and to assess their performance. In contrast, the predecessor Standard (IAS 14 Segment Reporting) required
the Group to identify two sets of segments (business and geographical), using a risks and returns approach, with the Group’s system of
internal financial reporting to key management personnel serving only as the starting point for the identification of such segments. As a
result, following the adoption of IFRS 8, the identification of the Group’s reportable segments has changed. As a result the comparative
year has have been restated to reflect the revised segmental analysis determined by the Group.
The Group’s reportable segments have been determined in accordance with the reorganisation activity finalised since the interim report,
focusing on key market sectors as opposed to service product. Principally, this split the Group into two business areas being:
Aerospace, Defence & Energy (ADE); and
Automotive & General Industrial (AGI)
This initial split is determined following consideration of factors including the different customer sets, differing service requirements and
different characteristics of business activity. A further split is then made for the revised geographical divisional split of the Group being:
Western Europe
North America; and
Emerging Markets

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the business units that are expected to benefit from that business
combination. Following the adoption of IFRS 8, as disclosed in note 2, the Group has restated the allocation of goodwill, matching the updated
cash generating units applicable to the new structure. After recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill has been
allocated as follows:
2009 2008
£m £m
ADE:
Western Europe 27.4 28.8
North America 36.9 55.4
AGI:
Western Europe 18.0 21.6
North America 15.2 24.5
Emerging Markets 10.4 10.5
Head Office .– 0.8
107.9 141.6
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for those calculations
are the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period. Management estimates discount
rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash generating units. The rate used
to discount the forecast cash flows for all cash generating units is 9.5% (2008: 9.4%). The recoverable amount is the sum of the discounted
cash flows over a fifteen year period.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts based on management estimates for the next five years. The expected sales reflect management’s
expectation of how sales will develop at this point in the economic cycle. The expected profit margin reflects management’s experience
of each cash generating unit’s profitability at the forecast level of sales and incorporates the impact of the restructuring programme, where
appropriate. Cash flows after five years are based on an estimated growth rate of 3.1% (2008: 3.1%), being the historical weighted average
growth in GDP in the markets that the Group operates in. This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of each cash generating unit’s carrying value. A cut in the sales growth
rate by seven percentage points would result in the carrying value of goodwill for the Group being reduced to its recoverable amount.
Goodwill was impaired for heat treatment locations across the Group as a result of the current uncertain market conditions. The most
significant impairments were made in locations in the North American Automotive & General Industrial and North American Aerospace,
Defence & Energy divisions.

The Group has enterered into finance leasing arrangements with SSCP Coatings Sàrl, an associated company, for 3 PVD machines.
The average term of finance leases entered into is 7 years. Unguaranteed residual values of assets leased under finance leases at the
balance sheet date are £0.9m (2008: £1.1m). The interest rate inherent in the leases is fixed at the contract date for the entire lease
term. The average effective interest rate contracted approximates to 4.5% (2008: 4.5%). The fair value of the Group’s finance lease
receivables at 31 December 2009 is estimated at £0.9m (2008: £1.1m). The lease receivables are secured on the related assets.
The maximum exposure to credit risk of finance lease receivables for the current and prior period is the carrying amount as the Group
has no allowance for doubtful debts. The finance lease receivables are not past due and are not impaired in the current and prior year.

The average credit period given to customers for the supply of services is 66 days (2008: 68 days). An allowance has been made for
estimated irrecoverable amounts from the supply of services of £8.1m (2008: £8.4m). This allowance has been determined by reference
to past default experience.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.

17. Other financial assets continued
Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances, cash and trade and other receivables.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances
for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience,
is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings
assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
Further disclosure of the Group’s financial instrument risk management activities is set out in the Finance Director’s Report on pages 26 to 33.
Included in the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £16.6m (2008: £30.5m) which are past due at
the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts
are still considered recoverable. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the quality of the trade receivable from the date
credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and
unrelated. Accordingly the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
Included in the allowance for doubtful debts are individually impaired trade receivables with a balance of £10.1m (2008: £10.5m). The
impairment recognised represents the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present value of the
expected proceeds. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.

Bank overdrafts 3.3 8.9
Non cumulative redeemable preference shares .– 0.7
Loans 99.5 309.6
The other principal features of the Group’s borrowings are as follows:
(i) Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand. No overdrafts are secured.
(ii) The Group has three principal loans which are secured by upstream guarantees provided by subsidiaries:
(a) Drawings of £Nil (2008: £194.8m) under a Revolving Credit Facility of £225m. This unsecured facility commenced on 22 August 2005
for a period of five years. The multi currency drawings under this facility carry an interest rate of between 0.50% and 0.75% above
LIBOR (the margin at 31 December 2009 was 0.50%).
(b) Drawings of £96.2m (2008: £107.3m) under a Revolving Credit Facility of €125m. This unsecured facility commenced on 31 July 2006
for a period of seven years. The Euro drawings under this facility carry an interest rate of between 0.80% and 1.10% above LIBOR
(the margin at 31 December 2009 was 0.8%).
(c) Letters of credit and loan drawings of £6.5m (2008: £10.5m) under a Revolving Credit and Letter of Credit Facility of $20m.
This unsecured facility commenced on 17 August 2007 for a period of three years. The US Dollar drawings and Letter of Credit fees
under this facility carry a margin/fee of between 0.50% and 0.75% above LIBOR (the margin/fee at 31 December 2009 was 0.50%).
At 31 December 2009 the Group had available £245.8m (2008: £47.1m) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities.
All borrowings are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.

20. Derivative financial instruments continued
The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge material future transactions and cash flows. The Group uses foreign currency forward
contracts in the management of its exchange rate exposures. The contracts are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Group’s
principal markets. The unrecognised gains and losses were not material in either 2009 or 2008.
Fair value is determined using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities
of the contracts.
The Group’s interest rate risk is primarily in relation to its fixed rate borrowings (fair value risk) and floating rate borrowings (cash flow
risk). From time to time the Group will use interest rate derivative contracts to manage its exposure to interest rate movements within
Group policy. However at the balance sheet date the Group had no interest rate derivative contracts.
In addition, energy derivatives have been used in Sweden to fix forward electricity prices, however this position is expected to unwind in 2010.
At the balance sheet date the Group had entered into foreign currency denominated cross currency swaps that were designated as a hedging
instrument for the purposes of hedging the translation of its foreign operations. The contracts are entered into either with both currencies
at floating interest rates (generally based on 3 month LIBOR interest rates) or both currencies at fixed interest rates. The details are:

Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset. The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances (after offset) for
financial reporting purposes:
2009 2008
£m £m
Deferred tax liabilities 73.4 78.3
Deferred tax assets (56.9) (52.5)
16.5 25.8
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of £177.1m (2008: £115.0m) available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of £83.4m (2008: £42.2m) of such losses, based on management forecasts of future
taxable profits against which the assets can be recovered in the relevant jurisdictions. No deferred tax asset has been recognised
in respect of the remaining £93.7m (2008: £72.8m) of such losses. All recognised losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not
been recognised was £525.8m (2008: £601.9m). No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group
is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse
in the foreseeable future. Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are insignificant.
The deferred tax liabilities not provided at 31 December 2009 are significantly reduced from the previous year as a result of a change
to UK tax legislation which largely exempts from UK tax, overseas dividends received on or after 1 July 2009. Temporary differences
at 31 December 2009 represent only the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the UK of those
earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions
in which these subsidiaries operate.

It is the Group’s policy to lease certain of its fixtures and equipment under finance leases. The average lease term is 3.7 years.
For the year ended 31 December 2009, the average effective borrowing rate was 7.8% (2008: 7.8%). Interest rates are fixed at the
contract date. All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments.
The fair value of the Group’s lease obligations approximates to their carrying amount.
The Group’s obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors’ rights over the leased assets.

The restructuring provision relates to the remaining costs associated with the closure of various Heat Treatment sites. Further details
are contained in the Finance Director’s Report.
The Group provides for the costs of environmental remediation that have been identified, either as part of acquisition due diligence,
or in other circumstances where remediation by the Group is required. This provision is reviewed annually. In the current year the
environmental provision has been separated into Restructuring Environmental and Environmental to separately identify environmental
provisions relating to the restructuring programme from those arising in the ordinary course of business.
Cash outflows in respect of these liabilities are expected to occur within 5 years.

Expected volatility % 42.7 42.7
Expected life years 3.0 3.0
Risk-free rate % 4.0 4.0
Expected dividends % 4.3 4.3
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous 3 years.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability,
exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised total income of £0.1m (2008: expenses of £2.6m) related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.

UK Scheme
The Company sponsors the Bodycote UK Pension Scheme which is a funded defined benefit arrangement for certain UK employees.
The last full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out by a qualified independent actuary as at 6 April 2008 and updated on an
approximate basis to 31 December 2009.
The contributions made by the employer over the financial year have been £1.0m, comprising £0.7m in respect of benefit accrual and
£0.3m in respect of ongoing expense. This level of contribution has been reviewed following the triennial valuation of the Scheme
completed as at 6 April 2008 and it is expected that the deficit will be extinguished by December 2016.
It is the policy of the Group to recognise all actuarial gains and losses in the year in which they occur outside of the profit and loss
account and in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF BODYCOTE PLC
We have audited the Parent Company financial statements of
Bodycote plc for the year ended 31 December 2009, which comprise
the Parent Company Balance Sheet, Accounting Policies and the
related notes 1 to 11. The financial reporting framework that has
been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United
Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body,
in accordance with Chapter 3 of part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them
in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement,
the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the parent company
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and
fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with
the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes
an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate
to the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant
accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall
presentation of the financial statements.
OPINION ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In our opinion the parent company financial statements:
give a true and fair view of the state of the Parent Company’s
affairs as at 31 December 2009;
have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements
of the Companies Act 2006.
OPINION ON OTHER MATTERS PRESCRIBED
BY THE COMPANIES ACT 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for
the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared
is consistent with the parent company financial statements.
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED
TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where
the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
adequate accounting records have not been kept by the
Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not
been received from branches not visited by us; or
the parent company financial statements and the part of
the Board Report on Remuneration to be audited are not
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified
by law are not made; or
we have not received all the information and explanations
we require for our audit.
OTHER MATTER
We have reported separately on the group financial statements
of Bodycote plc for the year ended 31 December 2009 and the
information in the Board Report on Remuneration that is described
as having been audited.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
ACCOUNTING CONVENTION
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical
cost convention and in accordance with applicable law and United
Kingdom accounting standards. The accounting policies have been
applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year
in dealing with items that are considered material in relation to the
Company’s financial statements. In accordance with Section 408
of the Companies Act 2006 a separate profit and loss account
dealing with the results of the Company has not been presented.
INVESTMENTS
Investments are held at cost less provision for impairment.
PENSION COSTS
For defined benefit and defined contribution schemes, the amount
charged to the profit and loss account in respect of pension costs is
the contributions payable in the year. For further details see Note 10.
LEASES
Assets held under finance leases and other similar contracts, which
confer rights and obligations similar to those attached to owned
assets, are capitalised as tangible fixed assets and are depreciated
over the shorter of the lease terms and their useful lives. The capital
elements of future lease obligations are recorded as liabilities, while
the interest elements are charged to the profit and loss account over
the period of the lease to produce a constant rate of charge on the
balance of capital repayments outstanding. Hire purchase transactions
are dealt with similarly, except that assets are depreciated over their
useful lives. 
Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss
account on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
THE COMPANY AS LESSOR
Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as
receivables at the amount of the Company’s net investment in the
leases. Finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods so as
to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the Company’s net
investment outstanding in respect of the leases.
TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost or valuation. Depreciation
is provided on a straight-line basis, to reduce the carrying value
to the estimated residual value at the point of sale, at the following
annual rates:
Fixtures and fittings : 10% to 20%
Residual value is calculated on prices prevailing at the date of acquisition.
TAXATION
Current UK corporation tax and foreign tax is provided at amounts
expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that
have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax
in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at
the balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between
the Company’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial
statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax
assessments in periods different from those in which they are
recognised in the financial statements. 
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore
recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can
be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable
profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing
differences can be deducted. 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of
overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date,
dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to
distribute past earnings in future has been entered into by the subsidiary. 
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected
to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected
to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is
measured on a discounted basis to reflect the time value of money
over the period between the balance sheet date and the dates on
which it is estimated that the underlying timing differences will reverse.
The discount rates used reflect the post-tax yields to maturity that can
be obtained on government bonds with similar maturity dates and
currencies to those of the deferred tax assets or liabilities.

DEBT
Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction
of issue costs. The carrying amount is increased by the finance cost
in respect of the accounting period and reduced by payments made
in the period. Finance costs of debt are recognised in the profit and
loss account over the term of such instruments at a constant rate
on the carrying amount. 
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company may enter into derivative financial instruments,
in particular interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps and forward
exchange contracts to manage the financial risks arising from the
business activities and the financing of the Group’s activities.
The Company does not use derivative financial instruments
for speculative purposes. 
The use of financial derivatives is governed by Group policies
approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles
on the use of financial derivatives. 
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets or liabilities
measured at their fair value on the balance sheet date. Changes in
the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not fulfil the criteria
for hedge accounting contained in FRS 26 are recognised immediately
in the income statement.
HEDGE ACCOUNTING
The Company maintains documentation of the relationship between
the hedged item and the hedging instrument at the inception of a
hedging transaction together with the risk management objective
and the strategy underlying the designated hedge. The Company also
documents its assessment, both at the inception of the hedging
relationship and subsequently on an ongoing basis, of the effectiveness
of the hedge in offsetting movements in the fair values or cash flows
of the hedged items. 
When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging relationships
are classified as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges:
Fair Value Hedge
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and
qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement,
together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset
or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. 
Cash Flow Hedge
Cash flow hedging matched the cash flows of hedged items against
the corresponding cash flow of the derivative. The effective part of
any gain or loss on the derivative is recognised directly in equity and
the hedged item is accounted for in accordance with the policy for
that financial instrument. Any ineffective part of any gain or loss is
recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument
expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies
for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on
the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity
until the forecasted transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no
longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised
in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the period.
Related Party Transactions
The company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in
Financial Reporting Standard 8 ‘Related Party Transactions’ not to disclose
transactions or balances with entities which form part of the group.

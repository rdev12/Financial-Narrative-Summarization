At A glAnCE
In the past year Care UK has cared for more than 
half a million people across the UK.
Care UK is delivering on its promise of fulfilling lives. We are improving the speed and ease 
of access to high quality health and social care; bringing services closer to people’s homes; 
bringing down waiting lists for non-emergency surgery; offering 8am to 8pm access to primary 
care facilities; and delivering industry leading quality of care in all of our businesses.

some important milestones during the year include:
October 2008
Care UK opens southampton 
nHs t reatment Centre 
In October 2008 Care UK opened the Southampton NHS Treatment 
Centre, a brand new, state of the art facility providing high quality 
specialist care for the people of Hampshire. The hospital provides 
treatments in nine specialties, including hip and knee replacements, 
ear, nose and throat and ophthalmology.
January 2009
Health Minister congratulates 
istC achievements in Plymouth 
In January the Health Minister, Ben Bradshaw, visited the Peninsula 
NHS Treatment Centre to congratulate staff after it came top in a 
national league table. Commissioned by NHS Plymouth, the specialist 
hospital has consistently achieved utilisation rates above 100% of 
targeted levels and consistently scores extremely highly in customer 
satisfaction surveys with over 98% of patients rating their care as 
“excellent” or “good”. 
February 2009
launch of greater Manchester CA ts 
In February, Care UK launched a highly innovative CATS in Greater 
Manchester. Using superbly equipped state of the art mobile units, 
CATS serves seven different locations bringing one stop diagnostics 
and treatment, including CT and MRI scanning, to areas that have 
traditionally had poor access to healthcare facilities. The CATS 
service reduces waiting times, offers 8am to 8pm opening and 
greatly reduces the number of appointments patients need to 
complete their treatment.
March 2009
new cataract service launched at Medway 
and two new residential homes opened
As part of our policy of working closely with Primary Care Trusts 
(“PCTs”) to deliver continuous improvement and innovation, in March 
Care UK launched a new cataract service at the Medway hospital in 
Gillingham, Kent. As with the other surgical procedures carried 
out at Medway, the service is proving popular with 98% of patients 
reporting their care experience as “excellent” or “good”.
Two new residential care homes opened in Chelmsford and Slough. 
The homes and their grounds were designed with the needs and 
comfort of residents in mind. Activity based care, which enables 
residents to continue to lead active and independent lives, will 
feature prominently in the running of the homes.
August 2009
Referrals jump at Barlborough 
Following its inclusion on the directly bookable part of the NHS 
“Choose and Book” system, which allows GPs and patients to book 
their surgery direct with the hospital, the Barlborough NHS Treatment 
Centre saw referrals jump significantly. This reflects the exceptional 
reputation that the specialist hospital has built up since opening just 
over four years ago. Word of mouth recommendation by satisfied 
patients is the largest single factor attracting patients.
October 2009
islington care home rated “excellent” 
by regulator
In October Highbury New Park home, operated in partnership with 
Islington Borough Council, became Care UK’s 20th home to receive 
the highest possible quality rating from the independent regulator, 
the CQC. CQC inspections are unannounced and cover the standards 
of personal care, social activities and the performance of management 
and staff.
november 2009
Work gets underway on new nursing 
home in Portsmouth
In November Care UK launched the build of a 92-bed specialised 
nursing home to provide high quality dementia care. The design 
of the home reflects Care UK’s activity based care philosophy 
focussing on what people can do rather than what they can’t. 
The home features an internet café, physiotherapy facilities, 
a gym, library and garden room.
2009
Care UK offers a new start to many 
during economic downturn 
While many traditional UK industries have had to make job cuts 
during the economic downturn Care UK has been continuing to 
recruit. By talking direct to employers who are losing staff Care UK 
has been able to attract high quality candidates many of whom 
had not previously considered a career in care.

Care UK’s performance during 2009 
demonstrates the resilience of the group 
and the benefits of investment in the market 
emerging as the NHS opens up to competition.
Adjusted operating profit, before 
non-recurring items and amortisation 
and impairment charges, increased 7% 
to £38.9m (2008: £36.4m) on revenue, 
including share of joint venture revenue in 
2008, up 20% to £410.0m (2008: £341.6m). 
Adjusted profit before tax rose 17% to 
£28.1m (2008: £24.1m). Adjusted basic 
earnings per share were up 13% to 31.46p 
(2008: 27.92p). Total basic earnings per 
share were 23.04p (2008: loss of 4.98p). 
Operating cash flow was £58.1m (2008: 
£46.9m), an increase of 24%, representing 
a cash conversion ratio of 149% (2008: 147%) 
measured against adjusted operating profit 
excluding share of joint venture operating 
profit in 2008.
The most notable financial performance 
in the group has been in the Health Care 
division, partly reflecting the full-year effect 
of full ownership of PHG. A number of 
important and innovative services have 
commenced in this division during the year, 
which are yet to reach their full operational 
capability. Notwithstanding this, revenue 
and adjusted operating profit increased by 
54% and 44% respectively and the division 
represented around 40% of both revenue 
and adjusted operating profit.
Overall, the aggregate revenue of the 
three Social Care divisions was 5% higher 
than the previous year, all of which was 
organic growth, with adjusted operating 
profit 4% lower. Solid performances in both 
Residential Care and Specialist Care were 
balanced by the operational challenges in 
Community Care reported in the interim 
results, which is now showing signs of recovery.
Employees and quality
Over the course of a year, Care UK 
cares for approximately half a million 
people through many different kinds of 
service, with a workforce that is dedicated 
to providing excellent care. We are fortunate 
in having such a committed and professional 
team of employees and I would like to 
thank them on behalf of the board, 
our patients and our other service users.
On 1 September 2009, Doug Umbers 
joined the group and the board as 
Managing Director, Social Care to 
assume responsibility for the operational 
performance and development of the 
group’s three Social Care divisions. Doug 
brings significant strategic and general 
management experience to the group 
and we are pleased to have him on board.
Our service user and patient base, 
as well as the UK population generally, 
are becoming increasingly diverse in their 
make-up. Care UK as an organisation seeks 
to reflect that diversity and to attract, retain 
and develop a wholly inclusive group of 
people who put the needs of our patients 
and service users at the heart of everything 
we do, recognising the difference that each 
of us can make and aspiring to deliver 
innovative solutions to individuals’ care 
needs. These goals have been embedded 
into the group’s “Fulfilling Lives” programme, 
a group-wide initiative to promote these 
values throughout Care UK. 
Dividend
The board is proposing a final dividend 
of 3.40p per share (2008: 3.10p), 
an increase of 10%, which will be paid 
on 17 February 2010 to shareholders on 
the Register on 22 January 2010. This level 
of increase is consistent with the group’s 
previously stated dividend policy.
500,000  
service users
over the course of a year. Care UK cares for 
approximately half a million people through many 
different kinds of service, consistently delivering 
industry leading quality and satisfaction ratings.
These results demonstrate 
the group’s resilience and the 
benefits of investment in the 
market emerging as the NHS 
opens up to competition. Our 
high levels of contracted revenue 
and the non-discretionary nature 
of our services offer unusually 
good income visibility and 
relative market stability.

Bid approach
On 30 September 2009, the board 
confirmed that it had recently received 
an unsolicited approach from Bridgepoint 
Capital Limited regarding a possible offer 
for the company. The approach was very 
preliminary in nature and, having discussed 
it with its advisors, Investec, the board 
rejected it.
Outlook
The group’s Social Care and Health Care 
businesses continue to benefit from high 
levels of contracted revenue and the 
non-discretionary nature of our services 
offer unusually good income visibility 
and relative market stability.
The challenges to public sector funding 
over the coming years are apparent and 
our experience and expectation is that to 
achieve higher quality services at better 
value, public sector commissioners are 
increasingly turning to the independent 
sector to drive efficiency and reform.
Our Social Care markets are well established 
and we expect that the positive impact of 
funding pressures will be to further outsource 
services currently provided in-house and to 
utilise fewer providers, generating genuine 
efficiencies of scale. We are also continuing 
to see funding focussed on people with the 
greatest need and this is best delivered by 
better resourced and effective providers.
In Health Care, there is a great opportunity 
to shift care from hospital environments 
to primary and community care settings. 
Services such as our enhanced GP-led 
health centres and consultant-led clinical 
assessment are demonstrating material 
savings for the NHS whilst delivering 
superior health benefits for patients.
We are pleased that centrally led initiatives 
are becoming embedded in mainstream 
Primary Care Trust (“PCT”) and patient-led 
procurement and choice. During the year 
and post year-end, we have been awarded 
14 new contracts, all procured by PCTs, and 
we are now seeing referrals to our specialist 
hospitals coming directly from GPs and 
patients, with dramatic increases once 
they are able to directly book referrals.
We are disappointed with progress with 
the post contract planning process for our 
specialist hospitals and the consequent lack 
of clarity and certainty. However, we remain 
optimistic that we will continue to operate 
most, if not all, of these high quality 
hospitals into the longer term.
Successive Governments have progressively 
introduced market-based reforms in social 
care and, latterly, in health care. It is remarkable 
to observe the distance we have travelled 
from historic ideological commitment to 
state-run monopolistic provision. The recent 
announcement by the Government to embed 
into legislation the 18-week target time for 
elective surgery and patient choice of provider 
is the latest example of this inexorable reform. 
We welcome recent policy statements by 
the opposition Conservative Party in the UK 
which have substantially strengthened their 
commitment to more open market reform 
to allow new providers of NHS services and 
for greater freedom for patients to choose 
their GP and hospital provider. This builds 
on the significant reforms introduced by 
the current Government in recent years 
and means both the largest political parties 
support the role that independent providers 
can play in helping to deliver the highest 
quality and most efficient care to patients. 
As well as such market reform and 
stimulation, policy reform generally is 
focussed on the migration of services 
from hospital to community and social 
care solutions in order to improve care 
quality and reduce cost. This is wholly 
aligned with Care UK’s long-term health 
and social care strategy and places 
the company extremely well to drive 
exceptional levels of long-term growth.

social Care
The group’s Social Care activities comprise 
the Residential Care, Community Care and 
Specialist Care divisions, which are commented 
on individually below. Aggregate Social Care 
revenue has increased by 5% with a fall in 
adjusted operating profit of 4%. The reduced 
operating margin reflects the cost implications 
of the additional holiday entitlements arising 
under the Work and Families Act 2006, which 
impacted the prior year for only six months, 
as well as the impact of start-up operations 
in Residential Care and operational challenges 
in Community Care.
Residential Care 
The Residential Care division achieved 
growth in revenue and operating profit 
of 6% and 3% respectively. The total 
number of beds at the end of the financial 
year, including day care places, was 3,533 
compared with 3,303 at the beginning 
of the year. Fee rates in the year averaged 
£642 per week compared with £621 in the 
previous year, an increase of 3.4%. The level 
of fee rate increase achieved during the 
year partly reflects the effect of a lower 
RPI index level than in previous years; 
despite this the underlying margin within 
the Residential Care division has been 
maintained. The mature level of financial 
occupancy in the year (“beds paid for”) 
was 96% and the mature level of physical 
occupancy was 90%, both measures 
excluding the two new homes opened 
during the year. These measures compare 
favourably with other market participants 
and demonstrate the benefit of our 
increasing focus on high dependency 
dementia care.
Oak House, the new residential care facility 
in Slough, and Manor Lodge, the new build 
120-bed care home in Chelmsford, both 
opened in March 2009. These homes are 
focussed on providing complex dementia 
care and have flexible registration and home 
layout arrangements enabling them to serve 
a changing mix of nursing, residential and 
respite care services. The initial aggregate 
occupancy build up in these two units 
has been encouraging.
We are pleased to have signed the 
contract for the provision of a 92-bed 
care home in Portsmouth. As reported 
previously, the contract element of this 
development is for 25 years for 62 beds. 
Construction of the home has now 
commenced and will be funded by 
Portsmouth City Council. We expect 
to open the home in autumn 2010.
As reported in the August Interim 
Management Statement, planning 
permission has been received for the 
development of a new 74-bed residential 
care home in Crowborough, east Sussex, 
targeted primarily at the self-pay market 
for older people with higher acuity dementia 
needs. Construction is due to start shortly 
and service delivery is expected to commence 
by spring 2011. This home does not have 
any block contracted beds.
The acquisition of a further site in 
the South east has now been agreed, 
subject to the receipt of suitable planning 
permission, for the development of a new 
70-bed care home targeted primarily at 
the self-pay market. Assuming a six-month 
period for achieving planning permission, 
this home would be expected to open 
towards the end of calendar year 2011.
We are continuing to evaluate a range 
of growth opportunities in Residential Care 
and have a number of potential new 
developments that we expect to 
approve in the forthcoming year.
Community Care 
After achieving a compound average 
annual growth rate in revenue of 19% 
over the previous six years, the Community 
Care division delivered revenue growth 
of 5% in 2009, all of which was organic.

Extraordinary performance – 
product/service extension
Peninsula tops the national league table 
of istCs. t o date the hospital has treated 
over 15,000 patients and delivers well 
above the utilisation rates expected by 
local commissioners.
The hospital provides a range of in-patient 
orthopaedic surgery and minor day cases supported 
by physiotherapy and diagnostics. In July this year 
an outreach service was launched to provide 
orthopaedic surgery to people living in Cornwall. 
Patient experience at Peninsula is exceptional with 
95% of patients rating their care as “excellent” or 
“good”. Patient satisfaction is a significant driver of the 
hospital’s success: over 58% of patient referrals result 
from recommendation by family or friends. The hospital 
has never had a case of MRSA or C-difficile.
A new knee allowed one patient at Peninsula 
to climb the mast of the STS Lord Nelson tall ship 
just a few months after her operation. Sylvia, 71, 
who had sufffered pain and lost mobility before 
her operation, told us “the physiotherapists were 
excellent in getting me up and about and the levels 
of cleanliness were exceptional.”
98% 
of Care UK patients say they would recommend 
our hospitals to family and friends.

collapse at home resulting from respiratory arrest. 
Whilst in hospital he was diagnosed with Motor 
Neurone Disease and other complications. 
Following a prolonged stay in an Intensive 
Treatment Unit (“ITU”) and an acute ward, 
the hospital team trained the staff at Pinetum 
to care for George and manage his equipment. 
Thanks to the team at Pinetum, George was able 
to be cared for in a more appropriate setting and 
his family and friends were able to maintain 
regular contact reducing the potential of any 
emotional and social isolation.

social Care continued
Community Care continued
The group has chosen to focus on 
performance improvement during the 
year and to temporarily suspend acquisition 
led growth, which has historically delivered 
around half of total revenue growth.
The reduced operating profit within 
Community Care reflects the previously 
reported operational costs of stabilising 
the Harrow branch and additional central 
management resources required to resolve 
immediate operational challenges and to 
enhance our prospects for further growth. 
Branch level performance in this division 
showed an operating margin at a similar 
level to 2008. The run rate operating profit 
in the last quarter of the financial year 
has shown some encouraging signs of 
improvement and we remain confident 
that the actions that have been taken will, 
in time, result in returning the division to 
similar levels of profitability experienced 
in previous years.
As well as those reported with the interim 
results, new and renewed contracts have 
been awarded in Sheffield, Brighton, 
Peterborough, Derby and Darlington. 
At 30 September 2009, the weekly total 
of hours of care provided amounted to 
around 123,000, representing like-for-like 
growth in the year of around 2.5%, 
excluding the terminated Hertfordshire 
contract. The total hours delivered in the 
year amounted to around 6.3m compared 
with 6.2m in the previous year.
Specialist Care 
Specialist Care has delivered growth in 
revenue and operating profit of 5% and 4% 
respectively, all of which is organic growth. 
Across the division we have seen an increase 
of approximately 8% in the average number 
of service users being cared for.
The Mental Health business achieved 
revenue growth of 9% and a good 
improvement in the operating margin, 
mainly through better occupancy levels 
in higher value-added services such as 
specialist eating disorders and self-harm.
In Learning Disabilities, revenue growth 
of around 11% was achieved following the 
start of a number of new services resulting 
in growth in the year of around 17% in the 
number of service users cared for. Almost 
90% of service users are looked after in 
independent supported living environments, 
the preferred form of care of service 
commissioners. The operating margin for 
the year reflected the start-up nature of 
these new services and was consequently 
slightly lower than the previous year. 
In Children’s Services we saw a revenue 
reduction of 12% over the previous year 
but a similar operating profit contribution, 
as expected, as a result of the rationalisation 
of capacity undertaken in the latter part 
of 2008 and early 2009. encouragingly, 
we have seen a much stronger performance 
from this business in the second half, 
showing the benefits of the action taken. 
Social Care strategy and outlook
It is clear that Local Government finances 
will be under pressure during the coming 
years and funding for social care has not 
received the same level of commitment by 
the main political parties as health care 
funding. However, we believe there is little 
room for further retrenchment of funding 
for the type of higher acuity service that 
we are increasingly focussing on as Local 
Authorities are now typically supporting 
hard core dependency requirements only 
and demographic trends are expected to 
add to demand rather than ease pressure.
As a consequence, Local Authorities 
are increasingly focussing on initiatives 
to deliver better value. These include 
further challenges to costly in-house supply,

social Care continued
Specialist Care continued
Social Care strategy and outlook continued
avoidance of unnecessary low dependency 
residential care placements and reductions 
in the number of suppliers in order to 
benefit from logistical synergy.
In addition, as illustrated in the recent 
Green Paper on the future of social care, 
“Shaping the Future of Care Together”, 
there is a growing expectation that greater 
levels of personal contribution to the cost 
of care will be required, whether self or 
insurance funded. 
Larger providers such as Care UK 
are better placed to leverage synergies, 
invest in cost-effective systems and provide 
consistently high-quality services to meet the 
needs of ever more dependent service users.
Given these industry trends, Care UK 
remains strongly committed to its Social 
Care business and our strategy is to continue 
to drive operational excellence to further 
improve our organic growth as well as 
gaining greater scale through carefully 
targeted acquisitions at the right price.
Care UK is already one of the best rated 
care organisations by the CQC with almost 
90% of all of the group’s Social Care services 
rated as “excellent” or “good” and our 
employees work constantly to achieve 
ever higher rates of service excellence.
Health Care 
The Health Care business has shown 
good improvement in financial performance 
compared with 2008, with revenue increasing 
by 54% and adjusted operating profit 
increasing by 44%. The full ownership 
of PHG for the full year, compared with 
only two months in the prior year, has 
contributed significantly to this level of 
growth. In addition, the two new Phase 2 
ISTC schemes commissioned in the first half, 
in Manchester and Southampton, have 
contributed around £24.5m of revenue 
in aggregate. As expected during their 
ramp-up periods, these two new contracts 
have delivered an aggregate break-even 
position. The underlying performance in 
Health Care – adjusting for full ownership of 
PHG and excluding the Phase 2 ISTC services 
and the West Midlands diagnostics contract 
in 2008 – saw growth of just over 12% in 
revenue with a similar operating margin 
being achieved.
Primary Care 
The Primary Care business now comprises 
over 40 operating sites delivering a range 
of services focussed around GP services, out 
of hours and walk-in services, diagnostics 
and CATS services and prison health. During 
the year a total of twelve new contracts 
have been awarded, of which all but one 
are now operational; the final service is due 
to commence in 2010. All but one of these 
contracts has been awarded under the 
Department of Health’s (“DoH”) “equitable 
Access to Primary Medical Care Services” 
procurement programme and will facilitate 
the creation of stronger customer relationships 
with the commissioning PCTs. The aggregate 
revenue from these contracts will amount to 
around £18m when fully operational. Since 
the year end we have been appointed as 
preferred bidder on a further two contracts. 
The Greater Manchester CATS service 
commenced operational delivery in 
February 2009 as planned. This service 
is provided by highly sophisticated mobile 
units that deliver a range of outpatient 
services to NHS patients including the 
treatment of minor injuries, diagnostics and 
scanning, endoscopies and pre-operative 
assessments. Over the past three months we 
have seen significant growth in the use of 
the service with referral levels increasing by 
over 70% during this period. We have now 
also arranged to provide an eighth site in 
order to extend the benefits of the service 
to a higher number of potential patients. 
We are confident that 
independent providers have a 
crucial role to play in the future 
provision of NHS services.

treated 16,800 patients in its first 
ten months of operation. MCAts delivers 
diagnostic services and a range of minor 
treatments to seven different sites 
in the greater Manchester area using 
innovative mobile units. 
The success of this service which is provided on 
behalf of the NHS is evidenced by the fact that over 
97% of patients using the service rate their care as 
“excellent” or “good”. Because the service operates 
as a “one-stop shop”, less than one in five patients 
require a second appointment. The service delivers 
around 24% in cost savings to the NHS. 
Robert who used the service in November told 
us: “everything ran to time and was efficient and 
professional. The mobile units were clean, hygienic 
and much more spacious than I imagined. You don’t

service user involvement strategy 
in specialist Care services
Care UK’s strategy to help people with learning 
disabilities become more involved in determining 
their own care is a national first in the private sector.
The process began with a group of people with learning 
disabilities who acted as “champions” for their fellow 
service users in “Listen to Me” groups.
One participant is John who lives in a 24-hour 
care supported house. Through his local group, 
he effectively trained our trainers by helping them 
learn more about what he wants from his support. 
The strategy will promote service users’ participation 
in the recruitment, selection and induction of their 
support staff as well as giving them an awareness 
of their own rights. 
each service user will also be able to give continuous 
feedback to ensure they have a service improvement plan 
tailored to their individual needs.
By 2010, Care UK will have developed a wide range 
of measures to help the people it supports to have 
more of a say in the care they receive, including a 
Service Users Involvement web page facilitated by users, 
a Self Advocacy Action Group in every region to provide 
a focus for consultation and a DvD of experiences to 
share with new users being supported by Care UK.

Health Care continued
Primary Care continued
This highly innovative service benefits 
patients by reducing waiting times and 
treatment schedules for many conditions, 
bringing care closer to patients’ homes, and 
reducing costs for the commissioning PCTs 
by up to 24%. As the service in Manchester 
becomes fully established we will be looking 
for opportunities to deliver similar services 
elsewhere.
Patient satisfaction levels in Primary Care 
services continue to be extremely high and 
reflect a strong culture of customer focus 
that differentiates Care UK. 
The Primary Care team continues to 
devote considerable resources to bidding for 
a range of opportunities and we continue 
to see an encouraging pipeline of potential 
contracts being locally procured by PCTs. 
Local procurement brings the added benefit 
of shorter timescales and the creation of 
strong customer relationships with local 
decision makers.
Secondary Care 
The six existing Wave 1 ISTCs within the 
Secondary Care business have continued 
to perform well, with excellent patient 
satisfaction levels and clinical outcomes and 
a commensurate financial performance. 
The Phase 2 ISTC in Southampton commenced 
services early in the financial year. Following 
the initial ramp-up period, when patient 
numbers were slightly behind expectations, 
volumes have steadily increased and the 
centre’s clinical outcomes and patient 
satisfaction ratings are comparable with 
other established centres.
We have now begun to implement a 
“directly bookable” service to our specialist 
hospitals under the NHS “Choose and Book” 
system, which enables patients to make 
online appointments for their procedures 
whilst at their GP practice. We are now 
seeing a significant increase in referral levels 
at the Barlborough Links site, the first of 
the existing ISTCs to implement this system. 
This is underscored by our own market 
research, which shows the importance and 
popularity of our hospitals, which have 
consistently delivered excellent clinical and 
patient satisfaction ratings, leading to 
strong word-of-mouth referrals from 
past patients.
Health Care strategy and outlook
The principal focus in the Health Care 
business remains the achievement of service 
continuity at the group’s Wave 1 ISTC 
centres beyond their initial contracted 
periods. The DoH has confirmed that the 
contractual position on guaranteed value 
asset buybacks (where applicable) will 
operate as intended and that the planned 
model for service continuity will be through 
a leasehold structure. 
The first two of the group’s centres, in 
Plymouth and Barlborough, reach their 
initial contract expiry dates in February 2010 
and April 2010 respectively; in 2009 these 
centres accounted for aggregate revenue 
of approximately £34m. In the case of 
Plymouth, the PCT is planning to confirm 
the appointment of the ongoing provider 
during March 2010. We are, therefore, in 
discussions to extend the existing contract. 
A similar process is yet to be established 
for the Barlborough Links site.
Given the scale of investment into 
these world-class hospitals and our 
excellent track record of patient care, 
we are extremely disappointed by the 
timescales and uncertainty of the processes 
around determining their continuation. 
Particularly given the extremely high patient 
satisfaction rates that we are achieving and 
the strong word-of-mouth referrals we are 
experiencing, we remain optimistic that 
we will continue to operate most, if not 
all, of the centres in the longer term but 
regret that we have not been able to 
provide greater certainty to our patients, 
employees and shareholders.

Secondary Care continued
Health Care strategy and 
outlook continued
We have also seen a growing interest in the 
NHS to explore the potential for alternative 
forms of management of NHS hospitals. 
We believe there would be significant scope 
for Care UK to add considerable expertise 
and value in such situations and the scale 
of such opportunities would potentially 
make this a transformational opportunity 
should viable operational and commercial 
concepts be developed.
The growing body of evidence is that high 
quality and appropriately equipped health 
care can deliver better and more convenient 
services to patients whilst achieving cost 
savings in excess of 20%. We are therefore 
confident that independent providers have 
a crucial role to play in the future provision 
of NHS services.
We welcome recent policy statements by 
the opposition Conservative Party which 
have substantially strengthened their 
commitment to more open market reform 
to allow new providers of NHS services and 
offer greater patient choice. Both the largest 
political parties support the long-term role 
that independent providers will play in helping 
to deliver high-quality and cost-effective 
care to patients. 
Having invested significant resources, time 
and expertise in our Health Care capabilities 
and delivered first class results for patients, 
we believe Care UK is now extremely well 
placed to help lead the inexorable evolution 
of market principles within the NHS through 
high quality and innovative solutions delivered 
in partnership with PCT commissioners, GPs 
and other NHS providers.

The 2009 financial year has seen another 
solid performance for Care UK with a further 
increase in the contribution from the 
group’s Health Care activities, a generally 
sound performance in Social Care and a 
substantial reduction in the group’s net 
debt position. The combination of a 
continuing strong cash flow performance, 
sound property asset base and significant 
funding headroom mean that the group 
is well placed to deliver on identified 
growth opportunities.
Overview
The group’s results show revenue, 
including in 2008 the group’s share 
of joint venture revenue, of £410.0m 
(2008: £341.6m), an increase of 20%, 
and adjusted operating profit of £38.9m 
(2008: £36.4m), an increase of 7%. Adjusted 
profit before tax was £28.1m (2008: £24.1m), 
an increase of 17%. Overall group profit 
before tax was £21.0m (2008: £1.6m), 
the 2008 figure reflecting the £15.9m of 
non-cash impairment charges taken in that 
year in relation to the terminated West 
Midlands diagnostics contract. The group’s 
forward contracted revenue was £1.4bn 
at 30 September 2009 (2008: £1.5bn).
Operating performance
The group’s underlying operating performance 
is shown in the table above as “Adjusted 
operating profit”, reflecting three adjustments 
for 2009.
Amortisation of IFRS 3 intangible assets
Under IFRS 3 all business combinations are 
reviewed in order to identify any intangible 
assets required to be recognised. Such 
intangible assets are then amortised over 
their estimated useful lives. The non-cash 
amortisation charge for the year amounted 
to £7.5m (2008: £5.0m), the increase from 
the prior year reflecting the annualisation of 
the acquisition of PHG, the group’s former 
50% owned joint venture, in August 2008.

Impairment of goodwill and 
intangible assets 
Goodwill of £0.2m relating to a small 
unit in the Specialist Care division has been 
impaired following the unit’s closure during 
the year.
Non-recurring items
There are three items covered by this 
heading as follows, amounting to a gain 
of £0.6m in aggregate.
Contract loss
As reported in the group’s interim results, 
a loss of £0.9m arose in the first half of the 
year from the termination of the Community 
Care division’s Hertfordshire contract. 
Property rectification costs
During the year, two related incidents 
have occurred at one of the group’s 
ISTC sites that have required significant 
construction remediation work to be carried 
out. The group has funded this remediation 
work in view of the urgency with which it 
was required to be undertaken. It is the 
group’s belief, based on advice received, 
that the responsibility for a substantial 
proportion of these costs falls on either the 
host hospital trust or the group’s insurers. 
However, at the year end, discussions 
relating to this issue had not reached a 
sufficiently advanced position to allow for 
the recognition of a contingent asset to 
reflect any potential recovery. Accordingly, 
the rectification costs incurred, amounting 
to £0.8m, have been taken to the income 
statement in full and any recovery will be 
reflected as and when received. 
Gain on settlement of compensation claims
The group has now settled all outstanding 
claims with the DoH for the terminated 
West Midlands diagnostics contract and 
abortive costs for Phase 2 ISTC projects. 
The settlement reached with respect to 
the last of these claims has resulted in an 
accounting gain of £2.3m being reported 
in the current year. However, this gain 
relates to a Phase 2 ISTC scheme that had 
been bid for by Mercury Health before its 
acquisition by Care UK in April 2007. A fair 
value adjustment of £2.4m was made on 
the acquisition of Mercury Health in respect 
of the receivable relating to this item, given 
the substantial doubts regarding its 
recoverability that existed at that time.
taxation
The group’s headline rate of tax for 2009 
is 32.8%; the equivalent rate in 2008 is 
not considered to be a relevant comparator 
because of the distortion arising from the 
impairment charges recognised in that year. 
The headline tax charge is measured against 
total pre-tax profit and includes the deferred 
tax credit accounted for under IAS 12, which 
arises in respect of the amortisation and 
impairment of other intangible assets recorded 
in the income statement. The more significant 
tax measure is the underlying tax rate that 
reflects the tax charge applying to the 
adjusted profit before taxation. In 2009 this 
rate was 31.3% (2008: 33.7%). Although 
the underlying rate remains above the 
statutory rate of 28%, mainly as a result 
of the proportion of the group’s capital 
expenditure that is non-qualifying for tax 
purposes, it has reduced from the prior year 
as a result of a review of the level of capital 
allowances claimed, which has resulted in 
an improvement in the proportion of capital 
expenditure classified as qualifying.
Earnings per share
Adjusted basic earnings per share were 
31.46p (2008: 27.92p), an increase of 
13%. The total basic earnings per share 
were 23.04p (2008: loss per share of 
4.98p). Adjusted diluted earnings per share 
were 31.24p (2008: 27.92p), an increase 
of 12%, and the total diluted earnings per 
share were 22.87p (2008: loss per share 
of 4.98p).
Dividends
The board is proposing a final dividend of 
3.40p per share (2008: 3.10p), which will 
be paid on 17 February 2010 to shareholders 
on the Register on 22 January 2010.

Dividends continued
If approved by shareholders, this 
would result in a total dividend in respect 
of the year of 4.85p (2008: 4.43p) when 
added to the interim dividend of 1.45p per 
share (2008: 1.33p) paid in July 2009.
Compensation claims
In the 2009 interim results we reported 
that we had agreed a mutually satisfactory 
full and final settlement with the DoH for 
the group’s compensation claim raised 
following the DoH’s voluntary termination 
of the West Midlands diagnostics contract. 
The final compensation payment was 
received as expected in the second half 
of the year. We also reported in the interim 
results that we had agreed settlements 
for three of the four compensation claims 
that were submitted for abortive bid and 
development costs for Phase 2 ISTC contracts 
and that we expected to agree a settlement 
for the final claim in the second half of the 
year. It is pleasing to report that the fourth 
such claim was agreed as expected during 
the second half and that all outstanding 
claim amounts were paid by the DoH before 
the year end. There are now no remaining 
outstanding claims with the DoH.
Financing, treasury and cash flow
Total net debt reduced substantially 
during the period by £23.9m to £156.3m. 
The total borrowing facilities available to 
the group at the period end amounted to 
£262.4m. All but £3.0m of this is available 
under committed facilities with £216.3m 
under the syndicated group facility and the 
balance of £43.1m under the non-recourse 
facilities set up to fund the Wave 1 ISTC 
programme. At 30 September 2009 a total 
of £170.7m of the syndicated facility was 
being utilised, including £11.4m of 
performance bonds not classified as net 
debt, and the total funding headroom 
available to the group, including cash, 
amounted to over £94m. The group 
remains comfortably within its key 
covenants under the syndicated facility, 
which is committed until February 2015.

19 Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2009 reports.careuk.com/2009
Adjusted operating cash flow for the 
year was £58.1m, an increase of 24% over 
the equivalent figure in 2008 of £46.9m. 
This represents a cash conversion ratio, 
measured against adjusted operating profit 
excluding share of profit of joint venture, 
of 149% (2008: 147%).
Net stakeholder cash flows (interest, tax, 
dividends and equity issues) represented 
a net outflow of £19.3m (2008: £17.8m). 
Maintenance and infrastructure capital 
expenditure absorbed £9.6m (2008: 
£6.2m), disposal proceeds were £12.5m 
(2008: £1.8m); in 2008 loan repayments 
totalling £5.9m were received from PHG 
prior to the group’s acquisition of the 50% 
of the business not previously owned. The 
disposals proceeds figure in 2009 includes 
£10.9m of compensation proceeds received 
in relation to items previously accounted 
for as “property, plant and equipment”. 
The free cash flow available for discretionary 
investment consequently amounted to 
£41.7m (2008: £30.6m).
Against this available free cash flow 
the discretionary investment in the year 
in new services amounted to £17.1m 
(2008: £14.9m), comprising capital 
expenditure of £17.0m (2008: £10.5m) 
and cash consideration for the acquisition 
of businesses in prior years of £0.1m 
(2008: £4.4m). 
The group continues to follow a policy of 
having a high proportion of its borrowings 
subject to interest rate hedging arrangements. 
At 30 September 2009 the total drawn debt, 
excluding cash and cash equivalents and 
finance leases, was £202.3m comprising 
£159.2m under the group’s syndicated 
facility and £43.1m under the ring-fenced 
non-recourse facilities that finance the 
Wave 1 ISTC programme. Of this, a total of 
£150.6m was subject to effective hedging 
arrangements with £107.6m swapped into 
fixed rates with an average life of 4.2 years 
and an average LIBOR rate of 4.94%, 
and £43.0m in “collar” arrangements with 
an average life of 3.8 years, an average 
LIBOR floor of 4.14% and an average LIBOR 
cap of 5.75%. The group has considered 
alternative structures to replace some or all 
of these structures given current LIBOR rates 
but has currently concluded that none of 
these alternatives are currently sufficiently 
attractive to break the existing position.
Future changes to adopted iFRs
The european Union endorsed IFRIC 12 
“Service Concession Arrangements” on 
25 March 2009 and this interpretation 
is mandatory for accounting periods 
commencing after that date. Consequently, 
this standard will apply to Care UK in 2010 
and the group’s evaluation, supported by 
the group’s auditor, is that IFRIC 12 applies 
both to the majority of the group’s Wave 1 
ISTC contracts as well as to certain PFI 
contracts in the Residential Care division.
IFRS generally is subject to ongoing 
review and revision by the International 
Accounting Standards Board and subsequent 
endorsement by the eU. Care UK continues 
to monitor any proposed changes to IFRS 
and will both assess how best practice develops 
as well as gauge the impact of any changes. 
Shareholders will continue to be kept 
informed as to how such changes may 
impact the group’s financial statements.

The directors present their report, together with the audited financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2009. 
Principal activities, trading review and future prospects
The group’s principal activities comprise the provision of a range of health and social care solutions primarily to various public sector purchasers.
A general review of the operations of the group and its future prospects is included in the Chairman’s statement, Chief Executive’s review and 
financial review on pages 4 to 19.
Results and dividends
The consolidated income statement is set out on page 36. The profit for the year is £14.1m (2008: £2.9m loss). Other movements are set out 
in the statement of recognised income and expense on page 37, movements in reserves are shown in note 20 of the financial statements. 
The Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”) used by the group to measure its own performance are revenue, adjusted operating profit, adjusted earnings 
per share, operating cash flow and net debt. The figures for the year ended 30 September 2009 are set out in the highlights on pages 1, 17 and 18 
together with the figures for the previous year and are discussed in the financial review on pages 16 to 19. At divisional level the KPIs include divisional 
revenue, adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating margin and, depending on the specific division, bed numbers and occupancy, hours of care 
provided, procedures delivered, forward contracted revenue and growth, both organically and by acquisition. The KPIs for each division are discussed 
in the Chief Executive’s review on pages 6 to 14.
The directors recommend the payment of a final dividend of 3.40p per share (2008: 3.10p), making a total dividend for the year of 4.85p per share 
(2008: 4.43p), amounting to £3.0m (2008: £2.5m). The final dividend will, subject to shareholders’ approval, be paid on 17 February 2010 to 
shareholders on the Register at 22 January 2010. The final dividend proposed was not included as a liability as at 30 September 2009, in accordance 
with IAS 10 “Events After the Balance Sheet Date”.
Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”)
The nature of Care UK’s services mean that the group is driven by a commitment to provide high quality care to patients and service users. Underpinning 
this is a belief that to be a socially responsible organisation also requires engagement with staff and the wider community of stakeholders in defining 
how the group behaves and operates.
Our CSR strategy
We are currently establishing a CSR leadership team in order to identify priorities and best practice from across the public and private sectors. 
This leadership team will consist of representatives from our Health and Social Care divisions, property services and human resources who will 
work together to evaluate and design the most suitable approach for our business. We view CSR in the wider context of sustainability not only 
in terms of environmental sustainability but also in terms of the sustainability of the wider economy and society.
In regards to our “carbon footprint”, Care UK is assessing the current NHS carbon reduction strategy as a benchmarking tool. This strategy, detailed 
in the “Saving Carbon, Improving Health” paper, requires the NHS to reduce its carbon emissions by 10% (from 2007 levels) by 2015. The exact targets 
for carbon reduction and timescales for any similar Care UK strategy will be developed by the CSR leadership team and will be agreed at both executive 
and board levels.
Our key CSR components
Human resources
At a corporate level, “Project Rainbow”, our quality and diversity programme, has now been completed and its outcomes have informed the 
“Fulfilling Lives” project.
At a local level, a partnership has been established between our Learning Disabilities (Scotland) services, the local Jobcentre Plus and Celtic and 
Rangers Football clubs. The “Support Employment” programme is designed to get the long-term unemployed back into work. Skills such as team work, 
communication and organisational skills are developed over a ten-week training course. Learning Disabilities Scotland has recently employed one 
individual that has come through this programme and he is now a valued and highly motivated employee who is undertaking his S/NVQ III.
Working with charities 
We continue to support a range of charities including palliative care, cancer support, children’s charities, the armed forces, specific conditions 
such as diabetes and alzheimers and many local institutions.

Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) continued
Our key CSR components continued
Energy use 
Work continues to develop our understanding of our carbon footprint in terms of business travel and energy use. The CSR leadership team will investigate 
innovative ways in which we can reduce unnecessary travel and monitor and reduce our energy use and waste. New resources are available to limit 
business mileage with the four main Care UK offices now equipped with video conferencing equipment. 
Supply chain and contractors 
We are actively investigating the environmental impact of our key partners and suppliers, using questionnaires to collate information regarding supplier 
CSR arrangements, with a particular focus on environmental impacts.
Clinical governance
During the past year the clinical governance framework has been strengthened across all divisions within Care UK and is focussed on the three objectives 
of ensuring safety, effectiveness and good patient experience in line with the NHS commissioned Darzi report “High Quality Care For All” published 
in June 2008. 
As the CQC begins its role in earnest, the clinical governance agenda has been focussed on greater self-regulation and providing the evidence base for 
person-centred care, which responds to the user’s voice and experience to continuously improve the quality of care delivered. A good example of this 
is in Specialist Care Services, who have installed a suite of specially enabled PCs in the Learning Disabilities independent supported living offices, where 
service users and staff can produce their own symbol-supported materials.
Regarding health care associated infections, a key measure of quality, Care UK continues to have an excellent record of low rates of infection. There have 
been no cases of mRSA bacteraemia acquired in any unit.
more information about the Clinical Governance arrangements within Care UK can be found in the Care UK Annual Clinical Governance Report, 
which can be found on the Care UK website www.careuk.com.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The board has overall responsibility for the group’s approach to assessing risk and recognises that creating value is the reward for taking, and accepting, 
risk. Executive management implements the board’s policies on risk and control and presents assurance on compliance with these policies. The external 
auditor and central compliance functions, such as internal audit, clinical governance and health and safety, which have group-wide remits, provide 
further independent assurance to the board. This system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failing to achieve corporate objectives. 
Accordingly, it can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Further information is provided on internal controls in the report on corporate governance on page 27 and on accounting estimates and judgements 
in the accounting policies section of these financial statements.
Loss of revenue from contracts with UK Local Authorities, PCTs and other NHS trusts
A substantial proportion of the group’s revenue derives from publicly funded bodies such as Local Authorities, PCTs and other NHS Trusts. The group 
expects to continue to rely on the ability and willingness of Local Authorities, PCTs and other NHS Trusts to pay for the group’s services. There are risks 
that either budget constraints or other financial pressures could cause such publicly funded bodies to allocate less money to the types of service that 
the group provides or that political or policy changes mean that fewer such services are contracted from independent sector providers. Also, in common 
with the majority of government-funded service providers, most of the group’s price changes take effect annually on 1 April. Around 40% of the group’s 
revenue is linked to general inflation indices such as the Retail Price Index (“RPI”) or RPI minus mortgage interest payments (“RPIX”). 
ISTC post-contract continuity
This risk is discussed in the Chief Executive’s review on page 13 of this report.
_6_CUK_ar09_section2_governance.indd   2 18/12/2009   14:53:20 24 Care UK Plc Annual report and accounts 2009 reports.careuk.com/2009
REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS CONTINUED
Principal risks and uncertainties continued
Failure to comply with regulation and increased regulatory costs
All of the group’s services are subject to a high level of regulation by various regulatory bodies. New regulations may be introduced that could impose 
increased costs on the group’s operations. The group is unable to predict the content of new legislation and regulations and their effect on its business. 
Whilst the group would seek to recover such costs from its customers, there can be no assurance that the group’s operations will not be adversely 
affected by regulatory developments.
Inspections by regulators are carried out on both an announced and unannounced basis dependent on the specific regulatory provisions relating to 
different care services. The failure to comply with Government regulations, the receipt of a negative report that leads to a determination of regulatory 
non-compliance or the failure of the group to cure any defect noted in an inspection report could result in the revocation of the registration of any 
service or a decrease in, or cessation of, the services provided by the group. Regulatory action could also result in the group deciding to cease providing 
a service or close a particular service because of negative publicity. In addition, regulatory action in relation to one or more of the group’s services or 
the group itself, regardless of the merit or the eventual outcome, may have a material adverse effect upon the group’s reputation and its ability to 
attract and/or retain customers and/or service users, expand its business or seek registrations for new services, either nationally or within the area 
in which the service which is subject to the regulatory action is located.
The group conducts regular internal governance audits of safety and compliance with regulatory requirements.
Negative publicity
many of the group’s service users, particularly those within the Social Care businesses, are considered as vulnerable and often require substantial 
supervision. There is a risk that one or more service users could be harmed by one or more of the group’s employees, either intentionally or through 
negligence, or by accident. A serious incident involving harm to one or more service users could result in negative publicity as could a similar incident 
relating to the provision of health care services. Any such negative publicity or harm to the group’s reputation could impact on the scale of the group’s 
services, thereby adversely affecting the group’s results of operations, growth prospects and financial condition.
The group carries out employment reference procedures and detailed multi-level business review processes. The group also deploys public relations 
resources to manage both positive and potential negative news.
The group maintains appropriate liability insurance to cover large claims arising from lawsuits alleging negligence, malpractice or mistreatment.
Multi-year contracts
The group undertakes multi-year contracts. This exposes the businesses to the risks of: 
U  increases in costs, including wage inflation, attributable to such contracts beyond those anticipated and provided for within such contracts 
at the time they are entered into; 
U being bound to fulfil an onerous contract as a result of inaccurate pricing and forecasting by the group; and
U increases in cost that are not met through corresponding attributable increases in revenues from such contracts;
unless, and to the extent that, such increases are taken into account in periodic benchmarking and/or market testing where included in such contracts. 
Any such losses may affect the group’s future revenues and profitability in the relevant businesses.
Contracts of significance
The group is party to significant contracts with UK Local Authorities, PCTs, other NHS Trusts and providers of its debt financing. These contracts are 
discussed in detail in the Chairman’s statement, Chief Executive’s review and the financial review on pages 4 to 19.
financial risk management
Refer to note 22 for disclosure of the group’s financial risk management policies and procedures.
Charitable and political donations
The group supports a number of charities through a community support scheme. During the year it made charitable donations of £17,000 
(2008: £19,000). No political donations were made in the year (2008: £nil).

Statement on payment of suppliers 
The company and group do not follow a specific code or statement on payment practice. However, it is the company’s and group’s policy to pay its 
suppliers in accordance with the payment terms agreed at the outset of the relationship providing the supplier adheres to its obligations. The significant 
expenses incurred by the company relate to staff costs, depreciation charges and finance charges, therefore disclosure of the number of billing days 
outstanding to suppliers by the company is not relevant.
Auditor
A resolution to reappoint KPmG Audit Plc as auditor will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General meeting.
Authority to purchase shares
The authority given at last year’s Annual General meeting of the company held on 11 February 2009 for the company to purchase in the market 
6,154,910 of its shares, representing approximately 10% of the issued share capital, expires on 10 February 2010. This authority was not used during 
the year and shareholders will be asked to give a similar authority at the forthcoming Annual General meeting.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS CONTINUED
Annual General Meeting
The notice of the Annual General meeting is set out on pages 83 and 84. The attention of shareholders is drawn to the notes forming part of the notice 
of the Annual General meeting.
Share capital and control
The following information is given pursuant to Section 992 of the Companies Act 2006.
There are no restrictions on the voting rights attached to the company’s ordinary shares or the transfer of securities in the company. No person 
holds securities in the company carrying special rights with regard to control of the company. Further details of the rights, restrictions and obligations 
attaching to the share capital of the company, including voting rights, are contained in the company’s Articles of Association. The Articles of Association 
may only be changed with the agreement of shareholders. Shares acquired through the company’s Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) and SAyE schemes 
rank pari passu with shares in issue and have no special rights.
On a takeover, awards to directors and employees under the company’s share schemes may vest.
The company is party to significant agreements with UK Local Authorities, PCTs, other NHS Trusts and providers of debt finance that would take effect, 
alter or terminate upon a change of control following a takeover bid.
Going concern
As discussed in the financial review on pages 16 to 19 the group had borrowing facilities available at the period end of £262.4m. All but £3.0m of this 
is available under committed facilities. At 30 September 2009 the group had total funding headroom of over £94m, including £45.8m of cash held, 
which it considers more than sufficient to fund current development plans.
Approval of report
The directors who held office at the date of approval of this directors’ report confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the company’s auditor is unaware and each director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a director to make 
himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the company’s auditor is aware of that information.
This report was approved by order of the board.

FOR THE yEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEmBER 2009
The directors acknowledge the principles set out in the Combined Code issued in 2006 by the Committee on Corporate Governance and intend 
to comply with the main provisions thereof. The company has complied with the provisions of the Combined Code throughout the year.
The company applies the principles of the Combined Code in the following ways:
internal control
The directors are responsible for the group’s system of internal controls and for reviewing its effectiveness. The internal control systems are designed 
to meet the group’s particular needs and manage the risks to which it is exposed, and by its nature can only provide reasonable, but not absolute, 
assurance against misstatement or loss.
The Combined Code requires that the directors review the effectiveness of the group’s system of internal controls. This requirement extends this review 
to cover all controls, including:
U financial;
U operational;
U compliance; and
U risk management.
The directors confirm that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the risks faced by the group, that has been in place 
for the year under review, and that this process is regularly reviewed by the directors, and accords with the Turnbull guidance.
The group operates in the care sector, one of the most closely monitored and regulated areas of business. Its services are subject to external inspections 
by registration and other authorities, which are followed up by publicly available reports. It also regularly conducts its own internal inspections.
With regard to financial matters, the group operates within a control environment, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the safeguarding 
of assets against unauthorised use or disposition, the maintenance of proper accounting records and the reliability of financial information used within 
the business or for publication. 
Key established procedures are:
U the definition of the organisation structure and the appropriate delegation of responsibility to operational management;
U the definition of authorisation limits, both financial and otherwise;
U written operational procedures;
U  a system of financial reporting encompassing an annual budget, updated forecasts and the monthly reporting of actual results measured against 
both budget and forecast; and
U  the regular assessment of risks facing the business and the reporting of operational performance to the board, including internal and external 
clinical audit reports.
The group’s Finance Director oversees the group’s risk assessment process. The senior management of the operating divisions regularly reviews the systems 
of internal control in their respective divisions, which are supported by assessments of key business risks, controls and resulting exposures, and confirms 
its compliance with them. These assessments are reviewed by the Finance Director and are subsequently reported to the group Executive Committee 
and the Audit Committee. 
The Audit Committee assists the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, primarily reviewing the systems of internal control and risk management, 
and the audit process. The external auditor attends all relevant meetings.
The group has in place a formal internal audit function. The function reports to the Finance Director but with direct access to the Audit Committee. 
The Audit Committee approves the annual internal audit strategy and plan and approves the amount of resources allocated to the internal audit function.
The directors confirm that they have reviewed the effectiveness of the group’s system of internal controls utilising, inter alia, the procedures identified above.

REPORT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED
Going concern
After making enquiries the directors, at the time of approving the financial statements, have formed the judgement that the group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the financial statements.
The statement of directors’ responsibilities for preparing the financial statements is set out on page 35. 
the board of directors
At 30 September 2009 the board comprised the non-executive Chairman, the Chief Executive, the Finance Director, the managing Director of Social Care 
and three non-executive directors. The directors’ biographies appear on pages 20 and 21 and detail their experience ensuring an effective board 
to lead and manage the group. All of the non-executive directors, other than the Chairman, are considered by the board as being independent, 
and michael Averill has been identified as the Senior Independent Director.
The non-executive directors have made arrangements to meet at least annually without the Chairman present, in order to review and evaluate 
the performance of the board, its principal committees and the Chairman. The non-executive directors seek, and take into account, the views 
of the Chief Executive in carrying out this review.
All directors have access to the Company Secretary and may take independent advice at the group’s expense. The board meets regularly and has adopted 
a schedule of matters reserved for its decision. The board has established three committees with defined terms of reference as detailed below. The terms 
of reference of each of these committees are available on our website, www.careuk.com.
Ten board meetings were held during the year. Attendance at these meetings is disclosed on page 29 of this annual report.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by James Strachan and also comprises michael Averill and miles Roberts. The Committee recommends the 
remuneration of the executive directors, including the granting of share awards and service contracts. The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
will be available at the Annual General meeting on 10 February 2010 to answer any questions regarding remuneration. The directors’ remuneration 
report appears on pages 30 to 34.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee comprises John Nash, miles Roberts, James Strachan, michael Averill and mike Parish and is chaired by John Nash. 
The principal function of the Committee is to lead the process for board appointments by reviewing at least annually the structure, size and composition 
of the board and making recommendations with regard to any changes. This includes evaluation of the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on 
the board and an annual review of the time required from, and performance evaluation of, non-executive directors. In doing so the Committee gives 
full consideration to succession planning in the context of the challenges and opportunities facing the group.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by miles Roberts and also comprises michael Averill. Fritz Ternofsky was also a member of the Committee until his 
retirement. A further member of the Committee will be appointed following the recruitment of another non-executive director. The Committee has 
direct access to the group’s external and internal auditor and liaises with executive management to review the effectiveness of internal controls.
Under its terms of reference, the Audit Committee monitors the integrity of the group’s financial statements. The Committee is responsible for monitoring 
the effectiveness of the external audit process and making recommendations to the board in relation to the appointment, reappointment and remuneration 
of the external auditor. It is responsible for ensuring that an appropriate relationship between the group and the external auditor is maintained, including 
reviewing non-audit services and fees. The group has agreed a policy on non-audit work, which sets out monetary limits for work that may be undertaken 
by the external auditor, in order to safeguard audit independence. The Committee also reviews annually the group’s systems of internal control and the 
processes for monitoring and evaluating the risks facing the group. The Committee reviews its terms of reference and its effectiveness annually and 
recommends to the board any changes required as a result of the review.

U reviewing an annual report on the group’s systems of internal control and its effectiveness and reporting to the board on the results of the review.
Relations with shareholders
The board understands the need for communication with both institutional and private shareholders. In addition to general presentations after the 
publication of the group’s interim and final results, the Chief Executive and Finance Director meet regularly with fund managers, analysts and institutional 
investors. The company’s Annual General meeting provides a forum for all shareholders to attend and put questions to the board. All resolutions are

This report explains how the company has applied the principles in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance that relate to the directors’ 
remuneration. It will be submitted to the forthcoming Annual General meeting for approval.
unaudited information
Composition and role of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (“the Committee”) is chaired by James Strachan and also comprises michael Averill and miles Roberts. Fritz Ternofsky 
also served as a member of the Committee until he stood down from the board on 31 may 2009. All members of the Committee are independent 
non-executive directors. The principal function of the Committee is to determine and agree with the board on all aspects of the remuneration package 
of the group Chairman, the executive directors and those members of the group’s executive management who report to the Chief Executive and 
who are not executive directors.
The Committee has access to advice provided by the Chief Executive and the Group Human Resources Director and also receives advice from Hewitt 
New Bridge Street Consultants LLP . Hewitt New Bridge Street provides no other services to the company. No director or senior executive is involved in 
any matter relating to their own remuneration. The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the company’s website and on request from the 
Company Secretary. 
Framework and policy on executive directors’ remuneration
The policy of the Committee is to ensure that the remuneration packages offered to the executive directors are competitive and designed to attract, 
retain and motivate executive directors and senior executives of a high calibre. In addition, the performance linked elements are designed to ensure that 
the executives are aligned to the business strategy and the interests of shareholders. Accordingly, a significant proportion of the remuneration package 
depends on the attainment of certain objectives, both short and long-term. These packages are reviewed regularly and independent advice is taken 
where appropriate. In considering the remuneration policy for executive directors, pay and conditions in the workforce generally are taken into account. 
There have been no significant changes to the policy for the 2009 financial year.
Basic salary
The Committee meets at least once a year in order to consider and set the annual salaries for executive directors. Remuneration is considered with 
regard to personal performance and independently compiled salary summary information, and is commensurate with their responsibilities and experience. 
The Committee also recognises the policy adopted generally regarding remuneration across the group in determining the appropriate arrangements 
for senior executives. During the year to 30 September 2009 the base salary levels were increased by 3.5% and 10.0% for the Chief Executive and 
Finance Director respectively. These rises were considered appropriate recognising the performance of the company and overall market relativities. 
In particular, for the Finance Director this increase was the second part of a two stage increase agreed in 2007 to move his salary and total pay 
to a broadly mid-market position. No base salary increases have been awarded in respect of salary payable for the year commencing 1 October 2009.
Incentive arrangements
Annual performance related bonuses
Key senior executives participate in an annual bonus plan under which a maximum of 75% of base salary may be earned. For 75% of the bonus 
potential, a profit before tax target range is set, with maximum bonus payable only for the achievement of a stretching level of performance in relation 
to the target. The remaining 25% of the annual bonus potential comprises Strategic Enhancement Targets, which take the form of a number of key 
strategic objectives for each executive to individually achieve. The achievement of each of these performance conditions has a strong link to improvement 
in company financial performance.
One-third of the total annual bonus is in the form of deferred shares in the company, which must be held for at least two further years and are 
only awarded subject to continued employment of the executive over the deferral period. A Deferred Share Bonus Plan is in place to administer 
these arrangements.
The Committee considers the annual bonus plan to be market-competitive, which provides a significant potential reward for the achievement 
of excellent operating performance, better retention and greater alignment of interest between executives and shareholders. In assessing the 
performance criteria and resultant levels of bonus payment, the Committee may exercise a limited degree of discretion to ensure that there is 
an appropriate overall link between reward and company performance.
No bonus payments are pensionable. 
LTIP
Under the terms of the LTIP , company shares may be conditionally awarded each year to participants, on a discretionary basis, subject to a maximum 
of 120% of base salary. Awards to participants vest after a three-year period subject to the satisfaction of performance criteria and continued service. 
Awards during the 2010 financial year will be made in relation to shares worth 120% of base salary for the Chief Executive, 100% of base salary 
for the Finance Director and the managing Director of Social Care and 75% of base salary for other participants.

unaudited information continued
Incentive arrangements continued
LTIP continued
Awards to the Chief Executive and the Finance Director are subject to two performance conditions, the scales relating to which are determined 
annually by the Committee. For the awards made in the 2010 financial year the criteria are (a) growth in Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) and (b) Return 
On Capital Employed (“ROCE”), which will each apply independently to half of the award. ROCE is calculated as operating profit divided by average 
capital employed, which is defined as net assets plus net debt less assets in the course of construction. EPS will be determined on the basis of adjusted 
earnings per share as reported in the group’s financial statements. ROCE and EPS growth are measured over a fixed three-year period. 
Awards to the managing Director of Social Care and to other divisional-based participants are equally divided into two elements. The first element 
is split into two equal components, which are measured against the group targets referred to above. The second element is also split into two equal 
components which are measured against division-specific profit and ROCE targets, consistent with the overall group measures. Due to the commercial 
sensitivity of these targets they will not be disclosed at the time of grant but they will be disclosed in the directors’ remuneration report immediately 
following the date the awards vest.
The Committee continues to believe that a blend of EPS and ROCE targets provides a balanced incentive, rewarding growth in profitability and a focus 
on capital employed and for divisional-based participants it is appropriate to have a blend of both group and divisional targets. 
The sliding scale of performance conditions for the group-based elements of awards to be made in the 2009/10 financial year are as follows:
Vesting level     EPS growth (compound over three years) ROCE (in year three)
Zero vesting     Below RPI +3.3% Below 13.3%
Vesting at 25%     At RPI +3.3%  At 13.3%
Vesting on a straight-line scale between 25% and 100%   Between RPI +6% and RPI +6.3% Between 13.3% and 14.5%
Vesting at 100%      At or above RPI +6.3% At or above 14.5%
The Committee remains committed to setting challenging targets and recognises the target ranges that have been set in previous years have been 
higher than in comparable FTSE businesses, which has led to there being only limited vesting under the LTIP . These target ranges are considered no less 
demanding than the target ranges applying to prior years’ awards, despite the actual growth ranges being lower, and the precise ranges have been 
determined after considering the company’s strategic plan over the next three years. In particular the Committee has taken account of the current 
uncertainty surrounding the continuity of Wave 1 ISTC contracts and the related changes in contract arrangements following the expiry of the initial 
contract periods.
Pensions
The group contributes to defined contribution personal pension schemes in respect of the executive directors. Company contributions for the executive 
directors are made at rates of 12.5% of salary for the Finance Director and the managing Director of Social Care and 15% of salary for the Chief Executive. 
None of the executive directors are members of any defined benefit pension scheme. The contributions paid in respect of the executive directors are 
detailed below.
Contracts of service and compensation for termination
It is the Committee’s policy that executive directors are employed on rolling contracts subject to twelve months’ notice from either party. The existing 
executive directors are employed on these terms. There is no provision in any executive director’s contract for predetermined compensation or liquidated 
damages in the event of early termination, but the company may make payments in lieu of notice at its discretion. The Committee would review each 
case of early termination individually in order to ensure compensation settlements are made which are appropriate to the circumstances.
The contract details for the executive directors are:

Paul Humphreys       8 Jul 02 12 months 12 months

Non-executive directors
Non-executive directors are appointed for an initial term of three years, which may be renewed for further terms of up to three years thereafter. As with executive 
directors, non-executives must stand for re-election at the first Annual General meeting following their appointment and at least every three years thereafter.

Non-executive directors continued
Non-executive directors’ fees are determined having regard to the need to attract individuals of the right calibre and experience, and the time 
and responsibilities entailed and the level of fees paid by companies of similar size. The remuneration of the group Chairman is determined by the 
Committee. The remuneration of the other non-executive directors is determined by the board within the limits set out in the Articles of Association. 
None of the non-executive directors receives any pension contribution or participates in any incentive scheme. All of the non-executive directors’ 
letters of appointment are for periods not exceeding three years and provide for early termination without compensation.
Non-executive directors are encouraged to build and maintain a shareholding equivalent in value to half of their annual fee.
The information provided until this point in the report has not been audited. The further disclosures set out below, with the exception of the

* The highest paid director for 2009 and 2008 was mike Parish.
The bonus payable in respect of the 2009 financial year was determined after considering qualitative aspects of management performance against targets 
set at the start of the year, which applied to 25% of the overall bonus potential. Targets were set around metrics such as an improvement in quality 
ratings, development and succession planning, risk control and cash management as relevant for different individuals. The profit before tax performance 
condition was not achieved. The bonuses payable to the Chief Executive and the Finance Director both represented amounts equivalent to 16% of salary.
Taxable benefits comprise travel allowance, car allowance, permanent health insurance and private medical insurance. The travel allowance was 
introduced during the year following the move of the corporate head office to London. 
Directors’ pensions 
Pension contributions to defined contribution schemes are detailed in the table on the following page. These contributions are subject to Hm Revenue 
and Customs limits. Where such limits would be exceeded, the remaining amount that would otherwise have been paid as a pension contribution 
is provided as a payment in lieu of pension benefits, at the discretion of the executive director. A payment of £58,219 (2008: £56,250) was made on 
this basis to mike Parish in lieu of pension benefits.

  Award four made on 22 November 2005 vested on the basis of the group’s results for the year to 30 September 2008. A total of 20.32% of this award vested, with the balance 
lapsing, as follows:
 U mike Parish – 16,995 shares vested with a market value of £59,143 at 30 September 2008.
 U Paul Humphreys – 7,399 shares vested with a market value of £25,748 at 30 September 2008.
  The award vested based on the EPS performance condition being achieved in part (RPI +12.1% pa growth compared to the required range of RPI +12%–22% pa). 
The ROCE-based half of the award lapsed. The achievement of the performance conditions was verified by the company’s auditor. Under the Scheme rules, the shares were 
deemed to vest on 30 September 2008, on which date the share price was 348p.

  Awards five, six and seven as detailed in the table above are subject to a range of EPS (compound growth over three years) and ROCE (in year three) performance conditions for 
the separate elements of each award. For award five, the range of EPS growth targets is RPI +12% pa at threshold and RPI +22% pa at maximum. The range for the ROCE target 
is 15% and 19.5%. 40% of the award vests for achievement of the threshold target. 
3
  For awards six and seven the range of EPS growth targets is RPI +6% pa compound growth at the threshold and RPI +15% compound growth at the maximum. The range for 
the ROCE target is 14% at the threshold and 17% at the maximum. In both cases, 25% of the award vests for achievement of the threshold target. 
  There is no opportunity to remeasure performance after the third year.
  Award five made on 8 December 2006 did not vest on the basis of the performance criteria not being achieved in relation to the group’s EPS and ROCE results for the year to 30 September 2009.

IN RESPECT OF THE REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS AND FINANCIAL STATEmENTS
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the group and parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they are required 
to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union (“EU”) and applicable law and have elected to 
prepare the parent company financial statements on the same basis. 
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the group and the parent company and of their profit or loss for that period.
In preparing each of the group and parent company financial statements, the directors are required to:
U select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
U make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
U state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU; and
U  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group and the parent company will 
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets 
of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a report of the directors, report on corporate governance 
and directors’ remuneration report that comply with that law and those regulations. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
directors’ responsibilities statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
U  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
U  the directors’ report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

aCCoUntinG poliCies
The significant accounting policies of the group and parent company are set out below.
The group’s annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2009 are prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted for use 
within the EU (“adopted IFr S”), International Financial r eporting Interpretations Committee (“IFr IC”) interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The directors have elected to prepare the parent company’s financial statements on the same basis.
Care UK Plc (“the company”) is a company domiciled in England and Wales. The consolidated financial statements of the company for the year ended 
30 September 2009 comprise the company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “group”).
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 10 December 2009.
(a) Statement of compliance
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with adopted IFRS.
(b) Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis or fair value as appropriate, except that certain land and buildings have 
previously been revalued and are stated at deemed cost.
Non-current assets held for sale are stated at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions 
are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the 
basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the 
financial statements, are disclosed in note (x) on pages 47 and 48.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which 
the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and 
future periods.
The accounting policies set out below and on the following pages have been applied consistently to all periods presented in the financial statements. 
The accounting policies have been applied consistently by group entities.
As described on page 26, the directors have concluded that it’s appropriate to prepare the financial statements using the going concern consumption.
(c) Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the company. Control exists when the company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial 
and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable 
or convertible are taken into account. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that 
control commences until the date that control ceased.
(ii) Joint ventures
Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the group has joint control, established by contractual agreement. The consolidated financial 
statements include the group’s share of the profits less losses of joint ventures in the consolidated income statement and its interest in their net assets 
in the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with the equity method of accounting.
(iii) Transactions eliminated upon consolidation
Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing 
the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with jointly controlled entities are eliminated to the extent of the 
group’s interest in the entity. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence 
of impairment. 
(d) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences 
arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
The functional currency of all the group entities is sterling.

(e) Financial instruments
(i) Non-derivative instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
Non-derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value. The group has no non-derivative financial instruments measured at fair value 
through profit or loss. Subsequent to initial recognition non-derivative financial instruments are measured as described below.
Accounting for cash and cash equivalents is discussed in note (k); interest-bearing borrowings in note (m); and finance income and expense in note (q)(iii). 
Other non-derivative financial instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
(ii) Derivative financial instruments
The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate risks arising from its financing activities. In accordance with 
its treasury policy, the group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. However, derivatives that do not qualify 
for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially and subsequently at fair value. The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss. However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature 
of the item being hedged. In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the group is required to document in advance the relationship between the item 
being hedged and the hedging instrument. The group is also required to demonstrate that the hedge is highly effective on an on-going basis. This 
effectiveness testing is reperformed at each period end to ensure the hedge remains highly effective.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount the group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking 
into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
(iii) Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, the effective part of any 
gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in equity. The associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and 
recognised in the income statement in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects profit or loss. The ineffective 
part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged 
transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy 
when the transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity 
is recognised immediately in the income statement.
(iv) Financial guarantee contracts
Where the company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its group, the company 
considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the company treats the guarantee contract as a 
contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
(f) Property, plant and equipment
(i) Owned assets
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Certain items of property that had been revalued to fair value prior to 1 october 2004, the date of transition to adopted IFrS, are measured 
on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount at the date of that revaluation less any subsequent depreciation and impairments. 
The last revaluation, to open market value, of the properties occurred in 1992.
Assets in the course of construction are carried in the financial statements at cost, taken from the most recent surveyor’s cost certificate received 
prior to the date of the financial statements.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant 
and equipment.
The cost of land and buildings includes both the costs of financing assets in the course of construction and other costs that are directly attributable 
to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Capitalisation 
of finance and other costs ceases when substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying asset for its intended use are complete.

ACCoUNTING poLICIES CoNTINUED
(f) Property, plant and equipment continued
(ii) Leased assets
Where the group enters into a lease which entails taking substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset, the lease is classified 
as a finance lease. The asset acquired by way of finance lease is stated at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of 
the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Future instalments under such leases, 
net of finance charges, are included within creditors.
All other leases are accounted for as operating leases.
(iii) Subsequent costs
The group recognises in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment the cost of replacing part of such an item when that cost 
is incurred if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured 
reliably. All other costs are recognised in the income statement, as an expense, as incurred.
(iv) Depreciation 
Depreciation is charged to the income statement to write off the cost, less estimated residual values, of property, plant and equipment by equal 
instalments over their estimated useful economic lives as follows:
Freehold land – no depreciation provided 
Freehold buildings – 25 to 50 years 
Long leasehold buildings – 50 years or, if shorter, the period of the lease or the associated contract 
Short leasehold buildings – the shorter of the period of the lease or the associated contract 
plant and machinery (as an integral part of property assets) – 25 years or, if shorter, the period of the lease 
motor vehicles – four years 
Furniture, fittings, medical equipment and office equipment – three to ten years
The residual value, if not insignificant, is reassessed annually.
(v) Pre-contract costs
Pre-contract costs include the costs attributable to a contract for the period from the date of securing the contract to the date at which financial close is 
achieved. The award of preferred bidder status is considered as the point at which it is probable that the contract has been secured, although contracts 
are individually reviewed in order to apply the most appropriate treatment. Costs that relate directly to a contract and which are incurred in this period 
are included as part of pre-contract costs where they can be separately identified and reliably measured. Such amounts are held within other debtors 
until such time as financial close of the contract is achieved, at which time they are transferred to assets in the course of construction.
(g) Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. Goodwill represents amounts arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries, 
associates and joint ventures, being the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration and associated costs and the fair values attributable to 
the net identifiable assets acquired. 
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to adopted IFrS has 
been retained at the previous UK GAAp amounts. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not subject to periodic amortisation but is tested 
annually for impairment. As permitted under IFrS 3 “Business Combinations”, the fair value of the assets acquired may be reassessed in the instance of 
further information arising within twelve months from the date of acquisition, provided the initial fair values were determined as provisional. 
Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised directly in the income statement.
(ii) Other intangible assets
other intangible assets that are acquired by the group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the income statement, as an expense, as incurred.

(g) Intangible assets continued
(iii) Amortisation
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are 
indefinite. Customer relationships are amortised over their estimated useful economic lives, which do not exceed ten years. Goodwill and intangible 
assets with an indefinite useful life are tested annually for impairment. Intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use over 
their estimated useful lives.
(iv) Impairment
The carrying amounts of goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether 
there is any impairment. The group also reviews the carrying amounts of its depreciable tangible and intangible assets to determine if there is any 
indication that an asset has suffered an impairment loss.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable 
amount of an asset is the greater of its net selling price and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to 
their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. 
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the 
asset belongs.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
(h) Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at fair value less provisions for impairment.
(i) Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at their fair value less impairment losses.
(j) inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, 
less the estimated selling expenses. The cost of inventories is based on a first-in first-out cost formula.
(k) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. Bank overdrafts that are repayable 
on demand and form an integral part of the group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose 
of the statement of cash flows.
(l) Share capital
(i) EBT shares
When share capital recognised as equity is acquired by the EBT, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised 
as a change in equity. Such shares are presented as a deduction from total equity.
(ii) Dividends
Final dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved by the company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recorded 
in the period in which they are paid.
(m) Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing 
borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over 
the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
(n) Employee benefits
The assets of all pension plans are held separately from those of the group, in independently administered managed funds.
(i) Defined contribution plans
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.

The group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have 
earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any 
plan assets is deducted. The discount rate applied is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity obligations 
approximating to the terms of the group’s obligations. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. 
All actuarial gains and losses as at 1 o ctober 2004, the date of transition to adopted IFr S, were recognised. In respect of actuarial gains and losses that 
have arisen subsequent to 1 october 2004, the group recognises all actuarial gains and losses in the statement of recognised income and expense.
(iii) Share-based payment transactions
The group operates a number of share option schemes. The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding 
increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to 
the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured based on the Black-Scholes formula, taking into account the terms and conditions upon 
which the instruments were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of share options that are expected to vest.
The group’s LTIp is managed by a separately administered EBT. Liabilities of the EBT are guaranteed by the company and the assets of the EBT 
mainly comprise shares in the company. The assets, liabilities, income and costs of the EBT have been included in the consolidated and company’s 
financial statements. 
Where the parent company awards a subsidiary’s employees options over its own shares, this is treated as a capital contribution and added to the 
cost of the parent company’s investment in its subsidiary.
(o) Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are stated at cost.
(p) Revenue
(i) Services rendered
revenue represents the fair value of sales and services to third party customers, stated net of any applicable value added tax, rebates and discounts. 
The stage of completion as defined in IAS 18 “Revenue” is determined by reference to the point at which the group has met its principal contractual 
obligations. revenue is recognised as follows:
U Social Care
  residential long-term contracts – revenue is recognised on a time-elapsed basis as the principal contractual obligation is to provide bed capacity. 
Units of care under these contracts are typically provided on a daily basis and there is no obligation to carry forward any non-utilised capacity. 
  Residential spot purchase contracts – revenue is recognised when the group’s principal contractual obligation is fulfilled, that is typically when 
a service user has received care services from the group, which are usually provided on a daily basis.
  Community-based services – revenue is recognised only on the actual delivery of care services. revenue attributable to any unused capacity under 
“block” contracts, where the group is able to submit invoices for contracted services that have not actually been provided, is only recognised when 
the recovery of income is considered virtually certain.
U Health Care
  Capacity-related contracts – revenue is recognised on a time-elapsed basis as the principal contractual obligation is to provide an agreed level 
of capacity over a fixed term. There is no obligation under these contracts to carry forward non-utilised capacity.
  Service-related contracts – revenue is recognised only on the delivery of services, either surgical procedures or other treatments, under contractual 
obligations that are intended to provide a pre-determined volume of services over a fixed term. Revenue attributable to unused capacity is only 
recognised when recovery of income is considered virtually certain. 
In all businesses when revenue is invoiced in advance this is accounted for as deferred income until the service is provided. 
(ii) Government grants
Capital based Government grants are included within accruals and deferred income in the balance sheet and credited to the income statement over 
the estimated useful economic lives of the assets to which they relate. Grants that compensate the group for expenses incurred are recognised as 
revenue in the income statement on a systematic basis in the same periods in which the expenses are incurred.

(q) Expenses
(i) Operating lease payments
payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives 
received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
(ii) Finance lease payments
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated 
to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
(iii) Net financing costs
Net financing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings calculated using the effective interest rate method, interest receivable on funds invested, 
foreign exchange gains and losses and gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement.
Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, using the effective interest method. The interest expense component of finance 
lease payments is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest rate method.
(r) Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the profit or loss for the year and comprises current and deferred taxation. Income tax is recognised in the income 
statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, 
together with any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the 
amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill not deductible for 
taxation purposes, and the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit. The amount of deferred tax 
provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be 
utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
(s) segment reporting
Care UK operates solely within the UK, hence no geographical segment disclosures are presented.
Segmental information is presented in respect of business segments, based upon management’s internal reporting structure. Further details are 
provided in note 1 to these financial statements.
(t) Non-current assets held for sale
Immediately before their classification as being held for sale, the measurement of the value of any such assets (and all assets and liabilities in a disposal 
group) is fair valued in accordance with applicable adopted IFRS. On their ensuing initial classification as being held for sale, non-current assets and 
disposal groups are recognised at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Impairment losses on the initial classification of non-current assets as being held for sale are included in profit or loss, including where there has been 
any revaluation of the asset. The same also applies to gains and losses on subsequent measurement.
(u) Non-GAAP performance measures 
The board believe that the “adjusted” profit and earnings per share measures provide additional useful information for the shareholders on the underlying 
performance of the business. These measures are consistent with how business performance is monitored internally. The adjusted operating profit is 
not a recognised profit measure under adopted IFRS and may not be directly comparable with “adjusted” profit measures used by other companies. 
The adjustments made to operating profit exclude “exceptional” income and charges, which are predominantly one-off in nature and therefore create 
volatility in reported earnings, and amortisation of intangible assets.
(v) New standards effective and applied in these financial statements
There were no new EU adopted standards, amendments to standards and interpretations effective for the year ended 30 September 2009 and 
applicable to these financial statements.

(w) New standards and interpretations not yet applied
The following new EU adopted standards, amendments to standards and interpretations were not effective for the year ended 30 September 2009, 
and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements:
(i)   IFr S 8 “o perating Segments” introduces the “management approach” to segment reporting. IFr S 8, which becomes mandatory for the group’s 
September 2010 financial statements, will require the disclosure of segment information based on the internal reports regularly reviewed by the 
board and executive in order to assess each segment’s performance and to allocate resources to them. Currently the group presents segment 
information in respect of its business segments (see note 1); these segments are not anticipated to change under the group’s management approach.
(ii)  IFrIC 12 “Service Concession Arrangements” was endorsed by the EU on 25 march 2009 and is effective for accounting periods that commence 
after that date. The group will first apply IFRIC 12 in its financial statements for the year ending 30 September 2010, including the interim results 
for the six months ending 31 march 2010. IFrIC 12 is required to be applied retrospectively and therefore the consolidated balance sheet as at 
1 october 2008 and the consolidated income statement for the year ended 30 September 2009 are both required to be restated. The group 
has established a project team to manage the implementation of IFrIC 12 within the group.
   IFrIC 12 applies to public-to-private service concession arrangements in which the public sector controls or regulates the services provided with the 
infrastructure and their prices, and controls any significant residual interest in the infrastructure. The group has identified a number of such arrangements 
in its health Care and residential Care divisions to which IFrIC 12 is applicable.
  prior to the adoption of IFrIC 12, the group’s accounting treatment for service concession arrangements can be summarised as follows:
  U infrastructure constructed or upgraded was capitalised as property, plant and equipment; and
  U  all contract derived revenue was recognised over the life of the service concession arrangement at the point when care services were performed 
in accordance with the group’s accounting policy for revenue recognition.
  The principal effects on the group’s financial statements will be that:
  U  revenue and operating profit will be separately recognised during the construction and operational phases of the service concession arrangement; and
  U  consideration receivable that relates to the construction phase of a contract will be recognised as a financial asset in the balance sheet rather 
than as “property, plant and equipment”.
  There is no impact on cash or the total profit that will ultimately be recognised throughout the life of the service concession arrangement.
  Further details are as set out below:
  U  Income recognition: revenue is required to be measured at the relative fair value of the consideration received or receivable on the constituent 
parts of the service concession arrangement, being the construction and operating phases. The group will therefore be required to recognise 
revenue and a related operating profit margin on the construction of the infrastructure.
  U  Asset recognition: 
    (a) The cost of infrastructure constructed or upgraded will be expensed to the income statement.
    (b)  The group will recognise, at fair value, consideration receivable from the grantor, which will be a public sector body, for construction services, 
as a financial asset and/or an intangible asset. A financial asset will be recognised when the group is entitled to receive an unconditional right 
to receive cash that is not dependent upon the extent of use of the infrastructure. Care UK anticipates that financial assets rather than intangible 
assets will be recognised on those service concession arrangements that were extant as at 30 September 2009.
      U  Borrowing costs: only where an intangible asset is recognised can borrowing costs be capitalised into the cost of that asset. previously 
the group capitalised borrowing costs into the cost of the service concession arrangement infrastructure in accordance with IAS 23 
“Borrowing Costs”. These costs will now be required to be taken to the income statement. The group will continue to capitalise borrowing 
costs on non-service concession arrangement infrastructure.
      U  Interest income: when a financial asset is recognised, interest income will be required to be recognised on that asset. Previously, the group 
did not recognise interest income on service concession arrangements. 
      U  Tax: there is not expected to be any material impact on the group’s tax position as a result of the adoption of IFrIC 12.

(w) New standards and interpretations not yet applied continued
(iii)  IFRIC 14 “The Limit of a Defined Benefit Asset” provides guidance on the amount of a pension asset that can be recognised as an asset. It concludes 
that refunds and reductions in contributions are recognisable as assets if they can be realised at some point during the life of the pension plan. 
The group does not consider this interpretation will have a material impact on the group’s financial position. It will be effective for the group’s 
September 2010 financial statements.
(iv)  Amendments to IAS 1 “presentation of Financial Statements: A revised presentation” proposes changing the content of the income statement 
and the statement of recognised income and expense and includes an opening balance sheet for all periods. It will be effective for the group’s 
September 2010 financial statements and will result in the renaming of the primary statements and the presentation of an opening balance sheet 
for the comparative period.
(v)   Amendment to IAS 23 “Borrowing Costs” removes the choice of treatment for borrowing costs. Under the revised standard borrowing costs 
must be capitalised where the criteria established are met. The group’s existing accounting policy is to capitalise such costs, therefore the revised 
standard is not expected to have an impact on the group’s future financial statements.
(vi)  Amendment to IAS 27 “Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements” revises the accounting for changes in the parent’s ownership interest 
in a subsidiary following the revision to IFRS 3 (see below). This will be effective for the group’s September 2010 financial statements.
(vii)  Amendment to IFRS 2 “Share-based Payment: Vesting Conditions and Cancellations” changes the definition of vesting conditions and clarifies 
the accounting treatment of cancellations by either parties. The definition of vesting conditions is now restricted to either service or performance 
conditions. Any other conditions will be non-vesting conditions and will be factored into the fair value at the grant date. These amendments will 
impact SAyE schemes. The group is currently considering the potential impact of this amendment. This will be effective for the group’s September 2010 
financial statements.
(viii)  Revised IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” revises several significant areas in accounting for acquisitions. It determines that the cost of investment 
should reflect the fair value of the consideration received by the vendor and hence acquisition expenses should be expensed as incurred. Pre-existing 
interests in a step acquisition must be remeasured to fair value when the acquirer obtains control with any resulting gain or loss being recognised in 
the income statement. The revised standard requires contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date, however subsequent 
revisions are recognised in the income statement. Retrospective application is not required. This standard will potentially have a significant impact on 
the group’s accounting for future acquisitions. This will be effective for the group’s September 2010 financial statements.
   IFrIC 13 “Customer Loyalty programmes”, IFrIC 15 “Agreements for the Construction of real Estate”, IFrIC 16 “hedges of Net Investment in 
a Foreign operation”, IFrIC 17 “Distributions of Non-cash Assets to owners”, IFrIC 18 “Transfer of Assets from Customers” and amendments 
to IAS 32 “puttable Financial Instruments”, IAS 39 “Eligible hedged Items” and IAS 1 “obligations Arising on Liquidation” will not have a material 
impact on the group.
(x) Significant sources of estimation uncertainty and critical accounting judgements in applying the group’s accounting policies
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the 
year then ended. management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under 
the circumstances. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Estimates are used in accounting for allowances for uncollectible receivables, depreciation, amortisation and impairment, share-based payments, pensions, 
taxes and contingencies. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the financial statements in 
the period that an adjustment is determined to be required.
management discussed with the Audit Committee the development, selection and disclosure of the group’s critical accounting policies and estimates 
and the application of these policies and estimates.
Significant accounting judgements in applying the group’s accounting policies have been applied by the group in order to prepare the consolidated 
financial statements with respect to the value of other intangible assets and goodwill (note 10), share-based payments (note 21), financial instruments 
(note 23) and pensions (note 24) and are described on the following page.

ACCoUNTING poLICIES CoNTINUED
(x) Significant sources of estimation uncertainty and critical accounting judgements in applying the group’s accounting policies continued
Intangible assets
The group uses forecast cash flow information and estimates of future growth to initially value other intangible assets, to assess whether goodwill 
and other intangible assets are impaired, and to determine the useful economic lives of its intangible assets. If the results of operations in a future 
period are adverse to the estimates used for impairment testing, an impairment charge may be triggered at that point, or a reduction in useful 
economic life may be required.
Share-based payments
The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share options has a significant impact upon magnitude of the charge recognised in the income 
statement. Details of the principal assumptions used in calculating the share-based payments expense are given in note 21. When a grant of share 
awards is made, management reviews the estimates and assumptions used and updates them accordingly.
Derivative financial instruments
The fair value of derivative financial statements is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged or a liability settled between willing parties in 
arm’s length transactions. The fair values of financial instruments are determined by reference to observable market prices where these are available 
and the market is active. Where market prices are not available or are unreliable because of poor liquidity, fair values are determined using valuation 
techniques including cash flow models which, to the extent possible, use observable market parameters. The process of calculating the fair value using 
valuation techniques may necessitate the estimation of certain pricing parameters, assumptions or model characteristics. Changes in assumptions about 
these factors could affect reported fair values of financial instruments.
Pensions
Details of the principal actuarial assumptions used in calculating the recognised liability for the defined benefit plans are given in note 24. Changes 
to the discount rate, mortality rates and actual return on plan assets may necessitate material adjustments to this liability in the future.

1. segment reporting
Segment information is presented in respect of the group’s business segments. The primary format, business segments, is based on the group’s 
management and internal reporting structure. Care UK operates solely within the UK, hence no geographical segment disclosures are presented.
Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arm’s length basis.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. 
Unallocated items comprise mainly interest-bearing loans, borrowings and expenses, corporation taxes and corporate assets and expenses.
Business segments
The group comprises the following main business segments:
U residential Care operates care homes for older people;
U Community Care supports people in their own homes, including older people and others with specialist needs;
U  Specialist Care includes the provision of care for individuals with learning disabilities or mental health needs and children’s residential 
and foster care; and
U health Care provides a range of primary and secondary care services.

Weighted average number of ordinary shares
The calculation of EpS is based on a weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period. The diluted EpS is based on a weighted 
average number of ordinary shares calculated in accordance with IAS 33, which assumes that all dilutive options will be exercised. The additional basic 
and diluted EpS use the same weighted average number of ordinary shares as the basic and diluted EpS.

The amortisation of intangible assets of £7.5m (2008: £5.0m) and impairment charge of £0.2m (2008: £15.9m) are both recognised within administrative 
expenses in the income statement.
Intangible assets comprise the value attributed to ongoing customer relationships within acquired businesses and are amortised over their estimated 
useful economic lives, which do not exceed ten years. The useful economic life is determined by reference to the life of the associated contract.
management believes that goodwill represents value to the group for which the recognition of a discrete intangible asset is not permitted.

10. Intangible assets continued
(a) Acquired intangible assets continued
In the prior year the following adjustments were made relating to the finalisation of fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of Mercury Health:
U fixed assets of £2.4m have been written off to give a revised fair value of £50.7m;
U accruals, including excess operating costs arising from the normalisation of patient waiting lists, were increased by £1.8m to £20.8m;
U the deferred tax provision was reduced by £0.8m in relation to the above revisions and the alignment with submitted tax computations;
U contingent consideration was increased by £1.1m to give revised total consideration of £32.8m; and
U goodwill increased by £4.5m as a consequence of the above adjustments. 
With the exception of the contingent consideration adjustment, the above adjustments were effected by way of a prior year adjustment as required by IFrS 3.
(b) Impairment charge
During the year ended 30 September 2009, the group reviewed all cash-generating units that contain goodwill for impairment in accordance with 
IFrS 3. The recoverable amount was determined by value-in-use. The discount rates used in each value-in-use calculation were based upon a risk 
adjusted pre-tax group weighted average cost of capital (2009: 5.25%; 2008: 7.23%) specific to the respective cash-generating unit. 
A goodwill impairment charge of £0.2m (2008: £13.9m) was recognised following an impairment review of the goodwill arising on acquisition 
of a small unit in the Specialist Care division (2008: mercury health).
(c) Impairment tests for cash-generating units containing goodwill
The following divisions have significant cash-generating units that have the following goodwill carrying values:
         2009 2008 
         £m £m
Community Care        19.1 19.1
Specialist Care        22.9 23.1
health Care        19.1 19.1
         61.1 61.3
All of the recoverable amounts are measured based on value-in-use. Those calculations use cash flow projections based on actual operating results 
and the budget and forecast business plan for the three years ending 30 September 2012. A further two years of projected cash flows are incorporated 
using an estimated annual growth rate and a terminal value is placed on the value of the annual cash flows. No adjustment is made for the projected 
terminal value of the net assets of the individual cash-generating unit.
The growth rate is consistent with the long-term average growth rate for the industry. The discount rates used in each value-in-use calculation were 
based upon division specific risk adjusted pre-tax cost of capital. The group pre-tax weighted average cost of capital used as the starting point for these 
tests was 5.25% (2008: 7.23%).

10. Intangible assets continued
(c) Impairment tests for cash-generating units containing goodwill continued
Community Care
The key assumptions in the value-in-use calculations are that forecast numbers of chargeable hours are met and hence that revenue and Earnings Before 
Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (“EBITDA”) projections are achieved. Cash flows for years one to five are derived from the current forecast 
budget and business plan. Thereafter no growth rate has been assumed. Cash flows for years one to three are derived from the current budget and 
forecast business plan.
Specialist Care
The key assumptions in the value-in-use calculations are that forecast occupancy levels are met and that revenue and EBITDA projections are achieved. 
Cash flows for years one to five are derived from the current forecast budget and business plan. Thereafter no growth rate has been assumed.
Health Care
The key assumptions in the value-in-use calculations are that forecast volumes of activity/patients treated are achieved and hence that forecast revenue 
and EBITDA projections are realised. Cash flows for years one to five are derived from the current forecast budget and business plan.
Assumptions
Whilst management is confident that its assumptions are appropriate in light of circumstances at the time of the review, it is possible that circumstances 
may change. The recoverable amounts calculated on the above basis significantly exceed the carrying values of the cash-generating units that include 
goodwill to the extent that the assumptions made would need to change by a significant amount to eliminate the surplus.
(d) Acquisitions
No acquisitions were made during the year ended 30 September 2009.
During the year ended 30 September 2008 the following businesses were acquired:
(i) Community Care

The fair values relating to the acquisition of phG were deemed provisional due to the scale and complexity of the transaction. In accordance with 
IFRS 3 a review of the fair value of assets and liabilities was completed before the first anniversary of the acquisition of PHG, on 1 August 2009, 
and no adjustments arose. 
The net profit (after attributable financial expenses and taxation) since their respective dates of acquisition, for the entities acquired during the 
financial year was:
          2008 
          £m
Community Care         0.4
health Care         2.1
If the above acquisitions had all occurred at the start of the financial year in which they were acquired, the group revenue and net profit would have been:
          2008 
          £m
revenue: group and share of joint venture        368.6

During the year a total of £0.1m (2008: £1.1m) contingent consideration was paid.

13. Trade and other receivables continued
(a) Current assets continued
The group has £3.9m trade and other receivables (2008: £12.7m) that are past due but not impaired. These relate primarily to Local Authorities, pCTs 
and other NHS Trusts for whom there is no history of default. These have not been provided for as there has not been a significant change in the credit 
quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable. The group does not hold any collateral over these balances. The ageing analysis of these 
receivables is as follows:
         2009 2008 
         £m £m
0–30 days        1.1 1.8
30–60 days        1.1 0.6
60–90 days        0.5 7.8
over 90 days        0.9 2.5
The group has trade and other receivables of £0.9m (2008: £2.6m) which are impaired and provided for. The ageing of these receivables is as follows:
         2009 2008 
         £m £m
0–30 days        — —
30–60 days        — —
60–90 days        — —
over 90 days        0.9 2.6
The group’s impairment provision has been calculated based upon the ageing profile of the receivables and any history of default with particular customers.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade and current other receivables are limited due to the nature of the group’s customer base.

19. Deferred tax liabilities
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using a tax rate of 28% (2008: 28%).
(a) Recognised deferred tax liabilities
Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of tax losses and other deductible temporary differences where it is probable that these assets 
will be recovered.
The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities (prior to the offsetting of balances within the same jurisdiction as permitted by IAS 12) during 
the period are shown below. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an 
intention to settle the balances net.

21. Share-based payments
(a) Share-based payment schemes
The group has the following share-based payment schemes:
(i) Number 2 Executive Scheme
The Number 2 Executive Scheme was initially an unapproved scheme. It was subsequently approved by hm Customs & revenue, although unapproved 
options were also granted under the scheme. This scheme was discontinued in 2003 in relation to new awards.
Options were granted with a fixed exercise price being not less than the market price of the shares under option on the date of grant. The options granted 
under this scheme are generally exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant. An employee generally has six months after 
leaving employment of the group to exercise any unlapsed options that have vested.
For the majority of options outstanding as at the year end the following performance conditions apply. The options granted are exercisable in three equal 
tranches, subject to the achievement of performance conditions, measured over a three-year period with the final tranche ending in the fifth year following 
the year of initial grant. The performance conditions for each tranche require that earnings per share for the previous three years must not be less than 
those for the base year increased by rpI +5% with yearly rests. All of the outstanding options have now fully vested. 
(ii) SAYE Scheme
Options are granted with a fixed exercise price. The exercise price is based on the average of middle market quotations of the shares under option for 
three days preceding the grant date less a discount of up to 20%. The options granted under this scheme generally become exercisable on the third 
anniversary of the commencement of the related savings contract. All employees who work more than 15 hours per week for any group company are 
eligible to participate in this scheme. The company anticipates making annual awards under this scheme. An employee generally has six months after 
leaving employment of the group to exercise any unlapsed options that have vested. 
(iii) Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)
o ptions have been granted as nil cost options under this scheme. The options granted under this scheme are generally exercisable at the end of 
the performance period and for six months thereafter. Awards under this scheme are reserved for employees at senior management level and above. 
If an employee leaves the employment of the group, a proportion of their award may be deemed to have vested, subject to satisfying any performance 
conditions and at the discretion of the remuneration Committee. The company anticipates making annual awards under this scheme.
Awards under the LTIp scheme are subject to two performance criteria, the scales relating to which will be determined annually by the remuneration 
Committee. Details of the performance criteria are further discussed in the directors’ remuneration report on pages 30 to 34.
(iv) Employee Share Option Scheme
The options were granted with a fixed exercise price being not less than the market price of the shares under option on the date of grant. The options 
granted will lapse on the third anniversary of the date of grant if the performance conditions have not been met. For the whole of the option to 
be capable of exercise the growth in the EpS of the company over the performance period must equal or exceed the growth in rpI by 12% per annum. 
If the growth in the EpS of the company over the performance period does not equal or exceed the growth in rpI by 12% per annum then the option 
will not be exercisable.
Awards under this scheme are available for all employees and directors with participation being at the discretion of the r emuneration Committee. 
If an employee leaves the employment of the group, a proportion of their award may be deemed to have vested, subject to satisfying any performance 
conditions and at the discretion of the remuneration Committee.

21. Share-based payments continued
(b) Share-based payment expense
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFrS 1 “First Time Adoption of IFrS”, the group has elected only to apply IFrS 2 “Share-based p ayment” 
to all relevant share-based payment transactions granted after 7 November 2002 but not fully vested or exercised by 30 September 2004.
All share-based payment transactions have been valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. No performance conditions were included in the 
fair value of the calculations. The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the year preceding the date of grant. The calculation of volatility 
uses a statistical methodology called generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity that incorporates the occurrence of volatility clustering. 
The expected life of the option is the average expected period to exercise. The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK Government bonds 
of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
The total income statement expense for the year relating to employee equity-settled share-based plans was £0.6m (2008: £0.4m). After deferred tax, 
the total charge was £0.6m (2008: £0.2m).

22. Financial risk management
The group’s activities and debt financing expose it to a variety of financial risks, the most significant of which are market risk (cash flow interest rate 
risk), credit risk and liquidity risk (changes in the debt market). The group’s overall risk management programme focusses on the unpredictability of 
financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the group’s financial performance. The group uses derivative financial instruments 
to hedge certain risk exposures, primarily instruments to fix interest rates.
It is, and has been throughout the year, the group’s policy that no trading of a speculative nature in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Financial risk management policies are approved by the board of directors and implemented by the Finance Director who receives regular reports from 
all operating divisions to enable prompt identification of financial risks so that appropriate actions may be taken. A group treasury objectives, strategy 
and policies paper sets out specific guidelines to manage interest rate and liquidity risk and the use of financial instruments to mitigate these risks.
(a) Market risk
(i) Cash flow interest rate risk
The group has significant short-term deposits; therefore the group’s income and cash flows are affected by changes in market interest rates. Short-term 
deposits are placed with financial institutions in accordance with the group’s treasury policy. Interest rates obtained on deposits are variable and linked 
to the inter-bank rate (“LIBOR”). At present the group does not hold any fixed interest rate deposits.
The group has significant long-term borrowings. Borrowings issued at a variable rate expose the group to further cash flow interest rate risk. The group 
uses interest rate swaps and collars to manage its exposure to floating rates. Floating rate liabilities bear interest rates based upon LIBOR. The interest 
rate swaps that the group is party to are all “pay fixed rate, receive floating rate” instruments. The interest rate collars utilised by the group limit its 
exposure to variability in LIBOR by establishing a cap and floor by which the interest rate will fluctuate.
In managing interest rate risks the group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations in the group’s earnings. Over the longer term, however, 
changes in interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.
The group has £202.1m of bank borrowings outstanding at the year end, of which £150.6m (75%) is hedged through the use of interest rate swaps 
and collars. £107.6m is covered by fixed interest swap arrangements, thereby eliminating the group’s exposure to movements in interest rates, and £43.0m 
is covered by cap and collar arrangements, thereby limiting the exposure to increases in interest rates. At 30 September 2009, a 100bps general increase 
in LIBor would increase the group’s interest charge on its borrowings by £0.3m and a 100bps general decrease in LIBor would decrease the interest 
charge by £0.3m. The fair value of the group’s derivative financial instruments will increase or decrease as a result of movements in LIBOR. The group 
accounts for movements in the fair value of derivative financial instruments through equity.
Short-term deposits are placed at a rate linked to LIBor and are consequently sensitive to movements in the inter-bank lending rate.

22. Financial risk management continued
(a) Market risk continued
(ii) Price risk
The group is not exposed to commodity price risk but as a provider of services is subject to both general and industry specific wage pressures, including 
legislative changes concerning the minimum wage level. Contracts with Local Authorities, pCTs and other NhS Trusts are also subject to annual price review.
A 1% general increase in salary costs would decrease profit after tax for the year ended 30 September 2009 by £2.2m. 
In common with the majority of government-funded providers, most of the group’s price changes take effect annually on 1 April. Around 40% 
of the group’s revenue is linked to general inflation indices. Refer to page 23 of the report of the directors for a further discussion of this risk.
(iii) Foreign exchange risk
The group has a minimal level of foreign currency transactions; therefore no forward foreign exchange contracts are entered into.
(b) Credit risk
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions. Credit exposures in respect to customers is limited 
given the majority of the group’s income is attributable to Local Authorities, PCTs and other NHS Trusts. The group has no significant concentrations 
of credit risk. For banks and financial institutions, only parties with a minimum rating of A are accepted. 
The table below analyses the group’s cash and cash equivalents by credit exposure excluding bank balances and petty cash:

management does not expect any losses from non-performance arising from counterparties used.
refer to note 13 for information relating to an analysis of trade receivables which are past due but not impaired and trade receivables which are past 
due and impaired.
(c) Liquidity risk 
A policy of prudent liquidity risk management is applied. The group’s operational cash flow is largely stable and predictable given the contractual 
nature of the core business activity. The group prepares annual cash flow forecasts and three-year cash flow budgets reflecting known commitments 
and anticipated projects. Borrowing facilities are arranged as necessary to finance requirements, including capital expenditure. Short-term flexibility 
is achieved by the utilisation of overdraft facilities. Adequate headroom in available facilities is maintained.
The group’s core funding is represented by a secured long-term loan facility (see note 16 for further details). At the time of signing these financial 
statements, the group has available bank and overdraft facilities totalling £262.4m, which is sufficient, together with cash flow from profits, to fund 
present commitments. Interest is charged on the term facilities at a margin over LIBor as explained in part (a) to this note. Interest arising on the 
group’s overdraft facility is calculated after netting positive cash balances held. Interest on this facility is charged at base rate plus a margin.
A maturity profile of the principal obligations with respect to the group’s financial liabilities is provided in note 16(c). Furthermore the group has 
contractual obligations with respect to interest due on the principal sums borrowed. £107.6m (53%) is covered by fixed interest swap arrangements 
which have a weighted average remaining life of 4.20 years and a weighted contract rate of 4.94% payable quarterly. £43.0m (22%) is covered 
by effective cap arrangements which have a weighted remaining life of 3.84 years and a weighted contract cap of 5.75% and a weighted floor of 
14.4% payable quarterly. The remaining £51.5m attracts interest at a fluctuating rate linked to LIBOR and is settled quarterly. The maturity profile 
of the principal and finance charge obligations with respect to finance leases is disclosed in note 16(d).
(d) Capital risk management
The board monitors a range of financial metrics including return on capital employed and gearing to measure the efficiency of the group’s capital 
structure and the returns for shareholders. Capital comprises shareholders’ equity and debt facilities.
The board has a policy to maintain the earnings cover for dividends at a level appropriate to the group’s growth objectives.
From time to time the company purchases its own shares in the market for the purpose of issuing shares under the group’s LTIp programmes. 
Outside of this practice the group does not have a defined share buy-back plan.

The interest rate swaps and collars have been accounted for as hedge transactions, hence changes in fair value have been recognised directly 
in the hedging reserves.
(b) Embedded derivatives
In accordance with IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: recognition and measurement”, the group has reviewed all contracts for embedded derivatives that 
are required to be separately accounted for if they do not meet certain requirements set out in the standard. No such derivatives were identified as a result 
of the review.

The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of the financial instruments reflected in the above tables:
Derivatives
Derivative financial instruments are valued by using broker quotes.
Trade and other receivables/payables
For receivables/payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value. All other receivables/payables 
are discounted to determine the fair value.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
Finance lease liabilities
The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for homogenous lease agreements. The estimated 
fair values reflect changes in the interest rates.

(d) Fair value of financial assets and liabilities continued
Interest rates for determining fair value
Unless specified on the previous page, the group uses the Government yield curve as of 30 September 2009 plus an adequate constant spread to discount 
financial instruments. The interest rates used are as follows:
         2009 2008 
         % %
Loans and borrowings        7.4 9.38
Leases        13.9 13.9
receivables        7.2 9.38
24. pensions
The group has established a number of pension schemes, both defined contribution and defined benefit, covering a number of its employees.
(a) Defined contribution plan
The group has a defined contribution group personal pension plan. Contributions to this scheme are charged to the income statement as they fall due. 
The assets of this scheme are held separately from those of the group in independently administered funds. 
Pension costs for defined contribution schemes are as follows:
         2009 2008 
         £m £m
Defined contribution schemes       0.7 0.8
As at 30 September 2009 contributions amounting to £nil (2008: £nil) were payable to the scheme and are included in creditors.
(b) Defined benefit plans
As a result of contractual arrangements with a small number of public sector customers, the group contributes to three defined benefit schemes. 
These schemes provide pension benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The schemes are funded by payments to independently managed funds, the assets of which are held separately from those of the group. The funds 
are administered by trustees as a separate legal entity. The trustees of the fund are required to act in the best interest of the fund’s beneficiaries. 
The appointment of trustees is determined by the schemes’ trust documentation.
Contributions to the defined benefit pension schemes are charged to the income statement so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees’ 
estimated working lives with the group. The contributions are determined by qualified actuaries on the basis of triennial valuations using the 
projected unit method.
The liabilities of the defined benefit schemes are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid out by the schemes using 
the projected unit method. This is the amount, after taking into consideration reimbursement assets, which is reflected in the deficit in the balance sheet. 
The projected unit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the scheme liabilities make allowance for projected earnings.
Care UK LG Pension Scheme
The most recent valuation was as at 1 April 2006. At the date of the actuarial valuation the market value of the scheme’s assets was £2.5m and the 
actuarial value of those assets represented 80% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings. 
Following the valuation the employer contribution rate decreased with effect from 1 october 2007 from 29.45% to 29.40%. The group will monitor 
funding levels on an annual basis. The next triennial valuation was completed as at 1 April 2009. The group considers that the contribution rates agreed 
with the trustees at the last valuation date are sufficient to eliminate the deficit over ten years and that regular contributions which are based on service 
costs will not increase significantly.
Employer contributions amounted to £0.7m (2008: £0.8m) for the year ended 30 September 2009. Employer contribution rates in respect of future 
years have currently been agreed at 29.40% of total pensionable salaries.
This scheme obtains approval by the Government Actuarial Department when new members join the scheme.
The trustee’s board has five places, three of which are nominated by the employer and two are nominated by the scheme members.

Dorset County Council Pension Fund
The group is an admitted body of the Dorset County Council Local Government pension Scheme. This is a closed scheme and no new members 
can be admitted. During the year ended 30 September 2006 a number of employees transferred to the group but continued to be members 
of Dorset County Council pension Fund.
Under the rules of the admission agreement, the associated pension fund assets and liabilities are separately identifiable and segregated 
for funding purposes.
Under the terms of the group’s contract with Poole Borough Council, the group is indemnified for any shortfall in scheme assets and for any increase 
in contributions required by any future actuarial valuation; hence the group has no constructive or legal obligation to fund a deficit on the associated 
segregated portion of the scheme. Accordingly, the group has recognised an asset equal to the current deficit on the segregated portion of the scheme. 
This reimbursement asset has been presented as offsetting the current scheme deficit on the segregated portion of the scheme and is therefore included 
within retirement benefit obligations.
The most recent valuation of this scheme was as at 31 march 2007. As at the date of the latest actuarial valuation, the segregated portion of 
the scheme showed that the value of the scheme’s assets was £1.2m and that the actuarial value of those assets represented 82% of the benefits 
that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
Employer contributions amounted to £0.1m (2008: £0.1m) for the year ended 30 September 2009. Contribution rates in respect of next year are 
expected to be 14.1% of total pensionable salary.
London Borough of Harrow Pension Scheme
The group is an admitted body of the London Borough of harrow pension Scheme. This is a closed scheme and no new members can be admitted. 
During the year ended 30 September 2008 a number of employees transferred to the group but continued to be members of London Borough 
of harrow pension Fund.
Under the rules of the admission agreement, the associated pension fund assets and liabilities are separately identifiable and segregated for 
funding purposes.
Under the terms of the group’s contract with the London Borough of Harrow, the group has no constructive or legal obligation to fund a deficit 
on the associated segregated portion of the scheme. Accordingly, the group has accounted for the scheme as a defined contribution scheme.
Employer contributions amounted to £0.1m (2008: £0.1m) for the year ended 30 September 2009. Contribution rates in respect of next year are 
expected to be 19.5% of total pensionable salary.
Royal County of Berkshire Pension Fund
The group is an admitted body of the royal County of Berkshire pension Fund. This is a closed scheme and no new members can be admitted. During 
the year ended 30 September 2009 a number of employees transferred to the group but continued to be members of royal County of Berkshire pension Fund.
Under the rules of the admission agreement, the associated pension fund assets and liabilities are separately identifiable and segregated for funding purposes.
Under the terms of the group’s contract with The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, the group is indemnified for any shortfall in scheme 
assets at the date of admission to the pension scheme; hence the group only has a constructive and legal obligation to fund any deficit arising following 
admission on the associated segregated portion of the scheme. Accordingly, the group has a recognised a defined benefit obligation equal to the deficit 
on the segregated portion of the scheme arising since admission. 
A valuation of this scheme was undertaken as at 1 April 2009, the date of transfer of obligations. As at the date of the actuarial valuation, 
the segregated portion of the scheme showed that the value of the scheme’s assets was equal to that of the benefits that had accrued to members, 
after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
Employer contributions amounted to £nil (2008: £nil) for the year to 30 September 2009. Contribution rates in respect of next year are expected 
to be 21% of total pensionable salary.

Expected return on plan assets       3.0–8.0 4.5–8.0
The derivation of the overall expected return on assets reflects the actual asset allocation at the measurement date combined with an expected return 
for each asset class. The bond return is based on the prevailing return available on high quality (AA or similar) corporate bonds. The returns on equities 
and property are based on a number of factors including the income yield at the measurement date, the long term growth prospects for the economy 
in general, the long term relationship between each asset class and the bond returns and the movement in market indices since the previous 
measurement date. The actual gain on plan assets was £0.2m (2008: £0.2m loss).
The assumed life expectancy at age 65 is:

the amount that may be repayable is £0.2m (2008: £0.2m).

of these guarantees being called upon is remote.

During the year, the group made various payments to defined benefit pension plans. Details of these transactions are set out in note 24

companies. The directors do not consider it meaningful to set out the gross amounts of transfers between individual companies. Similarly the directors

arrangements. There are no provisions or expenses recognised for doubtful debts with subsidiary undertakings.

in notes 13 and 17.

Voting and proxies
1.  All holders of ordinary shares of 10p each in the company on the r egister at 6pm on 8 February 2010 are entitled to attend and speak 
at the meeting. A holder of ordinary shares of 10p each is entitled to appoint one or more proxies to attend and, on a poll, vote in his stead. 
A shareholder may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the meeting provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached 
to a different share or shares held by him or her. A proxy need not be a member of the company.
2. Completion of the form of proxy will not prevent a holder of ordinary shares of 10p each from attending the meeting and voting in person. 
3.  The form of proxy, to be valid, must be lodged together with the power of attorney or other authority (if any) under which it is signed, or a 
notarially certified copy of such power of attorney or other authority, at Computershare Investor Services PLC, The Pavilions, Bridgwater Road, 
Bristol BS99 6Zy, not later than 48 hours before the time of the meeting or adjourned meeting.
4. In the case of an individual, the form of proxy must be signed by the appointor or by his/her attorney duly authorised in writing.
5.  In the case of a corporation, the form of proxy must either be executed under its common seal or under the hand of a duly authorised officer 
or attorney.
6.  In the case of a joint holder, the vote of the first named holder on the Register of members (whether voting in person or by proxy) will be accepted 
to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holder(s) in respect of the joint holding. 
7. Any alteration in the form of proxy must be initialled. 
8.  As at 10 December 2009 (being the last practicable business day prior to the publication of the notice) the Company’s issued share capital consists 
of 61,819,040 ordinary shares, carrying one vote each. The shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust do not attract voting rights, therefore the 
total voting rights in the company as at 10 December 2009 are 61,327,840.
9.  As an alternative to completing and returning the printed form of proxy, you may submit your proxy over the internet by accessing  
www.eproxyappointment.com. For security purposes, shareholders will need to provide their shareholder reference number (“SrN”) and personal 
identification number (“PIN”) to validate the submission of their proxy online. Shareholders’ individual SRN and PIN, together with an identifying 
Control Number, are shown on the printed form of proxy sent to them. For further information, see the instructions printed on the form of proxy.
10.  A person to whom this notice is sent who is a person nominated under Section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 to enjoy information rights 
(a ‘Nominated person’) may, under an agreement between him/her and the shareholder by whom he/she was nominated, have a right to be 
appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy for the meeting. If a Nominated person has no such proxy appointment right or does 
not wish to exercise it, he/she may, under any such agreement, have a right to give instructions to the shareholder as to the exercise of voting 
rights. The statements of the rights of shareholders in relation to the appointment of proxies set out above do not apply to a Nominated person.
11.  CrEST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by utilising the CrEST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the meeting 
and any adjournment(s) thereof by utilising the procedures described in the CrEST manual. CrEST personal members or other CrEST sponsored 
members and those Cr EST members who have appointed voting service provider(s), should refer to their Cr EST sponsor or voting service provider(s), 
who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
12.  Any member attending the meeting has the right to ask questions. The Company must cause to be answered any such question relating 
to the business being dealt with at the meeting but no such answer need be given if (a) to do so would interfere unduly with the preparation 
for the meeting or involve the disclosure of confidential information, (b) the answer has already been given on a website in the form of an answer 
to a question, or (c) it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of the meeting that the question be answered.

1.  At the Annual General meeting of the company held on 11 February 2009, the directors were authorised for the purposes of Section 80 of the 
Companies Act 1985 to allot relevant securities up to an aggregate nominal value of £2,051,616. That authority will expire at the conclusion of the 
forthcoming Annual General meeting. At this year’s Annual General meeting, an ordinary resolution (resolution 8) will be proposed to grant the 
directors authority under Section 551 of the Companies Act 2006 to allot relevant securities up to the maximum aggregate nominal amount of 
£2,060,634 representing one third of the total share capital of the company in issue as at the date hereof. The directors have no present intention 
of exercising that authority. The authority to allot up to £2,060,634 nominal aggregate value of relevant securities to be conferred pursuant to 
resolution 8 will lapse on 30 April 2011 or on the conclusion of the next Annual General meeting of the company after the passing of such 
resolution, whichever is the earlier.
2.  At the Annual General meeting of the company held on 11 February 2009, the directors were empowered for the purposes of Section 95 of the 
Companies Act 1985 to allot equity securities which are to be paid up in cash as if Section 89(1) of the Companies Act 1985 did not apply to any 
such allotment for the purposes, inter alia, of the allotment of equity securities for cash up to an aggregate nominal value of £307,745 otherwise 
than by way of rights. That authority will expire at the conclusion of the forthcoming Annual General meeting. At this year’s Annual General meeting, 
a Special resolution (resolution 9) will be proposed to empower the directors to allot equity securities for cash pursuant to the authority conferred 
upon them by resolution 8 as if Section 561(1) of the Companies Act 2006 did not apply to any such allotment provided that such power will be 
limited to the allotment of equity securities in connection with rights issues (as described in resolution 8) and the allotment of equity securities up 
to an aggregate nominal value of £309,095, representing approximately 5% of the total ordinary share capital in issue in the company as at the 
date hereof. The authority will terminate no later than 15 months after the passing of the Special resolution.
3.  resolution 10 authorises the company generally to make purchases of its own shares, as permitted by the Companies Act 2006 and the UK Listing 
Authority. The directors will only exercise this power of purchase in circumstances which, in the opinion of the directors should result in an improvement 
in earnings per share for the remaining shareholders and all such purchases will be made through the London Stock Exchange.
4.  Under the Companies Act 2006, general meetings, other than Annual General meetings, may be called on 14 clear days’ notice. however, 
the Shareholders’ rights regulations increased the notice period for all general meetings to 21 clear days’ notice. Companies do have the ability 
to reduced this notice period to 14 clear days’ notice (other than for Annual General meetings) provided that they offer facilities for all shareholders 
to vote and appoint proxies by electronic means and that, annually, shareholders be given the opportunity to approve the reduction in the minimum 
notice period from 21 clear days to 14 clear days.
The board is therefore proposing this resolution to seek such shareholder approval for 14 clear days to be the minimum period of notice for all general 
meetings of the Company, other than Annual General meetings. The approval will expire at the conclusion of the Company’s next Annual General meeting 
when it is intended that renewal of this authority will be sought.
Recommendation
The directors consider that each resolution set out in the Notice of Annual General meeting is in the best interests of the Company and the shareholders 
as a whole and, accordingly unanimously recommend that all shareholders vote in favour of all resolutions, as the Directors intend to in respect of their 
own beneficial holdings.

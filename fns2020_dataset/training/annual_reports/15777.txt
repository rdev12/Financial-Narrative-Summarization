    Annual Report 2012 Chairman’s statement
I am pleased to report that the first full  
financial year of operations for TLA Worldwide plc  
(TLA or the Group) has been a successful one. 
Following TLA’s listing on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) on 8 December 2011,  
it has fully integrated its portfolio companies under one unified brand, and completed a  
bolt-on acquisition of Peter E. Greenberg & Associates (PEG) to further extend our reach into 
Major League Baseball (MLB) by targeting the high growth region of Latin America. We also 
realigned and enhanced the Group’s sales functions. As a result, TLA is now a market leader  
in the representation of professional baseball players. 
TLA has also expanded its sports marketing offering. It is particularly strong in talent  
marketing, with special competencies in the representation of broadcasters, coaches and 
professional golfers. The short listing of TLA as Best in Talent Representation and Management 
at the prestigious 2013 Sports Business Awards is a testimony to the hard work of our people 
and the growing reputation of the Group.
Review of results
For the year ended 31 December 2012, the Group reported:
 w revenues of $15.1 million;
 w operating profit of $1.2 million;
 w adjusted EBITDA

 of $6.6 million;

Review of operations
The operational integration of TLA following our acquisition of PEG is complete with PEG reposi-
tioning itself within the TLA brand. We currently have more than 50 full-time personnel and nine 
locations worldwide (London, New York City, Newport Beach, San Francisco, Houston, Charleston 
SC, Phoenix, Miami and Maracay in Venezuela). There have been 52 net new client wins in 2012, 
demonstrating the benefits of the combined Group and reflecting the efforts of our team.

TLA Worldwide PLC     In January 2013, we renegotiated and expanded our banking facility to include a revolving 
facility to fund any future acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. We also appointed 
Numis Securities Limited as nominated adviser and broker to TLA as we strive to move the 
business forward.
Board changes
In June 2012, Andy Pearson was appointed as a non-executive director to the Board.  
Andy brings substantial experience to the Group. As a senior partner at KPMG for 16 years  
he formed and led KPMG’s Transaction Services business in the Midlands between 1999 and 
2005 and led work on more than 100 M&A or financing transactions. 
Additionally, effective 29 November 2012, Gareth Jones, TLA’s group financial controller, was 
promoted to chief financial officer and has joined the Group’s Board. Gareth joined TLA having 
previously advised the Group on its flotation. Previously, Gareth spent four years within the 
Audit and Assurance practice of Ernst & Young, where he worked on companies varying in size 
from start-ups to FTSE 100 clients. He holds a CA qualification and a member of the Institute 
of Chartered Accountants of Scotland.
Outlook
The start of 2013 has been positive and is in line with the Board’s expectations for the year. 
The cash position continues to be strong with cash on balance sheet of $1.2 million as at  
31 March 2013, after the payment of $2.2 million in earn-outs, and 70% of our forecast 2013 
revenue is currently contracted.
From an industry perspective, the strong underlying fundamentals of MLB were further 
confirmed through the recent doubling of its national media rights values to $1.55 billion  
per annum from 2014 to 2021. Additionally, the global sports marketing industry is  
trending positively following the highly successful London 2012 Olympics. Growth in sports 
marketing and sponsorship in the US continues to be robust and TLA is well placed to capture 
this market upswing. 
This year we have delivered a strong set of results and we have performed in line with 
expectations, proving the business model to investors. We remain focused on developing  
the business, expanding our client base and improving the value of the Group’s offering.  
The economic and growth trends are favourable for the sports marketing industry, specifically 
in baseball and the USA generally. We remain confident about TLA’s long-term growth.

TLA Worldwide PLC     Trading
The Group has continued to deliver strong sales and profit growth. In our first full year results 
we generated $15.1 million of revenue and growth of 9% on a pro forma basis (2011 pro forma 
$13.8 million; for the 23-day period after our admission to AIM, revenues were $171,000).  
Our adjusted EBITDA was $6.6 million (2011: pro forma of $6.1 million). The reported operat-
ing profit for the year was $1.2m (2011: a loss of $0.7m for the 23-day period) after amortisa-
tion charges of $4.4 million (2011: $0.3 million). 
Adjusted EBITDA
1
 margin for the group was 43% (2011 unaudited pro forma

: 44%). 
Adjusted diluted EPS was 4.2 cents (2011 unaudited pro forma: 0.02 cents). Statutory EPS  
for the year was a loss of 1.4 cents per share (2011: 2.7 cent loss per share).
Business review
The group has progressed successfully over the past 12 months and now operates under one 
brand across its operations. We also enhanced our sales team to capitalise on the potential 
within our baseball business and the increased awareness of the TLA organisation.
The baseball division was active during 2012, highlighted by four TLA clients being selected as  
MLB All-Stars in 2012. TLA now has 21 current and past All-Stars on our roster. In the MLB 
Amateur Draft, TLA advised 18 MLB draft picks, an increase of 20% on 2011. 18 of TLA’s clients 
were called up to the MLB compared to four in 2011. 
With the acquisition of PEG, TLA expanded into Latin America and is now a market leader in 
that sector. TLA is off to a strong start in 2013 with nearly 60 clients on MLB 40 man rosters, 
compared to 33 commencing the 2012 season. TLA recently completed a productive off-season, 
negotiating over $210m of contracts for its clients, compared to slightly over $100m in the 
prior off-season. 
The sports marketing division has performed well. We have invested in its sales resources, 
which slightly reduced margins in the short term. Golf had a solid year with 42 top 10 PGA 
Tour finishes and three new PGA Tour clients, including 2012 Rookie of the Year, John Huh, 
and 2010 USA Ryder Cup team member, Jeff Overton, signing with TLA for their exclusive 
representation. 
Talent marketing continued to perform well in commercially promoting its clients, negotiat-
ing deals with high-profile brands such as Pepsi, Red Bull and TicketMaster, as well as its 
exclusive marketing representation of top 10 draft pick in the National Football League, Ryan 
Tannehill. Coaching continued its upward trend by selectively expanding its client base, 
highlighted by its representation of eight of the 64 teams in the 2012 NCAA basketball champi-
onship tournament. Broadcasting added more than 10 new clients to its roster meaning TLA 
now has clients commentating across the media spectrum for networks including ESPN, the 
MLB, NFL and NHL Networks, CBS, NBC, Fox and Turner.
Acquisition
Part of our strategy is to acquire companies that fit into and further enhance our business and 
strategy. It was for this reason that we acquired PEG in November 2012. The acquisition moves 
us into a leading position in the Latin American baseball player market as well as enhancing 
our position as a leading baseball management business in the USA. Latin America is a key 
area for baseball representation, with 23.5% of MLB players originating from Latin America. 
PEG’s key markets of the Dominican Republic and Venezuela produce 10.2% and 7.3% of all 
MLB players respectively.
The integration of PEG into the TLA baseball business is progressing well, with the re-brand 
complete. The additional reach, combined with industry recognised agents, will only continue 
to enhance the TLA brand. During 2013 we intend to consolidate all our New York operations 
into one office, which will complete our integration.
The baseball division 
was active during 2012, 
highlighted by four TLA 
clients being selected 
as MLB All-Stars in 
2012. TLA now has 21 
current and past All-
Stars on our roster.

billion
per annum: the overall worth  
of the US sports market
Equity and debt financing
As part of the acquisition of PEG we raised additional equity. It was pleasing not only to have 
the support of our existing investors but to see new institutions supporting TLA. In January 
2013 we renegotiated our banking facilities, which are in place now until January 2018.  
This enabled us to reduce the interest paid margin by 1% and increase our overall facilities  
to $15 million. The increase in the facilities is by way of a $7 million revolver, which is in 
addition to our current $8 million term loan facility. The revolver is available for the future 
requirements of the group, including acquisitions.
Our markets
The baseball market continues to go from strength to strength. The estimated MLB revenues 
for the 2012 season is expected to be $7.5 billion (2011: $7.2 billion). That revenue figure is 
underpinned by the rapidly growing local broadcast rights market and league attendance. 
MLB’s 2012 gate increased to nearly 75 million, marking a return to pre-recession levels.  
The 2% year-on-year increase is the fifth highest in its history and the largest since 2008. 
These positive factors, combined with the new TV rights deal of $1.55 billion per annum from 
the 2014 season, give MLB a sound footing.
The overall US sports market is worth $48 billion per annum. The key segments of sponsorship 
and media rights are respectively worth more than $9 billion and $12 billion per annum.  
These segments are forecast to grow faster than the overall US sports market at 6.3% and 
7.8% per annum against growth of 4.7%
3
 for the total market. Drilling down further into the 
sports marketing landscape, PGA Tour revenues rose in 2012 to a record high of $1.11 billion, 
highlighted by a nine-year television deal which commenced in 2011 and averages $800 
million per annum. These markets are key drivers for the growth of TLA’s business as they 
underpin the spend by MLB baseball teams as well as increasing our ability to secure  
sponsorship opportunities for our clients.
People
One of the strengths of our business is the quality of our people. As well as the Board appoint-
ments of Andy Pearson and Gareth Jones, we have made a number of key hires, including the 
fulfilment of the newly created position of Senior VP, Business Development. On a personal 
note, I would like to thank all of the TLA team for their enthusiasm, energy and support over 
the last year.
Outlook
As set out in the chairman’s statement, the Group will continue to build upon its progress 
in 2012 by developing organically by expanding the current service offering and geographic 
presence, as well as seeking to make strategic acquisitions if and when the right opportunity 
presents itself.
TLA intends to become the pre-eminent, fully integrated representation and marketing 
services agency with on-field focus on professional baseball. As a combined group, TLA offers 
industry-leading capabilities in baseball, broadcasting, coaching, golf and talent management. 
TLA today offers a stronger platform to recruit new clients and identify new opportunities 
across the portfolio.
2013 has started as expected and the Group is performing is in line with the Board’s  
expectations.

cash and $1.3m in shares. There are five contingent earn-out payments of up to $7.1m, subject 
to certain EBIT targets. TLA has the option to pay 30% of any earn-out in shares.
PEG is a Latin America focused baseball representation business. This enhances TLA’s Latin 
America operation moving it to a market leader in the representations of Latin American 
baseball players. For the 60 days that PEG was part of TLA it made an operating loss of  
$0.5 million.
Cash flow and banking arrangements
Cash generated from operating activities for the year ended 31 December 2012 was $2.1million

million (2011: $3.1 million) and net debt was $3.9 million (2011: $6.9m). 
A new $15 million banking facility has been arranged since the year end with SunTrust Bank 
for a term of five years to January 2018. We have reduced the interest margin by 1%, the 
full benefit of which will not be seen until our hedge against future interest rate increases 
unwinds. The facility is comprised of a term loan of $8.0 million, which was fully drawn down 
as of 31 March 2013, and a $7.0 million revolver which was unused as of 31 March 2013. 
Cash earn-outs payments due in 2013 total $3.84 million. These were paid in March and  
April 2013.

    Annual Report 2012 The management of the business and the execution of  
the Group’s strategic plans are subject to a number of risks. 
The key business risks identified affecting the Group are set 
out here.
Reliance on key managers
Athlete representation is a people business, which relies on its agents to remain within the structure to 
maximise revenues by maintaining and attracting clients to the TLA roster. If key agents leave this may 
place risk on future revenues. The compensation structure of the key agents is aligned with the success 
of the venture. All current agents have been signed to long-term service agreements with restrictive 
covenants. Principal agents also have a significant portion of their acquisition proceeds tied up in TLA 
Worldwide shares, which aligns their interest with that of the shareholders. 
Margin erosion
There is the potential for margin erosion through the reduction of agents’ fees. However, the recent MLB 
CBA agreement and the MLBPA’s stance on agents’ remuneration afford the business protection, as do the 
multi-year contracts already in place. 
Suitable acquisitions and access to capital
The Group’s expansion strategy includes selective acquisitions and the availability of debt or equity to 
fund future acquisitions may be limited or difficult to obtain.
Execution
The ability of the Group to deliver incremental revenues through the co-ordination of new business activity 
is dependent on the availability of senior personnel to help convert leads and cross-refer business.
Look forward statements

uncertainties, the directors’ report and the directors’ remuneration report may constitute forward-looking 
statements that are based on the Board’s current expectations, assumptions and projections about the

    Annual Report 2012 As an AIM-listed company, the Company is not required 
to comply with Schedule 8 of the Companies Act. 
However, in accordance with AIM notice 36 has provided, on page 28, the necessary disclosure 
of the directors’ remuneration earned in respect of the financial year by each director of 
the Company acting in such a capacity during the financial year. The directors also feel it is 
appropriate to provide the following information to shareholders. 
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is comprised of:
 w Andrew Wilson (chairman) (who replaced Peter Moore on the Remuneration Committee, who 
resigned on 14 March 2012. Mr Wilson also became chairman, taking over from Mr Sadler)
 w Keith Sadler (chairman up to 14 March 2012)
 w Bart Campbell
The Code recommends that a remuneration committee should be comprised of entirely 
independent non-executive directors. Andrew Wilson, who is affiliated to a major shareholder, 
and Bart Campbell, due to his shareholding in the Company and his influence in its formation, 
are not independent under the Code. The Board does consider them to act independently as 
regards remuneration issues.
The committee met three times during the period.
The company secretary is the secretary to the committee.
The committee seeks input from the chief executive officer and the company secretary.  
The committee makes reference to external evidence of pay and employment conditions in 
other companies and is free to seek advice from external advisers.
Remuneration policy
The Group’s policy on remuneration for the current period and, so far as is practicable for 
subsequent years, is set out below. However, the Remuneration Committee believes that it 
should retain the flexibility to adjust the remuneration policy in accordance with the changing 
needs of the business. Any changes in the policy in subsequent years will be detailed in future 
reports on remuneration. The Group must ensure that its remuneration arrangement attract 
and retain people of the right calibre in order to ensure corporate success and to enhance 
shareholder value. Its overall approach is to attract, develop, motivate and retain talented 
Directors’  
remuneration report 
26
TLA Worldwide PLC     people at all levels, by paying competitive salaries and benefits to all staff and encouraging 
its staff to hold shares in the group. Pay levels are set to take account of contribution and indi-
vidual performance, wage levels elsewhere in the Group and with reference to relevant market 
information. The Group seeks to reward its employees fairly and give them the opportunity to 
increase their earnings by linking pay to achieving business and individual targets.
The Board believes that share ownership is an effective way of strengthening employees’ involvement 
in the development of the business and bringing together their interest and those of shareholders and 
as such anticipates granting a share option scheme to key employees in the future. 
Executive directors are rewarded on the basis of individual responsibility, competence and 
contribution and salary increases also take into account pay awards elsewhere in the Group as 
well as external market benchmarking.
During the period to 31 December 2012 there were three executive directors:
 Michael Principe (CEO)
 Greg Genske (Executive Director)
 Gareth Jones (CFO), appointed to the board on 29 November 2012
Messrs Principe, Genske and Jones participate in the Company’s healthcare. 
Performance-related elements form a substantial part of the total remuneration packages and 
are designed to align directors’ interest with those of shareholders. In line with best practice 
and to bring the Directors’ and shareholders’ interest further into line, Executive Directors and 
the management team are encouraged to maintain a holding of Ordinary Shares in the Group.
Non-executive directors’ fees
The Board determines fees for non-executive directors annually, taking advice as appropriate 
and reflecting the time commitment and responsibilities on the role. Non-executive directors’ 
fees currently comprise a basic fee of £30,000 per annum. The chairman receives a fee of 
£35,000 per annum. In addition, non-executive directors are paid £5,000 per annum for each 
committee that they sit on.
Non-executive directors do not participate in any pension schemes or LTIP, except for  
Mr Campbell. The Group reimburses the reasonable expenses they incur in carrying out their 
directors’ duties.
Remuneration components: executive directors
A significant proportion of each executive directors’ remuneration is performance related.  
The main components of the remuneration package for executive directors are:
 w Basic salary
 w Annual bonuses
 w LTIP
Basic salary 
Basic salary is set by the remuneration committee by taking into account the responsibility, 
individual performance and experience of the executive director, as well as market practice 
for executives in a similar position. Basic salary is reviewed (but not necessarily increased) 
annually by the remuneration committee.
Bonuses
The executive directors are eligible to participate in annual bonuses. The range of award is 
based on salary. For each of the executive directors, the percentage is as follows:

    Annual Report 2012 Although not required to comply with the UK 
corporate governance code (the Code) issued by the 
Financial Services Authority in June 2010, the Group is 
committed to high standards of corporate governance. 
While the Group does not fully comply with the Code, it 
applies a level of corporate governance appropriate for 
a company of its size. This statement describes how the 
principles of corporate governance are applied. 
The Board

The role of the chief executive and chairman are separate and there is a clear division of 
their responsibilities. All directors are subject to re-election every three years. The Company 
has additionally supplemented this with the good practice of one third of the total number 
of directors standing for re-election at each Annual General Meeting (AGM). Therefore, Keith 
Sadler and Greg Genske will retire at the upcoming AGM and, being eligible for re-election,  
offer themselves for re-election. Andrew Pearson and Gareth Jones offer themselves for elec-
tion as directors.

    Annual Report 2012 The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under 
that law the directors are required to prepare the group financial statements in accordance

 w select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 w make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 w state whether applicable UK accounting standards have been followed, subject to any

that directors:
 w properly select and apply accounting policies;
 w present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, 
reliable, comparable and understandable information; 
 w provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs 
are insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other 
events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
 w make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to 
show and explain the Company’s transactions and to disclose with reasonable accuracy at any

 w the management report, which is incorporated into the directors’ report, includes a 
fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together 
with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to 
identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware  
of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for 
our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the group financial statements:
 w give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 31 December 2012 and of its 
loss for the year then ended;
 w have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European  
Union; and
 w have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the  
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the directors’ report for the financial year for which the 
group financial statements are prepared is consistent with the group financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 
requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
 w certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

    Annual Report 2012 General information 
TLA Worldwide PLC (the Company) is incorporated in the United Kingdom under the  
Companies Act. The Company and its subsidiaries’ (together the “Group”) principal activities 
are set out as part of the chief executive and finance review on pages 8 to 17.
These financial statements are presented in US dollars because that is the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the Group operates.

Principal  
accounting 
policies
44
TLA Worldwide PLC     The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently 
to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
Judgements made by the directors in the application of these accounting policies that have 
a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements together with estimates with 
significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 26.
Going concern
The directors have reviewed the forecasts for the years ending 31 December 2013 and 31 
December 2014. The directors consider the forecasts to be prudent and have assessed the 
impact on the Group’s cash flow, facilities and headroom within its banking covenants. Further, 
the directors have assessed the future funding requirements of the Group and compared the 
level of borrowing facilities. Based on this work, the directors are satisfied that Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future despite the 
current economic uncertainty. For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the financial statements.
basis of accounting 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS). The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements 
comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS regulation. 
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the revalua-
tion of financial instruments. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consider-
ation given in exchange for the assets. The principal accounting policies are set out below:
basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company 
and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. 
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating 
policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are mea-
sured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over 
the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency 
of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired  
(i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the  
consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective  
date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial 
statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used  
by the group. All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated  
on consolidation.
Business combinations
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. 
The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the 
date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments 
issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are 
recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting 
from a contingent consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition-date fair value. 
Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where  
they qualify as measurement period adjustments (see below). All other subsequent changes  
in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted  
for in accordance with relevant IFRSs. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration 
classified as equity are not recognised.
These financial 
statements are 
presented in US 
dollars because that 
is the currency of the 
primary economic 
environment in which 
the Group operates
45
    Annual Report 2012 Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously-held interests in 
the acquired entity are remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date (i.e. the date the Group 
attains control) and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in profit or loss. Amounts 
arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been 
recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss, where such treat-
ment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of.
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions 
for recognition under IFRS 3 (2008) are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, 
except that:
 w deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit  
arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and 
IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively;
 w liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by the Group of an acquiree’s 
share-based payment awards are measured in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Pay-
ment; and
 w assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 
Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance 
with that standard.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting 
period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items 
for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the 
measurement period (see below), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect 
new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition 
date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group 
obtains complete information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition 
date, and is subject to a maximum of one year.
revenue
Revenue is measured as the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and com-
prises amounts billed to clients in respect of fees earned and commission-based income and is 
stated exclusive of any relevant sales taxes. Revenue is recognised in line with the provision 
of relevant services under the terms of the contract, provided that it is probable that the 
economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
All revenue is earned from talent representation, and can be split into three revenue streams:
1) Representation revenue
Representation revenue is generated from a commission paid as a percentage of a player’s 
base salary. Base salaries are fees payable by baseball clubs to their players. These fees are 
contractual obligations made by the club to pay the player for a specific number of seasons. 
Revenue is recognised at the point the player becomes contractually obliged to pay commis-
sion to the Group.
2) Signing bonuses
Signing bonuses are amounts payable by the clubs to the player for signing a contract.  
The Group earns a commission based on a percentage of the signing bonus. Commission 
revenue is recognised when the player receives the signing bonus from the relevant baseball 
club, at which point the player becomes contractually obliged to pay commission to the Group.
3) Endorsement revenue
Endorsement revenue is generated from commission calculated as a percentage of fees earned 
by clients for guest appearances, wearing of certain attire or other sponsorship deals. Revenue 
is recognised based on the terms of the individual contracts, in the period that the associated 
fees are earned by the player.
46
TLA Worldwide PLC     cost of sales
Cost of sales includes commission-based staff costs, including salaries, bonuses and social 
security costs, and expenses reimbursed to commission-based agents.
property, plant and equipment
The fixtures and fittings are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line 
method using an estimated useful life ranging from three to 15 years. Repairs and maintenance 
are charged to expense in the year incurred; major improvements and new assets are  
capitalised and depreciated using an estimated useful life ranging from three to five years.  
The estimated useful lives are as follows:
 w Fixtures and fittings: three to five years  
It is assumed that all assets will be used until the end of their useful life.
intangible assets and goodwill
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is 
acquired (the acquisition date). Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consid-
eration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair 
value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest (if any) in the entity over the net of the 
acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net 
assets exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling 
interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest 
in the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain 
purchase gain.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose 
of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units 
expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which 
goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when 
there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-
generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated 
first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other 
assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An 
impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determina-
tion of the profit or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets arising from a business combination whose fair values can be reliably 
measured are separated from goodwill and amortised based on the future cashflows attribut-
able to the individual assets.
Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill are systematically tested for 
impairment at each balance sheet date. Other intangibles assets are amortised from the date 
they are available for use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
 w Client contracts – over life of the contract
 w Customer relationships – six to eight years
impairment
For goodwill that has an indefinite useful life the recoverable amount is estimated annually. 
For other assets the recoverable amount is only estimated when there is an indication that 
impairment may have occurred. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs  
to sell and value in use.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce 
the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit and then to reduce 
the carrying amount of other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis. A cash generating unit is the 
47
    Annual Report 2012 smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of 
the cash flow from other assets or group of assets. Details of which are set out in note 10. 
taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net 
profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that 
are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable 
or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the  
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding 
tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance 
sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be 
utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from 
the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business 
combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable 
profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on invest-
ments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group 
is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced 
to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to 
allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the 
liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income 
statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case 
the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off 
current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied 
by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and 
liabilities on a net basis.
Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each group company are presented in the currency of 
the primary economic environment in which it operates (its functional currency). For the  
purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each 
group company are expressed in US dollars, which is the presentation currency for the 
consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies 
other than the entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of 
exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary 
assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates 
prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in 
foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was 
determined. 
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are  
not retranslated. 
Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise  
except for:
48
TLA Worldwide PLC      w exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings relating to assets under construction 
for future productive use, which are included in the cost of those assets when they are 
regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on those foreign currency borrowings;
 w exchange differences on monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation 
for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur (therefore forming part of the net 
investment in the foreign operation), which are recognised initially in other comprehensive 
income and reclassified from equity to profit or loss on disposal or partial disposal of the 
net investment.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of 
the group’s foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet 
date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, 
unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange 
rates at the date of transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised 
in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity (attributed to non-controlling 
interests as appropriate). 
Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities are reported as part of 
the fair value gain or loss. Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets, such as 
investments in equity securities classified as available for sale, are included in the fair value 
reserve in equity.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated 
as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Bank borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at an amount and the amount of the 
proceeds received net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including premiums payable on 
settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis in the 
Consolidated income statement using the effective interest rate method and are added to the 
carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which 
they arose. 
Finance costs
Finance costs of financial liabilities are recognised in the income statement over the term of 
such instruments at a constant rate of the carrying amount.
Operating leases
Leases where substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to 
the Group are treated as operating leases. Rentals under operating leases are charged to the 
income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other short-term 
highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are 
subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the 
Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
financial assets
All financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where the purchase or 
sale of a financial asset is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the financial asset 
within the time frame established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at 
fair value, plus transaction costs, except for those financial assets classified as at fair value 
through profit or loss, which are initially measured at fair value. 
49
    Annual Report 2012 Financial assets are classified into the following specified categories: financial assets ‘at fair 
value through profit or loss’ (FVTPL), ‘held-to-maturity’ investments, ‘available-for-sale’ (AFS) 
financial assets and ‘loans and receivables’. The classification depends on the nature and 
purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
loans and receivables
Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments 
that are not quoted in an active market are classified as ‘loans and receivables’. Loans and 
receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any 
impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for 
short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each 
balance sheet date. Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as 
a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, 
the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected. 
For listed and unlisted equity investments classified as AFS, a significant or prolonged  
decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered to be objective evidence  
of impairment. 
For all other financial assets, including redeemable notes classified as AFS and finance lease 
receivables, objective evidence of impairment could include:
 w significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterpar ty; or
 w default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; or
 w it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation.
For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed 
not to be impaired individually are, in addition, assessed for impairment on a collective basis. 
Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the Group’s past 
experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the 
portfolio past the average credit period of 60 days, as well as observable changes in national 
or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment is the differences 
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, 
discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all 
financial assets with the exception of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced 
through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable is considered uncollectible, 
it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously 
written off are credited against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the 
allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.
financial liabilities and equity
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in  
accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement. 
equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an 
entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group are  
recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities ‘at FVTPL’ or ‘other financial 
liabilities’.
50
TLA Worldwide PLC     financial liabilities at fvtpl 
Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL when the financial liability is either held for 
trading or it is designated as at FVTPL.
A financial liability is classified as held for trading if:
 w it has been incurred principally for the purpose of repurchasing it in the near term; or
 w on initial recognition it is part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that the 
Group manages together and has a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or 
 w it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument. 
A financial liability other than a financial liability held for trading may be designated as at 
FVTPL upon initial recognition if:
 w such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition 
inconsistency that would otherwise arise; or 
 w the financial liability forms part of a group of financial assets or financial liabilities or both, 
which is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance 
with the Group’s documented risk management or investment strategy, and information 
about the grouping is provided internally on that basis; or
 w it forms part of a contract containing one or more embedded derivatives, and IAS 39 
Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement permits the entire combined contract 
(asset or liability) to be designated as at FVTPL.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on 
remeasurement recognised in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss 
incorporates any interest paid on the financial liability and is included in the ‘other gains and 
losses’ line item in the income statement. Fair value is determined in the manner described in 
note 26. 
other financial liabilities 
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of 
transaction costs. 
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis. 
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial 
liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate 
is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of 
the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on 
initial recognition.
derecognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are 
discharged, cancelled or they expire.
derivative financial instruments
The Group enters into interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate that The 
Group holds. Further details of derivative financial instruments are disclosed in note 17.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is  
entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date. 
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately.
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative 
with a negative fair value is recognised as a financial liability. A derivative is presented as  
a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is 
more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months.  
Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities.

    Annual Report 2012 Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by 
appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Investments
Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an 
investment is under contract whose terms require the delivery of the investment within the 
time frame established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at cost, including 
transaction costs. Investments are classified either as available for sale, and are measured at 
subsequent reporting dates at fair value, or at amortised cost, where no fair value is readily 
determinable.
Gains and losses on available for sale financial assets arising from changes in fair value are 
recognised directly in equity, until the security is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, 
at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the net 
profit or loss for the period.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at their nominal value.

    Annual Report 2012 1. Segmental analysis
The Group reports its business activities in two areas: baseball representation and sports 
marketing. Unallocated represents the Group’s costs as a public company, along with intra-
group transactions, and exceptional items (see note 4). The Group derives its revenues in the 
United States of America.
Baseball representation: primarily assists the on field activities of baseball players, including 
all aspects of a player’s contract negotiation.
Sports marketing: primarily assists the off-field activities of athletes; in addition it represents 
broadcasters and coaches in respect of their contract negotiations.
All of the Group’s revenue arises through the rendering of services. 
IFRS 8 paragraph 34 requires disclosure of revenues by customer for each customer that 
generates in excess of 10 per cent of the Group’s total revenues in a period. In the year ended 
31 December 2012, there were no clients who generated in excess of 10 per cent of total 
revenue (23-day period ended 31 December 2011: one).

At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of $1.9 million (2011: $3.2 million) 
available for offset against future profits. A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect 
of $0.2 million (2011: $1.5 million); of such losses. No deferred tax asset has been recognised 
in respect of the remaining $1.7 million (2011: $1.7 million) as it is not considered probable 
that there will be future taxable profits available. The whole unrecognised loss balance may  
be carried forward indefinitely.

TLA Worldwide PLC     Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generat-
ing units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit from that business combination. Before recogni-
tion of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill had been allocated as follows:
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications 
that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of all three CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. 
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, 
growth rates and expected changes to contractual revenue and direct costs during the period. 
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assess-
ments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The unit cash flows were discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 11.5% (2011: 11.5%) 
which the directors believe adequately reflects current market assessment in respect of both 
the time value of money and the risk specific to each CGU. This discount factor was considered 
to be appropriate for all the units, given their geography and market sector. 
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of each CGUs carrying 
value. A decline of 15% to cash flows would result in the carrying value of goodwill being 
reduced to its recoverable amount.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets 
approved by management for the next five years and extrapolates cash flows for the following 
five years based on an estimated growth rate of 0% (2011: 0%). This rate does not exceed the 
average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
As a consequence the directors do not consider any need for impairment to goodwill as at  
31 December 2012.

TLA Worldwide PLC     13. Acquisitions
peter e greenberg & associates (peg)
On 11 November 2012, through its wholly owned subsidiary TLA Acquisitions Limited, the 
Group acquired the trade and certain assets of PEG. The Company focuses on baseball 
representation and has 13 Major League Baseball, including five All-star, players as clients. 
The consideration for PEG was made up as follows:
 w initial cash consideration of $3.1 million, reduced by a working capital adjustment of  
$0.7 million, payable on completion;
 w a further payment in cash of $0.2 million on 31 July 2013; 
 w $1.3m satisfied by the issue of the TLA (NY) Inc. consideration shares upon completion of 
the acquisition (which can, in accordance with the terms of the exchange agreement, be 
exchanged for 3,326,029 Ordinary Shares in the capital of TLA Worldwide plc at any time  
at the option of the vendors); and
 w up to $7.1million, payable in five earn-out payments. These earn-out payments can be 
earned if either the individual annual EBIT targets or the cumulative five-year EBIT target 
are met or exceeded. The Company has the option to pay 30% of each earn-out in shares 
instead of cash. Management has assigned a fair value of £4.9m to these payments.
The goodwill of $4.8 million arising from the acquisition consists of synergies arising from the 
acquisition, the acquiree’s assembled workforce and anticipated future profits arising from access 
to new markets. $4.8m of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
The fair value of the 3,326,029 Ordinary Shares issued as part of the consideration paid for 
PEG ($1.3 million) was determined at a value of 24.5 pence per share, being the average price 
at which the Group’s Ordinary Shares were traded on AIM during the period of seven (7) days 
ending at the close of trading on 16 October 2012). This valuation has been used as TLA (NY) 
Inc. shares are convertible at any time at the vendor’s option into TLA Worldwide plc shares. 
The conversion of these shares is not contingent on any future events. 
The contingent consideration arrangement requires the PEG business to achieve set earnings 
targets over a five-year period. The potential undiscounted amount of all future payments that 
TLA Worldwide plc could be required to make under the contingent consideration arrangement 
is between $nil and $7.1million.
The fair value of the contingent consideration arrangement of $4.9 million (discounted to 
present value) was estimated based on the anticipated earnings of PEG.

    Annual Report 2012 Acquisition-related costs (included in exceptional items) amount to $0.6 million. PEG contrib-

date of acquisition and the balance sheet date. It is not deemed practical to disclose revenue 
or profit if the acquisition occurred on 1 January 2012 as PEG historically produced financial 
statements on a cash basis. 
fair value adjustments in respect to prior year acquisitions: agency
On 8 December 2011, through its wholly owned subsidiary TLA Acquisitions Limited, the 
Group acquired certain business and assets of Goal Marketing Group and The Agency Sports 
Management LLC. 
The fair value of net assets acquired has been revised since the provisional figures stated in 
the 31 December 2011 year-end accounts and are stated as follows:
The goodwill of $6.1 million arising from the acquisition consists of synergies arising from the 
acquisition, the acquiree’s assembled workforce and anticipated future profits arising from 
access to new markets. $6.1 million of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax 
purposes.
fair value adjustments in respect to prior year acquisitions: legacy
On 8 December 2011, through its wholly owned subsidiary TLA Acquisitions Limited, the Group 
acquired certain business and assets of Legacy. The Company focuses on baseball representa-
tion and has 13 Major League Baseball All-star players as clients.
The fair value of net assets acquired have been revised since the provisional figures stated in 
the 31 December 2011 year-end accounts and are stated as follows:
   
* Amounts restated reflect receivables acquired which were impaired as a result of a fair value exercise undertaken in

trade receivables
Amounts receivable from trade customers are non-interest bearing and are generally on 
30 –60 day terms.
Trade receivables disclosed above include amounts (see overleaf for aged analysis) which are 
past due at the reporting date but against which the Group has not recognised an allowance 
for doubtful receivables because there has not been a significant change in credit quality and 
the amounts are still considered recoverable. The average age of these receivables is 56 days 
(2011: 58 days).
65
    Annual Report 2012 In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in 
the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the 
reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large 
and unrelated.
The directors have considered the material receivables that are past due dates with senior 
management directly responsible for those relationships. On the basis of these discussions 
and the credit control procedures in place the directors consider that these receivables are 
recoverable. The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables is 
approximately equal to their fair value.
15. Trade and other payables
Trade creditors and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases 
and ongoing costs. The average credit period taken for trade purchases is 40 days (2011:  
40 days). For most suppliers no interest is charged on the trade payables for the first 30 days 
from the date of the invoice. Thereafter, interest is charged on the outstanding balances at 
various interest rates. The Group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure 
that all payables are paid within the pre-agreed credit terms.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their  
fair value.
* Amounts restated reflect additional liabilities acquired which were recognised as a result of a fair value exercise 
undertaken in 2012. See note 13.

TLA Worldwide PLC     All borrowings are denominated in US dollars. The other principal features of the Company’s 
borrowings are as follows:
 w interest is charged at 4% above US LIBOR;
 w the loan is secured against trade receivables and contracted revenue;
 w repayments are made quarterly evenly over the life of the loan; and
 w the loan is for five years and expires on 8 December 2016.
17. Derivative financial instruments
On 16 December 2011 the Group entered into an interest rate swap of 5.22% for the period  
8 December 2011 to 2 December 2016 for $10 million of its borrowings.
The swap is designated a hedge of the interest rate expenses relating to the Group loans.  
The contract was marked to market on 31 December 2012 and had a fair value liability 
of $129,000 (31 December 2011: $78,000). In accordance with IAS 39 the loss has been 
recognised as an expense in the period.
The interest rate swap’s contractual maturity is summarised below:

    Annual Report 2012 18. Deferred consideration
Under the terms of the acquisition agreements in relation to Agency, Legacy and PEG,  
the Company has obligations to the vendors of those businesses as set out below:
In addition to the liabilities detailed above an additional $12,177,000 (2011: $10,866,000) 
consideration payable in one to two years is to be settled by way of the issue of shares. This 
issue is not contingent on any future event and is therefore considered an equity item (see 
note 21). 
The cash-deferred consideration requires the conversion into cash of the EBIT underlying the 
earn-out payment prior to its payment date. The extent to which this has not achieved the 
earn-out is reduced by the cash shortfall.
The Group has estimated the fair value of this liability based on the anticipated future EBIT of 
each underlying business. This value has then been discounted back to present value using the 
Group’s borrowing rate of 5.22%. 
The Group has the option to settle 30% of the $5,021,000 payable to PEG in shares in TLA 
(NY) INC. In accordance with the terms of the exchange agreement, these shares can be 
exchanged for Ordinary Shares in the capital of TLA Worldwide plc at any time at the option of 
the vendors. These payments are made annually for the next five years.

TLA Worldwide PLC     19. Operating leases
The Group’s future minimum operating lease payments are as follows:
The above represents a number of office premises. During the year $0.4m (23-day period 
ended 31 December 2011: $0.1m) was recognised as an expense in the income statement. 
20. Share capital
The issued share capital of the Company and the changes during the year can be summarised 
as follows:
On 11 November 2012 the Group placed 11,028,634 new Ordinary Shares on to AIM with a 
nominal value of £220,573 ($350,710). These shares were issued at a price of 23p with share 
premium of $3,682,460. 
On 28 December 2012 the Group settled a deferred consideration liability with the issue of 
12,593,253 Ordinary Shares with a prescribed value of 20p per share. These shares held a 
nominal value of £251,885 ($405,503) with a premium of $3,649,524. The Group held the 
option to settle this liability in cash or Ordinary Shares in TLA Worldwide plc. As such, in 
accordance with IAS39, this liability was presented as a financial liability until the point  
of issue. 
The Company has one class of Ordinary Shares which carry no right to fixed income.
21. Equity
The Share Premium arises from capital raised through the issue of Ordinary Shares to the 
extent that the nominal value is exceeded by the proceeds of the issue.
Shares to be issued reflect deferred consideration payable in respect to acquisitions made 
in the period. This issue is not contingent on any future event and is therefore considered an 
equity item (see note 13).

TLA Worldwide PLC     23. Notes of cash flow statement
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short-term bank deposits with an original 
maturity of three months or less. The carrying amount of these assets is approximately equal 
to their fair value.
24. Capital commitments
The Group had no commitments to purchase property, plant and equipment (2011: none).
25. Related parties
Greg Genske is deemed to be a related party as a beneficiary of the agreement relating to 
the acquisition of LS Legacy Sports LLC. As at 31 December 2012 he was owed $3,674 by the 
Company(31 December 2011: $9,386).
Jordan Bazant is deemed to be a related party as a beneficiary of the agreement relating to  
the acquisition of Goal Marketing, LLC, Goal Marketing II, LLC and The Agency Sports  
Management, LLC. As at 31 December 2012 a loan of $100,000 from the Company was 
outstanding (31 December 2011: $nil). The loan is repayable from Jordan Bazant’s future  
earn-out consideration.
26. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty
The preparation of financial information in conformity with IFRS requires the Group to make 
certain judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. These estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to 
be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or 
conditions.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to 
accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revi-
sion affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision 
affects both current and future periods. The Directors consider that the most significant area of 
accounting estimate relates to trade receivables, where clients have not settled in accordance

critical judgements in applying the group’s accounting policies
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (which are 
dealt with separately below), that the directors have made in the process of applying the 
Group’s accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recog-
nised in financial statements.
Impairment of goodwill
The carrying amount of goodwill is $29.0 million. The directors are confident that the 
carrying amount of goodwill is fairly stated, and have carried out an impairment review 
(note 10).
Other intangible assets
The valuation of client relationships and client contracts is based on key assumptions, 
which the directors have assessed, and are satisfied that the carrying value of these 
assets is fairly stated (see note 11). An impairment review has been carried out.
Fair value on acquisition
On acquisition management are required by IFRS3 to assess the fair value of assets and 
liabilities acquired. These assets and liabilities are often held at historical cost which in 
some instances does not equal fair value.  
The directors have assessed the fair value of assets and liabilities in respect of the 
acquisition of the trade and certain assets. 
Deferred consideration
The directors have provided an estimate of the amount payable in respect of deferred 
contingent consideration. The valuation of this liability is based on future earnings of 
each acquired business. Management apply judgement in estimating the anticipated 
future cash flows and subsequent amounts payable. See note 18.
Recognition of revenue
Revenue is measured as the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and 
comprises amounts billed to clients in respect of fees earned and commission-based 
income and is stated exclusive of any relevant sales taxes. Revenue is recognised on 
an accruals basis in line with the provision of relevant services under the terms of the 
contract, provided that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group 
and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
Trade receivables 
The Group’s customers include athletes, talent and large corporations. While dependant 
on its most high-profile clients, the Board believe that it has structures in place to 
mitigate the risk of non-payment. In addition, the regulatory framework around Major 
League Baseball in particular underpins this confidence. Historically there have been few 
instances of non-payment, with late payers settling outstanding balances in an acceptable 
time frame. The enlarged group has more than 130 clients, which spreads the risk going 
forward. It is a focus of the Board to closely monitor receivables as part of its KPIs.
27. Financial risk management objectives
capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as 
going concerns while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the 
debt and equity balance. The Group’s overall strategy remains unchanged from 2011.
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, which includes the borrowings 
disclosed in note 16 after deducting cash and cash equivalents, and equity attributable to 
72
TLA Worldwide PLC     equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as 
disclosed in note 21. 
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
Debt is defined as long- and short-term borrowings (excluding derivatives) as detailed in note 16.
Equity includes all capital and reserves of the Group that are managed as capital.
significant accounting policies
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted (including the criteria for 
recognition, the basis of measurement and the bases for recognition of income and expenses) 
for each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed within 
the principal accounting policies section of this report.
categories of financial instruments
Financial liabilities and assets included in the balance sheet are as follows:
All of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities, excluding derivative financial instruments, 
are held at amortised cost. The directors are of the opinion that there is no material difference 
between the book value and the fair value of any of these assets or liabilities.
financial risk management objectives
The Group’s international operations expose it to a number of risks that include the effect 
of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, credit and interest rates. As the majority of 
income and expenditure is in USD ,the main exchange risk is translational in effect to the earn-
ings and dividends granted, when related to the share price in GBP. The Group holds external 
credit, which is discussed overleaf.

    Annual Report 2012 Interest rate risk
The Group finances its activities through a mixture of retained cash, operating cash flow, 
bank debt and equity finance. The Group monitors its exposure to interest rate risk in 
association with the bank debt and when investing its cash resources and has taken the 
decision to fix its rates at 5.22% for a period of five years to 2 December 2016. Given this 
interest rate swap, interest rate fluctuations are not currently seen as sensitive.
Credit risk
The Group’s customers include athletes, talent and large corporations. While dependant 
on its most high-profile clients, the Board believe that it has structures in place to 
mitigate the risk of non-payment. In addition, the regulatory framework around Major 
League Baseball in particular underpins this confidence. Historically there have been few 
instances of non-payment, with late payers settling outstanding balances in an acceptable 
time frame. The enlarged group has more than 130 clients, which spreads the risk going 
forward. It is a focus of the Board to closely monitor receivables as part of its KPIs.
Liquidity risk
The Group has continued to maintain positive cash resources well above working capital 
requirements, providing a strong balance sheet visible to the Group’s customer base, 
but also ensuring sufficient available funds for operations, potential expansion or the 
potential financing of small acquisitions.
The following tables detail the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its non-deriv-
ative financial liabilities with agreed repayment periods. The tables have been drawn up 
based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on 
which the Group can be required to pay.

loan together with a $7 million revolver. The revolver is undrawn and is available to fund any 
future acquisitions as well as general corporate purposes.

    Annual Report 2012 We have audited the parent company financial 
statements of TLA Worldwide plc for the year ended 
31 December 2012, which comprise Parent Company 
Balance Sheet and the related notes 1 to 10.  
The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 
3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a 
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are respon-
sible for the preparation of the parent company financial statements and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on 
the parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Independent  
auditor’s report  
to the members of  
TLA Worldwide plc
76
TLA Worldwide PLC     Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Audit-
ing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial 
statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual 
report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become 
aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications 
for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the parent company financial statements:
 w give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2012;
 w have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice; and
 w have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the  
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for  
which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the parent company financial 
statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 
requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
 w adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns 
adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
 w the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records 
and returns; or
 w certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 w we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Other matters
We have reported separately on the group financial statements of TLA Worldwide plc for the 
year ended 31 December 2012.

Financial instruments issued by the Company are treated as equity (i.e. forming part of 
shareholders’ funds) only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions:
 w They include no contractual obligations upon the Company to deliver cash or other financial 
assets or exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under condi-
tions that are potentially unfavourable to the Company; and
 w Where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s equity instruments, it is 
either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the 
Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company 
exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own 
equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial 
liability. The instruments for call-up share capital and share premium account excludes 
amounts in relation to those shares.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance 
expenses. Finance payments associated with financial instruments that are classified in equity 
are dividends and are recorded directly in equity.

Introduction
Aldermore is a specialist lender, supporting UK SMEs, homeowners 
and landlords. Enjoying the advantages of modern, legacy-free 
and scaleable systems, our expert underwriters are able to make 
considered credit decisions rather than adopting a “computer says 
yes or no” approach. We are able to focus on customers who are 
often under- or poorly served by the wider market.
Diversification is a central theme of our strategy. In our lending 
portfolio, we focus on prime creditworthy customers across lending 
lines chosen for their large market sizes, high levels of tangible asset 
security and attractive risk adjusted returns. Across our funding 
base, which is anchored by our dynamic online savings proposition, 
diversification, along with falling interest rates, has been a key driver 
of our reducing cost of funds in recent years. Through the extension 
of our distribution capability, we are reaching more customers 
through multiple channels and aim to differentiate our service by 
being easy to do business with and making quick, consistent and 
transparent credit decisions.
Our DNA is to be Reliable, Expert, Dynamic and Straightforward 
and this informs everything we do, creating the basis of our culture 
and brand. We have a proven ability to leverage our specialist 
underwriting capability into adjacent market segments and are 
confident of achieving our strategic growth and financial objectives 
while maintaining a prudent risk appetite and strong capital base.

In our first Annual Report and Accounts 
as a listed company, we are pleased to 
report another year of strong lending 
growth and record levels of profitability. 
The past year has been one of 
tremendous achievement for Aldermore. 
This report provides considerable detail 
about this and about our governance, 
strategy, remuneration, risk and 
financial results.
Another year of 
strong performance
At IPO, we described our journey to 
generate both further scale and strong, 
sustainable returns for our shareholders. 
2015 marks another year of significant 
progress with lending to customers now 
at £6.1 billion and the Group already 
generating what we believe are attractive 
and sustainable returns. Our financial 
performance reflects the successful 
execution of our strategy and the strength 
of our business model. We remain 
confident that we are well positioned for 
further success.
Profit before tax on a reported basis 
increased by 88 per cent to £94.7 million. 
We generated earnings per share of 
22.7 pence, up by 75 per cent compared 
with 2014 and our return on equity 
increased by 6.2 per cent to 19.7 per cent.
Once again, we lent more than ever to 
UK SMEs, homeowners and landlords. 
Driven by record organic origination of 
£2.6 billion, net loans increased by 28 per 
cent to £6.1 billion. Although marginally 
below our target, this represents a strong 
performance supported by net loan 
growth in SME Commercial Mortgages 
of 50 per cent, Residential Mortgages of 
42 per cent, Asset Finance of 29 per cent 
and Buy-to-Let of 18 per cent. 
We also continue to benefit from 
a diversified funding base with our 
innovative, online savings franchise 
at its core. Matching the increase in 
our lending to customers, we have 
grown deposits by 29 per cent to reach 
£5.7 billion. Once again, within this, our 
SME deposits business has delivered 
excellent growth, with total balances of 
£1.4 billion up by 37 per cent in the year, 
and forms a key plank of our ongoing 
diversification strategy.
Across the business, we now support 
around 195,000 customers who we 
continue to impress, with 97 per cent of 
customers who posted feedback via our 
website saying they would recommend us 
to friends and family. Our Net Promoter 
Score, which measures customer loyalty, 
is 22, remains consistently strong and well 
above the UK banking industry average 
of 2.
Strong balance sheet 
Through our IPO, we built our capital 
position to ensure that we continue 
to remain well ahead of our minimum 
regulatory requirements as we fund the 
Group’s growth. Our fully loaded CRD IV 
CET1 ratio at 11.8 per cent remains ahead 
of both regulatory requirements and our 
target of around 11 per cent.
Our loan to deposit ratio remained 
broadly stable at 107 per cent as we 
continue to manage the balance between 
wholesale and deposit funding to drive 
an efficient cost of funds. Our funding is 
very well diversified by type and by size of 
individual depositor. Strategic report

Rigorous focus on prudent 
risk management
Prudent risk management is central to 
our operations and 2015 saw further 
ongoing enhancements.
Our approach to credit is prudent. 
The vast majority of our loans are well 
secured with tangible collateral and 
affordability tests applied on origination 
where applicable, with the portfolio 
being regularly stress tested thereafter. 
Albeit in a relatively benign interest rate 
environment, we have experienced low 
levels of arrears and our cost of risk has 
fallen to 19 basis points in 2015. Within our 
chosen lending lines, we avoid any undue 
concentration risks including by size of 
borrower, geography and industry. 
We also overhauled our Risk Management 
Framework to respond to the increasing 
scale and sophistication of our business 
and to meet best practice industry and 
regulatory standards. We considerably 
expanded our risk management 
resources in 2015 following an earlier 
investment in 2014.
Financial crime and cyber security is a 
growing threat in today’s world. In 2015, 
we invested significantly to improve our 
defences and will continue to do so in the 
coming year.
Continued investment 
and innovation 
To remain competitive and to ensure 
sustainability, we are continuously 
investing in our core systems and 
our digital capabilities. In 2015, we 
further enhanced our core systems to 
expand capacity, improve functionality, 
efficiencies and control. We delivered 
a new asset and liability management 
system which enhances our dynamic 
modelling capability enabling us to more 
efficiently manage liquidity and interest 
rate risk. We initiated the upgrading of 
our Asset Finance back office and our 
Mortgages platforms, investments which 
continue into 2016. Across the Group, we 
outsourced our IT infrastructure support 
to enhance our round the clock support 
capability and allow our strengthened 
internal team to focus on delivering our 
technology strategy to enhance our 
enterprise architecture, security and 
digital capability.
We paved the way for further 
transparency in the industry when, three 
years ago, we became the first bank in 
the UK to allow customers to rate and 
review our services online. In 2015, we 
continued to set standards by launching 
our SME Rate Checker tool, which enables 
business owners to check the rates of over 
90 savings institutions to see the current 
rate of interest being earned on their 
current or business savings account. 
A successful IPO
As noted above, we listed Aldermore in 
March 2015. Just over three months later, 
we were delighted to be admitted to the 
FTSE 250. 
The listing allowed us to raise gross 
primary capital of £75 million to ensure 
that we continue to remain well ahead of 
our minimum regulatory requirements 
as we fund the Group’s growth. 
Going forward, as we build further scale, 
retained profits will fund our incremental 
CET1 requirements organically. As we said 
at the time of the IPO, we will consider 
paying an initial dividend from 2017 taking 
into account the growth opportunities 
available to the Company at the time 
and the associated capital requirements. 
This continues to be our intention.
The IPO also enabled our principal 
shareholders, collectively AnaCap 
Financial Partners LP , AnaCap Financial 
Partners II, LP , AnaCap Derby Co-
investment (No.1) LP and AnaCap Derby 
Co-investment (No.2) LP , to reduce their 
equity interest in Aldermore to 53 per 
cent. As is natural for private equity, 
our principal shareholders continued 
the transition of Aldermore to public 
ownership and this interest was further 
reduced to 40 per cent in September 
2015. The liquidity in our stock, therefore, 
has improved as a result.
An evolving 
regulatory landscape
The chart on the left shows the movement 
in the Aldermore share price, indexed to 
100, from our listing in March until the end 
of 2015. As can be seen, our share price 
performed strongly in the initial months 
after IPO but since then has experienced 
significant volatility. In the period from 
float to the end of the year, our share price 
rose from 192p at the pricing of our IPO to 
close at 231.5p on 31 December, having 
closed as high as 316p during July. 
As can be seen in the chart overleaf, the 
volatility in our share price and across 
the wider financial markets continued 
throughout the first two months of 2016. 
However, more recently, we seen some 
recovery with the share price closing at 
224.3p on 4 March 2016. 05 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Strategic report Corporate governance Remuneration Risk management Financial statements Appendices
The disconnect between the continued 
strong financial and operational 
performance of the business, which 
has delivered a 75 per cent increase in 
EPS during 2015, and the share price 
performance is clear. Your Board of 
Directors is disappointed by the impact 
on shareholder value of the share price 
movement and so it is appropriate 
to consider the main causes and our 
perspective on these.
Having discussed this at length with our 
major shareholders and advisers, we 
believe that this disconnect comes down 
to the market’s changing perception of 
the business risk to our future growth 
prospects. Broadly speaking, there are 
two major themes at play: the evolving 
regulatory landscape in which we operate 
and global financial markets’ volatility 
in 2016.
Firstly, the impact of the following 
regulatory announcements made in the 
second half of 2015:
• A new corporation tax surcharge of 
8 per cent on all UK banking profits 
above £25 million applicable from 
1 January 2016
• Measures by the UK Government 
to dampen the buy-to-let market by 
restricting relief on mortgage interest 
payments to the basic rate of income 
tax from 2017 and by adding an extra 
3 per cent stamp duty on buy-to-let 
and second home purchases from 
April 2016
• Possible additional powers to be 
granted to the Financial Policy 
Committee of the Bank of England to 
further dampen buy-to-let by placing 
limits on loan-to-value ratios and 
interest coverage ratios
• A Basel Committee consultation paper 
that proposes raising standardised risk 
weightings on buy-to-let mortgages 
which is expected to be effective from 
2019 if agreed upon
The bank surcharge will impact our 
returns and, as a result, we now believe 
our percentage return on equity will be in 
the high-teens going forward. However, 
buy-to-let remains a key element of UK 
housing stock with continuing demand 
expected to be driven by factors 
including net migration into the UK, the 
reduced availability of social housing and 
affordability pressures on potential owner 
occupiers. We represent a small part of 
the overall market and believe that this 
lending segment remains attractive from 
both a growth and return perspective. 
The Basel Committee proposals are 
still only at a consultation stage but we 
have already started work to understand 
the requirements to transition to an 
IRB approach and use our own internal 
credit models rather than standardised 
risk weightings. 
The second theme has arisen in the 
early part of 2016 and hit the entire 
European banking sector without 
discrimination. Bank share prices were 
subject to increased volatility as a result 
of heightened fears about slowing 
global growth and the limited policy 
responses available to address this, 
with a particular concern about the use 
of negative interest rates that would 
hurt bank margins. As the UK economy 
appears to be in better shape than most 
other developed economies, (albeit with 
Brexit raising uncertainties), Aldermore, 
as a robust UK-focused business, should 
be somewhat insulated from these 
concerns. Certainly, at present, we are 
not seeing any loss of confidence in our 
customer base.
In conclusion, we continue to focus on 
building Aldermore’s track record of 
delivery and remain confident of our 
ability to deliver continued nominal net 
loan growth in line with recent run rates 
and strong, sustainable returns. 
A differentiated and 
diversified strategy
Aldermore is a diversified specialist lender 
focused on segments of large, growing 
markets which are under- or poorly served 
by the wider market and which provide 
numerous opportunities to deliver strong 
profitable growth. Our business model 
gives us significant operational leverage 
as we distribute primarily via specialist 
broker intermediaries, rather than through 
a costly branch network, and we have 
modern, scaleable systems and digital 
capability. As we have grown in size, our 
income growth is exceeding our cost 
growth and we are making good progress 
towards our cost/income ratio target of 
less than 40 per cent by the end of 2017 .

Chairman’s and Chief Executive Officer’s review
continued

 BDRC Continental, SME Finance Monitor Q3 2015.
We have a clear strategy for delivering 
further profitable growth based on the 
following high level drivers:
• We have a diversified lending 
portfolio which gives us multiple 
options for growth. As our 2015 results 
demonstrate, we are not reliant on any 
one business
• We have small shares of our 
addressable markets which provides 
ample opportunity for growth as 
we drive incremental increases in 
market share
• We continued to extend our 
distribution reach and mix, deepening 
relationships with existing brokers, 
establishing new relationships and, 
in tandem, developing our direct 
distribution capability 
• We continue to invest in technology to 
improve our customers’ experience of 
doing business with us and our ability to 
innovate, which helps us to both attract 
new customers and retain existing ones
• We have proven our ability to leverage 
our specialist underwriting capability 
into adjacent market segments, for 
example IT and telephony assets in 
Asset Finance and Bridging loans 
in Mortgages.
These factors taken together are hugely 
supportive of our future growth potential 
and we are confident therefore that this 
business will continue to deliver nominal 
net loan growth in line with recent 
run rates. 
Corporate governance
As a public company and regulated 
banking business, we strongly believe 
that effective corporate governance is 
fundamental to our business success. 
We have been fully compliant with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code 2014 
from the date of our listing. Your Board of 
Directors has ensured that best practice 
governance standards have been fully 
embedded. Towards the end of 2015, we 
undertook a Board effectiveness review, 
overseen by our Senior Independent 
Director and Company Secretary, to 
validate our effectiveness.
In June 2015, we further strengthened the 
Board with the appointment of Robert 
Sharpe as an Independent Non-Executive 
Director and member of the Risk and 
Audit Committees. Robert brings a 
wealth of experience in retail banking with 
a particular focus on mortgage lending 
and, as such, he complements the broad 
expertise we are able to draw upon as 
a Board.
We would particularly like to thank Mark 
Stephens, Deputy CEO and Group 
Commercial Director, who left during 
2015, for his enormous contribution to 
Aldermore. We had strong succession 
plans in place and Mark’s departure saw 
us welcome Carl D’Ammassa, as Group 
Managing Director of Business Finance, 
and Charles Haresnape, as Group 
Managing Director of Mortgages, to the 
Executive Committee. 
Customers and communities
Our customers and communities are key 
to our success and our strong relationship 
with these groups is discussed in detail on 
page 22.
We recognise that we have a 
responsibility to play our part in the UK’s 
financial services community, which 
includes taking part in Government 
schemes to support SMEs, homeowners 
and savers. We continue to be one of the 
most active lenders in the Funding for 
Lending Scheme (FLS) and were pleased 
to be the third largest net lender to SMEs 
under FLS in 2015. 
Our support for the Help to Buy scheme 
also goes back several years. We were 
one of the first lenders to take part in the 
Government’s Help to Buy scheme and 
the first to allow borrowers to remortgage 
onto Help to Buy products. In late 
2015, we were pleased to be one of the 
first organisations to offer the Help to 
Buy: ISA.
Outlook
As described earlier, the global 
economy has been full of gloomy news 
in the first two months of 2016. The UK 
economy, however, looks to be one of 
the more resilient developed economies 
notwithstanding that more recently, the 
Brexit in/out debate and referendum 
is introducing risk and uncertainty and 
we have seen sterling under pressure 
as a result. The UK also continues to 
experience a period of stable, low interest 
rates with current market expectations for 
the first interest rate rise now pushed out 
to 2018.
We are a purely UK-focused bank and 
our customer base remains positive. 
SME confidence continues to be resilient, 
with recent surveys showing that almost 
half of SMEs intend to grow in 2016
1
. 
As discussed, we believe underlying 
demand in buy-to-let will remain 
resilient to regulatory changes and in 
the residential mortgages market, the 
UK Government is supporting various 
initiatives to encourage first time buyers 
which should stimulate further growth in 
this segment.
Looking forward to 2016, there are risks 
and uncertainties that will challenge 
us, but we have a proven strategy and 
business model and a capacity to be fast 
and agile, so we are confident that we will 
continue to deliver further growth and 
increasing profitability.
We would like to thank our staff for 
their dedication and commitment, our 
customers for their valued business 
and our shareholders for their 
ongoing support.

Strategic report
Chief Financial Officer’s review
2015 was another excellent year financially 
for the Group. We delivered record levels 
of profitability, with reported profit before 
tax up by 88 per cent to £94.7 million, and 
continued strong lending growth. 
Net loans of £6.1 billion
We continued to support UK SMEs, 
homeowners and landlords and increased 
our net lending to customers by over 
£1.3 billion or 28 per cent to £6.1 billion 
(31 December 2014: £4.8 billion). 
Although marginally below our target, 
this strong performance was driven 
by excellent organic origination of 
£2.6 billion, up 10 per cent on the 
prior year.
Total assets exceeded £7 billion, an 
increase of 26 per cent on 2014. 
Continued 
funding diversification
We remain primarily deposit funded but 
continue to diversify our funding base 
through wholesale sources including the 
Bank of England’s Funding for Lending 
Scheme (FLS), RMBS and a small amount 
of Tier 2 debt securities.

Chief Financial Officer’s review 
continued
Our savers continue to be attracted by 
our innovative online proposition and 
we grew total deposits by 29 per cent to 
£5.7 billion during 2015. We continued to 
diversify our deposit base, growing our 
SME deposits strongly by 37 per cent to 
£1.4 billion. Corporate deposits, which 
we launched in December 2014, now 
total £156 million and we are pleased by 
this progress.
Our loans to deposits ratio is 107 per cent, 
broadly in line with the position at the end 
of 2014 and reflects our ability to match 
lending and deposit growth. 
As at 31 December 2015, Wholesale 
funding includes £0.4 billion of FLS, where 
we were pleased to be the third largest 
net lender to SMEs under this scheme in 
2015, £0.2 billion of RMBS, reflecting the 
outstanding balance on our April 2014 
issuance, and a small amount, around 
£38 million, of Tier 2 debt securities, which 
are callable in May 2017 .
As a result of the above, total liabilities 
grew by 25 per cent to £6.5 billion 
(31 December 2014: £5.2 billion).
Raised £75 million of gross 
primary equity
As at 31 December 2015, total equity was 
£534 million, an increase of 41 per cent 
on the prior year due primarily to the 
increase in retained earnings driven by 
profit after tax for the year of £78.3 million 
and the issuance of £75 million of gross 
primary equity at our IPO in March 2015 
(£72.3 million net of costs).
Interest income reflects 
continued loan growth
The 28 per cent growth in net lending 
drives the 32 per cent growth in interest 
income to £300.4 million for 2015 
(2014: £227 .8 million). We are particularly 
pleased to have achieved this growth 
whilst maintaining the overall gross 
interest margin broadly constant at 5.5 
per cent (2014: 5.6 per cent). 
As described above, we continued 
to diversify our funding base and as a 
result, of this and further movement in 
market deposit rates, our cost of funding 
reduced to 1.9 per cent (2014: 2.1 per 
cent). Interest expense has therefore only 
grown at 16 per cent to £101.5 million 
(2014: £87 .6 million). 
As a result, we delivered a 42 per cent 
increase in net interest income to 
£198.9 million (2014: £140.2 million) whilst 
also driving the expected 0.2 percentage 
point improvement in the net interest 
margin to 3.6 per cent (2014: 3.4 per cent).
Stable net fee and other 
operating income
Net fee and other operating income 
was broadly flat on the prior year at 
£25.6 million (2014: £26.0 million) with fee 
and commission income down by 5 per 
cent to £25.2 million (2014: £26.4 million) 
and a reduction in fee and commission 
expense of 10 per cent to £7 .0 million 
(2014: £7 .8 million) driven predominantly 
by Invoice Finance but partially offset 
by increased Asset Finance fees as this 
business has grown. Other operating 
income is mainly related to Invoice 
Finance and is in line with 2014 at 
£7 .4 million for both years.

“We delivered record profitability and 
continued strong growth in 2015. ”
James Mack, Chief Financial Officer
Net investment income
Net derivatives income and gains on 
disposal of debt securities shows a profit 
of £0.2 million (2014: £1.2 million expense) 
with a £2.1 million net expense from 
derivatives offset by a £2.3 million gain on 
disposal of the related debt securities. 
Operating income
As a result, we delivered a 36 per 
cent increase in operating income to 
£224.7 million (2014: £165.0 million).
Leveraging our 
operating platform
We have modern systems which 
we continue to invest in to maintain 
scaleability, improve functionality and 
cost efficiency. These systems, plus 
variabilising distribution costs via broker 
distribution plus avoiding expensive 
branch networks, has enabled us to 
grow revenues more quickly than costs. 
Total underlying expenses, excluding 
IPO costs, totalled £115.5 million 
(2014: £99.1 million) an increase of 17 per 
cent on the prior year and in line with our 
previous guidance of mid-teens per cent 
growth for the year.
The components of the cost base 
are shown in the table above. 
Other administrative expenses have 
grown by 18 per cent to £107 .9 million 
(2014: £91.6 million) mainly due to a 
24 per cent increase in staff costs as 
we increased the average number of 
employees by 12 per cent to 845.
A more detailed split of administrative 
expenses including provisions and IPO 
related costs can be found in Note 11 of 
the financial statements.
Provisions predominantly reflect the 
levy for the UK Government’s Financial 
Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) 
which offers protection to individual 
deposit holders on amounts up to 
£75,000. The levy for 2015 was £2.2 million 
(2014: £ 2.6 million).
The Group listed on the London Stock 
Exchange on 13 March 2015 and the 
related costs charged to the income 
statement for 2015 were £4.1 million 
(2014: £6.0 million).
Depreciation and amortisation was 
£5.3 million (2014: £3.9 million) with the 
increase over 2014 due to increased levels 
of amortisation on computer software 
reflecting the higher opening balance and 
additions during the year.
Improved cost/income ratio 
We continue to make good progress 
towards our target cost/income ratio of 
less than 40 per cent by the end of 2017 
with a 9 percentage point reduction 
during the year in our underlying cost/
income ratio to 51 per cent (2014: 60 per 
cent) which excludes IPO costs.
Rigorous credit 
risk management
Our continued focus on prudent credit 
risk management, as well as the benefit of 
the relatively benign credit environment, 
is reflected in the strong cost of risk of 
19bps (2014: 23bps). Impairment losses 
increased by 8 per cent to £10.4 million 
(2014: £9.6 million) reflecting growth in the 
portfolio and low levels of arrears.
In 2015, the cost of risk benefitted from 
a relatively benign credit environment 
as well as low levels of arrears across the 
portfolio. We continue to believe that, 
over the cycle, the normalised cost of risk 
for the business will be in the mid to high 
30s basis points.
Significant increase 
in profitability
In 2015, we generated profit before 
tax of £94.7 million, an increase of 88 
per cent over 2014 profit before tax of 
£50.3 million. Excluding IPO related 
costs, the underlying profit before tax 
is £98.8 million (2014: £56.3 million), an 
increase of 75 per cent.
Tax
The tax charge for the year increased 
by 38 per cent to £16.4 million 
(2014: £11.9 million) reflecting the Group’s 
increased profitability. However, the 
Group also benefitted from a one-
off revaluation of deferred tax assets 
following the announcement of the 
introduction of the 8 per cent bank 
tax surcharge from 1 January 2016. 
As a result, the effective tax rate for 
2015 was unusually low at 17 .3 per cent 
(2014: 23.7 per cent). Going forward, we 
would expect our effective tax rate to 
move towards the mid-20s percentages 
as we apply the UK statutory tax rate on 
all taxable profits and the additional 8 per 
cent surcharge on taxable banking profits 
above £25 million.
Profit after tax
Profit after tax for 2015 more than doubled 
to £78.3 million (2014: £38.4 million). 
Excluding IPO costs, the underlying profit 
after tax increased by 90 per cent to 
£81.7 million (2014: £43.0 million).
Delivering strong, 
sustainable returns 
Our continued strong improvement in 
profitability drove an improved return 
on equity of 19.7 per cent (2014: 13.5 per 
cent). On an underlying basis, excluding 
IPO related costs, the return on equity 
was 20.6 per cent (2014: 15.1 per cent). 
Return on equity is calculated as returns 
to ordinary shareholders, i.e. profit after 
tax less the post tax AT1 coupon, divided 
by average ordinary shareholders’ equity.
Both RoE measures benefit from the 
one-off deferred tax asset revaluation 
described above which is worth just less 
than 1 percentage point.

Asset Finance
The Asset Finance business delivered 
strong growth in 2015, with net loans 
growing by 29 per cent to £1.3 billion 
(31 December 2014: £1.0 billion) as we 
grew customer numbers by 30 per cent 
to around 42,000 (31 December 2014: 
c33,000). This growth was also driven 
by excellent organic origination which 
increased by 21 per cent to £893 million 
(2014: £740 million). We continued 
develop our IT and telephony assets 
capability, and these assets now comprise 
around 7 per cent of the portfolio. 
We also saw good progress with our 
stocking proposition which we launched 
toward the end of 2014.
Net interest income grew by 40 per 
cent to £51.8 million (2014: £36.9 million) 
driven by growth in lending with the 
net interest margin remaining broadly 
in line with the prior year at 4.3 per cent 
(2014: 4.2 per cent).
Administrative expenses were also 
stable at £12.0 million (2014: £11.9 million). 
We continue to invest to support growth 
and in upgrading our operating platform.
Impairment charges for the year totalled 
£4.8 million (2014: £2.7 million) leading 
to a cost of risk of 40 basis points 
(2014: 31 basis points). The 2015 charge 
reflects low levels of arrears whereas 2014 
benefitted from one significant recovery. 
Asset Finance delivered an excellent 
bottom line performance with the 
segmental result increasing by 55 per cent 
to £39.3 million (2014: £25.4 million).

Invoice Finance
Invoice Finance remains the smallest part 
of the Group at around 3 per cent of the 
total net loan portfolio. At 31 December 
2015, net loans were £0.2 billion 
(31 December 2014: £0.2 billion). 
Customer numbers increased marginally, 
although remain around 1,200. Our trade 
and construction finance propositions 
which were launched toward the end of 
2014 are starting to gain traction. 
Net interest income decreased 
by £0.7 million to £5.3 million 
(2014: £6.0 million) driven by a lower 
average balance during the year with 
the net interest margin broadly flat 
at 3.1 per cent (2014: 3.0 per cent). 
Net fee income was down 13 per cent 
to £15.2 million (2014: £17 .5 million) due 
to smaller average facility sizes and 
improvements in the credit performance 
of the portfolio leading to lower collect 
out fees. However, the latter was 
offset by improvements generated on 
impairments. The net revenue margin 
also remained constant at 12.0 per cent 
(2014: 12.0 per cent). 
We maintained our focus on cost 
management and expenses were 
£14.5 million (2014: £14.7 million). 
In addition to a number of fully provided 
loans being written off, we continue to 
benefit from actions previously taken to 
enhance credit and fraud controls and our 
non-performing loans ratio has reduced 
by 1.61 per cent to 1.51 per cent since the 
start of the year. These actions have also 
led to the improved credit performance 
of the business with impairments 
down by 56 per cent to £1.5 million 
(2014: £3.4 million) leading to a 85 basis 
points improvement in the cost of risk to 
88 basis points (2014: 173 basis points). 
The segmental result decreased 
by £0.9 million to £4.5 million 
(2014: £5.4 million).
SME Commercial Mortgages
In 2015, our SME Commercial Mortgage 
business grew net loans to customers by 
50 per cent to £0.8 billion (31 December 
2014: £0.6 billion) as we grew customer 
numbers by 38 per cent to around 1,500 
(31 December 2014: c1,100). Growth was 
supported by good organic origination, 
up by 42 per cent to £428 million 
(2014: £301 million). We delivered strong 
growth in the Commercial Investment 
portfolio where we focus on multi-let 
developments. We were also particularly 
pleased by the growth in the Property 
Development portfolio, with brokers 
attracted by our high quality service and 
national coverage.
The continued momentum is reflected 
in the increasing net interest income, 
up by 24 per cent to £34.2 million 
(2014: £27 .5 million). The net interest 
margin reduced by 0.8 percentage 
points to 5.0 per cent (2014: 5.8 per 
cent) as a result of the strong growth in 
the relatively lower margin Commercial 
Investment product. 
The Mortgages division is run as one 
business with common platforms and 
some shared teams. We have allocated 
expenses to the three portfolios, 
with front office costs allocated using 
origination activity and back office costs 
allocated on the basis of average loan 
balances. The increase in administration 
expenses of £1.8 million therefore 
predominantly reflects increased 
origination compared with 2014 as well 
as the underlying 15 per cent increase in 
the overall cost base as we continued to 
invest in the business.
As at 31 December 2015, the non-
performing loans ratio was 0.83 per cent. 
Impairment losses decreased by 33 per 
cent to £2.0 million (2014: £3.0 million), 
despite the growth in the portfolio, 
reflecting the low levels of arrears in 
the current relatively benign credit 
environment. As a result, the cost of risk 
has reduced by 34 basis points to 29 basis 
points (2014: 63 basis points). 
The segmental result was strong, 
growing by 25 per cent to £28.2 million 
(2014: £22.6 million).
Buy-to-Let
In 2015, our Buy-to-Let mortgage 
business grew net loans to customers by 
18 per cent to £2.4 billion (31 December 
2014: £2.0 billion) as we grew customer 
numbers by 15 per cent to around 16,000 
(31 December 2014: c14,000). Growth was 
supported by robust organic origination 
of £673 million (2014: £726 million).
Net interest income increased by 28 per 
cent to £73.3 million (2014: £57 .3 million) 
and the net interest margin remained 
broadly constant at 3.3 per cent 
(2014: 3.2 per cent).
The reduction in the allocated 
administration expenses of £0.3 million 
predominantly reflects the impact of 
reduced origination compared with 
2014 offset by the underlying 15 per cent 
increase in the overall cost base.
As at 31 December 2015, the non-
performing loans ratio was 0.21 per 
cent. Impairment losses increased 
by £1.6 million to £1.3 million 
(2014: £0.3 million benefit) as 2014 
benefitted from one unusually large 
recovery and the cost of risk was 6 basis 
points (2014: 2 basis points benefit).
The segmental result was excellent, 
growing by 29 per cent to £66.0 million 
(2014: £51.2 million). 12 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015

Residential Mortgages
In 2015, Residential Mortgages grew 
net loans to customers by 42 per cent to 
£1.4 billion (31 December 2014: £1.0 billion) 
as we grew customer numbers by 40 per 
cent to around 10,000 (31 December 
2014: c7 ,000). Growth was driven by 
organic origination, up by 4 per cent to 
£582 million (2014: £560 million) and was 
supported by a strong performance in 
Help to Buy. 
Net interest income grew by 117 per 
cent to £43.8 million (2014: £20.2 million). 
The net interest margin improved by 
1 percentage points to 3.7 per cent 
(2014: 2.7 per cent) due to the increased 
levels of Help to Buy which, by design, is 
higher loan-to-value lending and attracts 
higher margins. 
The increase in allocated administration 
expenses of £1.0 million predominantly 
reflects increased origination compared 
with 2014 as well as reflecting the 
increased scale of the business.
As at 31 December 2015, the non-
performing loans ratio was 0.29 per cent. 
Impairment losses were unchanged at 
£0.8 million (2014: £0.8 million) despite the 
growth in the portfolio, reflecting the low 
levels of arrears in the current relatively 
benign credit environment. As a result, 
the cost of risk improved to 7 basis points 
(2014: 11 basis points). 
The segmental result was excellent, 
growing by 136 per cent to £40.1 million 
(2014: £17 .0 million).
Central Functions
Central Functions includes the Savings 
division and the Group’s Treasury function 
as well as common costs which are not 
directly attributable to the business lines. 
Common costs include central support 
functions such as Finance, IT, Legal & 
Compliance, Risk and Human Resources.
Net interest income includes the 
interest expense relating to the Tier 2 
subordinated notes and the net interest 
income or expenses element arising from 
derivatives held at fair value in hedging 
relationships, neither of which are 
recharged to the business lines. 
Net fees and other income predominantly 
includes the net expense or income from 
derivatives not in hedging relationships 
and other financial instruments at 
fair value through profit or loss and 
gains on disposals of available for sale 
debt securities. 
Central administrative expenses, 
excluding IPO costs, increased by 25 per 
cent to £70.1 million (2014: £56.1 million) 
mainly driven by an increase in the 
number of head office employees as we 
invested in the central functions ahead 
of the IPO to support life as a listed 
company and to support the growth of 
the business.
Total IPO costs incurred in 2015 were 
£6.8 million (2014: 6.0 million) of which 
£4.1 million (2014: 6.0 million) was charged 
to the P&L with the remainder charged 
to equity.
The segmental result was a charge of 
£83.4 million (2014: charge of £71.3 million)
Capital position
The Group maintains a strong capital 
position and its fully loaded CRD IV total 
capital ratio as at 31 December 2015 was 
15.1 per cent (31 December 2014: 14.8 
per cent). Within this, the Group’s fully 
loaded CRD IV CET1 ratio was 11.8 per 
cent (31 December 2014: 10.4 per cent). 
Our total capital increased by 39 per cent 
to £558.2 million due to retained earnings 
of £78.3 million for the year and the 
£72.3 million of net primary equity raised 
at IPO. At the same time, our capital 
requirement increased as we grew RWAs 
by 37 per cent. 
The Group’s leverage ratio remains 
comfortably above the required minimum 
of 3 per cent at 7 .3 per cent, up from 
6.3 per cent at the end of 2014 due to 
retained earnings for the year as well as 
the equity raised at IPO.
Outlook
We are confident about the prospects 
for the Group. We continue to focus on 
balancing risk and return and remain 
committed to delivering profitable 
growth and strong, sustainable returns 
to shareholders while maintaining our 
prudent and disciplined approach to 
risk management. 
Specifically, in 2016, we expect to deliver:
• nominal net loan growth in line with 
recent run rates
• a broadly flat net interest margin, 
reflecting the low and stable UK interest 
rate environment
• a return on equity percentage in the 
high teens.
• a fully loaded CRD IV CET1 capital ratio 
of around 11 per cent.

Our differentiated approach has enabled strong growth within our prudent risk appetite. 
Aided by a relatively benign environment, our credit losses have been consistently modest.

We benefit from a diversified funding base.
Our lending is funded by a strong and well diversified online retail and SME 
deposit franchise together with a growing amount of wholesale funding.
This diversification, along with falling interest rates, has been a key driver 
of our reducing cost of funds in recent years.

Strategic objectives
Another year of strong delivery
Serving customers’ needs
Aldermore focuses on specialist lending across large lending 
segments which were deliberately chosen for their strong 
collateral characteristics, attractive risk-adjusted returns and 
growth potential. 
We look to leverage the strong market positions we have built, 
with distinctive customer propositions in chosen segments 
while maintaining excellent asset quality.
• We originated £2.6 billion of new loans in 2015 with net loans 
to customers reaching £6.1 billion at the end of 2015
• We maintained our average rating from customers leaving 
feedback via our online “Ratings and Reviews” service at 
4.6 out of 5
Deliver strong, sustainable returns 
to shareholders
The Group leverages its scaleable, efficient and legacy-free 
operating platform to grow revenues more quickly than its 
cost base and deliver long-term, sustainable profitability.
• We continue to invest in our business to ensure its 
sustainability and to leverage our modern and scaleable 
operating platform. Our underlying cost/income ratio
1
 
further improved by 9 percentage points to 51 per cent in 
2015 despite continued investment
• Growth in our balance sheet along with a falling cost/
income ratio and a strong credit performance are driving 
the Group’s profitability, return on equity and earnings per 
share. Underlying return on equity
1
 was 20.6 per cent in 
2015, an increase of 5.5 percentage points over 2014
Maintain prudent risk appetite, capital 
and funding positions
We take a prudent approach towards maintaining a capital 
base that supports the Group’s growth aspirations and 
exceeds regulatory requirements at all times. 
Our funding base is expected to remain predominantly 
deposit-led from retail and SME customers. However, in 
addition, we utilise wholesale sources such as the Bank of 
England’s Funding for Lending Scheme, our Residential 
Mortgage Backed Securitisation (RMBS) and a small amount of 
Tier 2 funding.
• Our cost of risk during the year was 19 basis points due 
to our rigorous focus on credit management leading to 
low levels of arrears in our loan book and was aided by a 
relatively benign credit environment 
• Aldermore holds at all times, regulatory capital in excess of 
the requirements set by the Prudential Regulation Authority 
(PRA) 
• As at 31 December 2015, our fully loaded CRD IV Total 
Capital Ratio was 15.1 per cent and our CET1 ratio was 11.8 
per cent compared with our target of around 11 per cent
• The increase in capital ratios was primarily driven by profit 
after tax for the year of £78 million and the £75 million of 
gross primary capital issued at IPO, partially offset by an 
increased capital requirement due to growth in lending
• At 31 December 2015, our loans to deposits ratio was 107 
per cent, in line with management expectations and the end 
of 2014
Continue to build an engaged and 
committed team
We recognise that for us to be successful, it is important to 
attract and retain a talented workforce. 
The Group aims to hire people who fit culturally and have 
the right competencies. We then empower managers 
with the tools and support they need to increase 
employee engagement.
• 2015 has been an exceedingly busy year for our team who 
have driven the continued operational success of the 
business whilst simultaneously undertaking a listing on the 
London Stock Exchange and operating in a new public 
company environment
• We have continued to focus on training and engagement 
and have also introduced changes to pension, maternity 
and paternity benefits. See page 22 for further details

Aligning the KPIs
We have aligned our key performance 
indicators (KPIs) to the various elements 
of our business model to provide 
additional clarity on how we measure 
and monitor performance and drive the 
business forward. 
Our DNA is to be Reliable, Expert, 
Dynamic and Straightforward – these 
values inform everything we do, forming 
the basis of our culture and brand.
We focus on prime creditworthy 
customers across lending lines chosen 
for their market size, growth potential, 
attractive risk adjusted returns and 
tangible asset security. We distribute 
to our customers through specialist 
brokers but have added growing direct 
distribution capability.
We enjoy the advantages of modern, 
legacy-free systems which we use to 
support our expert underwriters in 
making considered decisions, rather 
than adopting a “computer says yes or 
no” approach. Our operating platform is 
scaleable to support our future growth 
an we continue our investment in 
these systems.
We advance loans on which we earn 
income; these loans are funded via a mix 
of deposits and wholesale funding, on 
which we pay interest. The difference is 
net interest income which grows as we 
expand our loan book. Our cost base 
grows more slowly than our net interest 
income, driving an accelerating profit 
trajectory. This is what we refer to as 
“leveraging our business model” .

Customers, people and communities
Our customers, people and communities 
are an integral part of our business 
model and key to our success. We realise 
that by doing our best for those we 
serve, those who work for us and those 
who are impacted by our activities, 
we are contributing to the success of 
the business and so doing our best for 
shareholders as well.
Our customers
Our customers are at the centre of our 
business and underpin everything that we 
do. We now serve more customers than 
ever – around 195,000 at the end of 2015 
compared with c160,000 at the beginning 
of the year, an increase of 21 per cent. 
We believe in listening to our customers 
to understand what they think of us. 
We actively use customer feedback that 
we receive through our online “Ratings 
and Reviews” service to improve our 
offering. During 2015, we received an 
average rating of 4.6 out of 5, with 97 per 
cent of customers posting feedback 
on our website saying they would 
recommend us, tangibly demonstrating 
the continued strong performance in 
our brand and customer advocacy. 
Further endorsement from our customers, 
as well as our intermediary partners and 
the wider industry, came in the form of 
the 27 awards that we won during the 
year. We are also pleased with our Net 
Promoter Score of 22, which remains 
well ahead of of the UK banking industry 
average of 2.
Customer care is a key focus and all of 
our customer service teams are based in 
the UK. Occasionally, our customers do 
not enjoy the experience that they expect 
from us. When we receive a complaint, 
it is managed and resolved by the 
relevant business line and the responsible 
member of our Executive Committee 
is notified.
Our digital platforms, including 
our website, form a central part of 
our customer service proposition. 
We continue to make enhancements to 
our mobile friendly, customer-led website. 
To improve the customer service we 
provide we launched a number of 
new tools and resources during 2015. 
As described on page 37 , we launched 
our SME Rate Checker which allows 
SMEs to compare rates from over 90 
providers online. To support our landlord 
community we created a buy-to-let hub 
on our website which contains a range 
of resources for both prospective and 
existing landlords.
Our people
We have a strong performance culture 
at Aldermore built on the DNA that we 
established at the very beginning in 2009: 
to be Reliable, Expert, Dynamic and 
Straightforward. This culture is one of the 
many factors that attract people to work 
at Aldermore.
We are committed to promoting diversity 
in the workplace and as at 31 December 
2015, two or 25 per cent of our Executive 
Committee and 383 or 47 per cent of total 
employees were female. Both a “Diversity 
and Inclusion” policy and a “Dignity 
at Work” policy were adopted during 
the year. 
In 2015, we improved our employee 
recognition packages to help us retain 
our people and bring us in line with listed 
companies. We improved parental leave 
for new mothers and fathers, raised the 
level of pension contributions that we 
match, and encouraged all employees 
to participate in our recently launched 
Sharesave scheme. 
We are totally committed to developing 
people who choose to work at Aldermore. 
In 2015, we launched our “Empowered 
Managers” programme, our biggest 
development initiative to date, as well as 
“ Aspiring Managers” for those employees 
who would like to take on management 
positions in the future. Our “Next 
Generation Leaders” programme, which 
focuses on leadership capabilities, was 
also revamped in 2015.
Our “Skill!” programme promotes entrepreneurialism amongst young people. Aldermore’s Community team managed fundraising 
for Headway our chosen charity for 2015. 23 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Strategic report Corporate governance Remuneration Risk management Financial statements Appendices
We are constantly on the lookout for 
new talent and increasingly use digital 
channels for recruitment. Social media 
has proved to be both efficient and 
cost-effective with over 25 per cent of 
our external hires coming as a direct 
result of our social media presence. 
We also understand the need to help 
the next generation of employees enter 
the workforce and in 2015, recruited our 
first ever apprentices who joined our 
Mortgages team in Wilmslow.
Communication plays a big part in 
maintaining an engaged employee 
population and our senior leaders place 
a great deal of emphasis on meeting with 
and listening to our employees so that 
their views can be taken into account in 
making decisions which are likely to affect 
their interests. Executive Committee 
roadshows were held in Manchester, 
Reading and Leicester during 2015, 
allowing all of our people to interact 
with our senior team. Having attended 
these events, 90 per cent of colleagues 
said they felt proud of working for 
Aldermore. Outside of these events, 
we communicate systematically with 
employees on matters which concern 
them and to ensure a common awareness 
of the financial and economic factors 
affecting the performance of the Group. 
We also launched our first “Meet the 
Board” events in 2015 to give people the 
opportunity to interact with our Non-
Executive Directors. 
We were proud to be again awarded 
“One to Watch” status in the Sunday 
Times “Best Companies to Work 
For” survey. We view this recognition 
as an indication that our employee 
engagement is heading in the 
right direction. 
Our communities
Community is a core pillar of our brand 
and we are committed to making a 
contribution to those communities that 
we operate in, whether by supporting 
the UK’s vital SME community, 
giving something back to the areas 
where we operate or acting as a 
responsible member of the financial 
services community.
The UK’s SMEs play a large part in the 
country’s economic success, and as a 
lender serving these vital businesses, 
we recognise that our contribution can 
extend beyond merely providing finance. 
This is the reason that we continue to 
run regular education and networking 
events for SMEs and our introducers, 
most notably our Asset Finance training 
series. During 2015, over a hundred 
junior members of staff from our broker 
partners went through this training which 
introduced the basics of asset finance 
and the underwriting processes that 
lenders follow. The programme proved 
very popular amongst our brokers and is 
continuing into 2016.
The “SKILL!” programme, our flagship 
community initiative which promotes 
entrepreneurialism amongst young 
people, continued in 2015. For the first 
time, we held a national SKILL! final for the 
winning teams from each of the schools 
where we held events. Appropriately, 
given that 2015 was the year that we 
listed, this took place at the London Stock 
Exchange and coincided with Global 
Entrepreneur Week who recognised our 
programme as high impact in providing 
the support, inspiration and skills to help 
young people become more enterprising. 
We are aware of our impact on 
the environment and details of our 
greenhouse gas emissions can be found 
on page 80.
Headway, the brain injury association, 
was chosen as our charity of the year 
in memory of Adam Massen, one of 
our colleagues who sadly passed away 
in late 2014. Fundraising for Headway 
was managed by the Aldermore 
Community Team.
Our chosen charity of the year for 2016, 
is the Batten Disease Family Association 
(BDFA) which supports families, raises 
awareness and facilitates research into 
the group of fatal neurodegenerative 
diseases known as Batten disease. 
The charity was selected through an 
organisation-wide employee vote.
Were it not for our customers, people and 
communities, Aldermore would not exist 
and it is only with their ongoing support 
that we will thrive.

by 10 per cent and the broker channel by 
9 per cent.
Invoice Finance
The invoice finance market provides 
working capital for businesses by lending 
against outstanding invoices issued by the 
borrower to its customers. During 2015, 
the market has remained fairly stable
2
 
in terms of both loan advances and 
customer numbers at around £20 billion 
and around 44,000 respectively. 
Although accounting for only 20 per cent 
of customer numbers, around 80 per cent 
of advances by value are to businesses 
with turnover in excess of £5 million. Here, 
the market has seen customer numbers 
grow by c8 per cent with advances up by 
c2 per cent during 2015.
The remaining 80 per cent of UK invoice 
finance customers have turnover of 
less than £5 million. However, smaller 
companies only represent around 20 
per cent of invoice finance lending. 
During 2015, the market reported an 
increase in advances of around 5 per 
cent to customers with turnover of less 
than £5 million whilst customer numbers 
remained broadly stable. 
Commercial Mortgages
Commercial mortgages are secured 
against commercial properties such as 
retail premises, offices, industrial units 
and commercial investment property.
We estimate that the gross mortgage 
origination in 2015, was around £48 billion
3
 
growing by around 9 per cent compared 
with 2014 and by around 17 per cent 
since 2013.

Buy-to-Let Mortgages
Around £38 billion of buy-to-let 
mortgages
4
 are estimated to have been 
advanced in 2015, with this segment 
of the market growing by 39 per cent 
compared with 2014 and at an average of 
35 per cent over the last two years. 
In the second half of 2015, the UK 
Government introduced a number of 
measures aimed at moderating future 
growth in buy-to-let and second home 
ownership. These are discussed in more 
detail on pages 32 and 42 but include 
restricting mortgage interest rate relief to 
the basic tax rate for individual landlords 
from 2017 , a change which will be phased 
in over four years. An additional 3 per cent 
stamp duty will be payable on buy-to-let 
and second home purchases from April 
2016. However, it should be noted that, 
as shown in the chart, currently over half 
of all mortgages in the buy-to-let market 
relate to re-mortgaging and attract no 
stamp duty.
Residential Mortgages
According to the CML, in 2015, residential 
owner-occupied mortgage loan 
origination
4
 was around £182 billion and 
is up by 4 per cent over 2014 and by 
an average of 8 per cent over the last 
two years. 
Within this, advances to first time buyers 
totalled around £47 billion up 4 per cent 
on 2014 and new mortgage lending to 
the self-employed (excluding first time 
buyers) was up 9 per cent compared to 
2014 at £18 billion.
Around 70 per cent of the total residential 
owner-occupied mortgage market is 
distributed via intermediaries, with the 
remainder distributed directly. 
Savings
The UK deposit market is enormous
5
 
at around £1.8 trillion and has grown by 
around 4 per cent per annum over the last 
two years.
Although there are an increasing number 
of new entrants, the market continues to 
be dominated by the large incumbent 
banks, with six institutions holding 73 per 
cent of the UK’s savings. Around two-
thirds of the savings market is held in 
“Easy Access” products.
Retail deposits represent around two-
thirds of the market at £1.2 trillion, with 
the remaining third being SME and 
corporate deposits.

Business Finance
Asset Finance
Business Finance
In the second half of 2015, we created 
the Business Finance division bringing 
together the Asset and Invoice Finance 
business lines under common leadership.
Asset Finance
Aldermore Asset Finance supports 
capital investment in business critical 
assets. Leveraging our depth and breadth 
of expertise, we finance a wide array of 
assets. This flexibility enables us to meet 
the needs of customers of all sizes across 
key industries. 
In addition, we offer wholesale and block 
discounting facilities to smaller leasing 
companies and brokerages enabling 
them to extend credit directly to SMEs.
Market and strategy
Please see page 24 for an overview of the 
UK asset finance market.
We aim to be our partners’ “funder of 
first choice” by being easy to do business 
with, quick to respond and consistent in 
our credit decisions. 
Our main focus is lending through the 
broker channel, which as shown on 
page 24 represents almost 20 per cent 
of annual lending across the market. 
We’re delighted to have built excellent 
relationships with our network of around 
400 broker partners who have supported 
us in growing our market share to around 
13 per cent in this channel. 
From an asset perspective, our primary 
focus to date has been hard assets. 
In 2014, we extended our product range 
into soft, or IT and telephony, assets 
and these now account for 7 per cent of 
the portfolio.
Towards the end of 2013, we entered 
selected segments of the sales/vendor 
space which, in total, accounts for a 
further third of annual origination. 
Although our share of this is small today 
we see an opportunity though initiatives 
such as our dealer finance proposition.
On an overall basis, we estimate 
our 2015 market share to be around 
3.2 per cent.
Growth
2015 was another excellent year for our 
Asset Finance business with our portfolio 
growing by 29 per cent to £1.3 billion 
and customer numbers now totalling 
c42,000 (2014: c41,000). We grew organic 
origination to £893 million, up by 21 per 
cent over 2014 of £740 million. In October, 
we launched our new dealer finance 
proposition which brings together 
services from both Asset and Invoice 
Finance, including inventory, retail, 
working capital and trade finance to 
better meet our customers’ needs. 
Continued investment
We continued our multi-year investment 
programme in our technology and 
digital capability to improve customer 
experience. In 2015, we began upgrading 
our back office systems to strengthen 
their integration with our front office 
systems. The development of our front 
office portal, to provide functionality 
to allow documents to be uploaded, 
tracking of applications and e-signature 
capability, was also initiated.
In addition to continuing to invest in 
our own team, we’ve launched the 
“Next Generation Training Initiative” 
to help develop the UK’s new asset 
finance brokers. We believe it’s the first 
programme of its kind in the industry 
and, to date, over 100 of our registered 
brokers have participated in these 
free workshops.

Aldermore Invoice Finance provides 
working capital solutions for UK SMEs, 
ranging from vanilla invoice discounting 
and full service factoring, where we 
manage the customer’s debt collection 
on their behalf, to more tailored customer 
solutions requiring the in-house expertise 
that Aldermore has developed. We will 
usually lend up to 90 per cent of the value 
of approved outstanding sales invoices. 
Given the short-term nature of these 
loans, with the underlying invoices usually 
converting to cash within 60 days, our 
average loan balance is equivalent to 
providing over £1 billion in working capital 
finance to UK SMEs each year.
Market and strategy
Please see page 24 for an overview 
of the UK invoice finance market. 
The competitive landscape is split, with 
four large high street banks controlling 
around 70 per cent of advances and 
customer numbers, usually targeting 
larger clients with whom they hold 
the primary banking relationship. 
The remainder of the market is served by 
a fairly long and diverse tail of lenders, of 
which Aldermore is part. We estimate our 
current overall market share to be around 
0.8 per cent.
Our customers are typically SMEs 
with turnover of up to £2 million and 
we focus on key sectors including 
Manufacturing, Wholesale, Recruitment 
and Logistics. We have experienced client 
relationship managers who understand 
our customers’ businesses and provide 
expert advice to support their growth 
aspirations. We continually develop 
simple and transparent solutions, for 
example our trade finance product for 
businesses with overseas suppliers and 
our “Pay and Bill” product designed 
specifically for the recruitment industry 
which offers a simple solution to the 
funding gap between paying candidate 
wages and being paid by their customers. 
Our distribution channels are supported 
by local relationship managers based in 
our seven regional offices. We work with 
more than 500 intermediary groups at a 
local and national level. 
To ensure we have a sustainable 
platform for the future, during 2015, 
we restructured our operating model 
and sales structure to better serve our 
clients’ needs whilst maintaining our 
differentiated service proposition. 
Portfolio
Invoice Finance represents a useful part 
of our lending proposition to SMEs rather 
than a key driver of the Group’s growth 
and remains the smallest part of the 
Group at around 3 per cent of the total 
net loan portfolio. At 31 December 2015, 
net loans were £0.2 billion (31 December 
2014: £0.2 billion). Customer numbers 
increased marginally, although remain 
around 1,200, with average facility sizes 
reducing. We continue to support our 
customers with innovative products such 
as our construction finance proposition. 
This was launched toward the end of 2014 
and is gaining traction and now accounts 
for c4 per cent of the portfolio. 
Continued investment
During 2015, in addition to upgrading our 
core operating system, we upgraded our 
risk systems and framework to allow much 
earlier visibility of potential credit risk 
issues. This has both a positive effect on 
our credit decision process but also allows 
us to take remedial action much sooner 
with greater effect.

SME Commercial Mortgages
Mortgages
Since 2014, the Mortgages division has 
been run as an integrated business 
and one team under the leadership of 
Charles Haresnape. We’ve built an award-
winning, innovative and comprehensive 
proposition based on the foundations 
common across all of our lending lines, 
namely our ability to use our modern, 
flexible systems to enable our expert 
underwriters to make considered 
credit decisions and our responsive 
service culture.
In line with our operating model and to 
provide additional transparency, we have 
restructured our segmental reporting 
creating a “Buy-to-Let” segment which 
brings together loans which were 
previously split across SME Commercial 
and Residential Mortgages.
SME Commercial Mortgages
Aldermore offers mortgages to cover the 
full life cycle from property development 
through to purchase and refinancing 
as well as bridging loans. Our SME 
Commercial Mortgages business focuses 
on mortgages for shops, warehouses, 
industrial units and offices distributed 
through financial intermediaries and 
directly with customers.
Market and strategy
Please see page 24 for an overview of 
the UK commercial mortgage market of 
which we estimate our overall share to be 
around 0.9 per cent.
We look to build on our ability as one 
of the few lenders who can offer a full 
spectrum of products from property 
development to commercial investment 
and commercial owner occupied. 
We work closely with our panel of 
around 800 brokers to ensure we are 
easy to do business with and engage 
in a proactive dialogue particularly 
around more complex cases. Our direct 
business has also grown rapidly in recent 
years and now accounts for 26 per cent 
of origination.
Growth
Our SME Commercial Mortgage portfolio 
grew by 50 per cent to £0.8 billion 
(2014: £0.6 billion) driven by strong new 
lending levels which at £428 million 
represented an increase of 42 per cent 
compared with 2014 of £301 million.
Gross new lending via brokers grew by 
20 per cent to £318 million with direct 
distribution growing by over 200 per cent.
We were particularly pleased with the 
growth in our Commercial Investment 
portfolio, where we focus on multi-let 
developments, as well as significant 
traction gained by both the Property 
Development business, as we continue 
to support experienced regional 
developers, and by our commercial 
Bridging product, which is making good 
progress following its launch in June 2014.

Buy-to-Let Mortgages
Aldermore provides a complete Buy-
to-Let proposition catering for both 
individual and corporate landlords, simple 
to complex properties and from a single 
property to large portfolio.
Market and strategy
Please see page 25 for an overview of 
the UK buy-to-let market of which we 
estimate our overall share to be less than 
2 per cent. 
There have been a number of regulatory 
changes related to the buy-to-let sector. 
Firstly, the Summer Budget introduced 
plans to restrict relief on mortgage 
interest for individual landlords to the 
basic rate of income tax from April 2017 . 
This was followed by the introduction, 
from April 2016, of an additional 3 per 
cent stamp duty tax on buy-to-let 
properties over £40,000. We monitor 
activity in our buy-to-let portfolio closely. 
However, to date, we have seen no 
significant shift in customer behaviour 
and believe that it will be later in the 
year before we can see any possible 
impact of these changes on the market. 
Over half of all buy-to-let mortgages 
originated across the market each year 
relate to remortgage rather than purchase 
transactions and therefore attract no 
stamp duty. In comparison, around 
70 per cent of balances, and annual 
origination, in our Buy-to-Let portfolio 
relate to remortgages. 
Additionally, in December 2015, 
the Basel Committee on Banking 
Supervision issued a consultation paper 
on risk weights which, if implemented as 
currently drafted, would, probably from 
2019, increase the standardised capital 
risk weights for a buy-to-let mortgage on 
a residential property from 35 per cent 
to 70 per cent for transactions with 
a loan-to-value of below 60 per cent 
and 90 per cent for loans-to-value of 
between 60 per cent and 80 per cent. 
Although we believe the PRA will 
continue to determine the appropriate 
standardised risk weight for UK buy-to-let 
at a national level, we intend to pursue 
an IRB approach which would lead to 
the adoption of our own internal credit 
model, subject to regulatory approval, 
rather than standardised risk weights.
Buy-to-let remains a key element of 
UK housing stock with the underlying 
demand continuing to grow. 
We represent a small part of the overall 
market and, as such, believe that this 
lending segment remains attractive from 
both a growth and return perspective.
During 2015, we significantly enhanced 
our Buy-to-Let offering creating a 
seamless proposition for amateur to 
professional landlords. We streamlined 
our product range, launched Buy-to-
Let and landlord hubs on our website, 
providing enhanced buy-to-let calculators 
and additional information for brokers 
and customers. 
Growth
In 2015, our Buy-to-Let business grew 
net loans to customers by 18 per 
cent to £2.4 billion (31 December 
2014: £2.0 billion) as we grew customer 
numbers by 15 per cent to around 16,000 
(31 December 2014: c14,000). Growth was 
supported by origination of £673 million 
(2014: £726 million) which although down 
by 7% remains robust. We were pleased 
with the 10 per cent growth in direct 
distribution which now accounts for 
19% of annual origination.

A detailed review
Problem solved
Facing challenges
When Chris Symons came to 
remortgage some of his buy-to-let 
properties to expand his portfolio, 
a County Court Judgement against 
his previous limited company was 
identified and his previous high street 
lenders refused to help.
Our underwriters took a detailed look 
at his wider circumstances, reviewing 
his application on its own merits and 
providing him with the support he 
needed. Chris’ business is thriving. 
He has remortgaged five other 
properties and has a commercial 
mortgage with us.
Speaking to Aldermore was like a 
breath of fresh air. I explained my 
situation to one of the advisers and 
she immediately said, “Yes we can 
help. How many properties are you 
looking to remortgage?”

We aim to get our customers into new 
homes or remortgage their existing 
properties as quickly as possible. As in 
our other business lines, we aim to be 
easy to do business with, transparent 
and quick to respond. We benefit from 
modern technology with our brokers able 
to apply via an online portal and obtain 
a decision in principle within 90 seconds. 
This portal takes the application and 
links to external systems, automatically 
completing basic identity, fraud and 
credit checks and builds an underwriting 
file highlighting any specific issues to our 
underwriters. This technology allows us 
to use a targeted approach to human 
underwriting in a cost-effective manner 
to make considered and consistent 
credit decisions.
We work with around 12,000 brokers via 
our paperless broker portal. These broker 
relationships accounted for just over 
90 per cent of gross new lending in 2015. 
We also continue to develop our direct 
distribution capability which grew by 
around a third in 2015.
Growth
Aldermore’s residential owner occupied 
mortgage portfolio grew by 42 per cent 
to £1.4 billion (2014: £1.0 billion) as we 
grew customer numbers by 40 per cent to 
10,000. Gross new lending of £582 million 
was up by 4 per cent on 2014 levels.
We continue to support first time buyers 
and delivered good growth in Help To 
Buy, including our launch of Help To Buy 
Equity Loan product, which increases our 
support for the new build market.
Continued investment
Across the Mortgages division, to support 
the continued growth of the business we 
have increased our sales team and back 
office operations. We are also refreshing 
our operating platform and continue to 
invest in our online capability.

Help to Buy
An easy process
Determined to secure a home for 
their young family, first time buyers 
Kelly and Wayne Evison had lived with 
Wayne’s parents for two years so that 
they could save for a deposit.
Wayne’s self-employed status meant 
their 10 per cent deposit was too 
low for some high street lenders. 
We recommended Help to Buy, 
a UK Government scheme which 
enables borrowers with a small 
deposit to get a mortgage. 
Aldermore made the mortgage 
application process really easy. 
If I didn’t understand any of the 
terms or the process I just rang the 
team and it was explained perfectly 
and understandably.”

Savings
With our dynamic, online savings 
platform, we have created a strong 
customer franchise which provides a 
stable funding base enabling us to fund 
our lending to UK SMEs, homeowners 
and landlords.
We offer a range of award-winning, 
straightforward saving products to Retail, 
SME and Corporate customers. 
Market and strategy
Please see page 25 for an overview of the 
UK savings market of which we estimate 
our market share in retail deposits to be 
0.4 per cent and in SME deposits to be 
0.2 per cent, providing significant scope 
for future expansion without the need to 
target large market shares.
We believe that it should be as simple 
as possible to save so we make it easy 
for our customers to use their accounts. 
Both Retail and SME savers are able to 
open and fund an account online within 
15 minutes as our modern IT systems 
link with third parties to complete key 
identity checks.
We publish unedited reviews on our 
website, allowing us to react to customer 
feedback, as well as letting potential 
customers see what other savers think 
of us. We believe that we are still unique 
in this transparent approach in the UK 
banking sector.
Growth
Our savings business delivered another 
excellent year, matching our growth in 
lending with total deposits up by 29 per 
cent to £5.7 billion (2014: £4.5 billion). 
We now support almost 124,000 savers 
(2014: 105,000 savers). Total retail deposits 
grew by 23 per cent to £4.2 billion 
(2014: £3.4 billion). SME deposits have 
grown very strongly, up by 37 per cent to 
£1.4 billion (2014: £1.0 billion).
In a little over a year, our corporate 
deposit portfolio exceeds £156 million. 
This is an excellent performance and 
provides further diversification to our 
deposit base.
Continued investment
In line with our transparent approach and 
building on our track record of innovation, 
we commissioned bespoke research that 
showed that almost a quarter of SMEs 
didn’t know what interest rate they were 
receiving on their savings. In response, 
we’ve created a new and unique rate 
checking tool which compares the rate 
being paid by over 90 providers with that 
they could expect to earn with Aldermore.
We also recently launched our Help to 
Buy ISA, supporting the Government 
scheme specifically designed for 
people looking to buy their first home. 
The scheme allows savers to put away up 
to £200 a month, which the Government 
will boost by 25 per cent when they buy 
their home, up to a maximum of £3,000. 
We are also one of a small number of “ISA 
wrapper” providers, meaning that we 
can offer this new ISA to those who have 
already opened a Cash ISA in this tax year 
but have not taken advantage of their full 
ISA allowance.

“The SME Rate Checker originated from our belief that it 
should be really easy for time-poor SMEs to find out 
something as fundamental as their savings interest rate. ”
Simon Healy, Managing Director of Savings at Aldermore
Innovative
Transparent
Talking to SMEs, it became clear that 
many were not getting the most out 
of their surplus funds. They found it 
difficult to find out what interest rate 
they were earning and were unable to 
shop around easily. 
In response, we became the first 
financial institution to offer an 
independent business savings rate-
checking tool to SMEs. Our SME Rate 
Checker allows SMEs to view the rates 
of more than 90 savings institutions 
and provides a comparison rate for a 
similar Aldermore account.
The SME Rate Checker makes it 
straightforward for businesses to do 
in moments what can be an onerous 
task with some providers.
Listening to
our customers Risk principles
We manage risk in line with the following principles: 
• Strong risk governance:  
Risk is managed using the “three lines of defence” principle – separating risk 
origination from risk oversight and risk assurance, with governance provided 
by formal committees, including the Board’s Risk Committee and Audit 
Committee. See page 108 for further details 
• Independent risk oversight:  
Group Risk is the risk oversight function independent of the business with an 
independent reporting line to the Board Risk Committee. It is the basis of the 
“Second Line of Defence” . See page 108 for further details
• Defined risk appetite:  
A clearly defined Risk Appetite Framework is aligned to our business strategy 
and reflects the Board’s prudent approach towards risk taking. See page 106 
for further details
• Risk transparency and control:  
All risks are measured, monitored, managed and reported. All are subject to 
appropriate controls and governance. Responsibility for the identification, 
assessment, measurement, monitoring and management of risks rests with the 
First Line of Defence, overseen by Group Risk. See page 108 for further details 
• Value preservation:  
The protection of our reputation is paramount. Everything we do is guided by 
the principle of putting the customer at the centre of what we do. It informs our 
business strategy, the way in which we do business and the manner in which we 
treat our customers and other stakeholders 
38 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Strategic report
Risk overview
Risk Management Framework
The Risk Management Framework is 
the collection of tools, processes and 
methodologies that support the business 
to identify, assess, monitor and control 
the risks it faces. This framework outlines 
the means by which the Board and senior 
management establish the Group’s 
strategy in relation to its risk appetite and 
articulates how we identify, measure and 
manage risk. Senior management ensure 
that the Risk Management Framework is 
embedded in its day-to-day management 
and control activities. 
See page 105 for further details.
Risk culture
We have established and maintain a 
strong culture focusing on empowerment, 
customer-centricity, risk-awareness and 
responsibility supported by our brand 
pillars of exceptional service, transparency 
and community. Our performance 
management processes promote 
sound risk management and incentivise 
appropriate behaviour in our employees. 
Our employees should be risk aware, 
understand accountabilities and 
consequences of not adhering to policies 
and procedures as we aim to strike 
the right balance between openness, 
accountability and effective performance 
management. An understanding of risk 
and the risk appetites is embedded 
within business practices alongside 
a close collaboration with risk and 
compliance functions.  Achievements in 2015
We continue to deliver against our strategy of delivering for our customers and 
shareholders while maintaining prudent capital, funding and liquidity positions. 
In addition to the ongoing process and systems enhancements, our Risk function 
has played a key role in supporting strategic progress via:
• Capital position: Our successful listing in March 2015 provided access to the 
equity capital markets and enabled us to raise £75m of gross primary equity to 
support our growth plans. Our fully loaded CRD IV CET1 ratio was 11.8% as at 
31 December 2015
• Risk Management Framework: Enhanced the overarching approach to 
the management of risk across the Group. As part of this, the Operational 
Risk Management Framework has been updated to conform to the Basel 
Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) criteria for the sound management 
of operational risk 
• Risk Appetite Framework: A revised Risk Appetite Framework was adopted 
which links together our business objectives, the overarching risk appetite with 
detailed key risk indicators and performance metrics 
• Governance structure: In 2015 an enhanced governance structure was 
implemented, providing improved focus on risk management at the Board, 
Executive and Management levels 
• Resourcing: Further recruitment of risk management resources has helped 
strengthen risk management in the first line of defence as well as improved 
oversight capacity in the second line of defence 
• Funding: Our loans to deposit ratio reduced to 107% as we continued to 
effectively manage the balance between wholesale and deposit funding to drive 
an efficient cost of funds 
• Impairment: As a result of our continued rigorous focus on risk management, 
together with the relatively benign credit environment, we reduced our cost of 
risk from 23 basis points to 19 basis points
• Liquidity: Implemented international standards for Liquidity Risk Management 
(LRM) and integrated our wholesale liability management with the 
savings division
• Operational risk: Increased the awareness of operational risk management 
across the Group through engagement and training. Risk & Control Self-
Assessment process enhanced and deployed across the business to provide an 
accurate assessment of our operational risk profile. Embedded operational risk 
managers established within first line business units
• Conduct risk: Enhanced conduct risk framework by strengthening product 
governance controls, improving conduct risk metrics across the product life 
cycle and increasing awareness and understanding of conduct risk management 
across the Group through engagement and training
• Regulatory: Delivered a framework to address the requirements of the Senior 
Manager and Certification Regime (SMCR) and establish appropriate oversight
• Financial crime: Implemented enhanced monitoring and surveillance systems 
for Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Finance
Priorities for 2016
39 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Strategic report Corporate governance Remuneration Risk management Financial statements Appendices
Effective risk management is a key component of our strategy 
of supporting UK SMEs, homeowners, landlords and savers. 
Our approach to risk combines an effective Risk Management 
Framework with a strong risk management culture.
We expect the risk agenda in 2016 
to remain focused on the continually 
evolving regulatory landscape 
and ongoing enhancements to 
our internal risk processes and 
methodologies including:
• Further progress of IFRS 9: 
Which replaces the “incurred loss” 
approach to impairment with one 
based on expected losses
• SMCR: 
Which has a greater focus on decision-
making individuals in the top tiers of a 
firm and came into force in March 2016. 
• Internal Ratings-Based 
Approach (IRB): 
We intend to pursue an IRB approach 
and have mobilised a team to look at 
the transition. The initial phase will be to 
understand the requirements to move 
over time from a standardised capital 
model to an advanced approach using 
internal models
• Business Assurance Framework: 
As part of our ongoing process 
of continual improvement to risk 
management, we are reviewing our 
business assurance framework to align 
this to the risk and control assessment 
process and ensure it remains 
appropriate for our needs
• Operational risk quantification: 
Enhancing the quantification of 
operational risk to support the Internal 
Capital Adequacy Assessment Process 
(ICAAP) and risk appetite reporting 
for both expected and unexpected

Strategic report
Current strategic risks 
The Group’s current strategic risks are 
detailed as follows. These may have a 
potential future impact on the strategic 
plans for the business and its future 
financial performance.
Compliance and 
competition regulation
The banking sector is currently subject 
to a large volume of actual and potential 
regulatory change arising from European 
regulation and from the PRA and FCA. 
We actively manage a number of 
regulatory review and change activities. 
Buy-to-Let
There have been a number of actual 
and proposed regulatory and legislative 
changes related to the buy-to-let sector.
Firstly, the Summer Budget introduced 
plans to restrict relief on mortgage 
interest for individual landlords to the 
basic rate of income tax from April 2017 . 
This was followed by the introduction, 
from April 2016, of an additional 
3 per cent stamp duty tax on buy-to-let 
properties over £40,000. It should be 
noted, that around half of all buy-to-let 
mortgages across the market relate 
to remortgage rather than purchase 
transactions and attract no stamp duty. 
We represent a small part of the overall 
market and, as such, believe that this 
lending segment remains attractive from 
a growth and return perspective.
In addition to the powers of 
recommendation already granted, the 
UK Government is currently consulting 
on whether to grant the Financial Policy 
Committee (FPC) powers of direction to 
the PRA/FCA in relation to restrictions 
to the buy-to-let market. We consider 
our current underwriting criteria to 
be prudent. We stress all loans at 
origination to ensure that the mortgage 
is still affordable in a rising interest 
rate environment.
Additionally, in December 2015, the Basel 
Committee issued a consultation paper 
on risk weights which, if implemented as 
currently drafted, would, probably from 
2019, increase the standardised capital 
risk weight for a buy-to-let mortgage on a 
residential property. 
Although we believe the PRA will continue 
to press for the right, which it currently 
exercises, to determine the appropriate 
standardised risk weight for UK buy-to-let, 
given it is a mature and efficient market, 
we intend to pursue an IRB approach.
Interest rates
We are cognisant of the very low interest 
rate environment at present, with inflation 
and unemployment remaining low, 
despite global economic uncertainty and 
financial market turmoil. Predictions for an 
interest rate rise are highly uncertain but 
are currently indicating a rise sometime 
in 2018. However, the risk of an interest 
rate rise and the associated potential 
impact on our customers’ ability to repay 
is recognised and is mitigated through 
a range of measures, including stress 
testing and the use of affordability criteria 
which measure the ability of customers 
to service loan payments at higher 
interest rates. 
Political risks
There are ongoing political risks, 
including the UK’s membership of the 
EU. The impact of leaving the EU is 
uncertain but could affect exports and 
the position of London as a major financial 
centre. There could also be changes in 
taxation or regulation which may prove 
to be disadvantageous to our customers. 
We are solely a UK-focused business 
and seek to mitigate these by working 
closely with banking regulators and 
Government authorities.
Economic risks
The UK economic outlook remains 
relatively benign, with growth expected 
to continue, a stable property market 
and very gradually rising interest rates. 
Although there are some sub-sectors 
which have some risks (oil and gas and 
steel sectors), we have only limited 
exposure to these areas.
The international economic and 
political environment also contains risks. 
These include structural and deflationary 
concerns in the EU, worsening 
geopolitical risks in Russia and the Middle 
East, and a continued slowing of the 
economy in China, putting pressure on 
global financial and commodity markets. 
To date, the UK economy has remained 
robust in the face of these global 
headwinds and as a UK- focused 
business we have not felt any adverse 
consequences. The medium-term impact 
is unclear and there remains a possibility 
that material international events could 
adversely affect the UK and act as a drag 
on the UK economy and sectors in which 
we lend. We aim to manage these risks 
by maintaining a well-diversified product 
base, and remaining focused on the UK.
Cyber-crime
Financial cyber-crime has become a major 
issue in our increasingly interconnected 
world and exposes our business to both 
financial and reputational damage. 
During 2015, we continued to strengthen 
our defences against cyber-crime. 
Notwithstanding this, we plan to make 
further security improvements during 
2016 and to ensure that the measures 
in place are in line with best practice 
standards. Additionally, we have plans in 
place to identify and respond to a cyber 
risk event on a timely basis, ensuring that 
there is a practical approach to actions 
and escalation to help minimise any 
potential impact.
Impact of accounting standards
New reporting requirements under IFRS 9 
introduce forward looking credit models 
which will lead to changes in the timing 
of impairment recognition. We continue 
to assess the impact of IFRS 9 and have 
implemented a project plan to ensure 
compliance with this new standard well 
ahead of its proposed implementation 
date of 1 January 2018.
Competition
The competitive landscape contains risks 
from new entrants, increased competition 
from incumbent lenders and disruptive 
products/software solutions potentially 
affecting both lending and deposit taking 
activities. The effect of this could result in 
lower volume, higher customer attrition 
and/or lower net interest margins. The risk 
of competition has been recognised 
in our future planning process but is 
constantly monitored. 43 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015

Assessment of principal risks
As described further in the Risk 
Report, the Board is responsible for 
determining the nature and extent of 
the principal risks it is willing to take in 
order to achieve its strategic objectives. 
The Board is also ultimately responsible 
for maintaining sound risk management 
and internal control systems. In line with 
the Code requirements, the Directors 
have performed a robust assessment 
of the principal risks facing the Group, 
including those that would threaten its 
business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity. 
The principal risks are further described 
on pages 40 to 41 and the current 
strategic risks are described on page 42. 
Risk management and 
internal controls
The Board monitors the Group’s risk 
management and internal control 
systems. A review of the effectiveness 
of the systems has been performed 
incorporating all material controls, 
including financial, operational and 
compliance controls.
The Group’s risk management and 
internal control systems are designed 
to identify, manage, monitor and report 
on risks to which the Group is exposed. 
It can therefore only provide reasonable 
but not absolute assurance against the 
risk of material misstatement or loss. 
Further details of the processes and 
procedures for managing and mitigating 
these risks are provided in the Risk report 
from page 110. 
The effectiveness of the internal controls 
was regularly reviewed by the Board, 
Audit Committee and Risk Committee 
during the year. This involved receiving 
reports from management including 
reports from Finance, Risk, Compliance, 
Internal Audit and the business lines. 
The Audit Committee also receives 
reports on internal controls from the 
Group’s External Auditor. Where 
recommendations are identified for 
improvements to controls these are 
monitored by Internal Audit who report 
the progress made in implementing 
them to the Audit Committee.
Based on the review performed during 
the year, and the monitoring and 
oversight activities performed, the 
Audit Committee, in conjunction with 
the Risk Committee, concluded that the 
Group’s risk management and internal 
control systems were effective and 
recommended a statement to this effect 
to the Board.
Based on this assessment, the Board are 
satisfied with the effectiveness of the 
Group’s risk management and internal 
control systems. 
Viability 
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of UK 
Corporate Governance Code, published 
by the Financial Reporting Council 
in September 2014 (“the Code”), the 
Directors have assessed the prospects of 
the Group over a three-year time horizon 
to 31 December 2018.
The Directors concluded that a three-
year time horizon is an appropriate 
length of time to perform the 
assessment over because this is the 
period over which financial forecasts 
have a greater level of certainty. 
The Board monitor a longer term 
strategic plan which extends beyond 
the three-year horizon. This longer term 
strategic plan provides less certainty of 
outcome, but provides a robust planning 
tool against which strategic decisions 
can be made. 
In the assessment of the viability of the 
Group, the Directors considered each 
of the Principal risks set out on pages 40 
to 41 of the Strategic report. In addition, 
the assessment has been performed 
with reference to the Group’s current 
position and strategy. Details of the 
Group’s financial performance, capital 
management, business environment and 
outlook are set out on pages 3 to 37 .
In making this assessment, the Directors 
have considered a wide range of 
information relating to present and 
future conditions, including the current 
state of the balance sheet, future 
projections of profitability, cash flows 
and capital resources. The information 
considered includes a wide range of 
stress testing which is performed as part 
of both the ICAAP and ILAA processes 
as further described in the Risk report on 
page 109.
Based on the above assessment, the 
Directors have concluded that there is a 
reasonable expectation that the Group 
will be able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
the period to 31 December 2018.

In this section
UK Corporate Governance Code 2014 (“the Code”) – statement of compliance
The Board is committed to the highest 
standards of corporate governance. 
Prior to the IPO in March 2015, the 
Group was not required to follow the 
Code although it did take account 
of its principles. The Board confirms 
that from the IPO to the date of this 
report the Group has complied with 
the requirements of the Code, which 
sets out principles relating to the good 
governance of companies. 
The Code is available at www.frc.org.uk
This corporate governance report 
describes how the Board has applied the 
principles of the Code and provides a 
clear and comprehensive description of 
the Group’s governance arrangements.  45 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015

Corporate governance
Chairman’s introduction
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased 
to introduce our report on corporate 
governance. We have taken into account 
the main principles in the Code in relation 
to Board leadership and effectiveness, 
accountability, relations with shareholders 
and remuneration. In this report we 
describe our corporate governance 
arrangements in each of these areas 
along with the work which the Board 
and its Committees have undertaken. 
Whilst we are required to make various 
compliance statements we have tried 
to avoid describing these only in 
formal terms.
The Board believes that a robust 
governance framework is integral to the 
delivery of the Group’s strategic and 
financial objectives within its risk appetite. 
Strengthening our corporate governance 
arrangements was a key area of focus 
prior to listing. Our Committees have 
played a critical role in supporting the 
Board in implementing and embedding 
the policies and processes that are 
commensurate with operating in a listed 
and regulated banking environment, and 
I have set out some key highlights later in 
this letter. 
During 2014 the Board was enlarged 
ahead of the IPO and on 29 June 2015 we 
welcomed Robert Sharpe to the Board. 
Robert has significant retail banking 
experience, particularly in mortgages, 
and has further broadened the collective 
experience on the Board. As reported last 
year, John Callender stepped down from 
the Board on 27 February 2015, having 
served as an Independent Non-Executive 
Director since the Group was established. 
I would like to thank John for all his hard 
work and the invaluable contribution he 
made during his tenure. 
Following this period of change, I am 
delighted that we have established 
a strong and well-functioning Board. 
The Executive Directors manage the 
business day-to-day, within the strategic 
direction of the Group shaped by the 
challenge provided by the Non-Executive 
Directors. Discussions are open and 
constructive, and the Directors have a 
healthy respect for each other’s views. 
I meet regularly with the CEO which 
provides an opportunity for ongoing 
dialogue about the business and efficient 
running of the Board. Information about 
Board meeting processes and how we 
spent our time in 2015 is set out on pages 
52 and 53. 
The Board strongly supports the principle 
of boardroom diversity, of which gender 
is one important aspect. However, we do 
not recommend including a measurable 
target for gender representation on 
the Board. All Board appointments 
are subject to a formal, rigorous and 
transparent procedure and are made on 
merit against a defined job specification 
and criteria, and this was formalised into a 
Diversity Policy which we adopted in 2015. 
During the year we conducted an 
internal evaluation of the effectiveness 
of the Board and I am pleased to 
report that overall the results were very 
positive. Further information about the 
evaluation is set out on pages 56 and 57 , 
including agreed priorities which will be 
monitored over 2016 to further enhance 
effectiveness. An update on progress 
against these actions will be provided in 
the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts. 
The Board recognises that an effective 
risk management culture and framework 
is fundamental to the Group’s 
sustainability. Therefore, in 2014 we 
decided to split the combined Audit 
and Risk Committee into separate 
Board Committees. This has allowed the 
Risk Committee to increase the focus 
on enhancing our Risk Management 
Framework and ensuring that risk 
is managed effectively across the 
Group. The promotion of a culture of risk 
awareness is integral to ensuring that our 
strategic objectives are delivered in the 
right way. The Board is very conscious of 
its responsibility to set this “tone from the 
top” consistent with running a prudent 
banking business.
Ahead of our listing, the Remuneration 
Committee spent a significant amount 
of time on developing a Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy that both aligned 
remuneration with the long-term strategy 
of the Group and changing regulatory 
requirements, and that balanced our 
need to attract and retain the high-calibre 
individuals that can deliver our strategy 
with remuneration that is not excessive. 
The Board strongly endorses these 
principles, which reflect our approach 
to remuneration across the Group as 
a whole. 
The Board is committed to maintaining 
and developing further the high 
standards of governance that we have 
already established, and this will be an 
area of continued focus in 2016. We will 
hold our first AGM as a listed company 
on 17 May 2016. I will be joined by all 
my fellow Directors. We look forward to 
meeting you on the day and answering 
any questions you may have.

Board and Committee structure
The Board has delegated a number of 
its responsibilities to Board Committees, 
which utilise the expertise and experience 
of their members to examine subjects in 
detail and make recommendations to the 
Board where required. This delegation 
allows the Board to focus more of its time 
on strategic and other broader matters. 
The chairs of the Board Committees 
provide the Board with a verbal update 
on matters discussed at each meeting, 
and Board Committee minutes are made 
available to the whole Board through a 
secure online system.
In addition to the Board Committees 
noted on the diagram below, the 
Board has established two further 
standing committees:
• The General Purpose Committee, 
comprising the two Executive Directors, 
for the purpose of approving routine 
business matters such as powers of 
attorney, changes to bank mandates 
and the execution of agreements 
which have already been approved in 
principle by the Board
• The Disclosure Committee, comprising 
the two Executive Directors and the 
General Counsel, for the purpose 
of maintaining procedures, systems 
and controls for the identification 
and disclosure of market and price 
sensitive information
Both Committees have written terms of 
reference which set out their authority, 
and the minutes of all meetings of these 
Committees are included in Board 
meeting packs for information.
Responsibility for the day-to-day 
management of the Group is delegated 
to the CEO, who has established a 
structure of two executive committees, 
supported by a number of sub-
committees, which oversee the execution 
of the strategy agreed by the Board, 
and performance and risk issues. 
The executive committees and their sub-
committees each have their own terms 
of reference. Corporate governance

The Board – roles and processes
The Board
The Board is collectively responsible 
to shareholders for promoting the 
long-term success of the Group by 
directing and supervising the Group’s 
affairs to create sustainable shareholder 
value. In setting the Group’s strategy 
and related risk appetite, it also takes 
account of its obligations to other 
stakeholders including employees, 
suppliers and the community in which 
it operates, as well as the regulatory 
obligations of the Bank, its principal 
banking subsidiary, and to the 
Bank’s depositors.
The Chairman leads the Board in its 
role to provide executive management 
with entrepreneurial direction, whilst 
the day-to-day management of the 
Group and operational matters are 
delegated to the CEO. The separation 
of duties between the Chairman and 
CEO is formally documented. The CEO 
is supported by his senior management 
team (the “Executive Committee”). 
Further information about the role and 
responsibilities of each Board member 
can be found on the next page.
The Board’s duties are set out in a formal 
schedule of matters reserved for its 
decision, as summarised on page 52. 
This schedule is reviewed annually and 
is available at www.investors.aldermore.

Board meetings
The Board held 13 scheduled Board 
meetings, two strategy workshops and 
eight additional ad hoc Board meetings in 
2015. The high number of meetings held in 
2015 was driven in large part by additional 
meetings required ahead of the IPO. 
Attendance at scheduled Board and 
Committee meetings is set out below. 
There are occasions when a Director may 
be unable to participate in a meeting and 
if this is the case they are encouraged 
to provide comments to the Chairman 
on key items of business in advance 
of the relevant meeting, so that their 
views can be shared at the meeting 
and their opinions taken into account 
during discussions. 
In addition to the meeting programme, 
Directors meet informally during the year 
enabling Directors to discuss sensitive 
key matters in more depth. At least 
one informal session is held per year, 
which is attended by the Non-Executive 
Directors only. 
Both the Board and its Committees have 
a rolling annual programme which aligns 
to the schedule of matters reserved for 
the Board and the terms of reference of 
each Committee. The agendas and time 
allocation for Board meetings are put 
together by the Chairman, assisted by the 
CEO and Company Secretary, based on 
the annual programme, actions arising 
from previous meetings and key business 
priorities. A similar process is followed 
with the chair of each Board Committee. 
The Board and Committee agendas 
include a closed session at the end of 
meetings from time to time to enable 
the Chairman/Committee chair to meet 
privately with the Non-Executive Directors 
without management present. 
The Board monitors the performance of 
the Group against the approved strategy 
and annual business plan and within the 
agreed risk appetite through the following 
regular reports: 
• An update from the CEO on 
market, customer, strategic and 
regulatory developments 
• A business performance report from 
the CFO on the financial results of 
the business lines and the Group 
as a whole, as well as an investor 
relations update and various prudential 
regulatory matters
• A report from the Chief Risk Officer on 
key emerging risks, risk appetite and 
regulatory developments, including 
conduct risk
• A briefing from the Chief Operating 
Officer on IT, operational and 
transformation matters, and strategic 
change projects 
• Business deep-dives, which probe the 
business performance and related key 
issues, and provide an overview of the 
competitive landscape 
Strategy sessions 
The Board is responsible for establishing 
the Group’s strategy and plays a key role 
in challenging management in developing 
the strategic plan and objectives.
Each year two Board strategy workshops 
are held offsite where the CEO, with 
members of his Executive Committee, 
present their views of the market and 
proposed plans, including new initiatives, 
to be probed and tested by the Non-
Executive Directors. The range of 
experience and expertise that the Non- 
Executive Directors are able to bring to 
the debate, along with their independent 
oversight, is key to building a sustainable 
strategy. The focus of discussions is 
not only on how the strategy should 
evolve, but also on ensuring that the 
Group has the appropriate resources, 
skills and competencies to deliver the 
chosen strategy. 
However, given the rapidly changing 
market and regulatory environment in 
which the Group operates, the strategy 
has to be subject to continuous review 
and, as such, the executive management 
provides the Board with regular 
updates on key strategic initiatives as 
they progress. Key topics discussed at Board meetings since 1 January 2015

Appointments
The Corporate Governance and 
Nomination Committee (“the Nomination 
Committee”) is responsible for making 
recommendations to the Board regarding 
the appointment of new Directors. 
One new appointment was made in 
2015 – Robert Sharpe. The appointment 
process was overseen by the Nomination 
Committee and led by the Chairman. 
An external search consultancy, JCA 
Group, was appointed to identify suitable 
candidates. JCA Group does not have 
any other connection with the Group and 
is a signatory to the Voluntary Code of 
Conduct for Executive Search Firms. 
JCA Group conducted a search for 
candidates in the UK and overseas in 
accordance with an agreed candidate 
specification. A shortlist of candidates 
was agreed and candidates were 
interviewed by a number of Directors. 
References were taken on the selected 
candidate who also undertook his own 
due diligence on the Group. Finally, PRA 
and FCA approval was obtained prior to 
formal appointment.
Succession planning 
The Nomination Committee 
reviewed succession planning for 
both the Chairman and the Non- 
Executive Directors during the year. 
Whilst acknowledging that succession 
planning was key to the sustainability of 
the Board, the Nomination Committee 
was also cognisant that the majority of 
the Non-Executive Directors had been 
appointed in 2014 when a board was 
formed which would be suitable to lead 
the Company in a public environment. 
In the light of these relatively short 
tenures, the Nomination Committee 
set out the principles on which future 
succession planning should be based. 
With regard to succession planning for 
the Chairman’s role in particular, the 
Nomination Committee agreed that, 
when the time came, the search for a new 
Chairman would be led by the Senior 
Independent Director. Actions agreed 
include keeping under review, at least 
annually, the Chairman’s possible 
term; whether there are any internal 
candidates for Chairman succession; and 
any development steps that should be 
considered for such internal candidates. 
In order to develop a pipeline of potential 
successors to executive positions below 
Board level, the Executive Committee 
has reviewed the current capabilities 
and future potential of both their own 
direct reports and the teams of those 
direct reports. This has identified 
employees who would benefit from 
agreeing development plans to further 
build on their potential, and gaps 
where consideration should be given 
to recruiting potential successors. 
Executive Committee succession 
planning (including Executive Directors) 
will be an area of focus for the Nomination 
Committee during 2016. 
Diversity 
The Board embraces the benefits of 
diversity in the boardroom and believes 
that it generates effective challenge 
and decision-making. It strives for 
diversity in the broadest sense – female 
representation is just one of the factors 
that is taken into account and all Board 
appointments are made on merit against 
a defined job specification. The Company 
does not therefore consider it 
appropriate to set a measurable target 
for gender representation on its Board. 
Female membership of the Board 
currently stands at 18 per cent. 
The Board adopted a Board Diversity 
Policy in November 2015, which is 
available at www.investors.aldermore.
co.uk
Skills, knowledge 
and experience 
As mentioned above, the Board values all 
aspects of diversity and recognises the 
benefit of maintaining a balance of skills, 
experience and knowledge. During the 
year, the Nomination Committee oversaw 
an exercise to evaluate the skills and 
experience on the Board. Each Director 
was asked to self-assess his/her skills and 
experience and the results were input 
into a matrix. The Nomination Committee 
reviewed the results of this evaluation. 
The Nomination Committee provided a 
summary of the output to the Board which 
confirmed it was satisfied that Directors 
have the appropriate mix of skills and 
experience to challenge management 
and support the Group’s strategy. 
The review also identified some areas 
where, in the medium term, the balance 
of skills, knowledge and experience could 
be strengthened. These will be taken into 
consideration in any future search for new 
Non-Executive Directors. 
Election and re-election 
The Code requires that all Directors retire 
and offer themselves for election at the 
first AGM following their appointment, 
and for re-election on an annual 
basis thereafter. 
Ahead of the re-election of the Non- 
Executive Directors being recommended 
to shareholders, the Nomination 
Committee assesses the performance, 
time commitments and independence of 
each Non-Executive Director and makes 
a recommendation to the Board in this 
regard. In addition, the outcome of the 
appraisals of the Executive Directors 
(as set out on page 56) is considered. 
These assessments took place over 
January to March 2016 and based on 
these factors (described further in the 
paragraphs that follow on page 55), as 
well as the balance of skills, knowledge 
and experience on the Board as a whole, 
the Board approved the recommendation 
that each Director should be proposed 
for election/re-election at the 2016 AGM. 
Further information about the Directors, 
including their experience, is set out on 
pages 46 and 47 .
The Principal Shareholders are classed 
as a “controlling shareholder” of the 
Company under the Listing Rules. As a 
result, the Independent Non-Executive 
Directors of the Company must be 
elected or re-elected by both a majority 
of the votes cast by all of the Company’s 
shareholders and a majority of the votes 
cast by the Company’s independent 
shareholders (being all of the Company’s 
shareholders other than the controlling 
shareholder). The outcome of both of 
these votes will be announced following 
the 2016 AGM.  55 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Strategic report Corporate governance Remuneration Risk management Financial statements Appendices
Director performance 
evaluations
Details of the Director performance 
evaluation process are set out on page 
56. The outcome of the evaluations 
concluded that each Director continues 
to be effective and to demonstrate 
commitment to their role.
Time commitment and 
independence
The Nomination Committee reviewed 
the time commitment to the Company 
demonstrated by each of the Non-
Executive Directors and was satisfied that 
this was both in line with the requirement 
set out in their letters of appointment, 
and sufficient to discharge their duties. 
The external directorships and other 
commitments of the Non-Executive 
Directors was also taken into account in 
making this assessment. 
Independence of the Non-Executive 
Directors is assessed by the Nomination 
Committee on an annual basis against 
the criteria set out in the Code, which 
require directors to be independent 
in character and judgement and free 
from any relationships or circumstances 
which could affect that judgement. 
Factors taken into account in this 
assessment include length of tenure 
and any potential conflicts recorded in 
the Company’s Register of Directors’ 
Conflicts. The Nomination Committee 
was satisfied that there had not been any 
changes in circumstance which would 
impact on the previous assessment that 
all Non-Executive Directors, with the 
exception of the Directors who represent 
the Principal Shareholders, were deemed 
to be independent. It is noted that 
the Chairman was considered to be 
independent at appointment.
Shareholder-representative 
Directors 
Peter Cartwright and Neil Cochrane 
have been appointed to the Board to 
represent the interests of the Principal 
Shareholders, and are not therefore 
considered to be independent under the 
Code. Peter Cartwright has served on the 
Board for seven years. The Nomination 
Committee reviewed the contribution 
that both Directors make to the Board, 
and highlighted the significant value 
that they bring as a result of their in-
depth knowledge of the Group and 
its history, and their analytical skills. 
Notwithstanding that they are not 
independent and the length of Peter’s 
tenure, the Nomination Committee 
confirmed that it was satisfied that they 
should be recommended for re-election 
at the 2016 AGM.
Conflicts of interest
The Board has procedures in place to 
deal with potential conflicts of interest, 
which are governed by both company 
law and the Company’s Articles 
of Association. Under the Board’s 
procedures, all Directors are required to 
declare any interests that could give rise 
to a conflict of interest with the Group, 
either on appointment or when they 
arise. Under the Company’s Articles, the 
Board is permitted to authorise such 
conflicts and to impose any conditions 
on that authorisation that it considers 
to be necessary, for example to leave 
Board meetings when certain matters are 
discussed. All authorisations are recorded 
in the Board minutes, and entered into a 
Register of Directors’ Conflicts.
The Nomination Committee has provided 
guidance to the Board on the declaration 
of interests which cannot reasonably be 
regarded as likely to give rise to a conflict 
of interest. In addition, the Nomination 
Committee undertakes an annual review 
of the Register of Directors’ Conflicts 
to ensure that there have not been any 
changes in circumstances that would 
require the Board to revisit any previous 
authorisation that it has granted, or its 
view of the Directors’ independence.
Training and development 
Training sessions for Directors on topics 
of relevance to the Board are organised 
periodically throughout the year to tie in 
with Board and Committee meetings. 
In 2015, training sessions attended by 
the Directors included a session on 
Treasury Risk Management, and updates 
on the Senior Managers Regime and 
developments in corporate governance. 
The sessions were led by either senior 
management or external advisers. 
The Board values internal training 
sessions as an important way of engaging 
with key employees and familiarising 
themselves with the business. In addition, 
Directors attended relevant external 
training sessions. 
A training log is maintained by the 
Company Secretary for each Director as 
evidence of continuous development. 
A longlist of potential training 
sessions for 2016 was drafted by 
the Company Secretary based on 
proposals raised by Directors through 
the Board evaluation process, areas 
for development highlighted through 
Director performance evaluations, and 
suggestions from advisers regarding 
upcoming areas of regulatory change. 
The Company Secretary, the Chairman 
and Committee chairs discussed the 
proposals, which broadly covered 
business-related and technical/regulatory 
items. As a result, a programme of 
quarterly Board training sessions 
supplemented by Committee-specific 
training is being finalised for 2016.

Board and Committee  
effectiveness
The Board recognises the benefits that 
reviewing the effectiveness of its own 
performance and that of its Committees 
can bring, and is conscious that the 
actions needed to maintain effectiveness 
will develop over time as the Company, 
the Board and best practice evolve. 
Effectiveness is reviewed on an annual 
basis, and the Nomination Committee 
oversees this process. In 2015, the Board 
decided that the annual review would be 
conducted internally. An external review 
by Egon Zehnder took place in 2014.
The 2015 process was agreed by the 
Nomination Committee and led by 
the Senior Independent Director with 
support from the Company Secretary 
as required. The evaluation was taken 
forward by way of questionnaires which 
were issued to all Board and Committee 
members. Directors were encouraged 
to provide additional commentary 
to the “closed-ended” questions to 
provide more context to their responses. 
The results were collated and analysed 
by the Company Secretary, and the draft 
output discussed with the Chairman, 
Senior Independent Director and, in 
relation to Committees, the relevant 
Committee chairs. Finalised reports 
and action plans were presented and 
agreed by the Board and Committees. 
The output concluded that the Board 
and its Committees operated effectively 
during 2015. A summary of the outcomes 
is set out in the table on page 57 , together 
with a summary of the agreed action plan 
for 2016. Information on the Committee 
reviews can be found in the reports from 
the individual Committees on pages 62 
to 75. 
The Nomination Committee will oversee 
the implementation of the agreed 
action plan for the Board and interim 
updates will be assessed during the 
year. An update on progress against 
these actions will be reported in the 
2016 Annual Report and Accounts.
Director performance  
evaluations
In tandem with the process to review 
Board and Committee effectiveness, 
a similar process is followed to evaluate 
the continued effectiveness of the 
performance of the Chairman and  
Non-Executive Directors. 
In respect of the year under review, the 
Chairman undertook a performance 
evaluation for each Non-Executive 
Director whilst the Senior Independent 
Director led the process for evaluating 
the performance of the Chairman. 
To support the evaluations, each 
Director completed an anonymous 
questionnaire to provide an assessment 
of the performance and effectiveness of 
each of the Non-Executive Directors and 
the Chairman. The Senior Independent 
Director also solicited verbal feedback 
on the Chairman from other Non-
Executive Directors on an individual 
basis. The output from the performance 
evaluations was discussed in one-to-
one sessions between the Chairman 
and each Non-Executive Director, and 
development needs in terms of ongoing 
training were assessed. 
The performance of the Executive 
Directors was appraised by the Chairman 
(in the case of the CEO) or the CEO (in the 
case of the CFO) with input from other 
Directors. The evaluations were reviewed 
by the Remuneration Committee as part 
of the process by which changes to salary 
and bonus outcomes were approved. 
The evaluations concluded that each 
Director continues to be effective and 
demonstrate commitment to their role, 
and that each Director is able to allocate 
sufficient time to the Company to 
discharge their responsibilities effectively. 57 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Strategic report Corporate governance Remuneration Risk management Financial statements Appendices
Area Overview
Board balance 
and composition
Overall, the Directors considered the balance and composition of the Board to be appropriate 
with excellent sector and industry knowledge, and experience. Opportunities to add new skills and 
additional diversity would be considered as a natural part of Board attrition.
The role of the Board Directors felt that the role and authority of the Board is clearly defined with a clear division of 
responsibilities between the Board and management. Although there was, on occasion, a greater 
focus on the detail of operational issues than perhaps there should be, it was acknowledged that this 
reflected the approach that was necessary prior to the Company’s IPO and that it would evolve in 
due course.
Leadership and culture The culture and leadership was rated highly, and the boardroom dynamics promote good debate. 
There is robust challenge at meetings and discussions are open and constructive.
Information flows There was general agreement that the adequacy, accuracy and timeliness of information given to the 
Board was appropriate although there was some room for improvement noted in certain areas.
Strategy The strategic direction of the Group is very clear. The Board noted that the process during the last 
year in developing the business strategy had provided a good foundation on which to further evolve 
the strategic process. Offsite sessions had been very effective.
Governance and 
risk management
The output indicated that the Group is operating in line with good corporate governance. The Risk 
Management Framework has been enhanced and work continues to strengthen and embed this in 
the business.
Shareholder  
engagement
The strong work of the Investor Relations team was recognised. The Board is kept well informed of 
the market view but Directors were cognisant that this is a new area which would continue to evolve.
Succession planning 
and training
Directors recognised that, since the Board is relatively new, succession planning had not been tested, 
but they welcomed the robust framework developed by the Nomination Committee. Directors 
highlighted the ongoing need for training. The induction programme was noted by the most recently 
appointed Non-Executive Director as targeted and informative.
Meeting arrangements Meetings enable Directors to discharge their duties but sometimes meetings are called at short 
notice and have full agendas.
Secretariat The level of secretariat support has been enhanced with the development of a new function with 
strong public company experience.
Committees The composition, performance and support provided to the Board Committees were considered to 
be appropriate.
Outcome of 2015 Board effectiveness review
Actions for 2016
The following key actions were identified 
in the evaluation:
• Continue to embed the recently 
implemented new template for Board 
papers, ensuring that papers focus on 
the key issues and flag the decisions 
to be made; that there is appropriate 
analysis of data provided; and that 
information is not simply duplicated for 
different forums.
• Implement a more structured process 
to review the effectiveness of past 
decisions, and to apply lessons learned.
• Maintain the focus on succession 
planning and continue to evolve the 
framework already developed by the 
Nomination Committee.
• Review the ongoing development 
of the Risk Management Framework 
to ensure appropriate behaviour is 
embedded into the risk culture.
• Develop a comprehensive training 
programme to meet Directors’ 
requirements.
• Schedule more “informal” time for 
the Board to spend together, and 
extend some of the meetings to ensure 
there is adequate time for discussion 
of all agenda items, in particular 
strategic issues.
An update on progress against action 
points will be reported in the 2016 Annual 
Report and Accounts. 58 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Corporate governance
The Board – roles and processes 
continued
Induction of Directors
All Directors receive a comprehensive 
induction on appointment to enable their 
effective contribution to the Board as 
early as possible. Induction programmes 
are tailored to the needs of the new 
Director – the Chairman discusses 
requirements with the new Director, which 
are facilitated by the Company Secretary. 
The programme will typically include 
one-to-one meetings with business and 
functional heads; site visits; and access to 
past Board packs, relevant Group policies 
and procedures through the Board portal. 
Following his appointment in June 2015, 
an induction programme was developed 
for Robert Sharpe which aimed to 
enable him to build an understanding 
of the business and the key issues the 
business faces; to communicate the 
corporate governance arrangements 
and strategy; and to build links with, and 
access to, senior management within 
the business. Part of the programme 
included sessions with the divisional 
Managing Directors, which enabled 
him to gain an understanding of the 
history of the business areas and their 
financial, cultural and process dynamics; 
and to hear management’s views on 
the challenges, opportunities and 
strategy for the businesses. He also met 
with the heads of the Group’s central 
functions which provided him with an 
overview of the Group’s risk management 
systems and internal controls, risk 
appetite and key risks, and corporate 
governance processes. A number of 
Robert’s meetings with senior managers 
were combined with visits to some of 
the Group’s key sites across the UK. 
These visits were an important aspect 
of his induction as they allowed him to 
see operations and meet key staff in the 
business at first hand.
Independent 
professional advice
All Directors have access to the advice 
and services of the Company Secretary, 
who ensures that Board procedures are 
complied with. In addition, Directors have 
access to independent and professional 
advice at the Company’s expense. 
Information flow to the Board
The Board’s ability to discharge its 
duties is dependent on the quality of the 
information that it receives to support 
decision-making. Information should be 
accurate and clear, and provided on a 
timely basis.
Board papers
The Company Secretary takes 
responsibility for ensuring that the Board 
receives high-quality information and, 
in 2015, worked with the Chairman to 
develop a new Board paper template 
which would “signpost” the key areas of 
focus for the Board.
In the same vein, the CFO had identified 
a need to change the focus of the regular 
business performance report to the Board 
in order to provide insight rather than 
data, and to ensure that performance 
metrics were highlighted. The revised 
report was launched in Q1 2015.
Resources
A library of useful information has been 
made accessible to Directors through 
an online portal. This includes corporate 
information such as the business plan; 
corporate governance-related material; 
regulatory correspondence; and 
technical updates. 59 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015

Relations with shareholders
Investor relations
2015 was an exceptionally busy year 
in terms of engagement with existing 
and potential investors. Ahead of listing 
on the London Stock Exchange in 
March, Executive Directors and senior 
management met with a significant 
number of potential investors in the UK, 
US and Europe, many of whom later 
participated in the IPO.
Investor meetings are normally 
undertaken by the CEO, the CFO and the 
Director of Investor Relations. During the 
year, almost 200 individual and group 
investor meetings were held covering 
topics such as business performance, 
competitive positioning, strategy and 
changes in the regulatory environment. 
The Chairman and Senior Independent 
Director are also available to attend 
meetings with shareholders and address 
any significant concerns that shareholders 
may have. 
The Group provides regular updates 
on its investor relations website at 
www.investors.aldermore.co.uk including 
its half-yearly financial results, reports and 
presentations, press releases, regulatory 
news, share price data and useful 
information for shareholders with regard 
to managing their shareholding. 
Information to the Board 
The Chairman is responsible for 
ensuring effective communication with 
shareholders and the Board recognises 
the importance of constructively 
engaging with its shareholders. 
Feedback received from investors is 
regularly shared with Board members 
through the CFO’s regular business 
performance report, which aids broader 
discussions on business matters and 
other relevant topics. 
During the year, and following a 
structured process involving several 
banks, the Board approved the 
appointment of J.P . Morgan Cazenove 
and RBC as joint brokers to the Company. 
The wealth of combined experience of 
the selected broking teams in working 
with both mid-cap companies and 
specialist financial services firms was felt 
to be a particularly good match for the 
needs of the Company as a newly listed 
entity. The joint brokers attend Board 
meetings on a quarterly basis to provide 
Directors with input on market conditions 
and investors’ views. Outside of this 
formal programme, the views of the 
brokers are proactively sought on market 
developments including the regulatory 
and competitive environment. 
Principal Shareholders 
Following the sell down of 12 per cent 
of their holding in September 2015, the 
Principal Shareholders retain an interest in 
the issued share capital of 40.1 per cent. 
At the time of the IPO, the Principal 
Shareholders entered into a Relationship 
Agreement to govern their relationship 
with the Company after admission and to 
ensure that: 
• the Company is capable of carrying 
out its business independently of the 
Principal Shareholders; 
• transactions and arrangements with 
the Principal Shareholders (and their 
associates) are at arm’s length and on 
normal commercial terms (subject to 
the rules on related party transactions 
in the Listing Rules); and 
• the Principal Shareholders do not take 
any action that would have the effect 
of preventing the Company from 
complying with, or would circumvent 
the proper application of, the 
Listing Rules.
During the year, the Nomination 
Committee, in accordance with its duties, 
conducted a review of compliance with 
the terms of the Relationship Agreement 
and concluded that the Relationship 
Agreement is working effectively and 
that the Company is capable of carrying 
out its business independently of the 
Principal Shareholders. 
Since the IPO, the governance 
arrangements around Board meetings 
have been enhanced and procedures 
adopted which restrict Directors 
appointed by the Principal Shareholders 
from voting on matters where there 
are conflicts of interest and from 
using information obtained through 
their appointments. 
Under the Relationship Agreement, 
as the Principal Shareholders still have 
an interest in more than 20 per cent 
of the Company, they are entitled to 
appoint two Non-Executive Directors 
to the Board. Peter Cartwright and Neil 
Cochrane were both in office at the IPO 
and continue to serve on the Board as 
the Directors appointed by the Principal 
Shareholders. In common with other 
Directors, they will stand for re-election by 
shareholders at the 2016 AGM.
Annual General Meeting 
The Company’s first AGM as a listed entity 
will be held at 10.30am on 17 May 2016 at 
the offices of Linklaters LLP , 1 Silk Street, 
London, EC2Y 8HQ. The Notice of 
AGM, together with an explanation of 
the items of business to be discussed 
at the meeting, will be posted to 
shareholders and made available at 
www.investors.aldermore.co.uk 
All members of the Board will be in 
attendance at the 2016 AGM which will 
provide an opportunity to engage with 
shareholders on the key issues facing 
the Group and respond to any questions 
shareholders may have. All the Directors 
will be available before and after the 
meeting to meet shareholders on an 
informal basis. Voting at the 2016 AGM will 
be conducted by a poll and the results will 
be announced to the market and made 
available on the Group’s website as soon 
as practicable following the meeting.  Nomination Committee at a glance

Corporate Governance and  
Nomination Committee Report
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to welcome you to this first 
report of the Corporate Governance 
and Nomination Committee (“the 
Nomination Committee”). This has been 
an important year for the Nomination 
Committee as it set the foundations for 
its key responsibilities going forward in a 
listed environment. 
During the year, the Nomination 
Committee initially focused on ensuring 
that the Board composition was 
appropriate to support the Group’s current 
and future strategy. 
In the early part of the year, the Nomination 
Committee oversaw the appointment of a 
new Independent Non-Executive Director 
having identified the need for a further 
Director with strong retail banking and 
mortgages experience. This resulted in the 
appointment of Robert Sharpe, who we 
were delighted to welcome to the Board in 
June 2015. 
The Nomination Committee has reviewed 
the structure and size of the Board, and 
the balance of skills, knowledge and 
experience, and is satisfied that they 
are appropriate. 
Whilst a large proportion of the Board was 
appointed between 2014 and 2015 and is 
not expected to stand down for a number 
of years, it is never too early to consider 
Board and Chairman succession planning, 
and during the year the Nomination 
Committee agreed in principle its 
approach to these areas.
The Nomination Committee is also 
responsible for overseeing the Group’s 
corporate governance arrangements to 
ensure that they remain fit for purpose 
and in line with best practice. The current 
Corporate Governance Policy Framework 
(which includes key governance 
documents such as the schedule of 
Matters Reserved for the Board, Board 
Committee terms of reference and the 
written confirmation of the division of 
responsibilities between the Chairman and 
the CEO) was implemented in anticipation 
of the Company’s IPO in March 2015. 
The annual review of this framework was 
overseen by the Nomination Committee 
and I am pleased to report that, subject 
to some minor changes (including 
taking into account the PRA’s new Senior 
Managers Regime), the Nomination 
Committee concluded that the framework 
remains appropriate. 
Further detail on the key activities of the 
Nomination Committee in 2015 can be 
found on page 61. 
Looking forward to 2016, the Nomination 
Committee intends to look at succession 
planning, focusing on the Executive 
Directors and senior management, as well 
as monitoring and further embedding best 
practice governance.

Audit Committee Report
The four members of the Audit 
Committee are all Independent Non-
Executive Directors who bring a wide 
range of relevant business experience. 
In June 2015 we welcomed Robert Sharpe 
to the Audit Committee; he has significant 
financial services industry experience. 
I am also delighted that other Directors, 
who all have a standing invitation to 
meetings of the Audit Committee, 
have regularly attended meetings and 
provided valuable contributions. 
It has been a busy period for the Audit 
Committee with a significant amount 
of time spent on preparing for the IPO. 
This has included reviewing the historic 
financial information to be included in the 
Prospectus and the 2014 Annual Report 
and Accounts and satisfying ourselves 
that the Group’s internal financial 
reporting controls were fit for purpose for 
a listed company. 
In respect of financial reporting, we 
have spent considerable time reviewing 
the key judgements both for the half-
year and full-year results, and further 
detail on our debates and conclusions 
reached is set out on pages 65 and 66. 
Robust processes have been developed 
to ensure the integrity of the Group’s 
financial reporting is transparent and 
that our inaugural Annual Report and 
Accounts as a listed company fully 
meets all legislative requirements, as 
well as best practice. This includes 
providing assurance to the Board that 
the Annual Report and Accounts is fair, 
balanced and understandable, and 
we have implemented a number of 
additional procedures to enable the Audit 
Committee to make this assessment.
Dear Shareholder
I became the Chair of the Audit 
Committee on my appointment in 
May 2014 and I am pleased to present 
this first report for the year ended 
31 December 2015. 
In line with best practice and in 
preparation for the IPO, the Board agreed 
during 2014 to separate the previously 
combined Audit and Risk Committee. 
The purpose of this revised structure was 
to allow the Risk Committee to focus on 
oversight and advice to the Board on 
the current risk exposures of the Group 
and future risk strategy, with the Audit 
Committee having responsibility for 
ensuring that the interests of shareholders 
are properly protected in relation to 
financial reporting and internal control.
The report describes the work of the 
Audit Committee and takes into account 
the FRC’s Guidance on Audit Committees 
in discharging its responsibilities. 
We continue to work closely with the 
Risk Committee to ensure that areas of 
mutual interest are properly reviewed 
and challenged. 63 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015

“The key focus for the Audit Committee in 2016 will be to monitor the 
internal control framework to ensure it remains fit for purpose for a listed 
company and to support the ongoing strengthening and evolution of the

John Hitchins, Chair of Audit Committee
Responsibilities of the Audit Committee
• Monitor the integrity of the financial 
statements of the Group, including its 
annual reports, half-yearly reports and 
quarterly updates
• Challenge the consistency of, and 
any changes to, accounting policies 
and confirm whether the Group 
has complied with and followed 
appropriate accounting standards 
and made appropriate estimates 
and judgements 
• Monitor and keep under review 
the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal financial controls and internal 
control systems
• Assess whether the Group’s financial 
reports are fair, balanced and 
understandable; the appropriateness 
of the adoption of the going 
concern basis of accounting; and the 
statement that the Directors have 
a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will be able to continue its 
operation and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due
• Review the adequacy of the Group’s 
whistleblowing arrangements 
and procedures for detecting 
fraud and preventing bribery and 
money laundering
• Monitor the remit and effectiveness 
of the Group Internal Audit function, 
review all internal audit reports 
and monitor management’s 
responsiveness to the findings 
and recommendations
• Oversee the relationship with the 
external auditor, including the 
approval of audit and non-audit fees 
and terms of engagement, annually 
assessing their independence and 
reviewing their findings
We have considered the reappointment 
of the external auditor and, following an 
assessment of their effectiveness and 
independence, recommended their 
reappointment at the 2016 AGM. However, 
the Audit Committee has followed 
the developments in the reform of the 
external audit regulations with interest 
and in 2016 we propose to develop 
an audit tendering policy to provide a 
framework setting out the key principles 
and legislative requirements that will be 
taken into account when deciding when 
to implement a tender. In the meantime, 
the Audit Committee confirms that the 
Group is in compliance with The Statutory 
Audit Services for Large Companies 
Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of 
Competitive Tender Processes and Audit 
Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014.
We conducted a review of the 
effectiveness of the Group Internal Audit 
function and I am pleased to report that 
the Audit Committee agreed the function 
was operating effectively overall. There are 
some areas noted for improvement, which 
had already been identified by the Group 
Internal Audit Director, which are being 
actioned and will be monitored by the 
Audit Committee.
The key focus for the Audit Committee 
in 2016 will be to monitor the internal 
control framework to ensure it remains fit 
for purpose for a listed company and to 
support the ongoing strengthening and 
evolution of the internal control systems as 
the business grows.

Financial reporting
In respect of financial reporting, the Audit Committee considered the Company’s half-year and annual financial statements and 
considered a number of significant issues and areas of judgement (as set out in the table below).
Key issues/judgements in financial reporting Audit Committee review and conclusions
Loan impairment provisions
The calculation of loan impairment provisions 
is management’s best estimate of losses 
incurred in the Group’s portfolios at the 
balance sheet date. It involves estimates of 
expected future cash flows based on both the 
likelihood of a loan and advance being written 
off and the estimated loss on such a write-off. 
Determining the appropriateness of loan loss 
provisions is therefore inherently judgemental 
and requires management to make a number 
of assumptions. 
At 31 December 2015, the Group held 
£10.2 million of specific loan impairment 
provisions and £10.5 million of collective 
provisions respectively. 
The Audit Committee received regular reports from management during the year in relation 
to loan impairment. The most judgemental area of loan impairment provisioning relates to the 
collective provision and the assumptions used within the collective provision models. 
The Audit Committee considered and challenged all the key assumptions, including 
probability of default and emergence period assumptions, and reviewed sensitivity analysis for 
each key assumption.
The probability of default is assessed using information obtained from a credit bureau for 
comparable borrowers. These probabilities of defaults are then adjusted (usually downwards) 
to reflect the nature of the Group’s lending. The level of adjustment is based on historic 
internal data. 
Emergence period assumptions are necessary to estimate the time between the trigger 
events occurring and loans being identified as impaired. The Group has limited historical data 
available and therefore uses market insight to estimate the emergence period assumptions. 
The Audit Committee considered the key assumptions across each business line with 
consideration of the relatively unseasoned nature of the Group’s lending and the relatively 
benign credit environment the Group is currently operating in. 
The Audit Committee also considered specific cases of individual provisions. The most 
judgemental aspect of calculating specific provisions relates to the estimate of the value of 
collateral due to the specialised nature of lending in SME Commercial Mortgages and Asset 
Finance and the alternative exit strategies which can be adopted. 
The Audit Committee agreed management’s judgement was appropriate as at 31 December 
2015. The disclosures relating to loan impairment provisions are set out in Note 3 and Note 20 
to the financial statements on pages 151 and 162 respectively. 
Effective Interest Rate (“EIR”)
The EIR method of accounting for income 
recognition is judgemental and requires 
management to make a number of 
assumptions. In particular, management must 
use judgement to estimate the expected life 
of loan assets across the Group’s portfolios.
At 31 December 2015, the Group’s balance 
sheet includes the recognition of an EIR asset 
of £7 .7 million. 
Interest and fee income and expense on loan assets are recognised using the EIR method of 
accounting. This method spreads the income and expense over the estimated life of the asset. 
The EIR is calculated by management using discounted cash flow models across a number of 
portfolios which incorporate fees, costs and other premium and discounts. 
The Audit Committee considered and challenged the key assumptions with the EIR models. 
In particular, time was spent understanding the judgements management have taken in 
relation to the expected life of the loan assets. This assumption is underpinned by judgements 
made on the likely repayment profile of the Group’s portfolios (both organically originated 
and acquired), which is driven by expected future customer behaviour on a tranche-by-
tranche basis. 
The Audit Committee specifically considered the expected life assumptions with reference to 
management’s forecast information. While the Group has limited historical experience upon 
which to base the expected life assumptions due to the unseasoned nature of the lending, 
it is gradually building data on its books. At 31 December 2015 this allowed management to 
revise its assumptions that had previously been driven largely by industry experience and 
market insight in the sector. The Audit Committee reviewed these adjustments in detail 
and also considered the forecast information having regard to the current low interest rate 
environment.
The Audit Committee agreed that management’s judgement was appropriate at 
31 December 2015. The disclosures relating to EIR are set out in Note 3 to the financial 
statements on page 153. Corporate governance
66 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Key issues/judgements in financial reporting Audit Committee review and conclusions
Deferred tax
The recoverability of the deferred tax asset 
(“DTA”) requires consideration of the future 
levels of taxable profits in the Group.
The DTA at 31 December 2015 is £16.4 million. 
The Group’s DTA arises solely from temporary 
timing differences. The Group expects the asset 
to be realised in the short to medium term. 
The Audit Committee considered the recognition of the DTA including the Group’s forecast of 
the timing over which the asset would be realised against future taxable profits. 
The Audit Committee agreed with management’s judgement that it was appropriate to 
recognise the DTA based on the forecast future profits. This included consideration of the 
sensitivity of the future forecast profits. 
The disclosures relating to the DTA are set out in Note 3 and Note 17 to the financial 
statements on pages 153 and 160 respectively. 
Share-based payments
Share-based payments are material by 
nature and determination of the fair value 
of share-based payments awarded to 
Directors and employees of the Group 
requires management to make a number of 
judgements. 
A total charge of £3.4 million in relation to 
share-based payments was reflected in the 
income statement during the year. 
A number of new share plans were introduced by the Company during the year.
The Audit Committee considered the accounting for the share plans, including the 
methodology used to calculate the fair value of the awards granted and the key inputs and 
assumptions used in the valuation models to calculate the charge. 
The most subjective assumption relates to the expected volatility of the Company’s share 
price. At the grant date for awards under the executive share plans, the Company was not 
yet listed and therefore a bucket of similar shares were used as a proxy for the Company’s 
volatility. 
The Audit Committee considered sensitivities of key assumptions and were satisfied with the 
judgements applied in calculating the fair value of the awards granted. 
The disclosures relating to share-based payments are set out in Note 3 and Note 36 to the 
financial statements on pages 153 and 170 respectively. 
Goodwill attributable to Invoice 
Finance
At 31 December 2015, the Group held 
goodwill balances totalling £12.6 million, 
£8.5 million of which is attributable to the 
SME Commercial Mortgages segment, 
with the remaining balance of £4.1 million 
attributable to the Invoice Finance segment. 
Accounting standards require an assessment 
of goodwill balances for impairment on at 
least an annual basis. An impairment charge 
should be recognised where the recoverable 
amount from the segment is less than the 
carrying value of the goodwill. Judgement is 
required to calculate the recoverable amount 
of the Invoice Finance business.
Under IAS 36, the recoverable amount is the greater of either the Value in Use (“VIU”) of a 
business or its Fair Value less Costs of Disposal (“FVLCD”). As further described in Note 3 
to the financial statements, management has considered both methods for calculating the 
recoverable amount. 
During 2015, the business was refocused and management revised their projections for 
the business while the impact of this restructuring is being assessed. Using these updated 
projections, under the VIU method, the goodwill relating to the Invoice Finance business of 
£4.1 million would be fully impaired, although management note a reasonably small change 
in the key assumptions would result in the goodwill balance being supportable. The Audit 
Committee noted that, whilst this calculation is sensitive to small changes in assumptions 
about the projected performance of the Invoice Finance business, such changes are 
immaterial in the context of the Group’s overall performance.
Management determined the FVLCD by reviewing recent transactions for similar businesses 
and applying the Price/Tangible Book Value ratio from those transactions to the Aldermore 
Invoice Finance business. Management has performed an exercise to assess the comparability 
of the businesses involved in recent transactions with the Aldermore Invoice Finance business. 
Management concluded it is appropriate to use FVLCD and therefore are satisfied that the 
goodwill balance of £4.1 million in relation to the Invoice Finance segment is supportable. 
The Audit Committee received detailed analysis of the calculation of the recoverable amounts 
under both the VIU and FVLCD method. The Audit Committee considered and challenged 
management’s approach of using the FVLCD method and the detailed analysis which 
supported the valuation under this method. This included understanding the rationale for why 
the two methods could produce differing valuations. 
The Audit Committee specifically reviewed the comparable transactions used to derive a 
valuation under the FVLCD method. The Audit Committee was satisfied with the use of the 
FVLCD method, including the comparable transactions utilised by management to arrive at 
the valuation under this method. 
The disclosures relating to the Invoice Finance goodwill are set out in Note 3 and Note 24 to 
the financial statements on pages 154 and 166 respectively. The Audit Committee specifically 
reviewed these disclosures and considered the consistency with the disclosures in relation to 
the Invoice Finance business in the strategic review. The Audit Committee was satisfied that 
the disclosures were appropriate.

Fair, balanced 
and understandable
In line with the Code, the overarching 
principle for an annual report and 
accounts is that the report as a whole is 
“fair, balanced and understandable and 
should provide the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the company’s 
position and performance, business 
model and strategy” . This requirement 
was at the forefront of the Audit 
Committee’s planning process for the 
2015 Annual Report and Accounts to 
ensure that it could provide assurance to 
the Board about making this statement. 
The process enabling the 
Audit Committee to reach this 
conclusion included:
• The production of the 2015 Annual 
Report and Accounts was managed 
by the Chief Financial Officer, with 
overall governance and co-ordination 
provided by a cross-functional team of 
senior management 
• Cross-functional support to drafting 
the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts, 
included input from Finance, Risk, 
Company Secretariat, Investor Relations 
and the business lines (including the 
Managing Directors) 
• There was a robust review process of 
inputs into the 2015 Annual Report 
and Accounts by all contributors to 
ensure disclosures were balanced, 
accurate and verified, and further 
comprehensive reviews were 
conducted by senior management

Internal controls and 
risk management
The Audit Committee is responsible for 
reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness 
of the Group’s systems of internal control 
and risk management. Details of the 
risk management systems in place are 
provided within the risk management 
section on pages 105 to 108. 
Details of the process performed to 
assess the effectiveness of internal 
controls are provided on page 43.
On the recommendation of the Audit 
Committee and Risk Committee, the 
Board concluded that the Group’s 
systems of internal control and risk 
management were appropriately 
designed and operated effectively 
during 2015. 
Whistleblowing
The Audit Committee reviews the 
adequacy and security of the Group’s 
whistleblowing arrangements for its 
employees and contractors to raise 
concerns, in confidence, about possible 
wrongdoing in financial reporting 
or other matters. Under the Group’s 
Whistleblowing Policy, any concern that 
an employee has should be raised with 
their line manager, however this may not 
always be appropriate and a dedicated 
contact number is in place enabling 
employees to discuss the concern directly 
with the Head of Compliance, who will 
undertake an initial assessment and 
decide if an independent investigation 
is required.
In respect of the year under review, a 
report on whistleblowing was considered 
by the Audit Committee which concluded 
that there were no areas of concern which 
were significant or demonstrated material 
weaknesses in internal controls during 
the year. In 2016 the Audit Committee will 
be reviewing the current whistleblowing 
arrangements to ensure they encourage 
a culture of openness. Further, in line 
with many other companies, the Audit 
Committee will consider the appointment 
of an independent third-party provider to 
operate the whistleblowing line.  Corporate governance

Internal audit
The Group has an independent and 
objective Group Internal Audit (“GIA”) 
function. The GIA Director reports directly 
to the Audit Committee Chair and to the 
CEO for administrative purposes. The GIA 
Director meets with the Audit Committee 
Chair on a frequent basis and periodically 
with the whole Audit Committee without 
management present.
The Audit Committee reviewed and 
approved the GIA Risk Assessment and 
Plan of Work (“GIA Plan”) including the 
adequacy of resources and skills available. 
The GIA Director utilises specialist 
knowledge from external consultants 
where appropriate, to supplement the 
skills of the GIA team. The GIA Director 
monitors changes to the business and the 
external environment throughout the year 
and considers whether any changes to 
the GIA Plan are needed. Any proposed 
changes are reviewed and approved by 
the Audit Committee. 
The Audit Committee receives regular 
reports on progress against the GIA Plan 
including reports on individual audits 
as well as thematic issues identified. 
The Audit Committee also reviews the 
effectiveness of management action 
plans to remediate GIA findings and 
receives reports from GIA on the progress 
management has made in implementing 
audit recommendations.
To assess the effectiveness of GIA in 
respect of 2015, the Audit Committee 
performed an internal review which 
included obtaining feedback from 
members of the Audit Committee as well 
as executive management. It also had 
regard to the CIIA guidance on effective 
internal audit in the financial services 
sector. The internal review concluded 
that the function was effective overall 
noting that while there were some areas 
for improvement, these had already been 
identified and were being acted upon by 
the GIA Director. 
External audit
The Audit Committee reviews and makes 
recommendations to the Board with 
regard to the appointment of the external 
auditor, their remuneration and terms 
of engagement. Reappointment of the 
external auditor is considered by the 
Audit Committee following a review of 
their effectiveness. 
KPMG LLP and its predecessor firm, 
KPMG Audit Plc, were appointed as the 
Company’s auditor in 2009. The current 
audit partner is Mike Peck who has been 
in place since 2014. The Audit Committee 
is cognisant of the new rules that the 
external audit contract should be put out 
to tender at least every 10 years. Given we 
are a newly listed company, we have not 
yet developed an audit tendering policy 
and we have continued to benefit from 
the continuity of service provided by our 
external auditor during this period of 
significant change. We will develop an 
audit tendering policy during 2016 and 
make further disclosures in this area in our 
2016 Annual Report and Accounts. We will 
commence a tender process no later than 
2018. The Audit Committee believes that 
this timetable is in the best interests of 
the Company.
During 2015, the Audit Committee 
Chair met the external auditor on a 
regular basis during the year to facilitate 
effective and timely communication. 
Arrangements have been put in place in 
2016 for the Audit Committee to meet 
the external auditor at least once a year 
without management present so that 
they can discuss their remit and raise any 
issues arising from the audit.
Processes are in place to safeguard the 
independence of the external auditor, 
including controls around the use of the 
external auditor for non-audit services. 
Details of the Non-Audit Services Policy 
are set out on page 69. In addition, during 
the year the Audit Committee approved 
a Policy on the Employment of Former 
Employees of the External Auditor 
which provides further assurance of the 
auditor’s independence. 
In considering the reappointment 
of the external auditor, the Audit 
Committee assessed the effectiveness 
of KPMG LLP through a number of 
steps including: i) agreement of their 
engagement letter and fees; ii) a review 
of the external audit plan, including the 
experience of the audit team assigned; 
iii) an evaluation of the reports issued 
following inspections of KPMG LLP by 
the Financial Reporting Council’s Audit 
Quality Review team; iv) a review of the 
clarity and thoroughness of KPMG LLP’s 
written reports and contribution to Audit 
Committee discussions; and v) a review of 
non-audit fees to confirm compliance with 
the Group’s Non-Audit Services Policy. 
Following the review, and having given 
consideration to the performance, 
quality of the services provided and 
independence of the external auditor, 
the Audit Committee recommended to 
the Board that a resolution to reappoint 
KPMG LLP be proposed at the 2016 
AGM. This recommendation was 
approved by the Board in March 2016 
and the reappointment of KPMG LLP as 
external auditor is included in the 2016 
AGM Notice. 
Audit Committee effectiveness 
The Audit Committee undertook a review 
of its own effectiveness as part of the 
wider Board and Committee evaluation 
exercise undertaken in Q4 2015. The  
review took the form of an internal 
evaluation and was conducted by way 
of a questionnaire that was issued to all 
Audit Committee members. 
The review covered various areas 
including the role and remit of the Audit 
Committee; the effectiveness of the 
Chair; the appropriateness of information 
provided to the Audit Committee; 
and the relationship with management. 
The Audit Committee discussed the 
outcome of the review in 2016. The Audit 
Committee confirmed that it operated 
effectively and there were no significant 
areas for concern. Further information 
about the Board and Committee 
effectiveness process is set out on pages 
56 and 57 .

Non-audit services 
To ensure the independence of the 
external auditor, the Audit Committee 
has adopted a formal policy on the 
engagement of the auditor to perform 
non-audit services. 
Under the Non-Audit Services Policy 
the external auditor is prohibited 
from undertaking any work that 
is considered to threaten its 
independence or objectivity in its role. 
Prohibited work specifically includes 
bookkeeping services, the design and 
implementation of financial information 
systems, appraisal or valuation services, 
actuarial or legal services, and any 
other work that would involve the 
external auditor in preparing financial 
information that is included or disclosed 
in the audited financial statements, or in 
making judgements or taking decisions 
on behalf of management. 
The external auditor is permitted to 
undertake work in other areas as long 
as it is the most suitable supplier of the 
service and the terms and conditions 
of the engagement, including the level 
of the fee, do not impair its objectivity 
or independence. Under the Policy, 
the Audit Committee pre-approves 
the use of the external auditor for 
routine non-audit services, such as 
profit verifications and country-by-
country reporting.
Agreement to use the external 
auditor for non-audit services must be 
approved as set out below. 
When determining whether the 
external auditor is the most suitable 
supplier of a particular service, 
management and the Audit Committee 
take into account the cost-effectiveness 
of the service and the external auditor’s 
knowledge of the Group. KPMG LLP 
has policies and procedures in place 
to ensure that the highest standards of 
objectivity, independence and integrity 
are maintained, and these comply with 
the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors. The audit 
engagement partner must approve 
any non-audit services offered to the 
Group. This ensures that the objectives 
of the proposed engagement are 
not inconsistent with the objectives 
of the audit; allows the identification 
and assessment of any related threats 
to KPMG LLP’s objectivity; and 
assesses the effectiveness of available 
safeguards to eliminate such threats 
or reduce them to an acceptable level. 
KPMG LLP do not carry out non-
audit services where no satisfactory 
safeguards exist. 
During the year the external auditor was 
engaged to perform the following non-
audit services:

b Audit-related assurance services  16%

f Other services  10%
The above services resulted in total  
non-audit services being provided of 
£0.8 million. Corporate finance services 
included Reporting Accountant work on 
the Group’s IPO totalling £0.3 million. 
In 2015 the ratio of non-audit services to 
the external audit fee was 160 per cent, 
reflecting the considerable extent of work 
required from a Reporting Accountant for 
an IPO. It is not expected that this level of 
fees will continue. Further information on 
the total fees and non-audit fees paid to 
the external auditor is detailed in Note 16 
of the financial statements on page 159.  Risk Committee at a glance

Risk Committee Report
During the year, a detailed review of risk 
resourcing was undertaken to ensure the 
appropriate skills and capacity resides 
in the Group to support the strategic 
growth and development plans. 
The following sections discuss the 
activities of the Risk Committee and 
explain how it has discharged its 
responsibilities. It provides highlights 
of the key matters discussed during 
2015. This has included the significant 
work on the enhancement to the Risk 
Management Framework, its linkage to 
the redesigned Risk Appetite Framework, 
and the focus on business and strategic 
objectives. We have, in conjunction 
with the above, reviewed in detail our 
principal risks and the activity of the Risk 
Committee has been aligned to providing 
effective oversight of the risk framework, 
appetite and risk profile, as well as 
considering the emerging risks that we 
have and will continue to face over the 
coming year. 
The agenda for 2016 will include the 
continued development and embedding 
of the Risk Management Framework, 
together with the ongoing enhancement 
of the Risk Appetite Framework and 
associated metrics and processes. Finally, 
it is important that the risk management 
functions across both first and second 
lines of defence have sufficient resources 
and skills to support our risk strategies 
and plans, and the Risk Committee will 
ensure this is kept under review. 
Peter Shaw
Chair of Risk Committee
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present this first report 
since my appointment as Chair of the Risk 
Committee in February 2015. 
As noted in the introductory letter from 
the Chair of the Audit Committee, in line 
with best practice and in preparation for 
the IPO, the Board agreed during 2014 
to separate the previously combined 
Audit and Risk Committee. This revised 
structure has enabled the Risk Committee 
to focus on risk oversight and provide 
advice to the Board on the current risk 
exposures of the Group and future 
risk strategy. 
In June 2015 we welcomed Robert 
Sharpe to the Risk Committee. I am also 
delighted that other Directors, who all 
have a standing invitation to meetings 
of the Risk Committee, have regularly 
attended meetings and provided 
valuable contributions. 
Aldermore has embraced an enormous 
amount of change over 2015, as we have 
strengthened our Risk Management 
Framework and controls in line with 
our business aspirations. This has been 
the focus of dedicated resources and, 
in line with best practice for banks and 
expectations of a publicly listed company, 
we have enhanced and implemented 
our risk appetite metrics, taken 
strategic decisions over our outsourcing 
arrangements, invested in systems and 
redesigned the primary risk control 
documents to support a more effective 
risk management environment.  71 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015

Details of key matters discussed by 
the Risk Committee during the year 
are set out on page 71. In addition, 
pages 38 to 43 provide a summary of 
risk management within the Group; 
developments during 2015 and priorities 
for 2016; the principal and current 
strategic risks faced by the Group; and key 
mitigating actions. Further information on 
the Group’s approach to risk, including 
the associated governance framework 
for managing risk, stress testing and a full 
analysis of the principal risks is set out in 
the risk management section on pages 
105 to 130. 
Risk appetite 
During early 2015, the opportunity 
was taken to re-examine the Group’s 
risk appetite and the RMF . This was 
undertaken in support of the Group’s 
growth aspirations and the planned 
IPO, to ensure that the foundations 
for risk management were in line with 
growth objectives.
The Risk Committee reviewed the RAF , 
which was designed to ensure alignment 
of the overarching risk appetite with 
the Group’s strategic plans. The RAF 
was structured around the principal 
risks relevant to the Group and ensures 
appropriate metrics are in place to 
monitor performance against risk 
appetite limits. 
The Risk Committee monitored the 
implementation of the RAF during 
2015, and received regular updates 
from the CRO and business divisions. 
The RAF includes procedures to support 
the escalation of significant matters 
as appropriate, aiding enhanced risk 
awareness across the Group. During the 
year, further enhancements were made to 
the RAF metrics, reflecting the dynamic 
nature of the Group’s RMF . 
Strategic and emerging risks 
The Risk Committee received regular 
reports covering business and strategic 
risks, as part of the briefing provided at 
each meeting from the CRO. The reports 
also included coverage of emerging risks 
and any areas being closely monitored, 
which include economic and sector-
specific events. Annually, the CRO 
provides the Risk Committee with a 
report on the key risks which are relevant 
to the Group’s strategic objectives. 
These risks are then monitored during 
the year. 
The Risk Committee reviewed a Risk 
Strategy document which outlined how 
the Group’s strategy would be supported 
through the development of the RMF 
and enhancements to risk management 
across the Group. The Risk Committee 
reviewed and recommended the RMF 
to the Board for approval. The RMF 
documents the overarching approach 
to how we manage risk, which includes 
ensuring risk management is fully aligned 
with the Group’s strategy and that risk is 
undertaken within clearly defined limits.
Credit risk 
The Risk Committee closely 
monitored the Group’s credit risk 
profile and performance against risk 
appetite. At each meeting, the Risk 
Committee received an update on 
credit performance, an overview of 
the portfolio composition and key 
trends. Emerging risks and economic 
developments were considered, with the 
Risk Committee considering any potential 
impact on the Group’s risk profile and 
appetite limits. 
Over the year, the Risk Committee 
received updates on material credit policy 
changes, providing an overview of credit 
policy developments. This included the 
review and approval of the Group’s Credit 
Mandate Policy and the Concentration 
Risk Policy. 
Operational risk
During the year, the Risk Committee 
received a number of updates on 
operational risk matters including a 
detailed review of the effectiveness of 
operational risk system and processes, 
which covered business assurance 
controls, risk event management 
as well as business continuity and 
disaster recovery arrangements. 
As part of the continued development 
of the systems and controls in place 
to support the control environment, a 
revised Operational Risk Management 
Framework was approved in February 
2016. The Risk Committee also reviewed 
and recommended for Board approval 
the Group’s Reputational Risk Policy. 
Cyber security and cyber risk 
management has been an important 
area of focus for the Group during 
2015. Security enhancements were 
implemented during the year as part of a 
security review programme and the Risk 
Committee received quarterly updates on 
these improvements. 
In addition, the Risk Committee 
monitored the performance of key 
systems, significant projects, as 
well as noting material outsourced 
arrangements, which are also monitored 
actively within the revised risk 
appetite metrics. 
The Risk Committee received the annual 
report from the Money Laundering 
Reporting Officer which covers various 
areas including the Group’s arrangements 
for anti-money laundering, “Know 
Your Customer” , financial crime and 
fraud prevention, and anti-bribery 
and corruption.
Conduct risk management was an area of 
focus for 2015, and the Risk Committee 
received updates on conduct risk 
management and approved the revised 
Conduct Risk Policy. Conduct risk forms 
part of the RAF and the Risk Committee 
actively monitors conduct risk through 
this framework. 
Additionally, the Risk Committee receives 
updates twice a year on the approvals of 
new products and revisions to existing 
products, which have been reviewed by 
the Product and Pricing Committee.

Capital, liquidity and 
stress testing
The Risk Committee monitored market, 
liquidity and capital risks, receiving 
regular updates on key metrics. 
Regulatory developments were also 
considered in relation to the Group’s 
approach to stress testing with the Risk 
Committee approving the revised Stress 
Testing Framework, which applies to 
capital, liquidity and operational risk 
stress testing. It also reviewed and 
considered the ICAAP , ILAA and RRP 
documents, recommending these to 
the Board for approval. The ICAAP was 
considered twice during the year, once in 
March 2015 and again in July 2015, after 
the IPO. 
Regulatory developments 
The Risk Committee received regular 
updates on regulatory developments 
and considered the impact on the 
Group’s plans, operational processes, 
systems and controls. Major areas of 
regulatory development considered by 
the Risk Committee included aspects 
of CRD IV, changes in the depositor 
protection scheme and the Senior 
Managers Regime. The Risk Committee 
recognises the level of regulatory change 
has increased significantly and is likely 
to continue over the coming years, and 
a standing regulatory update is now 
included in its meeting programme to 
ensure it keeps abreast of developments. 
Risk Committee effectiveness
The Risk Committee undertook a review 
of its own effectiveness as part of the 
wider Board and Committee evaluation 
exercise undertaken in Q4 2015. The  
review took the form of an internal 
evaluation and was conducted by way of 
a questionnaire that was issued to all Risk 
Committee members.
The review covered various areas 
including the role and remit of the Risk 
Committee; the effectiveness of the 
Chair; the appropriateness of information 
provided to the Risk Committee; and the 
relationship with management. The Risk 
Committee discussed the outcome of 
the review in 2016. The Risk Committee 
confirmed that it continued to operate 
effectively and there were no significant 
areas for concern. Further information 
about the effectiveness process is set out 
on pages 56 and 57 . Remuneration Committee at a glance

Remuneration Committee Report
Dear Shareholder
This report provides an overview of the 
Remuneration Committee’s activities 
since 1 January 2015.
You will find our Remuneration Report on 
pages 82 to 103. This includes the Annual 
Report on Remuneration, which sets out 
how we have remunerated the Executive 
and Non-Executive Directors over the 
year ended 31 December 2015, and the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy.
The current members of the 
Remuneration Committee are set out in 
the “at a glance” box. However, I would 
also like to extend my thanks to Peter 
Cartwright, who stepped down as a 
member of the Remuneration Committee 
at IPO, for his valuable input and support 
during his tenure.
In the early part of 2015, the 
Remuneration Committee focused on 
ensuring that the Group had effective and 
appropriate remuneration arrangements 
in place ahead of its proposed listing. 
This included the finalisation of its 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy for 
inclusion in the IPO Prospectus and the 
design of a balanced scorecard approach 
to the executive annual bonus scheme. 
Later in 2015, in addition to monitoring 
executive pay and bonus schemes, 
the Remuneration Committee also 
oversaw the launch of our first Sharesave 
invitation and received updates from 
its remuneration adviser on regulatory 
developments. The European Banking 
Authority’s final guidelines on the 
remuneration provisions in the Capital 
Requirements Directive, which contains 
pay structure and policy rules for banks, 
was of particular relevance to the 
Group, and I provide an explanation of 
how this may impact our remuneration 
arrangements going forward in my 
introductory letter to the Remuneration 
Report on pages 82 and 83. 
Looking ahead to 2016, the Remuneration 
Committee will monitor the impact of the 
European and other regulatory changes 
to ensure our Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy remains appropriate and that 
we have effective and performance-
based remuneration practices that are 
well governed.

Committee effectiveness
The Remuneration Committee undertook a review of its own effectiveness as part of the wider Board and Committee evaluation 
exercise undertaken in Q4 2015. The review took the form of an internal evaluation and was conducted by way of a questionnaire 
that was issued to all Remuneration Committee members.
The review covered various areas including the role and remit of the Remuneration Committee; the effectiveness of the 
Chair; the appropriateness of information provided to the Remuneration Committee; and the relationship with management. 
The Remuneration Committee discussed the outcome of the review in 2016. The Remuneration Committee confirmed that 
it continued to operate effectively and there were no significant areas for concern. Further information about the Board and 
Committee effectiveness process is set out on pages 56 and 57 .

344,739,584 ordinary shares of £0.10 each.
The Company did not repurchase any of the issued ordinary shares 
during the year or up to the date of this report. On IPO, 1,593,839 
deferred shares of £0.10 each and 131,593,114 deferred shares of 
£0.0001 each were repurchased from shareholders as part of a 
share capital reorganisation. This represented 100 per cent of the 
deferred shares in issue at the time of the repurchase, and the total 
consideration paid was £1. 
Details of the Company’s share capital and movements in the 
Company’s issued share capital during the year are provided in Note 
35 to the consolidated financial statements.
The powers of the Directors, including in relation to the issue or buy 
back of the Company’s shares, are set out in the Companies Act 
2006 and the Company’s Articles of Association. The Directors were 
granted authorities to issue and allot shares and to repurchase shares 
at a general meeting on 9 March 2015. These authorities expire at the 
end of the next Annual General Meeting or, if earlier, on 30 June 2016. 
Shareholders will be asked to renew the authority to issue and allot 
shares at the 2016 AGM.

Going concern The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, 
as the Directors are satisfied that the Group has the resources to 
continue in business for the foreseeable future (which has been taken 
as 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements). In 
making this assessment, the Directors have considered a wide range 
of information relating to present and future conditions, including the 
current state of the balance sheet, future projections of profitability, 
cash flows and capital resources, and the longer term strategy of the 
business. The Group’s capital and liquidity plans, including stress 
tests, have been reviewed by the Directors. The Group’s forecasts 
and projections show that it will be able to operate at adequate levels 
of both liquidity and capital for the foreseeable future, including 
under a range of stressed scenarios. After making due enquiries, the 
Directors believe that the Group has sufficient resources to continue 
its activities for the foreseeable future and to continue its expansion, 
and the Group has sufficient capital to enable it to continue to meet 
its regulatory capital requirements as set out by the Prudential 
Regulation Authority.

Emissions reporting
Greenhouse gas emissions 
The Group’s greenhouse gas (“GHG”) 
emissions for 2015 were 721 tonnes 
of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO 2e) 
equating to 0.85 tCO 2e per employee. 
As this is the first year of reporting for 
the Group, there is no base year for 
comparison and no stated emissions 
targets against which to report. In 2016, 
the Group expects to establish an 
energy baseline against which it can 
report in future years.
GHG emissions for the Group have 
been collated and calculated for all 
UK operations where the Group is 
responsible for the combustion of fuel or 
energy used in the operation of facilities 
occupied by the Group. 
Reporting period 
The reporting period for emissions 
corresponds with the Group’s financial 
reporting period.
GHG scope of disclosure and 
omissions
As this is the first year of reporting, GHG 
emissions disclosure will be limited to 
Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions only as 
data was not readily available for Scope 
3 emissions. Scope 1 includes fuel 
emissions from buildings and company 
vehicles and Scope 2 includes our 
emissions from electricity. Disclosure of 
Scope 3 emissions is voluntary under 
the regulations. 
Heat and electricity supplied by 
landlords to premises occupied by the 
Group, where the heat or electricity 
is not separately reported or charged 
outside of the general building 
service charge, has not been included 
in this year’s report due to lack of 
data. Methods to obtain this data or 
reliable methods for estimation will be 
investigated and if suitably accurate 
data can be obtained then this will be 
included in future year’s reports. 
GHG data integrity and 
calculation method
The data included in this report has 
been taken from multiple sources, 
namely: utility billed data, existing 
internal calculations, existing external 
calculations from landlords, and 
expense claims in relation to transport 
usage. It has not been possible to obtain 
some data for the aforementioned 
reporting period. Where this is 
the case, data has been estimated 
either by using data from an earlier 
period or extrapolating existing data. 
Fuel consumption from vehicles for 
business travel was estimated from 
expense claim costs.
Conversion factors used in this report 
have been taken from the Department 
for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs’ 
Greenhouse Gas Conversion Factor 
Repository and the report has been 
compiled in line with the Department 
for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs’ 
Environmental, Reporting Guidelines: 
including mandatory greenhouse gas 
emissions reporting guidance.
GHG reduction plan
The Group is committed to reducing 
GHG emissions. The opportunities 
for energy savings identified through 
the Group’s ESOS (Energy Saving 
Opportunity Scheme) assessment, 
completed in January 2016, will 
be progressed and implemented 
as appropriate.
GHG data verification
All data used for GHG emissions 
reporting was compiled and calculated 
by JRP Solutions Ltd, an independent 
energy specialist.

Remuneration Report
Statement from the Remuneration Committee Chair
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to 
present our first Directors’ Remuneration 
Report (the “Remuneration Report”) for 
the year ended 31 December 2015.
The report has been divided into two 
principal sections, namely:
• the annual report on remuneration 
which discloses how the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy was implemented 
in the year ended 31 December 2015 
(the “ Annual Report on Remuneration”); 
and
• the Remuneration Policy report, which 
sets out the Group’s forward-looking 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy (the 
“Remuneration Policy”) for Executive 
and Non-Executive Directors.
A report on the key details of the 
Remuneration Committee and its 
activities is set out on pages 74 to 75.
The Remuneration Policy will be subject 
to a binding vote at our 2016 AGM and it 
is our intention to put our Remuneration 
Policy to a binding vote every three 
years unless there are changes requiring 
shareholder approval in the interim.
The Remuneration Policy is substantially 
similar to that disclosed to shareholders in 
the IPO Prospectus dated 10 March 2015. 
The only changes of substance are that 
we have proposed that:
• the cap on market adjusted allowances 
is set at 50 per cent of salary rather 
than the previously suggested 35 
per cent. This is to provide suitable 
flexibility given the uncertain regulatory 
environment and, with the exception 
of aligning the level paid to the two 
Executive Directors at 20 per cent (an 
increase from 15 per cent for the CFO), 
no further increases are envisaged at 
this time; and
• the pension allowance has been 
increased from 8 per cent to 15 per 
cent. Currently, the 8 per cent level 
applies Group-wide with no enhanced 
levels for senior staff. There is no 
current plan to change this level 
although additional flexibility is, 
again, helpful both to permit the 
Remuneration Committee to revisit 
the appropriate all-employee level 
from time to time and to permit a more 
differentiated approach should that 
prove necessary. The suggested 15 per 
cent level remains below a market level 
for senior executives.
The revised Remuneration Policy also 
reaffirms that a broader flexibility is 
retained to adjust the terms of the one-
off Pre-IPO Awards granted under the 
Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) due to 
vest in December 2016 as compared with 
the first regular grant made at IPO (due to 
vest around the third anniversary of IPO) 
and subsequent awards.
Any other changes which have been 
made from the IPO Prospectus are 
principally to reflect the context of 
re-stating this Remuneration Policy in our 
first Remuneration Report. Although the 
Remuneration Policy, if approved by 
shareholders, will not become formally 
effective until the 2016 AGM, the 
Remuneration Policy has been applied by 
the Remuneration Committee since the 
time of the IPO.
The Annual Report on Remuneration will 
be subject to an advisory vote each year 
starting with the 2016 AGM.
2015 performance and reward
In 2015, the Group has delivered 
continued strong growth and significantly 
increased profitability:
• underlying profit before tax up by 
75 per cent to £98.8 million
• underlying return on equity of 
20.6 per cent
• underlying cost/income ratio reduced 
by 9 percentage points to 51 per cent
• net loan growth of £1.3 billion or 
28 per cent
The Annual Incentive Plan (“ AIP”) is based 
on a balanced scorecard of financial,  
non-financial and personal measures. 
Approximately 87 per cent of the 
maximum was awarded to both the CEO 
and CFO in respect of 2015. 
This outcome under the AIP reflects 
the strong financial and operational 
results which the Group has achieved. 
However, in determining this outcome, 
the Remuneration Committee exercised 
careful judgement, assessing the 
quality of earnings, affordability, 
performance against the agreed risk 
profile, performance relative to peers, the 
wider economic environment plus other 
factors. This allowed the Remuneration 
Committee to consider overall Group 
performance and ensure that the AIP 
outcomes reflected this and were fair for 
both shareholders and executives.
2016 application of 
Remuneration Policy
The key remuneration outcomes in 
respect of 2016, which are in line with 
the proposed Remuneration Policy, are 
as follows:
• the CEO and CFO will each receive a 
base salary increase of 2.5 per cent with 
effect from April 2016;
• in order to align them with those of 
the CEO and the market, the CFO’s 
AIP maximum and PSP award levels 
have also been increased from January 
2016 to 125 per cent and 135 per cent 
of salary respectively, whilst his market 
adjusted allowance will be increased to 
20 per cent of salary from April 2016;
• annual PSP awards will be made on a 
similar basis to 2015, except that the 
50 per cent element which is based 
on a Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) 
condition will be subject to a more 
conventional relative assessment; and
• no changes have been applied to the 
fees of the Chairman and the Non-
Executive Directors in 2016. 83 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Strategic report Corporate governance Remuneration Risk management Financial statements Appendices
Remuneration Policy for 2016 
and beyond
The Company is currently a 
“Proportionality Level 3” firm within 
the classifications applied by the PRA 
and FCA for their Remuneration Codes 
for regulated entities. Accordingly, the 
Company is not currently required to 
apply fully all of the aspects of these 
Remuneration Codes under the doctrine 
of “proportionality” , although it has 
adopted a high level of compliance with 
all aspects of the Remuneration Codes on 
a voluntary basis.
The European Banking Authority 
(“EBA”) published final guidelines on 
the remuneration provisions of CRD IV 
in December 2015 (CRD IV being the 
Europe-wide regulation which imposes, 
inter alia, certain obligations regarding 
the structure of pay arrangements 
within banks, including an obligation 
that total variable pay should not 
exceed a prescribed proportion of 
fixed pay). While indicating that it would 
maintain a distinction between larger 
and smaller banks in many respects 
through proportionality, the EBA 
recommended that the EU and local 
regulators implement some changes 
in order to extend the requirement to 
apply a 2:1 variable to fixed pay cap to 
all regulated banks from January 2017 . 
However, in February 2016, the UK’s PRA 
and FCA together indicated that they 
were not intending to extend the cap 
to Proportionality Level 3 firms, at least 
initially. As a result, the Remuneration 
Policy has been drafted on the basis that 
the cap will not be legally applicable to 
the Company. In practice though, the 
Company has applied this cap since IPO 
on a voluntary basis, and will continue to 
do so as appropriate.
Shareholder engagement
We take an active interest in shareholder 
views on our Remuneration Policy and 
will be reviewing voting outcomes from 
our first AGM. We believe in maintaining 
ongoing dialogue with shareholders on 
remuneration and will engage regularly, 
including on any necessary changes 
to the Remuneration Policy going 
forward. Whilst we anticipate that the 
Remuneration Policy will apply for three 
years from approval, the regulation of 
pay within the sector remains under 
ongoing review and, should we need to 
revise our Remuneration Policy because 
of regulatory developments or otherwise, 
we would engage with our shareholders 
in a transparent way regarding 
our proposals.
We are committed to developing 
effective and performance-based 
remuneration policies that are well 
governed. We welcome any comments 
you may have.
The Remuneration Committee has sought 
to develop a remuneration framework 
aligned with shareholder interests and 
we hope that you will support the two 
remuneration-related resolutions.

Executive Directors’ base salary increases
At 1 April 2016 % increase At IPO (10 March 2015)

James Mack £358,750 2.5 £350,000
Fixed pay for 
Executive Directors
Base salary
The Remuneration Committee 
considered benchmarking data in respect 
of the base salaries of the Executive 
Directors, and determined that the 
increases set out in the table to the right 
were appropriate. The increases, which 
take effect from 1 April 2016, are in line 
with the proposed Remuneration Policy 
and are consistent with the average level 
of increase of 2.5 per cent awarded to 
employees in the Group generally.
Taxable benefits
The taxable benefits received by the 
Executive Directors in 2015 included 
private medical insurance (family cover), a 
car allowance and critical illness insurance. 
In addition, loans to Phillip Monks and 
James Mack of £108,317 and £31,279 
respectively were written off immediately 
prior to IPO in 2015. These loans were 
made originally to settle the tax payable 
by each of the Directors in respect of 
equity incentives awarded to them 
prior to the IPO. The write-off of the 
loans created a benefit-in-kind for 
each Director, which was taxed as a 
personal liability.
No changes to taxable benefits are 
expected during 2016.
Market adjusted allowance
The market adjusted allowance was paid 
to the Executive Directors from IPO and 
is calculated as a percentage of base 
salary (20 per cent and 15 per cent of base 
salary per annum for the CEO and CFO 
respectively in 2015).
With effect from 1 April 2016, the levels 
paid to the two Executive Directors will be 
aligned at 20 per cent.
Further information on the market 
adjusted allowance can be found in the

Pensions
Pension contributions for the Executive 
Directors may be paid into a personal 
pension arrangement or paid as a cash 
supplement (reduced for the impact of 
employers’ NICs). The CEO has chosen 
to receive a cash supplement whilst a 
contribution was paid into a stakeholder 
pension for the CFO.
For the first six months of the year, 
contributions were paid at the rates of 
5 per cent (less employers’ NICs) and 6 per 
cent for the CEO and CFO respectively. 
Consistent with employees in the Group 
generally, the cash supplement received 
by the CEO increased to 8 per cent (again 
less employers’ NICs) with effect from 
1 July 2015. The CFO chose to maintain 
contributions at 6 per cent from this date.
The Company does not intend to make 
any changes to pension contributions in 
2016. However, with effect from 1 April 
2016, the CFO has elected to be paid 
a cash supplement of 8 per cent (less 
employers’ NICs) and will cease to receive 
contributions into a stakeholder pension.
Annual Incentive Plan (“AIP”)
2015 AIP outturn
The maximum bonus opportunity was 
125 per cent of base salary for the CEO 
and 120 per cent of base salary for the 
CFO for the part of 2015 following IPO, 
and 100 per cent of base salary for both 
Executive Directors for the period prior 
to IPO. The actual percentage of the 
maximum bonus was 87 .3 per cent for the 
CEO and 86.7 per cent for the CFO. 
The table on page 86 sets out the 
performance measures and outcomes for 
the 2015 AIP .
For financial and treasury measures,  
0 per cent and 100 per cent of maximum 
opportunity is available for achievement 
of threshold and maximum performances 
respectively, with a sliding scale being 
applied between each point and the 
target level (at which point two-thirds of 
the maximum is payable). The financial 
targets are set out in the table on page 
86. The Remuneration Committee 
applied the target range as set out which 
includes minor adjustments to reflect in-
year unbudgeted initiatives.
The targets for risk, people and customer 
measures are internal to the Group 
and commercially sensitive, and likely 
to remain so. They are not, therefore, 
disclosed.
The Remuneration Committee assesses 
the non-financial elements by way of 
both internal, quantifiable targets and a 
broader qualitative assessment having 
sought appropriate input from the Chief 
Risk Officer. Key considerations that 
the Remuneration Committee took into 
account in making its overall assessment 
of these measures are set out below:
• A comprehensive assessment was 
made of the progress in embedding 
an effective risk management culture. 
This included the enhancement of the 
Risk Appetite Framework; ensuring 
that the appropriate levels of controls 
for risk management were in place; 
and reviewing the management of 
credit risk.
• With regard to the people metric, the 
Remuneration Committee took into 
account the performances in the “Best 
Companies to Work For” survey on 
both a company-wide and individual 
basis; and the operation of an effective 
approach to talent management.
• A number of key indicators in relation 
to the customer metric were reviewed, 
including the externally benchmarked 
Net Promoter Scores; the Group’s 
Ratings and Reviews service; and the 
work conducted to enhance customer 
experience, for example the work on 
digital platforms.
Key achievements within personal 
objectives are set out below:
Phillip Monks
• Achievement of the IPO
• Development of a management 
succession plan and implementation of 
key changes
• Delivery of strong financial performance 
whilst continuing to operate within the 
Board’s overall risk appetite
James Mack
• Achievement of the IPO
• Building an enhanced Finance function 
to support the listed business
• Delivery of an effective investor 
relations framework
• Enhancing data to support the business 
decision-making process
Based on the assessment of the 
performance measures above, actual 
bonuses paid to the Executive Directors 
are set out on page 86. For the part of 
2015 following IPO, 60 per cent of the 
bonus awarded will be deferred into 
shares and held under the DSP and 
for the part of 2015 preceding IPO, 15 
per cent of the bonus awarded will be 
deferred. The deferred element of the 
bonus will take the form of a conditional 
award, which will be released to the 
Directors in equal amounts over the three 
years following the award, subject to 
continued employment and malus and 
clawback provisions.
The number of shares to be awarded 
will be based on the Company’s average 
share price over the three-day period 
prior to grant and will be disclosed in the 
2016 Annual Report and Accounts.
2016 AIP
As detailed in the Statement from the 
Remuneration Committee Chair on page 
82, the maximum bonus opportunity for 
the CEO will remain at 125 per cent of 
salary and the maximum for the CFO will 
be increased to the same level.
The Remuneration Committee has 
reviewed the performance measures 
and weightings that were applied to the 
2015 AIP and is satisfied that they remain 
appropriately aligned to the business 
strategy. The 2016 AIP will therefore 
operate on the same basis as the 2015 AIP .
The various measures are currently 
commercially sensitive but will be 
disclosed in the 2016 Annual Report and 
Accounts on a similar basis to those for 
2015 in this report. Remuneration

Bonuses are calculated by multiplying earnings in the financial year by the maximum bonus potential and the percentage bonus awarded. For the period prior to IPO, the maximum bonus 
potential for both the CEO and CFO was 100 per cent. Following IPO, this increased to 125 per cent and 120 per cent for the CEO and CFO respectively. 87 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015

Long-term incentives
The Company introduced the PSP in 2015. The first awards under this plan were granted on 2 March 2015, subject to IPO. On this 
date, the Company granted awards (in the form of nil-cost options) which are subject to a three-year performance period and a 
further two-year holding period. In addition, “Pre-IPO Awards” (in the form of conditional awards) were granted to the Executive 
Directors and certain other senior managers on the same date in recognition of their contribution to the Group prior to the IPO. 
These latter awards are subject to a performance period to 31 December 2016. No holding period applies. The awards were granted 
on the basis that the participants bear employers’ NICs up to the current rate of 13.8 per cent. The awards were also subject to a 
condition that they would lapse if the participant, or any connected person, sold or otherwise disposed of any shares held by them at 
IPO within 12 months of that date.
Details of the performance measures and targets in respect of awards made during 2015 are set out below and on the next page:

 Shows the maximum number of shares that could be received, before any dividend equivalents, if the awards vested in full.
2
 Face value has been calculated using the final offer price of the Company’s shares at IPO (192p), which has been multiplied by the maximum number of shares that would vest if 
all performance measures and targets were met. Actual value at vesting will depend on actual share price at the time of vesting, and any dividend equivalents (if any) payable on 
vested shares.
3
 In the case of the nil-cost options, assumes that either the TSR or EPS performance measure threshold is met in respect of one half of the award, and that the other half of the 
award lapses.
4
 Vesting is also subject to “underpin” performance conditions. Further detail on performance conditions is provided at pages 88 and 89.
5
 Nil-cost options will lapse on 2 March 2025.
In addition to the awards noted above, 51.37 per cent of the award made under the 2015 AIP will be deferred into shares. This is a 
blended rate based on 15 per cent of the amount earned in the period up to IPO being deferred, and 60 per cent of the amount 
earned in the period following IPO being deferred. The number of shares comprising the deferred element will be calculated on the 
basis of the average share price shortly prior to grant, and will be disclosed in the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts. Remuneration

PSP awards to be made in the current year (2016)
In 2016, the Remuneration Committee intends to make PSP awards (in the form of nil-cost options) to Phillip Monks and James 
Mack with a face value (at the time of the award) of 135 per cent of base salary. With the exception of changing the absolute TSR 
performance measure to a relative performance measure, the awards will be made on the same basis as in 2015. The move to a 
relative TSR measure was considered appropriate by the Remuneration Committee as this reduces the exposure of participants to 
re-ratings (both within the sector and of companies more generally).
On that basis, half of the award will be subject to a relative TSR condition with 20 per cent of that part vesting at median versus the 
constituents of the FTSE 350 (excluding Investment Trusts and the Company itself) rising to full vesting of that part for upper quartile 
performance. The other half of the award will again be subject to an EPS scale with 20 per cent of that part vesting at an EPS of 
30p rising to full vesting of that part for an EPS of 37p. In both cases, the same underpins will apply as for the 2015 PSP awards (nil-
cost options).
Other scheme interests
In addition to awards made under the PSP as noted on page 87 , the Directors also hold the scheme interests noted below:

Executive Directors (audited)
The following table sets out the total 
remuneration paid to the Executive 
Directors for the financial years ending 
31 December 2015 and 31 December 
2014. As the Company listed in March 
2015, part of the 2015 and all of the 2014 
remuneration relates to the period when 
the Company was privately owned.
Notes:
1
 “Taxable benefits” comprises the gross value of any benefits paid to the Director, whether in cash or in kind, that are chargeable to UK income tax. Further detail is provided at page 84.
2
 Awards made under the SIP are also included under “Taxable benefits”. Consistent with other employees, a one-off award was made under the SIP to both Executive Directors following 
IPO in recognition of their contribution to the business. This has been valued at the share price on the date of grant (£2.41). These awards vested immediately on grant and are included in 
the share interests table on page 93.
3
 Details of Phillip Monks’ participation in the Sharesave Plan (2015 invitation) can be found on page 89. As the average closing share price over Q4 2015 (£2.51) is lower than the option price 
of £2.52, the option granted to Phillip Monks has not been included under “Taxable benefits”.
4
 “Taxable benefits” also includes the write-off of loans to Phillip Monks and James Mack of £108,317 and £31,279 respectively which was approved by the Remuneration Committee in 
February 2015. These loans were made originally to settle the tax payable by each of the Directors in respect of equity incentives awarded to them prior to the IPO.
5
 “Pension” is the cash value of defined contribution or cash equivalent. Further detail is provided at page 84.
6
 The “Market adjusted allowance” became payable following IPO.
7
 The “Annual bonus” figure represents the value of the total bonus. A proportion of the bonus will be deferred into shares under the Deferred Share Plan. This will be at a blended rate 
based on 15 per cent being deferred into shares for the part of the bonus earned in the period up to IPO, and 60 per cent being deferred into shares for the part of the bonus earned for 
the period following IPO. See page 86 for detail on the bonus outcome.
8
 The Directors held certain shares pre-IPO which converted into ordinary shares on IPO. The reported gains have been calculated on the market value of shares held at IPO (£1.92) less the 
actual cost of any shares bought pre-IPO, regardless of whether such shares were acquired as an investment or an incentive. As part of the IPO, the Directors were subject to certain lock-
up arrangements in respect of their shares, as set out in the IPO Prospectus. The lock-up in respect of two-thirds of each Director’s holding will expire on the first anniversary of the IPO, 
whilst the remaining one-third will expire on the second anniversary of the IPO.

Notes:
1
 The fees paid to the Non-Executive Directors relate to the period for which they held office. In addition, Glyn Jones, Danuta Gray and Peter Shaw also received fees for services to the 
Company prior to their appointments. This has also been included under “Fees”.
2
 2015 fees includes an allowance of £10,000 which was paid to the current Independent Non-Executive Directors which represented time incurred before the IPO.
3
 The total fees paid to the Non-Executive Directors in 2015 were within the current limit of £2,000,000 set out in the Company’s Articles of Association.
4
 “Taxable benefits” includes an estimate of the tax liability due on travel expenses. This amount will be agreed with HMRC and any variance will be reported in the 2016 Annual Report 
on Remuneration.
5
 The gain on Glyn Jones’ personal investment in certain shares prior to IPO has been included under “Long-term incentives” (calculated at the market value of shares held at IPO (£1.92) 
less the original cost of his personal investment). Such shares were not part of an incentive subject to any form of performance hurdles and his only ongoing financial interest in the 
performance of the Company is as an ordinary shareholder.
6
 Neil Cochrane and Peter Cartwright represent the Company’s Principal Shareholders, and their fees are paid directly to these entities. They did not receive any fees prior to IPO. 
Further information on the relationship with the Principal Shareholders can be found in Note 40 to the financial statements (related parties).

 In addition to his appointment as a Director of the Company, Chris Stamper acted as a Director of Aldermore Bank PLC for the whole of 2014. His fees in respect of this directorship are

Single total figure table: Non-Executive Directors (audited)
The following table sets out the total remuneration paid to the Non-Executive Directors for the financial years ending 31 December 
2015 and 31 December 2014.
Non-Executive Directors’ fees
The Chairman and Non-Executive 
Directors are paid a basic fee, whilst the 
Non-Executive Directors may receive 
further fees to reflect Board Committee 
or additional responsibilities.
The current fee structure was agreed 
at the time that the Board was put 
together in preparation for IPO, and 
was benchmarked at that time against 
financial services companies of a 
similar size.
The fees are reviewed by the Board (in 
the case of the Non-Executive Directors) 
and the Remuneration Committee (in 
the case of the Chairman) on an annual 
basis. The most recent review concluded 
that the fees remain appropriate, and 
no increases would be made in 2016. 
Current fees are set out below:

Payments to past Directors 
and loss of office payments 
(audited)
There were no payments made during the 
year to any person who was not a Director 
of the Company at the time the payment 
was made, but had previously been a 
Director. There were also no payments for 
loss of office made during the year.
Employee Share Trust
The Company has established the 
Aldermore Group PLC Employees’ Share 
Trust (the “Trust”), a discretionary share 
trust, for the purpose of facilitating the 
operation of the Company’s share plans. 
The Trust has not held any shares since it 
was established on 9 March 2015, and it is 
the Company’s current intention to satisfy 
any vested share awards by the allotment 
of new shares to the Trust.
Dilution
As noted above, the Company intends 
to issue new shares to satisfy awards 
outstanding under employee share 
plans, and will implement these 
arrangements in accordance with the 
Investment Association Guidelines on 
dilution. Based on the number of awards 
outstanding as at 31 December 2015, 
the levels of dilution, which are within 
the dilution limits set by the Investment 
Association, are as set out in the 
table below. For the purpose of these 
calculations, executive awards granted 
prior to IPO are excluded in accordance 
with the relevant plan rules and as 
disclosed in the IPO Prospectus.
External advisers
In April 2014, the Remuneration 
Committee engaged FIT Remuneration 
Consultants LLP (“FIT”) for the provision 
of independent remuneration advisory 
services following a competitive tender 
process. FIT does not provide any other 
services to the Group. FIT is a member 
of the Remuneration Consultants Group 
and adheres to its code of conduct. 
The Remuneration Committee reviews 
the effectiveness of its adviser on an 
annual basis, and remains satisfied that 
the advice that it has received from FIT 
during the year has been objective and 
independent. Total fees paid to FIT during 
the year amounted to £130,000, which was 
charged on its normal terms. FIT advised 
the Remuneration Committee extensively 
in the run up to its IPO in March 2015 on 
areas including the formulation of the 
Remuneration Policy, and the design 
and structure of its performance-related 
incentive plans. 
Remuneration Committee
Details of the Remuneration Committee’s 
membership, terms of reference and 
internal advisers are included in the 
corporate governance section on 
page 74.
External appointments
The Company’s policy is that Executive 
Directors may hold one external non-
executive directorship, subject to prior 
approval by the Company. Neither of the 
Executive Directors hold any external 
directorships at the current time.
Statement of voting at the 
Annual General Meeting
The Company will be proposing 
resolutions to shareholders in respect of 
its Remuneration Policy and its Annual 
Report on Remuneration for the first time 
at the Annual General Meeting to be held 
on 17 May 2016. The percentage of votes 
cast for and against and the number of 
votes withheld will be reported in the next

Remuneration Policy 
Introduction
As mentioned in the Statement from 
the Remuneration Committee Chair 
on page 82, this Remuneration Policy 
will be submitted to the 2016 AGM 
for shareholder approval. If approved 
by shareholders, it will formally take 
effect from the date of the AGM. 
The Remuneration Policy has been 
prepared in accordance with the 
regulations set out in the Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 
(‘‘the DRR Regulations’’) and is based on 
the following key principles:
Aligned to the long-term success 
of the Group
The remuneration framework is structured 
to align remuneration, and in particular 
performance-related remuneration, with 
the long-term interests of shareholders. 
Incentive plans should be designed such 
that they do not encourage excessive 
risk-taking.
Competitive but not excessive
The Group recognises that its long-term 
success is closely linked to its ability to 
attract and retain high-calibre individuals 
who can drive the delivery of its business 
strategy. However, this should be 
balanced with ensuring that remuneration 
is appropriate to the role, responsibilities, 
experience and performance of the 
individual, and is not excessive.
Appropriate and balanced 
proportion of variable pay
Total remuneration should balance 
both fixed and variable elements, 
whilst variable pay should be balanced 
between both short-term and long-term 
incentives with an emphasis on achieving 
sustainable business results.
Simplicity and transparency in 
the design and communication
The key to an effective remuneration 
structure is that the link between 
incentives and performance is clear, well-
communicated and easily understood.
To see how the Remuneration Policy will 
be implemented in 2016, please refer to 
the Annual Report on Remuneration on 
pages 84 to 94.
Future policy table
Executive Directors’ fixed pay
Element and purpose Policy and operation Maximum Performance measures Committee flexibility
Base salary
• To provide a fair level of 
fixed pay which reflects 
the individual’s experience 
and contribution
• To attract and retain the 
high-calibre individuals 
necessary to deliver the 
Group’s strategy
• Typically paid 
monthly in cash and 
reviewed annually
• The annual review takes 
into account various 
factors including:
 –  corporate and individual 
performance
 –   any change in an 
individual’s role and 
responsibilities
 –  ma r k et b e n c h ma r k i ng 
 –  average pay increases 
awarded across the 
Group as a whole
• Market benchmarking 
primarily takes into 
account pan-sector 
companies of a similar 
market capitalisation 
rather than looking at 
companies solely within 
the financial services 
sector. However, the 
Remuneration Committee 
may also consider more 
specific data and uses 
all data as a reference 
point in considering, 
in its judgement, the 
appropriate level of salary
• Although an annual 
review of salaries is 
normally undertaken, the 
Remuneration Committee 
will not automatically 
award an increase
• The Remuneration 
Committee may freeze 
salaries with consequently 
larger increases as 
and when an increase 
is awarded
• Increases will normally be 
in line with the average 
increases for staff
• The maximum salary 
increase which the 
Remuneration Committee 
may award will not result in 
the base salary exceeding 
110% of median data 
for an equivalent role 
within a comparator 
group of companies 
(the 20 companies listed 
on the London Stock 
Exchange above and 
below the Company by 
market capitalisation)
Not applicable • Base salary increases 
will be awarded at 
the Remuneration 
Committee’s discretion, 
taking into account the 
factors listed Remuneration

Benefits
• To provide market-
competitive benefits as 
part of an overall package 
which attracts and retains 
Executive Directors
• A range of benefits is 
provided, which includes:
 –  c a r a l l o w a n c e
 –  p r iva t e m edi c a l 
insurance (family cover)
 –   l i f e a s s u r a n c e
 – income protection
 –  critical illness insurance
• Certain costs relating 
to Executive Director 
relocations will be met 
where appropriate
• Benefits will not exceed 
15% of an Executive 
Director’s base salary on 
an annual basis (plus a 
further 100% in the case 
of a Director who has 
been relocated)
• As premiums are not 
taxable as benefits in 
kind, the following caps 
apply to life assurance and 
income protection:
 –  life assurance: up to 8 
times salary, although 
currently capped at 4 
times salary
 –  income protection: up to 
75% of salary
   The value of such benefits 
is outside of the above 
cap 
• The Remuneration 
Committee will monitor 
the costs in practice 
and ensure that the 
overall costs do not 
increase by more than it 
considers appropriate in 
all circumstances
Not applicable • The Remuneration 
Committee reserves 
the discretion to 
introduce new benefits 
as appropriate
Pension 
• To enable Executive 
Directors to build 
long-term savings for 
retirement, within a market-
competitive package
• To attract and retain high-
calibre individuals
• Contributions may be 
paid into personal pension 
arrangements or as a cash 
supplement (reduced for 
the impact of employers’ 
NICs) 
• Up to 15% of base salary 
p.a.
• This is higher than was set 
out in the IPO Prospectus 
– although there are no 
plans to change pension 
contributions currently, 
this higher cap allows for 
suitable flexibility
Not applicable Not applicable
Market 
adjusted allowance 
• To ensure appropriate 
weighting of fixed and 
variable remuneration 
within an overall market-
competitive package
• The allowance ensures 
that the gearing of 
the overall package 
remains appropriate
• A fixed monthly allowance, 
typically paid in cash 
• Paid on the same basis 
as salary but will not be 
taken into account for the 
purposes of:
  –   incentive pay multiples
  –   pensions or insured 
benefits
  –   s h a r e h old in g g u i d e l in e s
  –   t e r m i n ati on or 
redundancy payments
• In order to provide a 
formal cap, the maximum 
level of market adjusted 
allowance will be limited 
to 50% of base salary p.a. 
for the duration of this 
Remuneration Policy. 
This level is higher than set 
out in the IPO Prospectus 
– although there is no 
current intention to 
increase the current levels, 
this ensures that suitable 
flexibility is retained 
Not applicable • Increases in the market 
adjusted allowance 
will be awarded at 
the Remuneration 
Committee’s discretion, 
but will only be increased 
if there is a meaningful 
change in the appropriate  
market benchmarks
• Market adjusted 
allowances may be 
settled in shares or 
other instruments 97 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015

Annual Incentive Plan 
(‘‘AIP’’)
• To motivate Executive 
Directors and incentivise 
delivery of performance 
over a one-year operating 
cycle, focusing on the 
short- to medium-term 
elements of the Group’s 
strategic aims 
• A proportion of the 
annual bonus is deferred, 
which encourages a 
longer-term focus and 
aligns the interests of 
the Executive Directors 
with shareholders
• A bonus plan which 
operates annually. 
Performance measures are 
set by the Remuneration 
Committee at the start 
of the financial year. 
Performance targets 
are assessed by the 
Remuneration Committee 
following the year-end and 
the AIP outcome is agreed
• At least 40% of the AIP 
outcome is deferred 
into shares under the 
Company’s Deferred 
Share Plan (“DSP”), whilst 
at least 60% of the AIP 
outcome is deferred if total 
variable remuneration 
exceeds £500,000 p.a.
• The balance is normally 
paid in cash
• The deferred element 
is typically released in 
tranches of one-third 
on the first, second and 
third anniversaries of 
the award, subject to 
continued employment
• Shares within the DSP 
may accrue dividend 
equivalents which may be 
settled in cash or shares 
(and which are excluded 
from the limit in the 
next column)
• Both the cash and 
deferred elements of the 
bonus may be subject to 
malus and clawback
• The maximum level of AIP 
outcomes is 125% of base 
salary p.a.
• Performance measures 
applied may be financial 
or non-financial and 
corporate, divisional 
or individual, and in 
such proportions as the 
Remuneration Committee 
considers appropriate. 
The performance 
measures which apply to 
2016 only are summarised 
on page 85
• The AIP outcome is 
determined by assessing 
each performance 
measure on the 
following basis:
 –  attaining the threshold 
level of performance 
produces a nil pay-out
 –  a sliding scale (not 
necessarily straight-line)
is applied between the 
threshold and maximum 
levels, full pay-out being 
achieved for this latter 
level
 –  no more than two-
thirds of maximum is 
payable for on-target 
performance 
• The Remuneration 
Committee must be 
satisfied that the result was 
achieved consistent with 
the Group’s risk appetite
• The Remuneration 
Committee retains 
discretion to adjust 
performance measures 
and targets during the 
year to take account 
of events outside of 
management control 
which were unforeseen 
when the measures and 
targets were originally set
• The Remuneration 
Committee retains 
a standard power to 
apply its commercial 
judgement to adjust the 
outcome of the AIP for 
any performance measure 
(from zero to any cap) 
should it consider that to 
be appropriate
• The Remuneration 
Committee reserves 
the right to further 
modify the operation 
of the AIP to comply 
with developments in 
regulatory requirements 
and market practice 
subject to the overall 
cap. Operation of the 
AIP and DSP will not, 
in the Remuneration 
Committee’s view, be 
made less onerous. 
In particular, the 
Remuneration Committee 
may vary the deferral 
terms and settle awards 
in cash, shares and 
other instruments Remuneration

Performance Share 
Plan (“PSP”)
• To motivate and incentivise 
delivery of sustained 
performance over 
the long term, and to 
promote alignment with 
shareholders’ interests
• A long-term incentive 
plan under which awards 
are made annually as 
either nil-cost options or 
conditional awards
• Vesting is subject to 
performance conditions 
and continued 
employment over a period 
of at least three years
• After the performance 
period, awards are subject 
to a holding period of a 
further two years
• Shares within the PSP 
may accrue dividend 
equivalents which may be 
settled in cash or shares 
(and which are excluded 
from the limit in the 
next column)
• Malus and clawback may 
be applied to PSP awards
• The PSP allows for awards 
over shares with an 
absolute maximum value 
of 200% of base salary per 
financial year
• Where awards are not 
made in a financial 
year due to regulatory 
constraints, this limit will be 
carried forward
• Performance measures 
applied may be financial 
or non-financial and 
corporate, divisional 
or individual, and in 
such proportions as the 
Remuneration Committee 
considers appropriate. 
The performance measures 
which apply to 2016 only 
are summarised on page 89
• Performance periods will 
not be less than (but may 
be longer than) three years
• No more than 20% of 
awards vest for attaining 
the threshold level 
of performance 
• The Remuneration 
Committee must be 
satisfied that the result was 
achieved consistent with 
the Group’s risk appetite
• Awards may be settled in 
cash or other instruments
• Once set for an award, 
performance measures 
and targets will generally 
remain unaltered unless 
events occur which, 
in the Remuneration 
Committee’s opinion, 
make it appropriate to 
substitute or vary them
Non-Executive Directors
Element and purpose Policy and operation Maximum Performance measures Committee flexibility
Chairman and Non-
Executive Director fees 
• To enable the Company 
to recruit and retain, at 
an appropriate cost, 
Non-Executive Directors 
with the necessary 
skills and experience to 
oversee the delivery of the 
business strategy
• Fees of the Chairman 
and the Non-Executive 
Directors are set by the 
Remuneration Committee 
and the Board respectively
• Fees are structured as:
  –  basic fee
  –   additional fees for 
chairmanship and 
membership of Board 
Committees
  –   additional fees for 
further responsibilities 
(e.g. Senior Independent 
Director)
• Fees are reviewed 
annually. Factors taken 
into account in the annual 
review include:
  –   t i me c o m m i t men t
  –   eq u iva l e n t be n c h m a r k s 
to those considered for 
Executive Directors with 
a particular emphasis 
on other banks/financial

• The aggregate fees 
(together with any shares 
and/or benefits including 
the reimbursement of 
travel and other expenses, 
and an amount to meet any 
tax liability arising on such 
expenses) of the Chairman 
and of Non-Executive 
Directors will not exceed 
the limit set out within

fees in shares or other 
instruments
  –  permit the Chairman 
or Non-Executive 
Directors to participate 
in any benefits in kind
  –  change the basis of 
paying fees within the 
constraints of the cap 99 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015

Additional information to future 
policy table
i. Legacy arrangements
It is the Group’s policy to honour any 
commitment made to a Director before 
the Remuneration Policy takes effect, 
subject to shareholder approval, on 
16 May 2016 or before he or she became 
a Director even if doing so may be 
inconsistent with the Remuneration Policy 
in place at the time the commitment 
comes to be honoured. This would 
cover, for example, the vesting of a 
long-term incentive award granted 
before the Remuneration Policy took 
effect or a person became a Director 
even if the award was not consistent with 
the Remuneration Policy in place at the 
time of vesting. In particular, a different 
approach may apply to the one-off Pre-
IPO Awards (granted under the PSP) due 
to vest in December 2016. These, in part, 
were made in recognition of pre-IPO 
performance and the Remuneration 
Committee reserves a broader discretion 
to amend the relevant performance 
conditions or extend these awards 
should it consider it appropriate in 
the circumstances. 
ii. Maximum amounts
The DRR Regulations and related investor 
guidance encourages companies to 
disclose a cap within which each element 
of the Remuneration Policy will operate. 
Where maximum amounts for elements 
of remuneration have been set within the 
Remuneration Policy, these will operate 
simply as caps and are not indicative of 
any aspiration.
iii. Malus and clawback
As noted in the Remuneration Policy 
table, the rules of the AIP , DSP and PSP 
include provisions for malus and/or 
clawback which allow the Remuneration 
Committee to reduce awards under 
certain circumstances. Malus may be 
employed where an award of shares has 
not yet been made, and clawback will be 
used where cash has been paid or a share 
award has already vested. 
The chart illustrates the potential outcomes of the Remuneration Policy for Executive 
Directors based on three different scenarios. The assumptions on which the scenarios 
are based are set out below:
Scenario Assumptions
Minimum Consists of base salary, benefits, market adjusted allowance and 
pension, as set out in the table below:
Base 
salary Benefits Pension
Market 
adjusted 
allowance Total
Phillip Monks 509 20 41 102 672
James Mack 357 14 27 67 465
–  Base salary is the salary to be paid in 2016.
–  Benefits represent the total benefits as shown in the single total 
figure table for 2015 less the one-off write-off of a loan prior to 
IPO and taking a single year’s maximum savings under Sharesave 
regardless of the personal investment choice of the executive.
–  Pension contributions are 8% of base salary for Phillip Monks; and 
6% of base salary for James Mack until 31 March 2016 and 8% from 
1 April 2016, in line with the Remuneration Policy.
–  Market adjusted allowance is 20% of base salary for Phillip Monks; 
and 15% until 31 March 2016 and 20% from 1 April 2016 for James 
Mack.
–  No bonus is payable and no awards vest under the PSP (or other 
long-term incentive plan).
In line with 
expectations
Based on what the Director would receive if performance was on-
target (excluding share price appreciation and dividends):
– AIP:  consists of the on-target bonus of two-thirds of maximum 
opportunity.
– PSP: consists of the threshold level of vesting (20% vesting).
Maximum Based on the maximum remuneration receivable (excluding share 
price appreciation and dividends):
–  AIP:  consists of maximum bonus of 125% of base salary for each of 
Phillip Monks and James Mack.
–  PSP:  consists of the face value of awards to be made each year under 
the Remuneration Policy (135% of base salary for each of Phillip 
Monks and James Mack).

iv.  Selection of performance 
measures and targets
The Group’s policy is to ensure that 
performance-related remuneration is 
aligned to the Group’s strategic and long-
term goals, and performance measures 
and targets are set within this context.
The AIP is designed to align executive 
performance over a one-year period 
with the Group’s operating cycle, and 
the Remuneration Committee agrees 
a balanced scorecard of performance 
measures, weightings and targets for 
each Executive Director which are linked 
to the key goals within the one-year 
business plan. The measures selected are 
a combination of financial, operational, 
risk-related and personal performance 
measures. Details of the performance 
measures selected in respect of the 2016 
AIP can be found in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration on page 85. 
The purpose of the PSP is to incentivise 
sustained performance over the long 
term. The performance measures 
selected (TSR and EPS) are consistent 
with the creation of long-term 
shareholder value whilst the targets 
are aligned to the Group’s long-
term strategy. TSR demonstrates the 
delivery of shareholder returns, one of 
the Group’s key long-term objectives, 
whilst EPS is a key performance 
metric. The Remuneration Committee 
selected these performance measures 
as they provide a balance between 
delivery of earnings and external 
market performance.
v. Discretion
In addition to the areas of flexibility 
highlighted in the Remuneration Policy 
table, consistent with normal market 
practice the Remuneration Committee 
also retains flexibility to operate within 
various areas including:
• Determining the performance 
measures, weightings and targets for 
incentive plans from year to year
• Agreeing the size of awards, payments 
or when and how much of an award 
should vest
• Agreeing whether a participant is a 
good or bad leaver, and the treatment 
of awards as a result
• The application of malus and 
clawback provisions
vi.  Policy on the remuneration of 
employees generally
The Group has implemented a firm-wide 
remuneration policy which is based on 
the principles of attracting and retaining 
high-calibre individuals who will promote 
the long-term interests of the Group; 
aligning remuneration, which shall not 
be excessive, to those interests; and 
ensuring that the proportion of any 
variable pay is appropriate and balanced 
and takes account of any impact of risk. 
Whilst the quantum and components 
of the remuneration of the Executive 
Directors may vary from that of the wider 
employee population, they are based on 
these same principles.
In line with the Executive Directors, all 
employees are paid a base salary which is 
reviewed annually by reference to market 
rates. In addition, all employees receive 
benefits (which may vary according 
to seniority) and a pension provision. 
However, the Executive Directors (and the 
Group’s senior leadership team) are able 
to influence the Group’s performance, 
and they are incentivised to do so through 
the inclusion of variable share-based 
pay within their remuneration package. 
Employees within control functions do 
not participate in incentive pay plans 
where the outcome is dependent upon 
financial performance metrics relating 
to the business over which they have 
oversight. They may participate in the 
Restricted Share Plan (“RSP”) which can 
vest after the satisfaction of any continued 
employment requirements and the 
expiry of any holding period. Other less 
senior employees may also receive 
awards under the RSP at the discretion 
of the Remuneration Committee, 
whilst Executive Directors are excluded 
from participating.
vii. Travel and hospitality
While the Remuneration Committee 
does not generally consider it to form 
part of benefits, it has been advised that 
corporate hospitality (whether paid for by 
the Company or another) and business 
travel for Directors (and exceptionally 
their families) may technically fall within 
the applicable rules and so the Company 
expressly reserves the right for the 
Remuneration Committee to authorise 
such activities within its agreed policies, 
in addition to the stated caps for benefits 
in kind (for Executive Directors) or in 
addition to the fees for the Chairman and 
Non-Executive Directors.
viii. Loans and staff discounts
The Group may provide loans, other 
financial products which are offered 
by the Group to customers, and/or 
staff discounts to a Director on a 
similar basis as they are available to 
employees generally. 101 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Strategic report Corporate governance Remuneration Risk management Financial statements Appendices
Recruitment 
Remuneration Policy
Appointment of Executive 
Directors
The Remuneration Policy balances the 
need to have appropriate remuneration 
levels with the ability to attract 
high-performing individuals to the 
organisation. With this in mind, the 
starting point for the Remuneration 
Committee in setting a remuneration 
package for a new Executive Director will 
be to structure a package in accordance 
with the Remuneration Policy, based 
on the individual’s knowledge and 
experience. Consistent with the DRR 
Regulations, the caps contained within 
the Remuneration Policy for fixed pay 
do not apply to new recruits, although 
the Remuneration Committee does not 
currently envisage exceeding these caps 
in practice.
Notwithstanding the general approach 
set out above, the Remuneration 
Committee recognises that, when 
recruiting externally in particular, it may 
be necessary to compensate an individual 
to ensure that they are remunerated 
effectively. The table to the right sets 
out areas where the Remuneration 
Committee may exercise its discretion 
in order to achieve this. This may arise 
in particular in relation to bonus and 
incentive plans given that variable 
performance-related pay is widely used 
in the financial services industry to 
incentivise senior management.
Appointment of Non-Executive 
Directors
A new Non-Executive Director would be 
recruited on terms in accordance with 
the approved Remuneration Policy at 
that time.
Recruitment Remuneration Policy – Remuneration 
Committee discretion
Relocation expenses
For external and internal appointments, certain relocation expenses may be 
provided and may be paid over more than one financial year. As set out in the 
Remuneration Policy, this may be up to a maximum of 100 per cent of base salary 
per annum (over and above the general policy on payment of benefits).
AIP
The AIP will operate as detailed in the Remuneration Policy (including the 
maximum award levels).
In the year of appointment, at the Remuneration Committee’s discretion, the 
terms of that year’s AIP and the performance measures will normally be varied to 
reflect the part year worked. 
For an internal appointment, any award under the AIP in respect of the 
individual’s prior role may either continue on its original terms or be adjusted to 
reflect the new appointment as appropriate.
No element of AIP will be guaranteed, unless in the year of joining a guaranteed 
element is used as part of a buy-out of awards forfeited on leaving the previous 
employer (see below for further detail).
PSP
The PSP will operate as detailed in the Remuneration Policy (including the 
maximum award levels).
For an internal appointment, in line with the AIP , PSP awards in respect of the 
individual’s prior role may either continue on its original terms or be adjusted to 
reflect the new appointment as appropriate.
Buy-out awards
For external candidates, it may be necessary to make additional awards in 
connection with the recruitment to buy out awards forfeited by the individual 
on leaving a previous employer. Although these are not subject to a formal cap, 
the Group will not pay more than is necessary, in the view of the Remuneration 
Committee, to fairly compensate for awards forfeited on leaving the previous 
employer to join the Group and will in all cases seek to deliver any such awards 
under the terms of the existing AIP and PSP . In some cases however, it may be 
necessary to make such buy-out awards on different terms to reflect better the 
structure of the awards being bought out.
All buy-outs, whether under the AIP , PSP or otherwise, will take account of 
the service obligations and performance requirements for any remuneration 
relinquished by the individual when leaving their previous employer. The 
Remuneration Committee will seek to make buy-outs subject to what are, in 
its opinion, comparable requirements in respect of service and performance. 
However, the Remuneration Committee may choose to relax this requirement in 
certain cases, for example:
– where the service and/or performance requirements are materially completed, or 
–  where such factors are, in the Remuneration Committee’s view, reflected in some 
other way, such as a significant discount to the face value of the awards forfeited, 
or
–  where necessary to retain compliance with regulatory requirements, such as

Service agreements, payments 
for loss of office and 
termination policy
Executive Directors
The terms under which the Executive 
Directors are appointed are set out in 
service agreements with the Company. 
In line with current market practice, the 
Executive Directors have rolling service 
agreements, which may be terminated 
by the Company or the individual on 
12 months’ notice. The date of each 
Executive Director’s service agreement 
is 10 March 2015. Copies of the service 
agreements of the Executive Directors are 
available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office. They will also be 
available for inspection prior to and 
during the AGM.
Under the service agreements, the 
Company may make a payment in lieu of 
notice to an Executive Director. This will 
be limited to the amount of base salary 
and, potentially, other fixed benefits 
for the notice period and may be paid 
in instalments. The Director is obliged 
to seek alternative work during this 
period and the payments may cease 
or be reduced if the individual finds an 
alternative role. 
Service agreements may be terminated 
without notice or payment in lieu of notice 
under a range of circumstances including 
gross misconduct, fraud or dishonesty, 
and negligence and incompetence. 
The agreements do not contain change 
of control provisions.
The Remuneration Committee is 
opposed to rewarding failure and, when 
considering a termination, takes account 
of all of the information available to it at 
the time. This policy applies both to any 
negotiations linked to notice periods on a 
termination and any treatments which the 
Remuneration Committee may choose to 
apply under the discretions available to it 
under the terms of the AIP , DSP and PSP . 
The potential treatments on termination 
under these plans are summarised below.
Plan “Approved leaver” (e.g. death, injury 
or disability, redundancy, retirement) 
or otherwise at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee (including 
on resignation) 
“Unapproved leaver” 
(e.g. resignation)
Termination by the 
Company 
for misconduct
Other exceptional cases 
(e.g. change of control, winding up 
of the Company)
Annual 
Incentive Plan 
(“AIP”)
Payment of the award is at the discretion 
of the Remuneration Committee.
Award usually time pro-rated for the 
period of service and released at the end 
of the performance period, subject to 
assessment of performance conditions.
No awards made for the year 
of leaving.
No awards made for 
the year of leaving.
Payment of the award is at the 
discretion of the Remuneration 
Committee.
Award usually time pro-rated subject 
to satisfaction of performance 
conditions, which are assessed over 
the period to the date of the event.
Deferred 
Share Plan 
(“DSP”)
Unvested awards will vest at the original 
vesting dates.
However, the Remuneration Committee 
retains discretion to accelerate vesting 
to the date of cessation.
If leaving before the employment 
requirement date
1
 all unvested 
awards will lapse.
If leaving after the employment 
requirement date
1
, unvested 
awards will vest at the original 
vesting dates. However, in 
this case the Remuneration 
Committee retains discretion to 
accelerate vesting to the date of 
cessation.
All unvested awards 
will lapse.
Awards will normally vest early, 
but may be exchanged for a new 
award over shares in the acquiring 
company in the case of an internal 
reorganisation.
Performance 
Share Plan 
(“PSP”)
If leaving before the employment 
requirement date
2
, awards will vest at 
the original vesting date on a time pro-
rated basis for the period of service and 
subject to performance conditions.
If leaving after the employment 
requirement date
2 
but before the end of 
the holding period, unvested awards will 
vest at the original vesting dates.
Under both scenarios, the Remuneration 
Committee retains discretion to 
accelerate vesting to the date of 
cessation.
The Remuneration Committee also has 
discretion to reduce or disapply the 
time pro-rating.
If leaving before the employment 
requirement date
2
 all unvested 
awards will lapse.
If leaving after the employment 
requirement date
2 
but before 
the end of the holding period, 
unvested awards will vest at the 
original vesting dates. However, 
in this case the Remuneration 
Committee retains discretion to 
accelerate vesting to the date 
of cessation.
All unvested awards 
will lapse.
Awards will normally vest early, 
but may be exchanged for a new 
award over shares in the acquiring 
company in the case of an internal 
reorganisation.
The extent to which the award vests 
will be determined by review of 
performance conditions and applying 
time pro-rating.
The Remuneration Committee has 
discretion to reduce or disapply the 
time pro-rating. 103 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Strategic report Corporate governance Remuneration Risk management Financial statements Appendices
The Remuneration Committee may 
also approve payment of amounts in 
settlement of statutory or contractual 
claims based on legal advice and may 
make payment of an amount in respect of 
legal, tax and outplacement services as it 
considers appropriate.
Chairman and Non-Executive 
Directors
The Non-Executive Directors (including 
the Chairman) are appointed pursuant 
to letters of appointment, which set 
out the terms of their appointment. 
The appointment is subject to termination 
by the Company at any time with three 
months’ written notice. Directors are 
requested, but not obliged, to give three 
months’ notice. The letters do not provide 
for compensation for loss of office. All 
Non-Executive Directors are subject to 
annual re-election by shareholders at 
the AGM, however should the Director 
not be re-elected by shareholders their 
appointment will cease immediately and 
without compensation.
Copies of the letters of appointment 
of the Non-Executive Directors are 
available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office. They will also be 
available for inspection prior to and 
during the AGM.
Share ownership guidelines
In order to further align the interests 
of Executive Directors with those of 
shareholders, the Company introduced 
share ownership guidelines at IPO. 
The guidelines require the Executive 
Directors to build up a specified level of 
shareholding (expressed as a percentage 
of base salary) within five years of the 
guidelines being implemented (or within 
five years of appointment, if later). 
The required level of shareholding is 
200 per cent of base salary, using the 
current share price from time to time, 
for each of the Executive Directors. 
The Remuneration Committee reserves 
the discretion to amend these levels 
in future years, provided that the 
revised levels will not, in the view of 
the Remuneration Committee, be less 
onerous overall.
Under the guidelines, the Executive 
Directors are expected to retain all of 
the ordinary shares vesting under any 
of the employee share plans, after any 
disposals for the payment of applicable 
taxes and any acquisition costs, until 
they have achieved the required level 
of shareholding. Vested awards not 
subject to any performance condition 
(but subject to a holding period) count as 
ownership towards the guidelines after 
deducting the tax which would be due 
if the shares were released on that date. 
The guidelines also prohibit the Executive 
Directors from hedging (or offering as 
collateral) any shares which are unvested 
or unexercised under any employee 
share plans, and any shares which count 
towards meeting the guidelines.
Other shares owned by Executive 
Directors and their connected 
persons also count towards the share 
ownership guidelines.
All-employee share plans
Executive Directors are invited to 
participate in all-employee share plans 
on the same basis as other Group 
employees. The purpose of these plans 
is to encourage share ownership by 
employees, thereby allowing them to 
share in the long-term success of the 
Group and align their interests with 
those of the shareholders. The plans 
are operated within the maximum 
participation levels permitted under 
HMRC regulations from time to time. 
The Company has established both a 
Sharesave and a Share Incentive Plan 
(“SIP”). The SIP was used as a vehicle to 
award free shares to employees following 
IPO in recognition of their contribution 
to the business. Awards of between £200 
and £1,000 were made, based on length 
of service.
External appointments
The Company recognises that it can 
benefit from Executive Directors holding 
outside non-executive directorships. 
Under the Company’s policy, the 
Executive Directors are permitted to 
hold no more than one such position, 
subject to the Company’s prior approval. 
The Remuneration Committee reserves 
the right to determine whether or not any 
fees receivable by the Director should be 
paid on to the Company.
Consideration of employment 
conditions elsewhere in 
the Group
Pay and employment conditions generally 
in the Group are taken into account when 
setting Executive Directors’ remuneration. 
The Remuneration Committee receives 
regular updates on overall pay and 
conditions in the Group, including salary 
increases for the general employee 
population; has oversight of significant 
changes in employee benefit structures 
(including pension provisions); and 
approves staff bonus pools. It also 
oversees the HMRC qualified all-
employee share plans which Executive 
Directors and all other Group employees 
can participate in on the same terms 
and conditions. As is normal commercial 
practice, the Company does not consult 
with its employees in preparing the 
Remuneration Policy.
Consideration of shareholder 
views
In formulating this Remuneration Policy, 
the Company took into account the views 
of its major shareholders. Should any 
significant changes be proposed to the 
Remuneration Policy going forward, 
the Company will engage with its 
shareholders to seek their views. The 2016 
AGM will be the first occasion on which 
the Company will formally seek the 
support of its post-IPO shareholders in a 
general meeting for matters relating to 
the remuneration of Directors, and the 
Remuneration Committee will consider all 
of the feedback which it receives from its 
shareholders during this process.

Risk management
The Group’s approach to risk
Effective risk management plays a key role 
in the execution of the Group’s strategy 
of supporting UK SMEs, homeowners, 
landlords and savers. Risk-taking is an 
inherent part of banking, and as a business 
we aim to make a profit from taking risk 
in a controlled way. The Board and senior 
management ensure that the risks the 
Group is taking are clearly identified, 
managed, monitored and reported and 
that the Group’s resources are capable 
of withstanding both expected and 
unexpected levels of risk performance.
The Risk Overview on pages 38 to 42 
provides a summary of risk management 
within the Group and describes 
developments during 2015 and priorities 
for 2016. It highlights the principal risks 
we face and key mitigating actions. 
Risk Management Framework
The Risk Management Framework 
outlines the governance, policies, 
procedures, systems, tools, techniques 
and activities by which the Board and 
senior management establish and 
monitor the Group’s risk appetite and 
effectively manage risk.
Risk management refers to the process 
of identification, managing, monitoring 
and reporting of risks to which the 
Group is exposed. Senior management 
ensure that the Risk Management 
Framework is embedded in its day-to-
day management and control activities.

to risk, the associated governance 
framework, stress testing and provides a 
full analysis of the principal risks. 
Risk strategy
We have clearly defined our risk 
management objectives and have 
a strategy to deliver them. Our risk 
management strategy is to:
• Identify our principal and 
emerging risks
• Define our risk appetite and ensure that 
the business plans are consistent with it
• Manage risk within the business with 
independent effective oversight
• Ensure that the business plans are 
supported by effective risk controls, 
technology, and people capabilities 
• Manage the risk profile to ensure that 
the business strategy can withstand a 
range of adverse conditions 
• Ensure a sound risk control environment 
and risk-aware culture
• Ensure our compensation practices 
ensure only prudent risk taking within 
our risk appetite is rewarded.

Legal and regulatory 
environment
We operate within the context of the UK 
legal and regulatory environment (as well 
as European law adopted and supported 
by UK regulators). The Legal Counsel and 
Compliance functions ensure that we are 
aware of both current and upcoming legal 
or regulatory requirements. Reporting of 
any forthcoming changes to regulation 
or law is routinely made to the relevant 
committees for awareness, impact 
and action.
Risk management
Risk appetite framework and 
risk culture:
• Risk appetite statement
• Risk culture
• Risk policies and procedures
Risk Appetite Framework
The Risk Appetite Framework (“RAF”) is 
the overarching framework through which 
we set individual risk appetites for each 
principal risk and monitor performance 
against the risk appetites. The RAF forms 
an important element of the overall Risk 
Management Framework described on 
page 105.
The RAF includes the following 
components:
• Overarching risk appetite – the primary 
statement outlining our approach to 
risk taking linked to the pursuit of our 
business objectives
• Key risk appetite statements – the 
articulation of the type and level 
of specific risks that we are willing 
to accept
• Risk capacity – the maximum level of 
risk we can assume before breaching 
constraints determined by regulatory 
capital and liquidity needs
• Risk limits – quantitative measures that 
allocate our aggregate risk appetite 
statement to individual activities
• Risk profile – the point in time 
assessment of our net risk exposure. 
Risk appetite statement
Our risk appetite statement defines 
the level and types of risk that we are 
willing to accept in order to achieve our 
business objectives and strategy, sets the 
tone for risk management to reinforce 
a strong risk management culture, and 
provides a framework to establish risk 
policies, controls and limits in a consistent 
manner. Our overarching risk appetite 
statement is:
“To run a sustainable, safe and sound 
business that conducts its activities 
in a prudent and reputable manner, 
taking into account the interests of 
our customers and also ensuring our 
obligations to key stakeholders are met.”

Risk management
The management of risk is based on an 
understanding of the risks that we face, an 
assessment of these risks and establishing 
an appropriate control environment. 
Risks are assessed at the inherent level 
(before being mitigated by controls) and 
at the residual level (once controls have 
been considered). Controls include risk 
appetite statements, defined limits to 
risk exposures, policies, procedures, 
mandates, oversight and reporting. 
The design and effectiveness of controls 
is key and an assessment of these is 
performed by all three lines of defence.
Ongoing monitoring of the performance 
of risks and the controls used to manage 
and contain risk is undertaken and the 
results are reported to the risk oversight 
committees. The risk management 
process uses a continuous feedback loop 
with six elements as shown in the risk life 
cycle diagram below.
Risk policies and procedures
Risk policies and procedures are the 
formal documentation of the methods 
used to manage, control, oversee and 
govern each principal risk. They articulate 
the limits, operating standards and 
procedures by which risks are identified, 
assessed and managed at all stages of 
the business and risk life cycle.

This overarching risk appetite is 
supported by individual risk appetite 
statements linked to the principal risks, 
which are in turn supported by individual 
detailed metrics. See pages 110 to 130 for 
further details of the risk appetites for the 
principal risks.
Risk culture
Our culture is articulated through our core 
values of being Reliable, Expert, Dynamic 
and Straightforward. These underpin 
the risk culture, drive the day-to-day 
behaviours across the Group, and form 
the DNA of the business. The Board 
sets the “tone at the top” and ensures 
that this is cascaded into day-to-day 
operations through policies, recruitment 
of competent employees, training and 
aligning remuneration to risk appetite. 
Our performance management process 
promotes sound risk management 
to ensure employees are risk-aware, 
understand their accountabilities, and the 
importance of adhering to policies and 
procedures. This is reinforced through 
mandatory interactive training and our 
compensation philosophy.
Risk life cycle Risk governance and oversight
108 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Risk management
Risk governance and oversight
The Board, often via its Committees, 
has overall responsibility for approving 
and reviewing the business strategies 
and significant policies of the Group; 
understanding the principal risks taken by 
the Group, and setting acceptable limits 
for these risks. The Board is ultimately 
responsible for ensuring that an adequate 
and effective system of internal controls is 
established and maintained. 
The Board Risk Committee and Audit 
Committee are the main oversight 
committees in the above respects.
Three lines of defence
Our governance framework adheres 
to a “three lines of defence” model 
to ensure a clear delineation of 
responsibilities between control over 
day-to-day operations, risk oversight and 
independent assurance of our activities. 
All three lines of defence are responsible 
for supporting and developing a culture 
of risk awareness and to support each 
other in creating the best outcome for 
the business and its customers. In this 
way, risk management responsibilities 
are understood at all levels, ownership 
and accountability is clear and control 
and oversight is established throughout 
the Group. 
Business lines and centralised 
functions – First line
The business lines take calculated risks 
with the aim of delivering value for 
the business. The first line of defence 
encompasses the controls that we have 
in place to deal with day-to-day business 
and manages risks in the business, to pre-
agreed tolerances or limits. It identifies, 
manages and monitors risks within 
each area of the business, reporting 
and escalating issues as necessary and 
evidences control. 
Risk oversight – Second line 
of defence 
The second line of defence encompasses 
the risk oversight functions (as shown 
below), which are independent of 
the business and central functions. 
The second line supports a structured 
approach to risk management by 
maintaining and implementing the Risk 
Management Framework and Group-
wide risk policies and monitoring their 
proper execution by the first line of 
defence. It also provides independent 
oversight and guidance on risks relevant 
to our strategy and activities, maintains 
an aggregate view of risk and monitoring 
performance in relation to our risk 
appetite, monitors changes in and 
compliance with external regulation and 
promotes best practice.
Independent assurance –  
Third line of defence 
Internal Audit provides independent 
assurance to the Board via the 
Audit Committee that the first 
and second lines of defence are 
both effective in discharging their 
respective responsibilities.

Stress testing
Stress testing
Stress testing is an important risk 
management tool, with specific 
approaches documented for the major 
regulatory exercises of the Internal 
Capital Adequacy Assessment Process 
(“ICAAP”), Individual Liquidity Adequacy 
Assessment (“ILAA”) and Recovery and 
Resolution Plan (“RRP”). 
We have in place a Stress Testing 
Framework (“STF”) to assist the Board’s 
understanding of the key risks, scenarios 
and sensitivities that may adversely 
impact our financial or operational 
position and support the development 
of risk appetite, business and capital 
plans by:
• Testing our ability to withstand the 
materialisation of risks in both “normal” 
and “stressed” conditions
• Assessing the adequacy of our financial 
resources (both capital and liquidity) 
and the potential management actions 
available to mitigate the effect of any 
adverse events 
• Identifying potential gaps in our Risk 
Management Framework such as a 
potential weaknesses in the controls 
operated by the Group 
• Provides a cohesive approach to 
common rules and principles regarding 
stress testing and scenario analysis
The STF relies upon and supports 
the Capital Stress Testing policy, the 
Funding and Liquidity policy and the 
Operational Risk Framework. All of which 
provide detail of how the STF has been 
implemented within their specific areas 
of focus. The STF assesses the adequacy 
of our financial resources and provides 
inputs for our ICAAP , ILAA and RRP .
The ICAAP is an assessment of our 
total capital requirements based on our 
risk profile under normal and stressed 
operating conditions. The preparation 
of the ICAAP incorporates all material 
risks and is based on active cooperation 
between Finance, (including Treasury), 
business areas and risk functions. 
The ILAA is an assessment of our 
liquidity position under normal and 
stressed conditions and is used to inform 
the Board of the ongoing assessment 
and quantification of liquidity risk and 
the manner in which it is managed, 
monitored, controlled and mitigated. 
The CFO is responsible for the 
Group’s ILAA.
The RRP provides an assessment of 
our ability to recover financial strength 
following or during a period of severe 
stress through a formal assessment of 
recovery options and enabling recovery 
options to be activated and mobilised 
quickly and effectively. The RRP also 
provides regulatory authorities with 
information and analysis to enable 
them to carry out an orderly resolution 
if required. 
We perform Reverse Stress Testing 
(“RST”) to identify and assess events 
that could cause our business model 
to become unviable. The outcome of 
failure is assumed as a starting point 
and we work backwards to determine 
the type and sequence of events and 
vulnerabilities that could lead to the 
hypothetical failure of the business. 
The key objective of RST is to enable the 
early identification of events that could 
cause our business plan to become 
unviable and, to assess the likelihood that 
such events could crystallise. Where those 
tests reveal a risk of business failure that 
is unacceptably high when considered 
against our risk appetite, there will be 
measures to prevent or mitigate that 
risk, including contingency plans in place 
to restore the business to a stable and 
sustainable condition. 
Stress testing governance
The Board is responsible for reviewing 
and approving the STF , scenarios for 
each type of stress testing and results of 
the stress test analysis. The Board Risk 
Committee (“BRC”) is responsible for 
reviewing the STF annually. The scenarios 
for each type of stress testing and results 
of the stress testing analysis are reviewed 
and recommended at the ALCO and 
Executive Risk Committee (“ERC”). 
The BRC makes recommendations to 
the Board for approval of the scenarios 
to support the ICAAP , ILAA and RRP . 
As the senior risk committee, BRC 
provides independent review and 
challenge to stress scenarios, underlying 
assumptions and adequacy of proposed 
management actions.
The primary executive responsible for 
the STF is the Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”), 
who is responsible for ensuring the 
development and implementation 
of a robust STF and overseeing its 
implementation. The CRO is also 
responsible for ensuring that the STF is fit 
for purpose and adheres to all regulatory 
requirements and industry good 
practices. Participants from all business 
and control functions are responsible for 
providing inputs for the development 
of scenarios, underlying assumptions 
and relevant management actions. 
Business and control functions coordinate 
with the CRO and CFO to provide 
relevant data for stress testing. 
Internal Audit provides periodic 
independent assurance regarding 
ongoing adherence to internal controls 
and compliance standards. Internal Audit 
also verifies the extent of compliance 
of stress testing policies with regulatory 
requirements and reports its findings 
and recommendations to the Board 
Risk Committee, Audit Committee and 
the Board.  Risk management

Exposure
The above table presents our maximum 
exposure to credit risk of financial 
instruments on the balance sheet and 
commitments to lend before taking into 
account any collateral held or other credit 
enhancements. The maximum exposure 
to credit risk for loans, debt securities, 
derivatives and other on balance sheet 
financial instruments is the carrying 
amount and for loan commitments the 
full amount of any commitment to lend 
that is irrevocable or is revocable only in 
response to material adverse change.
Mitigation
We target Small and Medium-sized 
Enterprises (“SMEs”) and mortgage 
customers. Credit risk is managed in 
accordance with lending policies, the 
risk appetite and the Risk Management 
Framework. Lending policies and 
performance against risk appetites are 
reviewed regularly. We seek to mitigate 
credit risk by focusing on business sectors 
where we have specific expertise and 
through limiting concentrated exposures 
on larger loans, certain sectors and other 
factors which can represent higher risk. 
We also seek to obtain security cover, and 
where appropriate, personal guarantees 
from borrowers. Affordability checks 
on income versus outgoings are also 
made in relation to mortgages to 
assess a borrower’s capacity to meet 
interest payments.
Credit risks associated with lending are 
managed through the use of detailed 
lending policies which outline the 
approach to lending, underwriting 
criteria, credit mandates, concentration 
limits and product terms. We maintain a 
dynamic approach to credit management 
and aim to take necessary steps if 
individual issues are identified or if credit 
performance deteriorates, or is expected 
to deteriorate, due to borrower, economic 
or sector-specific weaknesses.
Due to the retail and SME markets we 
operate in, external rating agency ratings 
for borrowers are not typically available. 
However, credit risk is assessed through 
applying a combination of due diligence, 
reviewing credit reference agency 
reports, reviewing financial information, 
credit scores and the use of underwriters.
This section provides further detail on the 
specific areas where we are exposed to 
credit risk.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss 
arising from a borrower or counterparty 
failing to meet their financial obligations 
to the Group in accordance with 
agreed terms. 
This risk arises from our lending activities 
as a result of defaulting mortgage, lease 
and loan contracts and is the most 
significant risk we face. Although credit 
risk arises from our loan book it can also 
arise from off balance sheet activities. 
Risk appetite
We operate a business line level credit 
risk appetite, as well as an overall credit 
risk appetite for our lending activities. 
Expected losses are factored into the 
budgeting and forecast process and 
reflect our expected view of lending 
performance, taking into account recent 
performance data and the prevailing 
economic environment.
We recognise that actual losses may differ 
from forecasted or budgeted values. 
The credit risk appetites are set based 
on expected levels of loss, credit risk 
concentration, and portfolio composition 
and performance characteristics. 
All areas of the following report are 
covered by the external auditor’s opinion 
on page 133, except for the shaded 
sections on pages 129 to 130.

Credit risk portfolio
The following section provides analysis of 
our credit risk portfolio as at 31 December 
2015. The analysis is segmented between 
credit risk on loans and advances to 
customers and credit risk on treasury 
assets. Details of the methodologies 
and estimates used to determine the 
allowances for loan impairments are 
provided in Note 3.
As described in Note 4 to the financial 
statements, we have split out Buy-to-Let 
as a separate operating segment during 
2015. The analysis within this section has 
been aligned to the new segments and 
the prior year comparatives have been 
re-presented on the new basis.
Furthermore, the analysis has been 
enhanced to exclude the Property 
Development (“PD”) portfolio from 
a number of tables where it is not 
relevant (marked with a footnote). 
Details of the quality of collateral held for 
the PD portfolio is provided on page 116. 
Prior year comparatives have been 
re-presented accordingly.
Credit risk on loans and advances  
to customers
Key terms: 
Neither past due nor individually 
impaired – Loans that are not in arrears 
and where there is no objective 
evidence of impairment.
Past due but not individually impaired 
– Loans that are in arrears but have not 
been individually assessed as impaired.
Individually impaired – Loans which 
have been individually assessed for 
impairment as there is objective 
evidence of impairment, including 
changes in customer circumstances.
Forborne – Any concessionary 
arrangement that is made for a period 
of three months or more where financial 
difficulty is present or imminent.

Forbearance
Forbearance is defined as any 
concessionary arrangement that is made 
for a period of three months or more 
where financial difficulty is present or 
imminent. Occasionally, some borrowers 
experience financial difficulties which 
impact their ability to meet mortgage 
or SME finance obligations. We seek to 
identify borrowers who are experiencing 
financial difficulties as well as contacting 
borrowers whose loans have gone into 
arrears, consulting with them in order to 
ascertain the reason for the difficulties, 
and to establish the best course of action 
that can be taken to bring the account up 
to date. In certain circumstances, where 
the borrower is experiencing significant 
financial distress, we may use forbearance 
measures to assist the borrower. 
These are considered on a case-by-case 
basis and must be in the best interests of 
the customer. The forbearance measures 
are undertaken in order to achieve the 
best outcome for both the customer 
and the Group by dealing with financial 
difficulties and arrears at any early stage. 
The most widely used methods of 
forbearance are temporarily reduced 
monthly payments, loan-term extension, 
deferral of payment and a temporary 
or permanent transfer to interest only 
payments to reduce the borrower’s 
financial pressures. Where the 
arrangement is temporary, borrowers are 
expected to resume normal payments 
within six months. Both temporary and 
permanent concessions are counted 
as forborne for 24 months following 
the end of the concession. In all cases, 
the above definitions are subject to no 
further concessions being made and the 
customers’ compliance with new terms. 
See page 119 for an analysis of 
forbearance measures in place at 
31 December 2015.

Credit risk continued 
a) Risk grading methodology
The categorisation of high, medium, low 
risk is based on internal grading models. 
The grading models are used to generate 
a consistent Group-wide approach for the 
grading of customer credit risk exposures 
for all lending businesses, and provide a 
relative internal ranking of risk. Drivers for 
the grade mapping include external 
credit reference agency risk scores, 
property valuations and qualitative 
factors. The relative measure of risk 
reflects a combined assessment of the 
probability of default by the customer and 
an assessment of the expected loss in the 
event of default. 
The resulting classification of balances 
between low, medium and high is 
consequently driven by a combination of 
the probability of default (“PD”) and loss 
given default (“LGD”) grades. A matrix 
of 15 PD and 10 LGD grades determine 
the category within which each loan is 
categorised i.e. those accounts that have 
a low PD and/or LGD are graded as “low” . 
Those graded “high” will be accounts 
that have either a high PD and/or LGD.
• Probability of default refers to 
the probability of a customer or 
counterparty defaulting, which is 
typically taken as three payments 
past due, within the next 12 months. 
A default probability model predicts 
this probability by using credit scores 
along with financial, behavioural and 
qualitative inputs
• Key components of the Loss Given 
Default are the propensity to “cure” , 
that is for an account to be restored 
to a performing status, and the level 
of security held in relation to the 
credit exposure. The level of security 
varies, ranging from a small number 
of very short-term unsecured loans in 
the Asset Finance business, to highly 
secured loans on residential property 
within the Residential Mortgage 
business. The valuation method for 
assets is specific to the nature of the 
collateral and includes indexation for 
property valuations
b) Fair value of collateral methodology
For SME Commercial Mortgage, 
Buy-to-Let and Residential Mortgage 
agreements, the fair value of underlying 
collateral is calculated based on the 
indexed valuation of the property 
on which the mortgage is secured. 
Where the indexed valuation is greater 
than the balance outstanding, the fair 
value of the collateral is capped to the 
value of the outstanding balance. 
For Asset Finance agreements, the 
estimated fair value of the collateral is 
calculated by applying LGDs on a case by 
case basis. The LGD against each loan is 
deducted from the balance outstanding 
to derive a proxy for fair value. As the 
fair value is derived using LGDs, the fair 
value calculated includes an element of 
prudence as the LGD is based on non-
performing loan data. 115 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015

Property Development 
We use “loan to gross development 
value” as an indicator of the quality of 
credit security of performing loans for 
the Property Development portfolio. 
Loan to gross development value is a 
measure used to monitor the loan balance 
outstanding compared against the 
expected gross development value once 
the development is complete.
At 31 December 2015, 98.9 per cent 
(31 December 2014: 99.1 per cent) 
of the portfolio had a loan to gross 
development value of 65 per cent or less. 
The gross development value is based 
on valuations by qualified valuers with 
reference to recent market transactions 
for similar developments in the local area.  117 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015

Higher LTV bandings have increased as 
a result of the Group’s participation in 
the Help to Buy Scheme, which has an 
associated Government guarantee which 
reduces the Group’s exposure.
Invoice Finance 
In respect of Invoice Finance, collateral is 
provided by the underlying receivables 
(e.g. trade invoices). As at 31 December 
2015, the average advance rate against 
the fair value of sales ledger balances 
which have been assigned to the 
Group, net of amounts considered 
to be irrecoverable, is 64.99 per cent 
(31 December 2014: 68.04 per cent).
In addition to the value of the underlying 
sales ledger balances, we will, wherever 
possible, obtain additional security before 
offering invoice finance facilities to a 
client. These include limited personal 
guarantees from major shareholders, 
charges over personal and other 
business property, cross guarantees 
from associated companies and 
unlimited warranties in the case of frauds. 
These additional forms of security are 
impracticable to value given their nature.
Asset Finance
In respect of Asset Finance, collateral 
is provided by our rights and/or title to 
the underlying leased assets, which we 
are able to repossess in the event of 
default. Where appropriate, we will also 
obtain additional security, such as parent 
company or personal guarantees. 
Asset Finance also undertakes a small 
volume of unsecured lending where it 
has obtained an understanding of the 
ability of the borrower’s business to 
generate cash flows to service and repay 
the facilities provided. As at 31 December 
2015 the total amount of such unsecured 
lending was £15.9 million (31 December 
2014: £17 .4 million).

Credit risk – treasury assets
Credit risk exists with treasury assets 
where we have acquired securities 
or placed cash deposits with other 
financial institutions. The credit risk 
of treasury assets is considered to be 
relatively low. No assets are held for 
speculative purposes or actively traded. 
Certain liquid assets are held as part of 
our liquidity buffer.
Credit quality of treasury assets
The table sets out information about the 
credit quality of treasury financial assets.
As at 31 December 2015 and at 
31 December 2014 none of the treasury 
assets were past due or impaired.
Management
Cash placements
Credit risk of Group and treasury 
counterparties is controlled through the 
treasury credit risk policy which limits 
the maximum exposure by entity where 
the Group can place cash deposits. 
All institutions need a sufficiently 
high long-term and short-term rating 
at inception.
Gilts and supranational bonds
As part of the liquidity buffer, we hold 
a portfolio of gilts and Supranational 
bonds. These instruments are AAA or 
AA+ to AA- rated, and typically represent 
sovereign risk.
Asset-backed securities (“ABS”)
We have a portfolio of ABS. The majority 
of these investments are in AAA or 
AA+ to AA- rated bonds secured on UK 
originated assets. All investments are 
in Sterling; no foreign currency bonds 
were bought. The portfolio has credit 
enhancement, providing principal 
protection against losses.
Derivatives
Credit risk on derivatives is controlled 
through a policy of only entering into 
contracts with a small number of UK 
credit institutions, with a credit rating of 
at least AA- at inception. Most derivative 
contracts are collateralised through the 
receipt/payment of daily cash margin calls 
to cover the mark to market asset/liability.

Offsetting financial assets 
and liabilities
It is our policy to enter into master 
netting and margining agreements with 
all derivative counterparties. In general, 
under master netting agreements the 
amounts owed by each counterparty 
that are due on a single day in respect 
of all transactions outstanding in the 
same currency under the agreement are 
aggregated into a single net amount 
being payable by one party to the other. 
In certain circumstances, for example 
when a credit event such as a default 
occurs, all outstanding transactions under 
the agreement are terminated.
Under the margining agreements where 
we have a net asset position valued at 
current market values, in respect of our 
derivatives with a counterparty, then 
that counterparty will place collateral, 
usually cash, with us in order to cover the 
position. Similarly, we will place collateral, 
usually cash, with the counterparty where 
it has a net liability position. 
As our derivatives are under master 
netting and margining agreements 
as described, they do not meet the 
criteria for offsetting in the statement of 
financial position.
The following tables detail amounts of 
financial assets and liabilities subject to 
offsetting, enforceable master netting 
agreements and similar arrangements

Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that we are not 
able to meet our financial obligations 
as they fall due, or can do so only at 
excessive cost.
Risk appetite
The Board has set a liquidity risk appetite 
which aims to ensure that a prudent level 
of liquidity is held to cover an unexpected 
liquidity outflow such that we will be 
able to meet our financial commitments 
during an extended period of stress. 
Additionally, reputational risks are kept 
managed through holding liquidity to 
meet pipeline commitments expected to 
complete during a three month period.
Based on the business model of funding 
primarily via retail and SME deposits, 
the Board has set a liquidity risk appetite 
which it considers to be appropriate 
to provide it with the assurance that 
the relevant liquidity risk drivers are 
considered and appropriately stressed 
and that we are able to meet liabilities 
beyond the targeted survival period.
Exposures
Liquidity risk exposure represents the 
amount of potential stressed outflows in 
any future period less expected inflows. 
Liquidity is considered from both an 
internal and a regulatory perspective.
Mitigation
To protect the Group and its depositors 
against liquidity risks, we maintain a 
liquidity buffer which is based on our 
liquidity needs under stressed conditions. 
The liquidity buffer is monitored on a 
daily basis to ensure there are sufficient 
liquid assets at all times to cover cash flow 
movements and fluctuations in funding 
and to enable us to meet all financial 
obligations and to support anticipated 
asset growth. 
Contingency funding plan
As a regulated firm, we are required to 
maintain a Contingency Funding Plan 
(“CFP”). The plan (which is now part of 
our Recovery and Resolution Plan (“RRP”)) 
involves a two stage process, covering 
preventative measures and corrective 
measures to be invoked when there is a 
potential risk to our liquidity or capital 
position. The CFP/RRP provides a plan for 
managing a liquidity or capital situation or 
crisis within the Group, caused by internal 
events, external events or a combination 
thereof. The plan outlines what actions 
we could take to ensure we comply with 
the liquidity adequacy rules, maintain 
sufficient capital and operate within 
our risk appetite and limits, as set and 
approved by the Board.
Analysis of liquidity risk
Through the ILAA process, we have 
assessed the level of liquidity necessary 
to prudently cover systemic and 
idiosyncratic risks and the ILAA process 
determines the appropriate liquidity 
buffer, taking into account the specific 
nature of the deposit base and other 
liquidity risk drivers. 
The ILAA requires us to consider all 
material liquidity risks in detail and the 
ILAA has documented our analysis of 
each key liquidity risk driver and set 
a liquidity risk appetite against each 
of these drivers. Liquidity risks are 
specifically considered by the ALCO 
each month.

An overview of our key liquidity risk 
drivers is provided below:
a) Deposit funding risk 
The deposit funding risk is the primary 
liquidity risk driver for the Group and 
this could occur if there was a concern 
by depositors over the current or 
future creditworthiness of the Group. 
Although we seek to operate in such 
a way as to protect depositors, an 
extremely high proportion of deposits 
are also protected by the Government’s 
Financial Services Compensation Scheme 
(“FSCS”). The FSCS provides £75,000 of 
protection to each individual depositor. 
b) Wholesale funding
We mainly finance our operations through 
retail and SME deposit taking. We also 
have long-term wholesale funding lines 
in place under the Funding for Lending 
Scheme, repo facilities to help manage 
liquid assets, and debt securities issued 
by the Group securitisation vehicle in 
April 2014. We have relationship banking 
facilities in place which are used to 
hedge against currency and interest rate 
exposures as well as repo facilities for 
short-term liquidity management. 
A summary of our wholesale funding 
sources is shown below: Risk management

Principal risk drivers 
continued
Liquidity risk continued
c) Payment systems
We do not form part of the UK payment 
system. However, in the event there 
are problems with one of the payment 
systems, we have access to other facilities 
with which to make payments if needed. 
d) Pipeline loan commitments
We need to maintain liquidity to cover 
the outstanding pipeline of loan offers. 
Although certain pipeline offers may not 
be legally binding, the failure to honour 
an expression of intent to finance a loan 
contract brings reputational risk, therefore 
liquidity is held for all such pipeline offers.
e) Cash collateral requirements
The swap Credit Support Annex (“CSA”) 
agreement requires us or a swap 
counterparty to hold cash in a deposit 
account, depending on whether the 
swap is in or out of the money. As we are 
unrated, the swap agreements are not 
credit rating sensitive in relation to the 
Group, which removes the impact from a 
downgrade risk.

Interest rate and market risk 
Overview
Interest rate risk is the risk of loss 
through mismatched asset and liability 
positions sensitive to changes in interest 
rates. Interest rate risk consists of asset-
liability gap risk and basis risk. 
Risk appetite
We aim to minimise interest rate risk and 
have a policy of matching fixed or variable 
rate assets with liabilities of a comparable 
interest rate basis, supplemented by 
derivatives such as interest rate swaps. 
Exposures
We do not seek to take or expose ourself 
to market risk, and do not carry out 
proprietary trading, although certain 
liquid asset investments which form part 
of the liquid asset buffer carry mark to 
market risk which we regularly monitor.
Mitigation
Hedge accounting
As detailed above, we only use derivative 
contracts in order to hedge existing 
exposures on loans to customers, 
customer deposits and available for 
sale securities, principally with regard to 
following our policies in respect of the 
management of asset-liability gap and 
basis rate risks. Wherever possible we 
seek to include the derivatives used within 
hedges which meet the qualification 
requirements of IAS 39 to be accounted 
for as fair value portfolio hedges (see 
accounting policy 2(j) and Note 22). 
There are, however, times where, in 
order to meet IAS 39 requirements 
for prospective testing of hedge 
effectiveness for new derivatives to be 
included in hedging portfolios, there is a 
time lag, due to operational processes, 
before IAS 39 hedge accounting 
may commence.
Similarly, there are also certain derivative 
contracts, e.g. those hedging basis risk 
exposures (see above) which do not 
meet the criteria for hedge accounting 
under IAS 39. The gains and losses 
arising on contracts which do not meet 
the IAS hedge accounting criteria are 
included within income as part of “Net 
(expense)/income from derivatives and 
other financial instruments at fair value 
through profit or loss” , but, as they are not 
matched by similar adjustments to the 
hedge assets and liabilities, they give rise 
to volatility in the income statement on a 
year to year base which will only reverse 
over the life of the hedge exposures. Risk management

continued
Interest rate and market risk 
continued
In 2014, there was also a portfolio of fixed 
rate UK gilts and Supranational bonds 
where the pre-existing hedges using 
interest rate swaps did not meet the 
requirements for hedge accounting on 
transition to IFRSs and as a consequence 
we used the option available within 
IFRS to designate the bonds at fair 
value through profit and loss in order to 
reduce the accounting mismatch with 
the derivatives used to hedge the bonds. 
Changes in the fair value of the bonds 
and the hedging derivatives, and any 
differences between them, which are 
largely attributable to changes in the fair 
value of the bonds due to changes in 
their credit risk, are both reflected within 
the income statement as part of “Net 
(expense)/income from derivatives and 
other financial instruments at fair value 
through profit or loss” . The portfolio of 
bonds designated at “fair value through 
profit or loss” and the related interest rate 
swaps were all disposed of during the 
current period.
Analysis of interest and market risk
Asset-liability gap risk
Where possible we seek to match the 
interest rate structure of assets with 
liabilities, creating a natural hedge. 
Where this is not possible we will enter 
into interest rate swap transactions to 
convert the fixed rate exposures on loans 
and advances, customer deposits and 
available for sale securities into variable 
three month LIBOR liabilities. 
Given timing differences and the price of 
hedging small gaps, it is not cost effective 
to have an absolute match of variable rate 
assets and liabilities. The risk exposure 
of the overall asset-liability interest rate 
profile is monitored against approved 
limits using changes to economic value 
of the balance sheet as a result of a 
modelled 2 per cent shift in the interest 
yield curve. 
After careful consideration of our interest 
rate risk exposures, simulated VaR is no 
longer measured for risk management 
purposes. Our activities are relatively 
straightforward processes for managing 
retail or commercial banking products; 
simulated VaR, however, is best used for 
measurement of embedded optionalities 
and more complex portfolios.
Basis risk
Basis risk is where there is a mismatch 
in the interest rate reference base for 
assets and liabilities. When we enter into 
derivative contracts to swap fixed rate 
assets and liabilities into variable rate 
liabilities, the reference base is usually 
three month LIBOR. Certain lending 
products have interest rates which are 
based on the prevailing Bank of England 
Base Rate (BBR) and this different basis 
reference leads to basis risk. 
We have a market risk policy in place 
which places limits on the net mismatch 
between base rate linked assets and 
liabilities; and seeks to manage the overall 
level of basis risk exposure by entering 
into basis swap agreements. As at 
31 December 2015, the amount of the 
basis risk sensitivity measure, as described 
above, was £0.5 million (31 December 
2014: £0.4 million).
Other market risks
We do not carry out proprietary trading 
or hold any positions in assets or equities 
which are actively traded.
We do, however, hold a portfolio of 
highly rated asset backed securities 
and a portfolio of liquid assets (primary 
gilts, Treasury bills and Supranational 
bonds) which are used for liquidity 
buffer purposes. 
The interest rate risk on these liquid assets 
is considered as part of the asset-liability 
gap risk described. The instruments are 
also exposed to other forms of market 
risk e.g. credit spread risk. Prices are 
monitored on a day-to-day basis to 
ensure that we are aware of any material 
diminution in value. Formal monthly 
prices are subject to independent review 
and are reported to ALCO. We have repo 
facilities in place which can be used in 
the first instance to obtain liquidity when 
necessary, which will avoid the need to 
sell the liquidity buffer assets and so 
crystallise any price gain or loss due to 
market price movements.
Capital risk
Capital risk is the risk that we have 
insufficient capital to cover regulatory 
requirements and/or growth plans.
Risk appetite
We aim to maintain a strong capital 
position in line with the capital risk 
appetite established by the Board. 
Our capital risk appetite reflects the 
desire to optimise the capital structure 
of the Group and efficiently utilise its 
capital resources in order to generate 
appropriate returns for shareholders. 
We maintain capital levels consistent with 
our capital risk appetite, which is set to 
ensure that we:
• meet minimum regulatory capital 
requirements at all times;
• are able to achieve our strategic 
objectives including business 
growth plans;
• are able to withstand an adverse stress 
scenario and continue to meet our 
individual capital guidance (“ICG”); and
• provide assurance of our resilience to 
depositors, customers, shareholders 
and other key stakeholders.

Requirements 
We operate under the CRD IV CRR 
regulatory framework as required by the 
Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”).
Pillar 1 requirements
Pillar 1 capital requirements are based 
on prescribed risk calculations in line 
with Capital Requirements Regulation 
(“CRR”), EBA Single Rulebook and 
relevant PRA regulations. Under this 
framework, we hold Pillar 1 capital for 
credit risk, operational risk, market 
risk and Credit Valuation Adjustments 
(“CVA”). We calculate our credit and 
market risk Pillar 1 requirements 
using the standardised approaches. 
The operational risk Pillar 1 requirement 
is calculated under the Basic Indicator 
Approach (“BIA”).
Under CRD IV, we must hold total 
capital equal to 8 per cent of our total 
risk weighted assets to cover our Pillar 1 
capital requirements. 
We are also subject to a number of 
common equity tier 1 (“CET1”) capital 
buffers over and above the required 
minimum CET1, Tier 1 and Total 
Capital ratios. These capital buffers 
were implemented under CRD IV. 
The buffers applicable to us include 
the capital conservation buffer and 
the countercyclical buffer. The capital 
conservation buffer phase-in commences 
on 1 January 2016 when it is set at 
0.625 per cent, such that a requirement 
of 2.5 per cent will be fully phased-in by 
January 2019. 
Application of the Pillar 2 
Framework 
We have an established Internal Capital 
Adequacy Assessment Process (“ICAAP”) 
which is conducted in accordance 
with CRD IV and PRA requirements. 
The ICAAP represents the aggregated 
view of the risks faced by the Group and 
is used by the Board and management to 
understand the level of capital required 
over the planning horizon to cover these 
risks and to withstand a range of adverse 
stress scenarios. 
Key risks assessed under Pillar 2 include 
credit concentration risk, operational risk 
and interest rate risk in the banking book.
Following a review of our ICAAP 
assessment through its Supervisory 
Review and Evaluation Process (“SREP”), 
the PRA sets an Individual Capital 
Guidance (“ICG”), which supersedes 
Pillar 1 requirements and establishes the 
minimum level of regulatory capital we 
must maintain. 
We also conduct capital stress testing 
and scenario analysis as part of our ICAAP 
assessment. We use the stress scenarios 
to size and carry a stress loss buffer 
which ensures we are able to withstand 
an adverse economic downturn over a 
five-year planning horizon. In addition, we 
identify management actions that could 
be taken to mitigate the impact of the 
stress on the capital position. These are 
aligned with our Recovery and Resolution 
Plan, which describes actions that can 
be taken to preserve capital if the stress 
scenario is more extreme than expected.
The stress testing conducted in our 
ICAAP forms the basis for the PRA 
buffer assessment. Following their 
review, the PRA sets a PRA buffer, 
which in combination with the CRD IV 
combined buffer is held to ensure we 
can withstand an adverse market stress. 
The combination of the PRA buffer and 
the CRD IV combined buffer replaced 
the Capital Planning Buffer (“CPB”) with 
effect from 1 January 2016. The PRA has 
extended the CRD IV quality of capital 
requirements to the ICG. The PRA buffer 
has to be met fully with CET1 capital by 
1 January 2019, subject to a phase-in from 
1 January 2016, which is aligned with the 
phase-in of the conservation buffer.
Our capital base was in excess of the 
minimum required under the ICG at all 
points during the year.
Further details of our capital requirements 
and resources are provided in the annual 
Pillar III disclosures which are available 
on our investor relations website: 
www.investors.aldermore.co.uk
Mitigation and monitoring
We are governed by our Capital 
Planning and Management policy which 
establishes a framework for maintaining 
our current and prospective capital at an 
appropriate level under various scenarios. 
The policy describes the process for 
establishing the Group’s capital risk 
appetite, which is approved by the Board 
and reviewed on an annual basis or more 
frequently if required.
We monitor current and forecast 
levels of capital against the capital 
risk appetite approved by the Board, 
and report the capital position to 
ALCO, the Risk Committee and the 
Board on a regular basis. The capital 
forecast forms an integral component 
of the annual budgeting process and 
is updated in line with changes to our 
business plan. The capital forecast 
incorporates the impact of forthcoming 
regulatory changes to help ensure 
we are well positioned to meet them 
when implemented.  Risk management

Analysis of capital risk
We operated in line with our capital 
risk appetite as set by the Board 
and above its regulatory capital 
requirements throughout the year ended 
31 December 2015. 
As at 31 December 2015, our capital 
base was made up of £509.6 million of 
Tier 1 capital and £48.6 million of Tier 2 
capital. Tier 1 capital consisted of fully 
issued ordinary shares, satisfying all the 
criteria for a Tier 1 instrument as outlined 
in the CRR, audited/verified reserves, and 
qualifying Additional Tier 1 capital issued 
in December 2014. Tier 2 capital relates 
to issued subordinated loan notes and 
collective impairment allowances.

 With effect from 1 January 2015, the available for sale reserve is included in the Group’s Common Equity Tier 1 capital.
Our capital resources as at the year end were as follows:
Regulatory capital has increased during 
2015 due to the £75 million gross capital 
raised at IPO in March 2015, the exercise 
of the share warrants in September 2015 
and the inclusion of the profit after tax 
for the year in retained earnings. This has 
been partially offset by the coupon paid 
on the Additional Tier 1 instrument in 
April 2015. Further details regarding the 
capital raised at IPO and as a result of 
the exercise of the share warrants are 
provided in Note 35.

The following shaded sections describe 
the operational and conduct risks to 
which we are exposed. The sections are 
shaded as both areas are unaudited. 
All other areas of the Risk report are 
covered by the external auditor’s 
opinion on page 133.
Operational risk 
Operational risk is the risk of loss 
resulting from inadequate or failed 
internal processes, people and 
systems or from external events. 
This risk includes IT, information 
security, project, outsourcing, tax, 
legal, and fraud and compliance risks.
Risk appetite
We aim to maintain robust operational 
systems and controls and seek to 
operate within an acceptable level of 
operational risk that enables execution 
of our business strategy and for risks to 
be taken without unacceptable losses 
or reputational impacts.
The operational risk appetite considers 
risk events, the assessment of internal 
controls as well as holding additional 
capital for certain operational risks. 
Exposures
The key operational risks to the 
Group are:
•  Business continuity – risk of 
inadequate business recovery and 
disaster recovery capability to recover 
from any operational disruption 
and continue to provide product or 
service delivery to customers 
•  Change management – inability 
to execute business process 
changes effectively
•  Financial crime – third-party fraud 
against the Group including provision 
of false information 
•  Information security – inappropriate 
disclosure of personal or sensitive 
information, inappropriate access 
to internal data sources, and in 
particular cyber security threats to 
the Group and its customers as a 
result of attacks through the use of 
computer systems
• Information technology – risks to the 
availability, performance and capacity 
of IT systems/telephony/internet/ 
networks
• Legal & regulatory - failure to identify, 
interpret or respond to legal or 
regulatory change, lack of contractual 
arrangements in place to protect 
the Group
• People – inability to attract, manage 
and retain competent employees to 
fulfil role requirements
• Process – ineffective design 
or execution of operational 
processes, payment or transaction 
processing failure
• Property – risks relating to provision of 
safe and secure working environments, 
and inadequate protection of physical 
assets, employees and customers 
against external threats
• Third-party suppliers – inappropriate 
supplier selection and contractual 
arrangements, or inadequate ongoing 
management of critical suppliers or 
material outsource partners
Mitigation
The management of operational risk is 
a key area of management focus and 
we currently adopt the Basic Indicator 
Approach (“BIA”) to operational 
risk. In 2015, substantial focus was 
placed on reviewing and enhancing 
operational risk controls, as articulated 
in the Basel Committee on Banking 
Supervision criteria for the sound 
management of operational risk, which 
continues into 2016.
The Operational Risk Management 
Framework has two key objectives:
• Minimise the impact of losses suffered, 
from day-to-day operations (expected 
losses) and from extreme events 
(unexpected losses) 
• Improve the effective management of 
the Group and protect its reputation 
and brand value
The prime responsibility for the 
management of operational risk and 
compliance with the Operational Risk 
Management Framework lies with 
business units and central functions. 
The Operational Risk function within 
Group Risk acts in a second line 
of defence capacity and provides 
oversight of and challenge to the 
operational risk profile, escalating 
issues as appropriate.
The Operational Risk oversight function 
is responsible for establishing and 
maintaining an appropriate Group-
wide Operational Risk Management 
Framework and for overseeing the 
operational risk profile across the Group. 
Senior management across the Group 
identify and assess operational risks 
within their respective areas and assess 
the effectiveness of key controls that 
mitigate those risks following the Risk 
& Control Self-Assessment process. 
This includes an assessment as to 
whether management actions are 
required to bring the risk within risk 
appetite, whether the level of risk is 
accepted, or whether escalation of the 
risk is required.
Operational risk event reporting 
is in place across the Group and 
corrective actions, and recoveries are 
tracked accordingly.
We have placed emphasis on ensuring 
that the IT infrastructure, performance, 
resilience, and security meet the 
ongoing needs of the business. 
In particular, significant investment in 
cyber risk controls to ensure that we 
maintain appropriate levels of controls 
to counter the increasing threat of 
cyber-crime across the banking and 
financial services industries. Risk management
130 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Operational risk continued
We currently have a significant change 
agenda which includes the concurrent 
running of numerous projects. 
These projects include IT-based 
projects designed to ensure that our 
infrastructure remains modern and 
scaleable, to support our growth 
strategy. Therefore we are exposed to 
execution risk on these projects.
Mitigation to the risks arising from 
ongoing changes and project activity 
is through a robust project governance 
structure and delivery framework. 
This approach was used to manage a 
series of projects during the year and 
ensures there are appropriate controls 
in place covering scoping and planning, 
design, initiation, monitoring and risk 
assessment. Following completion, 
post-implementation reviews are 
held to ensure any process or project 
improvements which are identified are 
implemented for future projects.
Conduct risk 
Conduct risk is the risk of causing 
unfair outcomes or detriment to our 
customers, regulatory censure and/
or undermining market integrity as 
a result of our behaviour, decision-
making, activities or processes. 
We extend the definition of 
“customer” to include both Retail 
and SME commercial customers (but 
exclude intermediaries and/other 
third parties) across all business 
segments, including both regulated 
and non-regulated activities, 
thereby applying our conduct risk 
policies to all lending and deposit-
taking activities.
Risk appetite
We have a zero appetite for systemic 
unfair outcomes, which may result in 
significant detriment to our customers. 
Systemic unfair outcomes may arise 
from poor product design, poor sale 
processes or unacceptable operational 
practices which risk repeated or continual 
outcomes which are detrimental 
to customers.
Exposures
Whilst we have a zero appetite, we 
recognise that occasional failures in 
operational processes may occur, for 
example administration and processing 
errors or interruptions to IT systems. 
These occasional events may have 
an impact on customers, leading to 
customer detriment. 
There is a risk that customers can suffer 
detriment due to actions, processes or 
products which originate from within the 
Group. Conduct risk can arise through 
the design of products that do not 
meet customers’ needs, mishandling 
complaints where we have behaved 
inappropriately towards our customers, 
inappropriate sale processes and 
exhibiting behaviour that does not meet 
market or regulatory standards.
Customer detriment could affect our 
reputation, lead to loss of market share 
due to damage to our brand, may lead 
to customer redress payments and could 
lead to regulatory action and censure.
Monitoring and mitigation
In acknowledgement of the occasional 
events which may have an impact 
on customers, we have set a trigger 
and escalation framework around 
the detriment caused through 
such non-systemic process failings. 
We monitor and mitigate conduct risk 
by ensuring our products, services, 
business processes and procedures 
are designed to consistently deliver fair 
customer outcomes which are subject 
to ongoing assurance, monitoring, 
testing and reporting where we may be 
operating outside of risk appetite.
Conduct risk metrics and KPIs 
(which include among others, staff 
performance levels, training, customer 
feedback, complaints, product 
retention rates, cancellations, arrears 
levels and customer service standards) 
are in place to evidence fair outcomes, 
identify any emerging issues and 
document remedial actions.
Our recruitment, training and 
development programmes 
have a clear customer focus and 
reward mechanisms are aligned 
with fair customer outcomes. 
Escalation processes are in place 
to ensure any issues are addressed 
and key lessons understood and 
acted upon.
Monitoring and testing of customer 
processes and outcomes is undertaken 
within each business area and is 
supported by independent review 
and oversight through the Group 
Risk function.

Financial statements
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the 
Annual Report and Accounts and the financial statements 
The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report and 
Accounts and the Group and parent 
company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law 
and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare Group and parent company 
financial statements for each financial 
year. Under that law they are required to 
prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
EU and applicable law and have elected 
to prepare the parent company financial 
statements on the same basis. 
Under company law the Directors must 
not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Group and parent company and 
of their profit or loss for that period. 
In preparing each of the Group and 
parent company financial statements, 
the Directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently; 
• make judgements and estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent; 
• state whether they have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU; and 
• prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Group and the parent company will 
continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for 
keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain 
the parent company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the parent 
company and enable them to ensure that 
its financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They have general 
responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the 
assets of the Group and to prevent and 
detect fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, 
the Directors are also responsible for 
preparing a Strategic report, Directors’ 
Report, Remuneration Report and 
Corporate governance statement 
that complies with that law and 
those regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for 
the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information 
included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the 
Directors in respect of the annual 
financial report
We confirm that to the best of 
our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with the applicable set 
of accounting standards, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of 
the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole; and
• the Strategic report includes a 
fair review of the development 
and performance of the business 
and the position of the issuer and 
the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face.
We consider the Annual Report and 
Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the group’s 
position and performance, business 
model and strategy.

Opinions and conclusions 
arising from our audit
1  Our opinion on the financial 
statements is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements 
of Aldermore Group PLC for the year 
ended 31 December 2015 set out on 
pages 137 to 186. In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and 
fair view of the state of the Group’s and 
of the parent company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2015 and of the Group’s 
profit for the year then ended; 
• the Group financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European 
Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU);
• the parent company financial 
statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU and as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006; and 
• the financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation. 
2  Our assessment of risks of 
material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above 
on the financial statements the risks 
of material misstatement that had 
the greatest effect on our audit were 
as follows:
Impairment of loans and advances to 
customers
Refer to page 65 (Audit Committee 
Report), page 146 (accounting 
policy), page 151 (Use of estimates 
and judgements) and note 20 
(financial disclosures)
The Risk – The impairment provision 
relating to the Group’s loan portfolios 
requires the Directors to make significant 
judgements and assumptions over the 
recoverability of loan balances. 
The Group performs an assessment of 
its loans for impairment as described 
in note 3(a). The loan provision is most 
sensitive to assumptions made when 
assessing the collective provision, in 
particular in respect of the probability 
of default and the emergence period. 
This is because the Group has limited 
historical experience to support the 
assumptions made due to the relatively 
unseasoned nature of its loan portfolios 
underwritten during a relatively benign 
economic period. 
To assess the probability of default, the 
Group uses a credit bureau to provide 
it with probabilities of default based on 
all available credit data for comparable 
borrowers. As a result, these probabilities 
are then adjusted (in almost all cases 
downwards) to reflect the Group’s actual 
borrowers and the nature of its lending. 
The adjustments (“scalars”) are based 
on Group’s internal data, with the scalars 
incorporating a buffer to reflect the fact 
the Group’s own historic data is limited. 
The emergence period is assessed 
based on loans for which the Group 
is able to reliably measure the time 
between the trigger event occurring and 
the loans being identified as impaired. 
As the Group has limited historical data 
available, particularly in Asset Finance, the 
estimated emergence period is adjusted 
upwards (in the form of an overlay) and is 
based on market insight.
The Group’s individual provisions can 
also require judgement, particularly in 
SME Commercial Mortgages and Asset 
Finance, where the valuation of collateral 
can be difficult to establish due to its 
specialised nature; as well as the exit 
strategy adopted, which can significantly 
impact the timing and value of the 
cash flows. 
Our response – our audit 
procedures included:
• We tested the design, implementation 
and operating effectiveness of key 
controls over the capture, monitoring 
and reporting of loans and advances 
to customers.
• We assessed the accuracy of the 
impairment model for collectively 
assessed loans, with assistance from 
our IT specialists, by re-performing a 
sample of calculations produced by the 
impairment model and compared the 
methodology used to our interpretation 
of the requirements of the relevant 
accounting standards. 
• For loans assessed collectively for 
impairment we: 
 – considered the competency, 
reputation and objectivity of the 
credit bureau that provides the 
probabilities of default;
 – critically considered the assumptions 
made in respect of the probabilities 
of default (inclusive of the scalars) 
and the emergence periods against 
our understanding of the Group 
as well as our knowledge of the 
wider market;
 – considered the consistency of the 
probabilities of default (inclusive 
of the scalars) and the emergence 
periods with the limited historic 
internal data available; and
 – considered the accuracy of previous 
estimates of the collective provision.
• For a sample of exposures that were 
subject to an individual impairment 
assessment, and focusing on those 
with the most significant potential 
impact on the financial statements, 
we specifically challenged the Group’s 
assumptions on the expected future 
cash flows, including the value of 
realisable collateral based on our own 
understanding and reviewing latest 
correspondence and valuations.
• We benchmarked the Group’s key 
metrics, such as arrears trends and 
provision coverage, to externally 
available data, with particular focus on 
similar lending. 
• We also considered compliance with 
the relevant accounting standards 
including the adequacy of the Group 
disclosures in relation to impairment.  Financial statements

Income Recognition
Refer to page 65 (Audit Committee 
Report), page 144 (accounting 
policy), page 153 (Use of estimates 
and judgements) and note 5 
(financial disclosures)
The Risk – Measuring interest income 
on loans and advances to customers 
under the effective interest rate method 
(Note 2(a)) requires the Directors to apply 
judgements, with the most critical being 
the expected life assumption. A net 
credit of £0.4 million was recognised in 
the income statement during the year 
as a result of a change in the expected 
life assumptions.
The Group has a number of portfolios 
(including organic and acquired loans) 
across a variety of sectors and products 
which results in a large number of 
expected life assumptions. The sensitivity 
to a change in expected life can vary 
greatly over the portfolios depending 
on the underlying borrower and the 
other parameters also included in the 
effective interest rate calculation such 
as reversionary interest rates at the end 
of the fixed term, transaction costs and 
discounts or premia in place at inception. 
The expected life assumptions utilise 
repayment profiles which represent 
how customers are expected to repay. 
The Group has limited historical 
experience to support these profiles due 
to the relatively unseasoned nature of its 
lending. Consequently, the Group makes 
its expected life assumptions based on 
its forecasting process which takes into 
account historical data but also, for the 
forecast period, the Group’s expertise 
and experience in the sector. As such, any 
change in the expected life assumptions 
depend on the Directors’ assessment of 
whether there is any emerging experience 
or market information that indicates a 
different repayment profile and by how 
much. As the forecast profiles extend 
significantly into the future this creates a 
high level of estimation uncertainty. As a 
result, the later years of the repayment 
profiles are removed when calculating any 
change in estimate because they are not 
considered sufficiently reliable. 
In addition, repayment profiles will be 
affected by future changes in the market, 
for example, interest rates and the ability 
of borrowers to remortgage. This has 
the greatest impact on the acquired loan 
portfolios because repayments are linked 
to base rate with minimal incentive for the 
borrowers to remortgage until there is a 
change in interest rates. This means any 
change in the repayment profile causes 
the discount received on purchase of the 
acquired portfolios to be adjusted and 
spread over the revised expected life. 
Our response – our audit 
procedures included:
• We agreed a sample of data inputs 
used to measure interest income, 
including the loans split by product 
type, to reports from the Group 
reporting system
• We tested application controls, with 
the involvement of IT specialists, over 
the completeness and accuracy of 
the reports 
• We assessed the accuracy of the 
models by re-performing a sample 
of calculations and comparing the 
methodology used to our interpretation 
of the requirements of the relevant 
accounting standard 
• We challenged the appropriateness 
of key assumptions, including the 
expected lives, by comparing these 
to the available historical customer 
trends within the Group, internal 
forecasts, and to our own expectations 
based on our knowledge of the Group 
and experience of the industry in 
which it operates. This included an 
assessment as to how far forward the 
forecast expected life profiles should 
be considered 
• For comparable lending and where 
available, we benchmarked the Group’s 
expected life assumptions to peer data 
and/or market information 
• We also considered the adequacy 
of the Group’s disclosures about the 
changes in estimate that occurred 
during the period and the sensitivity 
disclosure across the key loan books
Recoverability of the goodwill 
attributable to the Invoice Finance 
business (£4.1 million)
Refer to page 66 (Audit Committee 
Report), page 149 (accounting 
policy), page 154 (Use of estimates 
and judgements) and note 24 
(financial disclosures)
The Risk – The Group tests the 
recoverable amount of the carrying value 
of the Invoice Finance cash generating 
unit (“CGU”) annually for impairment 
(or sooner if there are indications of 
impairment). An impairment loss is 
recognised when its carrying amount 
exceeds its recoverable amount (which 
is the higher of its value in use (“VIU”) 
and its fair value less costs of disposal 
(“FVLCD”)). As explained in note 24, 
impairment testing requires the Directors 
to make significant assumptions to assess 
the recoverable amount.
A refocusing of the Invoice Finance 
business during the year has led to 
the Group revising its forecasts whilst 
the impact is fully assessed. This has 
significantly impacted the future cash 
flow assumptions used within the VIU 
calculation and as a result, the VIU 
calculation is highly sensitive to the 
following assumptions, net fee income, 
impairment losses on loans and advances 
to customers, indirect costs allocated to 
the CGU and the post tax discount rate. 
If the assumptions included in the revised 
forecasts approved by the Board are used 
to calculate the VIU, then the goodwill 
would have been fully impaired. However, 
as explained in note 24, the Directors have 
recognised no impairment against the 
carrying value of the goodwill allocated to 
the Invoice Finance CGU. This is because 
the FVLCD have been determined to be 
greater than the carrying amount. This has 
required the Directors to make significant 
judgements and assumptions over the 
comparability of the CGU with recent 
disposals in the market.  135 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Strategic report Corporate governance Remuneration Risk management Financial statements Appendices
Our response – our audit 
procedures included:
• We assessed the appropriateness 
of the goodwill impairment 
model, with assistance from our 
Valuation specialists, and compared 
the methodology used to our 
interpretation of the requirements of 
the relevant accounting standards and 
market practice 
• We critically evaluated the cash flow 
forecasts and challenged the key 
assumptions including, net fee income, 
loan impairment, the level of indirect 
costs allocated to the CGU and that the 
post tax discount rate was reflective 
of the specific risks associated with 
the business to the extent such risks 
were not already reflected in the cash 
flow forecasts 
• We compared the cash flow forecasts 
with the latest Board approved budget
• We evaluated the historical accuracy 
of the Group’s forecasting ability by 
comparing the budget used in the prior 
years against actual performance of the 
business in the current year 
• We critically evaluated recent disposals 
in this sector and their comparability 
with the Invoice Finance CGU
• We challenged the valuation 
methodology used by the Directors 
to determine the FVLCD and used 
alternative valuation techniques, 
including a Price to Earnings basis, 
taking into account reasonable levels of 
costs of disposal 
• We challenged the recoverable amount 
by performing sensitivity analysis 
on both the VIU and FVLCD bases 
of calculation as well as assessing 
the differences between the VIU 
and FVLCD 
• We also considered the adequacy of 
the Group’s disclosures
3  Our application of materiality 
and an overview of the scope 
of our audit
The materiality for the Group financial 
statements as a whole was set at 
£3.0 million, determined with reference 
to a benchmark of Group profit before 
tax of £94.7 million, of which it represents 
3.2 per cent. 
We report to the Audit Committee any 
corrected or uncorrected identified 
misstatements exceeding £0.15 million, in 
addition to other identified misstatements 
that warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds. 
The Group audit team performed the 
audit of the Group as if it was a single 
aggregated set of financial information. 
The audit was performed using the 
materiality level set out above and 
covered 100 per cent of total Group 
revenue, Group profit before tax, and 
total Group assets.

Both the Group consolidated financial statements and the Company financial statements have been prepared and approved by 
the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (“IASB”), and as adopted by the European Union (“EU”). For IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement” the exclusion regarding hedge accounting (the so-called “carve out”) decreed by the EU on 19 November 2014 is 
taken into account.
By including the Company financial statements here together with the Group consolidated financial statements, the Company is 
taking advantage of the exemption in Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and 
related notes that form a part of these approved financial statements. 
The principal activity of the Company is that of an investment holding company. 
Note on rounding
In preparing the 2015 financial statements, the 2014 comparative numbers were restated from the original £ thousands to £ millions 
to one decimal place. As a result of rounding issues arising from this change, the presentation of some of the comparative numbers 
may differ slightly to the 2014 financial statements. All percentage movements as shown in the document are calculated using 
underlying figures.
b) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries which are entities 
controlled by the Company (jointly referred to as the Group) made up to 31 December each year. 
Control is achieved when the Company:
• Has power over the investee
• Is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee
• Has the ability to use its power to affect returns
The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or 
more of the three elements of control listed above.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are deconsolidated from the date that 
control ceases. Uniform accounting policies are applied consistently across the Group. Intercompany transactions and balances are 
eliminated upon consolidation.
Securitisation vehicles
The Group has securitised certain loans and advances to customers by the transfer of the beneficial interest in such loans to 
securitisation vehicles (see Note 20).
 
The securitisation enabled the subsequent issue of debt securities by a securitisation vehicle 
to investors who have the security of the underlying assets as collateral. The securitisation vehicles are fully consolidated into the 
Group’s accounts as the Group has control as defined above.
The transfer of the beneficial interest in these loans to the securitisation vehicle are not treated as sales by the Group. The Group 
continues to recognise these assets within its own statement of financial position after the transfer as it continues to retain 
substantially all the risks and rewards from the assets.
c) Going concern
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, as the Directors are satisfied that the Group has the resources 
to continue in business for the foreseeable future (which has been taken as 12 months from the date of approval of the financial 
statements). In making this assessment, the Directors have considered a wide range of information relating to present and future 
conditions, including the current state of the balance sheet, future projections of profitability, cash flows and capital resources and 
the longer term strategy of the business. The Group’s capital and liquidity plans, including stress tests, have been reviewed by the 
Directors. The Group’s forecasts and projections show that it will be able to operate at adequate levels of both liquidity and capital 
for the foreseeable future, including a range of stressed scenarios. After making due enquiries, the Directors believe that the Group 
has sufficient resources to continue its activities for the foreseeable future and to continue its expansion, and the Group has sufficient 
capital to enable it to continue to meet its regulatory capital requirements as set out by the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”). 143 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Strategic report Corporate governance Remuneration Risk management Financial statements Appendices
d) Basis of measurement
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the following material items in the 
financial statements:
• Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value through profit or loss
• Debt securities designated at fair value through profit or loss
• Available for sale debt securities are valued at fair value through other comprehensive income
• Fair value adjustments for portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities designated as hedged items in qualifying fair value 
hedge relationships, which reflect changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged
e) Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
Information about areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most 
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are included in Note 3.
f) Presentation of risk disclosures
The disclosures required under IFRS 7 “Financial instruments: disclosures” have been included within the audited sections of the Risk 
Report on page 105. Where information is marked as audited, It is incorporated into these financial statements by this cross reference 
and it is covered by the Independent Auditors report on page 133.
g) Future accounting developments
All standards or amendments to existing standards which have been endorsed by the EU and which are available for early adoption 
for annual periods commencing on or after 1 January 2015 have been adopted by the Group.
There are also a number of standards, amendments and interpretations which have been issued by the IASB but which have not 
yet been endorsed by the EU. The most significant of these is IFRS 9: “Financial instruments” , the planned replacement for IAS 39: 
“Financial Instruments: recognition and measurement”.
IFRS 9 introduces new requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets, hedge accounting and the impairment 
of financial assets. Under IFRS 9 financial assets are classified and measured based on the business model under which they are held 
and the characteristics of their contractual cash flows. In addition, IFRS 9 is replacing the incurred loss approach to impairment of 
IAS 39 with one based on expected losses, and is replacing the rules based hedging requirements of IAS 39 with new requirements 
that align hedge accounting more closely with risk management activities.
IFRS 9, including the final version of the requirements in respect of impairment, was issued on 24 July 2014. The IASB has decided 
to apply IFRS 9 for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. IFRS 9 is required to be applied retrospectively, but prior 
periods need not be restated. IFRS 9, including its commencement date, will be subject to endorsement by the EU. 
In addition, the IASB has commenced a separate project for macro hedging, which is exploring a new way to account for the dynamic 
risk management of open portfolios and is likely to be of future relevance to the Group. That project is still at the Discussion Paper 
stage and as yet the likely final form of any amendments to IFRS 9, or their required implementation date, is not clear. The adoption 
of IFRS 9 is expected to have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements. Work is ongoing to quantify the impact.
It is not anticipated that changes in approach to impairment would have a significant impact on the Group’s impairment provisions in 
respect of specifically impaired loans, as the current impairment provisions on such loans are based on estimates of expected losses. 
In respect of other loans against which collective provisions are raised, our current approach, as explained in Note 3, is to estimate 
probabilities of default for the next 12 months. This approach is similar to that which will be required under IFRS 9 except in order to 
measure incurred losses, as required by IAS 39, management then adjust the calculated 12 month expected loss for an emergence 
period reflective of the underlying asset enabling management to reflect only the impairment considered to have been incurred at 
the reporting date. In addition, for those loans where there has been a credit deterioration, although the loans are not considered to 
be yet impaired, IFRS 9 will require the recognition of full life expected losses. Whilst management’s current approach to calculating 
collective impairment provisions (as described above) has similarities to the approach required under IFRS 9, it should be noted 
that IFRS 9 is a complex accounting standard and management’s detailed modelling approach under IFRS 9 will require further 
investigation and consideration before implementation.
As described above, under IFRS 9, impairment provisions on all financial assets are recognised based on either 12 month expected 
losses or lifetime expected losses. This will result in the acceleration of the recognition of impairment provisions and will lead to more 
volatile impairment charges in the income statement. However, whilst IFRS 9 represents a significant change compared to IAS 39, the 
quantum of impairment losses recorded against any one loan over the life of the loan will not change as IFRS 9 alters only the timing 
of recognition of the impairment losses. Financial statements

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
1. Basis of preparation continued
The IASB has also issued IFRS 15: “Revenue from contracts with customers” . The impact for the Group is currently being assessed. 
The Standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with retrospective application 
subject to EU endorsement.
On 13 January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16: “Leases” as a replacement for IAS 17: “Leases” . The Standard will be effective for annual 
reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, with early application being permitted for companies that also apply IFRS 15, 
subject to EU endorsement. The impact for the Group is currently being assessed. A significant change will be the inclusion of a 
“right of use asset” within the statement of financial position in respect of the benefit the Group receives where it leases assets under 
operating leases, together with a financial liability in respect of the obligation to make operating lease payments. Within the income 
statement, an operating charge will be reflected in respect of the use of the asset together with interest expense in relation to the 
financing, replacing the current operating lease charges included in administrative expenses.
2. Significant accounting policies
a) Interest income and expense
Interest income and expense are recognised in the income statement on an effective interest rate (“EIR”) basis. The EIR is the 
rate that, at the inception of the financial asset or liability, exactly discounts expected future cash payments and receipts over 
the expected life of the instrument back to the initial carrying amount. When calculating the EIR, the Group estimates cash flows 
considering all contractual terms of the instrument (for example, prepayment options) but does not consider the assets’ future 
credit losses.
At each reporting date, management makes an assessment of the expected remaining life of its financial assets, including any 
acquired loan portfolios, and where there is a change in those assessments the remaining amount of any unamortised discount or 
premiums is adjusted so that the interest income continues to be recognised prospectively on the amortised cost of the financial 
asset at the original EIR. The adjustment arising is recognised within interest income in the income statement for the current period.
The calculation of the EIR includes all transaction costs and fees paid or received that are an integral part of the interest rate, 
together with the discounts or premium arising on the acquisition of loan portfolios. Transaction costs include incremental costs that 
are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or liability.
Interest income and expense presented in the income statement include:
• Interest on financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost calculated on an EIR basis
• Interest on available for sale debt securities calculated on an EIR basis
• Interest income recognised on finance leases where the Group acts as the lessor (see Note 2(o))
• The effective portion of fair value changes in qualifying hedging derivatives designated in fair value hedges of interest rate risk, 
together with changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk
• Interest income on financial assets designated at fair value so as to avoid an accounting mismatch with derivatives held as an 
“economic” hedge and the matching interest component of the derivative
Interest income includes amounts the Group charges its invoice finance clients as interest each day on the balance of their 
outstanding loans. This interest income is recognised in the income statement on an EIR basis.
b) Fee and commissions and other operating income
i. Fee and commission income
Fee and commission income includes fees relating to services provided to customers which do not meet the criteria for inclusion 
within interest income.
Within the Invoice Finance segment of the Group, customers are charged a factoring fee for managing their sales ledgers. This fee 
is recognised within fee and commissions income over the period in which the ledger management service is provided. Other fee 
and commission income includes fees charged for mortgage services, arrears, and insurance commission receivable. Fee income is 
recognised as the related services are performed.
Arrangement fees and others fees relating to loans and advances to customers are included within interest income as part of the 
EIR calculation.
ii. Fee and commission expense
Fee and commission expense predominantly consists of introducer commissions, legal and valuation fees and company search fees. 
Where these fee and commissions are incremental costs that are directly attributable to the issue of a financial instrument, they are 
included in interest income as part of the EIR calculation. Where they are not incremental costs that are directly attributable they are 
recognised within fee and commission expense as the services are received. 145 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Strategic report Corporate governance Remuneration Risk management Financial statements Appendices
iii. Other operating income
Other operating income predominantly arises from the provision of invoice finance services and includes disbursements and collect 
out income. This income is recognised within other operating income when the service is provided.
c) Net income from derivatives and other financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss
Net income from derivatives and other financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss relates to non trading derivatives held 
for risk management purposes that do not form part of a qualifying hedging arrangement and financial assets designated at fair 
value through profit or loss. It includes all realised and unrealised fair value changes, interest and foreign exchange differences, with 
the exception of interest income on financial assets designated at fair value and the matching interest component of the hedging 
derivatives. The assets designated at fair value are treated in this manner so as to avoid an accounting mismatch with derivatives held 
as an “economic” hedge.
d) Financial instruments – recognition and derecognition
i. Recognition
The Group initially recognises loans and advances, amounts due to banks, customer accounts and subordinated notes issued on the 
date that they are originated.
Regular way purchases and sales of debt securities and derivatives are recognised on the trade date at which the Group commits 
to purchase or sell the asset. All other financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised on the trade date at which the Group 
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
ii. Derecognition
Financial assets are derecognised when they are qualifying transfers and:
• The rights to receive cash flows from the assets have ceased; or
• The Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets
When a financial asset is derecognised in its entirety, the difference between the carrying amount, the sum of the consideration 
received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and any cumulative gain or loss, that had been recognised 
in other comprehensive income, is recognised in the income statement.
When available for sale financial assets are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss, including that previously recognised in 
reserves, is recognised in the income statement.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires. Any difference between the carrying 
amount of a financial liability derecognised and the consideration paid is recognised through the income statement.
iii. Funding for Lending Scheme (“FLS”)
Loans and advances over which the Group transfers its rights to the collateral thereon to the Bank of England under the FLS are 
not derecognised from the statement of financial position, as the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, 
including all cash flows arising from the loans and advances and exposure to credit risk. The treasury bills that the Group borrows 
against the transferred assets are not recognised in the statement of financial position, but where they are sold to third parties by 
the Group under agreements to repurchase, the cash received is recognised as an asset within the statement of financial position 
together with the corresponding obligation to return it which is recognised as a liability at amortised cost within “ Amounts due to 
banks” . Interest is accrued over the life of the agreement on an EIR basis.
e) Financial assets 
i. Overview
The Group classifies its financial assets (excluding derivatives) as either:
• Loans and receivables
• Available for sale
• Financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss
ii. Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market 
and that the Group does not intend to sell immediately or in the near term. These are initially measured at fair value plus transaction 
costs that are directly attributable to the financial asset. Subsequently, these are measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. 
The amortised cost is the amount advanced less principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the EIR 
method of any difference between the amount advanced and the maturity amount less impairment provisions for incurred losses. 
Loans and receivables mainly comprise loans and advances to banks and customers. Financial statements
146 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
2. Significant accounting policies continued
iii. Available for sale
Available for sale financial assets are debt securities that are not held for trading and are intended to be held for an indefinite 
period of time. These are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the financial asset. 
Subsequently, they are measured at fair value based on current quoted bid prices in active markets for identical assets that the 
Group can access at the reporting date. Where there is no active market or the debt securities are unlisted, the fair values are based 
on valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis, with reference to relevant market rates, and other commonly 
used valuation techniques. Interest income is recognised in the income statement using the EIR method. Impairment losses are 
recognised in the income statement. Other fair value changes are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the 
available for sale reserve in equity. On disposal, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is reclassified to the income statement.
iv. Financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss are assets which have been designated as such to eliminate or 
significantly reduce a measurement and recognition inconsistency or where management specifically manages an asset or liability 
on that basis. These assets are measured at fair value based on current quoted bid prices in active markets for identical assets that 
the Group can access at the reporting date. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value are brought into the income 
statement within “Net income/(expense) from derivatives and other financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss” as they 
arise. The Group disposed of all of its financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss during the year.
f) Financial liabilities
i. Overview
Financial liabilities are contractual obligations to deliver cash or another financial asset. Financial liabilities are recognised initially 
at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs for financial liabilities other than derivatives. Financial liabilities, other than 
derivatives, are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
ii. Financial liabilities at amortised cost
Financial liabilities at amortised cost are recognised initially at fair value, which equates to issue proceeds net of transaction costs 
incurred. They are subsequently stated at amortised cost. Any difference between proceeds net of transaction costs and the 
redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the EIR.
iii. Subordinated notes
Subordinated notes issued by the Group are assessed as to whether they should be treated as equity or financial liabilities. 
Where there is a contractual obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets, they are treated as a financial liability and measured 
at amortised cost using the EIR method after taking account of any discount or premium on the issue and directly attributable costs 
that are an integral part of the EIR. The amount of any discount or premium is amortised over the period to the expected call date of 
the instrument. 
All subordinated notes issued by the Group are classified as financial liabilities. The warrants attached to the subordinated notes, 
which gave the holders the right to subscribe for shares in Aldermore Group PLC (the “Parent Company”), were included in equity as 
a warrant reserve at the residual value attributable to the warrants, after deducting from the face value of the instrument, as a whole, 
the amounts determined separately as the fair value of the subordinated notes at the date of issue. All the warrants were exercised 
during the year as described in Note 35.
g) Impairment – financial assets
i. Assessment
At each reporting date the Group assesses its financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss as to whether there is objective 
evidence that the assets are impaired. Objective evidence that financial assets are impaired may include:
• Significant financial difficulty of the borrower
• A breach of contract such as default or delinquency in interest or principal repayments
• The granting of a concession for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrower’s financial condition that the Group would not 
otherwise grant
• Indications that a borrower or issuer will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation
• The disappearance of an active market for a debt security because of the issuer’s financial difficulties
• National or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults within groups of financial assets e.g. increases in unemployment 
rates or decreases in property prices relating to the collateral held
The Group considers evidence for the impairment of loans and advances at both the individual asset and collective level. In certain 
cases where a borrower is experiencing significant financial distress, the Group may use forbearance measures to assist them and 
mitigate against default. Any forbearance measures agreed are assessed on a case by case basis. 147 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Strategic report Corporate governance Remuneration Risk management Financial statements Appendices
ii. Scope
The Group considers evidence of impairment of financial assets at both an individual asset and collective level.
Individual impairment
All individually significant financial assets are assessed for individual impairment using a range of risk criteria. Those found not to be 
individually impaired are then collectively assessed for any impairment that has been incurred but not yet identified.
Assets are considered to be individually impaired where they meet one or more of the following criteria:
• A default position equivalent to 3 or more missed monthly repayments (or a quarterly payment which is over 30 days past due)
• Litigation proceedings have commenced
• Act of insolvency, e.g. bankruptcy, administration or liquidation, or appointment of an LPA Receiver
• Invoice finance accounts are classified as in default when there is cessation of additional advances and/or when the facility is in 
collect out
• Where there is evidence of fraud
Collective impairment
All financial assets that are not found to be individually impaired are collectively assessed for impairment by grouping together 
financial assets with similar risk characteristics.
iii. Measurement
Impairment provisions on financial assets individually identified as impaired are calculated as the difference between the carrying 
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset’s original EIR.
When assessing collective impairment, the Group estimates incurred losses using a statistical model which multiplies the probability 
of default (“PD”) for each class of customer (using external credit rating information) by the loss given default (“LGD”) multiplied by 
the estimated exposure at default (“EaD”) to arrive at the projected expected loss. An emergence period is subsequently applied 
to the projected expected loss to determine the estimated level of incurred losses at each reporting date. In addition an adjustment 
is made to discount the imputed cash flows from the model at the assets’ original EIR to arrive at the recorded collective provisions. 
The model’s results are adjusted for management’s judgement as to whether current economic and credit conditions are such that 
actual losses are likely to differ from those suggested by historical modelling.
In assessing the level of collective impairment provisions, the Group uses statistical modelling of historical trends of probability 
of default, the timing of recoveries and the amount of loss incurred, adjusted for management’s judgement as to whether current 
economic and credit conditions are such that actual losses are likely to be greater or less than suggested by historical trends. 
Default rates, loss rates and the expected timing of future recoveries are benchmarked against actual outcomes to ensure they 
remain appropriate.
Impairment losses are recognised immediately in the income statement and a corresponding reduction in the value of the financial 
asset is recognised through the use of an allowance account.
A write-off is made when all or part of a financial asset is deemed uncollectible or forgiven after all collection procedures have been 
completed and the amount of the loss has been determined. Write-offs are charged against amounts previously reflected in the 
allowance account or directly to the income statement. Any additional amounts recovered after a financial asset has been previously 
written off are offset against the write-off charge in the income statement once they are received. Allowances for impairment losses 
are released at the point when it is deemed that, following a subsequent event, the risk has reduced such that an allowance is no 
longer required.
Interest on impaired financial assets is recognised at the same EIR as applied at the initial recognition of the financial asset but 
applied to the book value of the financial asset net of any individual impairment allowances that have been raised.
iv. Impairment of financial assets classified as available for sale
Impairment losses on available for sale debt securities are recognised by reclassifying the losses accumulated in the available 
for sale reserve in equity to the income statement. The cumulative loss that is reclassified from equity to the income statement is 
the difference between the acquisition cost, net of any principal repayment and amortisation, and the current fair value, less any 
impairment loss recognised previously in the income statement. Changes in impairment provisions attributable to the effective 
interest method are reflected as a component of interest income.
If in a subsequent period the fair value of an impaired available for sale debt security increases and the increase can be related 
objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised, then the impairment loss is reversed.
h) Financial instruments – fair value measurement
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date in the principal, or in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Group has 
access at that date. The fair value of a liability reflects its non performance risk. Financial statements
148 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
2. Significant accounting policies continued
When applicable, the Group measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active market for that instrument. 
A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide 
pricing on an ongoing basis.
When there is no quoted price in an active market, the Group uses valuation techniques that maximise the use of relevant observable 
inputs and minimises the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation techniques incorporate all the factors that market 
participants would take into account in pricing a transaction.
The best evidence of fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is normally the transaction price – i.e. the fair value of the 
consideration received or given.
If an asset measured at fair value has a bid and an offer price, the Group measures assets and long positions at a bid price and 
liabilities at an offer price.
i) Derivative financial instruments
The Group enters into derivative transactions only for the purpose of reducing exposures to fluctuations in interest rates, exchange 
rates and market indices; they are not used for proprietary trading purposes.
Derivatives are carried at fair value with movements in fair values recorded in the income statement. Derivative financial instruments 
are principally valued by discounted cash flow models using yield curves that are based on observable market data or are based on 
valuations obtained from counterparties. As the Group’s derivatives are covered by master netting agreements with the Group’s 
counterparties, with any net exposures then being further covered by the payment or receipt of periodic cash margins, the Group 
has used a risk free discount rate for the determination of their fair values.
All derivatives are classified as assets where their fair value is positive and liabilities where their fair value is negative. Where there 
is the current legal ability and intention to settle net, then the derivative is classified as a net asset or liability, as appropriate. 
Where cash collateral is received, to mitigate the risk inherent in amounts due to the Group, it is included as a liability within 
“ Amounts due to banks” . Where cash collateral is given, to mitigate the risk inherent in amounts due from the Group, it is included as 
an asset in “Loans and advances to banks” .
j) Hedge accounting
The Group designates certain derivatives held for risk management as hedging instruments in qualifying hedging relationships. 
On initial designation of the hedge, the Group formally documents the relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged 
items, including the risk management objective, the strategy in undertaking the hedge and the method that will be used to assess 
the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The Group makes an assessment both at the inception of the hedge relationship as 
well as on an ongoing basis, as to whether the hedging instruments are expected to be highly effective in offsetting the changes in 
the fair value of the respective hedged items during the period for which the hedge is designated.
i. Fair value hedge accounting for portfolio hedges of interest rate risk
The Group applies fair value hedge accounting for portfolio hedges of interest rate risk. As part of its risk management process, the 
Group identifies portfolios whose interest rate risk it wishes to hedge. The portfolios comprise either only assets or only liabilities. 
The Group analyses each portfolio into repricing time periods based on expected repricing dates, by scheduling cash flows into the 
periods in which they are expected to occur. Using this analysis, the Group designates as the hedged item an amount of the assets 
or liabilities from each portfolio that it wishes to hedge.
The Group measures monthly the change in fair value of the portfolio relating to the interest rate risk that is being hedged. 
Provided that the hedge has been highly effective, the Group recognises the change in fair value of each hedged item in the income 
statement with the cumulative movement in their value being shown on the statement of financial position as a separate item, “Fair 
value adjustment for portfolio hedged risk” , either within assets or liabilities as appropriate. This amount is amortised on a straight-
line basis to the income statement over the remaining average life of the original hedge relationship, from the month in which it is 
first recognised.
The Group measures the fair value of each hedging instrument monthly. The value is included in derivative financial instruments in 
either assets or liabilities as appropriate, with the change in value recorded in the income statement. Any hedge ineffectiveness is 
recognised in the income statement as the difference between the change in fair value of the hedged item and the change in fair 
value of the hedging instrument.
k) Embedded derivatives
A derivative may be embedded in another instrument, known as the host contract. Where the economic characteristics and risks of 
an embedded derivative are not closely related to those of the host contract (and the host contract is not carried at fair value through 
profit or loss), the embedded derivative is separated from the host and held on the statement of financial position with “Derivatives 
held for risk management” at fair value. Movements in fair value are posted to the income statement, whilst the host contract is 
accounted for according to the relevant accounting policy for that particular asset or liability.
  149 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Strategic report Corporate governance Remuneration Risk management Financial statements Appendices
Embedded derivatives contained within equity instruments are considered separately. The embedded derivative on the contingent 
convertible securities is not separated as the Group has an accounting policy not to separate a feature that has already been 
considered in determining that the entire issue is a non-derivative equity instrument. 
l) Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost on transition to IFRSs, less accumulated depreciation and 
any provision for impairment. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset or costs incurred 
in bringing the asset to use. Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment, at rates calculated to write-off the cost of 
each asset to realisable values on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life, as follows:
• Fixtures, fittings and equipment five years
• Computer hardware one to five years
Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment. 
m) Intangible assets
i. Goodwill
Goodwill is stated at deemed cost upon transition to IFRSs, less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortised but 
is tested for impairment on an annual basis. Where impairment is required, the amount is recognised in the income statement and 
cannot be subsequently reversed.
ii. Computer systems
Software acquired by the Group is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Expenditure on internally developed software is recognised as an asset when the Group is able to demonstrate its intention and 
ability to complete the development and use the software in a manner that will generate future economic benefits, and can reliably 
measure the costs to complete the development. The capitalised costs of internally developed software include all costs directly 
attributable to developing the software, and are amortised over its useful life. Internally developed software is stated at capitalised 
cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment.
Software is amortised on a straight-line basis in the income statement over its useful life, from the date that it is available for use. 
The estimated useful life of software is one to five years.
n) Impairment of non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets are reviewed at least annually to determine whether there is any indication 
of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
i. Goodwill
Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to operating 
segments. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of a segment is less than its recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount of a segment is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is calculated 
from forecasts by management of post tax profits for the subsequent five years, and a residual value, discounted at a risk adjusted 
interest rate appropriate to the cash generating unit. Fair value is determined through review of precedent transactions for 
comparable businesses.
Where impairment is required, the amount is recognised in the income statement and cannot be subsequently reversed.
ii. Intangible assets
If impairment is indicated, the asset’s recoverable amount (being the greater of value in use and fair value less costs to sell) is 
estimated. Value in use is calculated by discounting the future cash flows from continuing use of the asset. If the carrying value 
of the asset is less than the greater of the value in use and the fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognised in the 
income statement.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would 
have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
o) Assets leased to customers
Leases of assets to customers are finance leases as defined by IAS17 . When assets are leased to customers under finance leases, 
the present value of the lease payments is recognised as a receivable. The difference between the gross receivable and the present 
value of the receivable is recognised as unearned finance income. Lease income is recognised, within interest income in the income 
statement, over the term of the lease using the net investment method (before tax) which reflects a constant periodic rate of return 
ignoring tax cash flows. Financial statements

2. Significant accounting policies continued
p) Assets leased from third parties
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases. Payments made 
under operating leases, net of any incentives received from the lessor, are charged to the income statement, within administrative 
expenses or staff costs (in the case of company cars), on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. The Group holds no assets 
under finance leases.
q) Provisions
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated 
reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. 
The Group has an obligation to contribute to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) to enable the FSCS to meet 
compensation claims from, in particular, retail depositors of failed banks. A provision is recognised to the extent it can be reliably 
estimated and when the Group has an obligation in accordance with IAS 37 . The amount provided is based on information received 
from the FSCS, forecast future interest rates and the Group’s historic share of industry protected deposits. The FSCS provision is 
recognised at the commencement of the scheme year in line with IFRIC 21.
r) Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities held at the balance sheet date are translated into sterling using the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. 
Exchange differences are charged or credited to the income statement.
s) Taxation
Taxation comprises current and deferred tax, and is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items 
recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on taxable income or loss for the period, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial 
reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for:
• Temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that 
affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss
• Temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future
• Taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill
The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow the manner in which the Group expects at the end 
of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is measured using tax rates 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
t) Pension costs
The cost of providing retirement benefits is charged to the income statement at the amount of the defined contributions payable for 
each year. Differences between contributions payable and those actually paid are shown as accruals or prepayments. The Group has 
no defined benefit pension scheme.
u) Shareholders’ funds
i. Capital instruments
The Company classifies capital instruments as financial liabilities or equity instruments in accordance with the substance of the 
contractual terms of the instruments. Where an instrument contains no obligation on the Company to deliver cash or other financial 
assets, or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable 
to the Group, or where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments but includes no obligation 
to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own equity instruments, then it treated as an equity instrument. Accordingly, the 
Company’s share capital and contingent convertible securities are presented as components of equity within shareholders’ funds. 
Any dividends, interest or other distributions on capital instruments are recognised in equity. Any related tax is accounted for in 
accordance with IAS 12. 151 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Strategic report Corporate governance Remuneration Risk management Financial statements Appendices
ii. Share premium
Share premium is the amount by which the fair value of the consideration received exceeds the nominal value of the shares issued.
v) Capital raising costs
Costs directly incremental to the raising of share capital are netted against the share premium account. Costs directly incremental to 
the raising of convertible securities included in equity are offset against the proceeds from the issue within equity.
w) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and balances with a maturity of three months or less from the acquisition date, 
which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
x) Investment in group undertakings
Investments in group undertakings are initially recognised at cost. At each reporting date, an assessment is made as to 
whether there is any indication that the investment may be impaired. If such an indication exists, the Company estimates the 
investment’s recoverable amount. The investment is written down to the recoverable amount if this is lower than its carrying value. 
The impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
y) Warrants
The Company’s subsidiary, Aldermore Bank PLC, previously issued subordinated notes with attached warrants. The warrants gave 
the holders the right to subscribe for shares in the Company. These warrants were exercised during the year resulting in an increase 
in share capital and share premium. On the exercise of the warrants, the warrant reserve was re-classified to retained earnings.
z) Share-based payment transactions
Employees (including Senior Executives) of the Group may receive remuneration in the form of equity settled share-based payment 
transactions to reward strong long-term business performance and to incentivise growth for the future.
The grant date fair value is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity over the period that the 
employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards. The grant date fair value is determined using valuation models which take 
into account the terms and conditions attached to the awards. Inputs into valuation models may include the risk free interest rate, 
the expected volatility of the Company’s share price and other various factors which relate to performance conditions attached to 
the awards.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards for which the related service and non-
market vesting conditions are expected to be met such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the 
number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. For share-based 
payment awards with market performance conditions or non-vesting conditions the grant date fair value of the share-based payment 
is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes.
Within the Parent Company stand alone financial statements the share-based payment transactions are recognised as an investment 
in Group undertakings with an associated credit to the share-based payment reserve.
3. Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial information requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates.
Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in 
which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected. The judgements and assumptions that are considered to be the 
most important to the portrayal of the Group’s financial condition are those relating to loan impairment provisions, EIRs, deferred 
tax, share-based payments and Invoice Finance goodwill.
a) Loan impairment provisions
Loan portfolios across all segments of the Group are reviewed on at least a monthly basis to assess for impairment. In determining 
whether an impairment provision should be recorded, judgements are made as to whether there is objective evidence that a 
financial asset or portfolio of financial assets is impaired as a result of loss events that occurred after recognition of the asset and 
by the reporting date. The calculation of impairment loss is management’s best estimate of losses incurred in the portfolio at the 
balance sheet date and reflects expected future cash flows based on both the likelihood of a loan or advance being written off and 
the estimated loss on such a write-off.
At 31 December 2015, gross loans and advances to customers totalled £6,165.5 million (31 December 2014: £4,823.6 million) 
against which impairment allowances of £20.7 million (31 December 2014: £22.5 million) had been made (see Note 20). 
The Group’s accounting policy for loan impairment provisions on financial assets classified as loans and receivables is described 
in Note 2(g). Impairment allowances are made up of two components, those determined individually against specific assets and 
those determined collectively. Of the impairment allowance of £20.7 million at 31 December 2015, £10.2 million (31 December 
2014: £14.0 million) relates to individual provisions and £10.5 million (31 December 2014: £8.5 million) relates to collective provisions.  Financial statements

3. Use of estimates and judgements continued
The section below provides details of the critical elements of judgement within the loan impairment calculations. Less significant 
judgements are not disclosed.
i. Individual
Individual impairment allowances are established against the Group’s individually significant financial assets that are deemed 
by management to be impaired. The determination of individual impairment allowances requires the exercise of considerable 
judgement by management involving matters such as local economic conditions, the financial status of the customer and the 
realisable value of the security held. The actual amount of the future cash flows and their timing may differ significantly from the 
assumptions made for the purposes of determining the impairment allowances and consequently these allowances can be subject 
to variation as time progresses and the circumstances of the customer become clearer.
ii. Collective
The collective impairment allowance is also subject to estimation uncertainty and in particular is sensitive to changes in economic 
and credit conditions, including the interdependency of house prices, unemployment rates, interest rates, borrowers’ behaviour and 
consumer bankruptcy trends. All of these factors can influence the key assumptions detailed below. It is, however, inherently difficult 
to estimate how changes in one or more of these factors might impact the collective impairment allowance.
The key assumptions used in the collective model are: probability of default (“PD”), the loss given default (“LGD”) and the loss 
emergence period (“EP”) (the time between a trigger event occurring and the loans being identified as individually impaired). 
An additional element is included within the collective provision to reflect fraud losses that are incurred as at the reporting date 
but are yet to be individually identified. The Group uses two types of underlying models to calculate the LGD, depending on the 
availability of default data. For the mortgage businesses, the models use a range of key assumptions to derive an expected LGD. 
The key assumptions are based on management expertise and are validated against available data. For Asset Finance and Invoice 
Finance, the models are empirical based models which mainly use past lost data to determine the risk drivers behind the loss. 
This allows the portfolios to be segmented into homogenous buckets to derive an LGD. Further details in respect of assumptions 
and details of the sensitivity of the estimate to changes in significant assumptions are as follows:
iii. Probability of default
The PD is based on external individual customer credit rating information, sourced from an external credit bureau, updated for each 
reporting date. This external credit rating information gives a PD in the next 12 months where “default” is defined as loans which 
are 2 months or more in arrears (“2 MIA”) and incorporates credit information from a broad range of financial services products for 
each customer.
Management make an estimate so as to adjust the external data to reflect both the individual nature of the Group’s lending and 
the Group’s policy of classifying loans which are 3 months or more in arrears (“3 MIA”) as “impaired” . This adjustment is achieved by 
using two management assumptions: firstly a “conversion rate” that reflects how many of the loans which fall into 2 MIA will also fall 
into 3 MIA; and secondly a scalar that adjusts the external PDs to reflect the individual nature of the Group’s lending.
• A 10 per cent absolute increase in the “conversion rate” assumed by management between 2 MIA and 3 MIA (e.g. a PD increasing 
from 50 per cent to 60 per cent), when the loans are considered to be individually impaired would increase the impairment 
allowance by £0.3 million
• A 10 per cent relative worsening of the scaling factors applied to external data in order to arrive at PDs appropriate to the 
individual nature of lending being undertaken would increase the impairment allowance by £0.6 million
iv. Loss given default
The model calculates the LGD from the point of repossession. Not all cases that are 3 MIA will reach repossession. Management 
therefore adjust the model by applying an assumption of the percentage of accounts 3 MIA that will reach repossession.
• A 10 per cent absolute reduction in this assumption would decrease the impairment allowance by £0.3 million
The LGD is also sensitive to the application of the House Price Index (“HPI”) and Forced Sale Discount (“FSD”) which affect the 
underlying value of the collateral which is expected to be received
• A 10 per cent relative reduction in the HPI would increase the overall impairment allowance by £1.3 million
• A 5 per cent absolute increase in the FSD would increase the overall impairment provision by £1.0 million
The above assumptions are important factors when calculating the LGD to be applied for the mortgage business. For the Asset 
Finance and Invoice Finance model, the assumption with most judgement is the absolute LGD value calculated.
• A 10 per cent relative increase in the LGDs used would increase the overall impairment allowance by £0.6 million
v. Emergence period
The Group’s collective models estimate the expected losses for the next 12 months, which are then scaled back to reflect the level 
of incurred loss as at the reporting date, using the emergence period. The emergence period is the time taken from the trigger 
event (such as a job loss) to the Group identifying the loan is impaired. The emergence period varies by business line and requires 
management to make judgements because of the limited data available.
A three-month increase in all emergence periods would increase the overall impairment allowance by £3.6 million. 153 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Strategic report Corporate governance Remuneration Risk management Financial statements Appendices
b) Effective interest rate
IAS 39 requires interest earned from mortgages to be measured under the EIR method. Management must therefore use judgement 
to estimate the expected life of each type of instrument and hence the expected cash flows relating to it. The accuracy of the EIR 
would therefore be affected by unexpected market movements resulting in altered customer behaviour, inaccuracies in the models 
used compared to actual outcomes and incorrect assumptions.
A critical estimate in determining EIR is the expected life to maturity of the Group’s commercial, Buy-to-Let and residential mortgage 
portfolios, as a change in the estimates will have an impact on the period over which the directly attributable costs and fees, and any 
discount received on the acquisition of the mortgage loan portfolios, are recognised.
As at 31 December 2015 a reassessment was made of the estimates used in respect of the expected lives of the commercial, Buy-to-
Let and residential mortgage portfolios and also of those for the asset finance portfolios. As a consequence an overall adjustment 
of £0.4 million was recorded to increase the value of the loan portfolios and the interest income recognised in the current period, so 
that interest can continue to be recognised at the original effective the interest rate over the remaining life of the relevant lending 
portfolios. The adjustment made at 31 December is analysed as follows:
Impact on 2015 
interest income 
£m
Asset Finance – organic lending (1.6)
SME Commercial – acquired portfolios (0.7)
SME Commercial – organic lending (0.9)
Buy-to-Let – acquired portfolios (0.6)
Buy-to-Let – organic portfolios 0.1 
Residential – acquired portfolios (1.1)
Residential – organic lending 5.2 
0.4 
A change in the estimated expected lives, after taking account of the above adjustment, to extend the expected lives of the 
commercial, Buy-to-Let and residential portfolios by six months would have the effect of reducing the cumulative profit before tax 
recognised as at 31 December 2015 by £1.5 million (31 December 2014: £2.4 million). Included within this sensitivity of £1.5 million, is 
a £2.8 million cumulative reduction in profit relating to acquired portfolios (31 December 2014: £2.9 million) due to a change in the 
unwind of the discount which is offset by a £1.3 million cumulative increase in profit relating to the organic portfolios (31 December 
2014: £0.5 million).
A 0.1 per cent increase in the rate of early redemptions, expressed as a percentage of the outstanding balance in respect of asset 
finance portfolios would have the impact of reducing cumulative profit before tax recognised as at 31 December 2015 by £0.3 million 
(31 December 2014: £0.2 million).
c) Deferred tax
Taxation involves estimation techniques to assess the liability in terms of possible outcomes. The assessment of the recoverability or 
otherwise of deferred tax assets is based mainly on a determination of whether sufficient profits will be generated within five years to 
realise deferred tax assets.
This is reviewed at each reporting date with a detailed exercise conducted to establish the validity of profit forecasts and other 
information including timescales over which the profits are expected to arise and the deferred tax assets will reverse. Deferred tax is 
determined using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of financial position date and which are expected to 
apply when the related deferred tax assets are realised.
The judgement required in the assessment of whether to recognise a deferred tax asset is set out in Note 2 (s). The Group estimates 
that even after reasonably possible changes in the profit forecasts, the Group would have sufficient profits against which to realise 
the deferred tax assets. 
Based on the analysis of the timing and level of reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, management conclude that a net 
deferred tax asset of £16.4 million should be recognised at the balance sheet date.
d) Share-based payments
The fair value of the share awards is calculated using statistical models. The inputs to these models require management judgement 
to estimate the probability and timings of events taking place in the future. The significant inputs used in the models include the 
exercise price, share price, expected volatility, expected life and the risk free rate. The share-based payment recognised can be 
materially affected by these assumptions. Further information on the key assumptions can be found in Note 36. Financial statements

3. Use of estimates and judgements continued
e) Invoice Finance goodwill
At 31 December 2015, the Group held goodwill balances totalling £12.6 million, £8.5 million of which is attributable to the SME 
Commercial Mortgages segment, with the remaining balance of £4.1 million attributable to the Invoice Finance segment. 
IAS 36 requires an assessment of goodwill balances for impairment on at least an annual basis. An impairment charge should be 
recognised where the recoverable amount from the segment is less than the carrying value of the goodwill. 
The recoverable amount is the greater of either the Value in Use (“VIU”) of a business or its Fair Value less Costs of Disposal 
(“FVLCD”). VIU is determined by discounting the future cash flows forecasted to be generated from the continuing use of the 
segment and requires judgement to be applied, specifically in relation to the assumptions used within the discounted future cash 
flow calculation. FVLCD is defined as the price that would be expected to be received if sold in an orderly transaction between 
market participants and equally requires judgement to be applied, specifically in assessing comparable transactions in order to 
derive a fair value. 
Management has considered both methods for calculating the recoverable amount. 
The VIU calculation is sensitive to key inputs into the calculation, including the forecasted future cash flows and the discount rate 
applied. During 2015 the business was refocused and management revised their projections for the business while the impact of this 
is being assessed. Using these updated projections, under the VIU method, the goodwill relating to the Invoice Finance business of 
£4.1 million would be fully impaired, although management note a reasonably small change in the key assumptions would result in 
the goodwill balance being supportable.
Management has determined the FVLCD by reviewing recent transactions for similar businesses and applying the Price/Tangible 
Book Value ratio from those transactions to the Aldermore Invoice Finance business. Management have performed an exercise 
to assess the comparability of the businesses involved in recent transactions with the Aldermore Invoice Finance business. 
Before relying on the market value, analysis has been performed to understand the differing valuations produced by both the FVLCD 
and VIU methods. 
Management believe that the Price/Tangible Book Value ratio is the most appropriate Fair Value methodology to use but note that 
applying an alternative Price/Earnings methodology also supports the goodwill balance. 
After considering the above, management has concluded it is appropriate to use FVLCD and therefore are satisfied that the goodwill 
balance of £4.1 million in relation to the Invoice Finance segment is supportable. The estimated value would be required to fall 
approximately 25 per cent before the goodwill balance would be fully impaired.
4. Segmental information
The Group has five reportable operating segments as described below which are based on the Group’s five lending segments plus 
Central Functions. Each segment offers groups of similar products and services and are managed separately based on the Group’s 
internal reporting structure.
In the prior period, the Group had four reportable operating segments. In late 2015, the Group concluded that it was necessary to 
split out the Buy-to-Let segment from SME Commercial and Residential Mortgages segments, where it was previously reported. 
This split ensures a closer alignment to the Group’s evolving operating model and greater transparency over the Buy-to-Let 
segmental results. The prior year comparatives have been re-presented on the new basis. 
Residential Mortgages, SME Commercial mortgages and Buy-to-Let are operated under a single management team and supported 
by a single IT platform. Shared administrative expenses in the mortgages business have been apportioned across these segments 
on the basis of business activity levels in each segment. However, the characteristics of the three businesses are sufficiently different 
and accordingly the segments are reported separately to the Board. Therefore, the three businesses represent separate operating 
segments in accordance with IFRS 8. 
For each of the reportable segments the Board, which is the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker, reviews internal management 
reports on a monthly basis. The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group’s reportable segments:
 – Asset Finance – Lease and hire purchase financing for SMEs, focusing on sectors with strong returns and liquid secondary 
asset markets.
 – Invoice Finance – Provides UK SMEs with working capital solutions through invoice discounting, factoring and asset 
based lending.
 – SME Commercial Mortgages – Property finance needs of professional, commercial property investors, and owner-occupier 
SMEs. Targets prime and specialist prime segments with loan sizes generally below £5 million.
 – Buy-to-Let – Offers a wide range of standard and specialist Buy-to-Let mortgages for residential units, multi-unit freehold or 
houses with multiple occupation (“HMO”) to both individuals and companies.
 – Residential Mortgages – Prime residential mortgages targeting underserved segments of creditworthy borrowers that provide 
attractive and sustainable margins. 155 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Strategic report Corporate governance Remuneration Risk management Financial statements Appendices
Central Functions include the reconciling items between the total of the five reportable operating segments and the consolidated 
income statement. As well as common costs, Central Functions includes the Group’s Treasury and Savings functions which are 
responsible for raising finance on behalf of the operating segments. The costs of raising finance are all recharged by Central 
Functions to operating segments, apart from those costs relating to the subordinated notes (Note 6) and the net expense/income 
from derivatives held at fair value.
Common costs are incurred on behalf of the operating segments and typically represent savings administration costs, back 
office costs and support function costs such as Finance, Risk and Human Resources. The costs are not directly attributable to the 
operating segments.
Information regarding the results of each reportable segment and their reconciliation to the total results of the Group are included

 The prior year comparatives have been re-presented to reclassify £0.6 million relating to share-based payments, from “Other” to “Staff costs”.
Included in other administrative expenses are costs relating to temporary staff of £5.0 million (31 December 2014: £4.5 million), travel 
and subsistence of £3.2 million (31 December 2014: £2.8 million) and staff recruitment of £1.6 million (31 December 2014: £2.1 million).
Information technology costs for the year ended 31 December 2014 included £1.6 million in relation to a write-off of intangible assets.
Costs associated with the IPO
Included within administrative expenses for the year is £4.1 million (31 December 2014: £6.0 million) of costs associated with the IPO. 
The £4.1 million consists of £0.4 million for a one-off share award to employees and £3.7 million for fees associated with listing.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of capital, including advisory and underwriting fees, have been charged 
directly to equity. Other costs associated with the listing have been allocated between administrative expenses and equity, based on 
the proportion of new shares issued in the IPO compared to the total number of shares. Total costs associated with the listing for the 
year ended 31 December 2015 are £6.8 million, comprising £4.1 million charged to the income statement and £2.7 million charged 
to equity. Financial statements

forgave loans totalling £0.1 million. At 31 December 2015 there is one loan to a Director for the value of £0.05 million under normal 
terms of business (31 December 2014: two loans, £0.1 million).
Long-term incentive schemes
The Directors held certain shares pre-IPO which converted into ordinary shares on IPO. The reported gains have been calculated 
on the market value of shares held at IPO (£1.92) less the actual cost on any share bought pre-IPO, regardless of whether such shares 
were acquired as an investment or an incentive. The aggregate gains on such shares held by Directors on IPO was £7 ,782,900.

A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can 
be regarded as probable that there will be suitable future taxable profits against which the unwinding of the asset can be offset.

Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate from 23 per cent to 21 per cent (effective from 1 April 2014) and 20 per cent (effective from 
1 April 2015) were substantively enacted on 2 July 2013. In the Budget on 8 July 2015, the Chancellor announced additional planned 
reductions to 19 per cent with effect from 1 April 2017 and to 18 per cent with effect from 1 April 2020. In addition, the Chancellor 
announced the introduction of a corporation tax surcharge applicable to banking companies with effect from 1 January 2016. 
The surcharge will be levied at a rate of 8 per cent on the profits of banking companies chargeable to corporation tax after an annual 
allowance of £25 million. These changes, which were all substantively enacted on 26 October 2015 will result in an overall increase in 
the Group’s tax charge for years commencing from 1 January 2016.
Deferred tax as at 31 December 2015 has been provided for at the revised substantively enacted rates that will apply when 
deferred tax assets are realised or deferred tax liabilities are settled. The impact of this change increased the net deferred tax 
asset recognised as at 31 December 2015 by £3.7 million, with a corresponding reduction to the tax charge recognised in the 
income statement.
There were no unrecognised deferred tax balances at 31 December 2015 (31 December 2014: £nil). 161 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015

18. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Group by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
2015 2014*
Profit after taxation – attributable to equity holders of the Group (£million) 78.3 38.4 
Coupon paid on contingent convertible securities, net of tax (£million) (2.8) –
Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Group (£million) 75.5 38.4 
Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue (million) 332.4 296.2 
Basic earnings per share (p) 22.7 13.0 
The ordinary shares in issue used in the denominator in the calculation of basic earnings per share are the ordinary shares of the 
Company since the share reorganisation that occurred on the Company’s admission to the LSE on 13 March 2015. Further details of 
the share reorganisation are provided in Note 35. Prior to that date, the ordinary shares in issue figure was based on the A1, A2, D and 
E ordinary shares in issue. The B and C ordinary shares were excluded from the calculation on the basis that they had no entitlement 
to dividends or other distributions of the Company.
* The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share in the prior period has been restated to reflect the impact of the bonus share 
issue that was made to existing shareholders as part of the share reorganisation that occurred on the Company’s admission to the 
LSE on 13 March 2015.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share has been based on the same profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the 
Group as for basic earnings and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding after the potential dilutive effect of 
share-based payment awards to Directors and employees. The share warrants, giving rise to dilution for 2014, were exercised on 
9 September 2015 and new shares were issued and listed on the London Stock Exchange (for details see Note 35).

collateral with the Scheme, against which £750.0 million of UK Treasury Bills had been drawn as at the reporting date (31 December 
2014: £485.0 million). 
At 31 December 2015, loans and advances to customers include £206.5 million (31 December 2014: £293.1 million) which have been 
used in secured funding arrangements, resulting in the beneficial interest in these loans being transferred to Oak No. 1 PLC which 
is a securitisation vehicle consolidated into these financial statements. The carrying value of these loans on 10 April 2014, when the 
beneficial interest was transferred, was £362.3 million. These loans secured £333.3 million of funding for the Group. All the assets 
pledged are retained within the statement of financial position as the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards relating to 
the loans.

a) Fair value hedges of interest rate risk
The Group uses interest rate swaps within qualifying hedge accounting relationships to manage its exposure to changes in the fair 
values of certain fixed rate lending and savings products and debt securities held, attributable to changes in market interest rates. 
Further details regarding the Group’s approach to hedge accounting, including a description of the Group’s exposure to volatility 
are provided in the risk report on page 125.
b) Other derivatives held for risk management 
The Group uses other derivatives, not designated in qualifying hedge relationships, to manage its exposure to the following:
• Interest rate risk on certain debt securities held which are designated at fair value through profit or loss
• Interest rate basis risk on certain mortgage loans 
• Equity market risk on equity linked products offered to depositors
• Foreign exchange risk on currency loans provided to invoice finance customers

Goodwill arose on the acquisitions of Ruffler Holdings Limited (subsequently renamed Aldermore Holdings Limited), Base 
Commercial Mortgages Holdings Limited and Absolute Invoice Finance (Holdings) Limited. For the purpose of impairment testing, 
goodwill is allocated to the Group’s operating segments. The aggregate amount allocated to each segment is as follows:

SME Commercial Mortgages 8.5 8.5 
Invoice Finance 4.1 4.1 
12.6 12.6 
No impairment losses on goodwill were recognised during the year ended 31 December 2015 (31 December 2014: £nil).
The Value in Use (“VIU”) for SME Commercial Mortgages and Invoice Finance segment have been determined by discounting the 
future cash flows to be generated from the continuing use of the segment. VIU at 31 December 2015 has been determined in a 
similar manner as at 31 December 2014.
Key assumptions used in the calculation of VIU were the following: 
• Cash flows were projected based on past experience, actual operating results and the five-year business plan (31 December 2014: 
the five-year business plan). Cash flows after the planning period were extrapolated using a constant growth rate of 2 per cent 
(31 December 2014: 3 per cent) into perpetuity 
• Pre-tax discount rates of 13.0 per cent and 14.3 per cent (31 December 2014: 13.0 per cent and 15.0 per cent) respectively were 
applied in determining the recoverable amounts for the SME Commercial Mortgages and Invoice Finance operating segments. 
These discount rates were based on the weighted average cost of funding for the segments taking into account the Group’s 
regulatory capital requirement and expected market returns for debt and equity funding, adjusted for risk premiums to reflect the 
systemic risk of the individual segments
The VIU of the SME Commercial Mortgage segment is significantly above the carrying value of the attributable goodwill and net 
assets. The Group estimates that reasonably possible changes in the above assumptions are not expected to cause the recoverable 
amount of SME Commercial Mortgage to reduce below the carrying amount. Financial statements

Goodwill attributable to Invoice Finance
During 2015, the Invoice Finance business was refocused and management revised their projections for the business while the 
impact of this is being assessed. Using these updated projections, under the VIU method, the goodwill relating to the Invoice 
Finance business of £4.1 million would be fully impaired, although management note a reasonably small change in the key 
assumptions would result in the goodwill balance being supportable.
Under IAS 36, the recoverable amount is the greater of either the VIU of a business or its Fair Value less Costs of Disposal (“FVLCD”). 
Management has therefore also considered the FVLCD valuation method. 
Management considers the goodwill attributable to the Invoice Finance business to be a critical accounting judgement. Note 3 
provides further details of the method used to calculate the FVLCD valuation method. Under the FVLCD method, the goodwill 
balance of £4.1 million in relation to the Invoice Finance segment is supportable. The estimated value would be required to fall 
approximately 25 per cent before the goodwill balance would be fully impaired. The valuation calculated using the FVLCD method is 
categorised as level 3 under the fair value hierarchy of IFRS 13.

Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”)
In common with all regulated UK deposit takers, the Group’s principal subsidiary, Aldermore Bank PLC, pays levies to the FSCS to 
enable the FSCS to meet claims against it. The FSCS levy consists of two parts: a management expenses levy and a compensation 
levy, which includes capital and interest levies. The management expenses levy covers the costs of running the scheme and the 
compensation levy covers the amount of compensation the scheme pays, net of any recoveries it makes using the rights that have 
been assigned to it. 
The FSCS provision at 31 December 2015 of £1.1 million (31 December 2014: £1.2 million) represents the interest levy for the 2015/2016 
scheme year (31 December 2014: interest levy for the 2014/2015 scheme year).
Customer redress
The Group has a small number of loans which are regulated under the Consumer Credit Act (“CCA”) and had identified that, 
following changes to the CCA in 2008, certain letters and statements were sent to customers that did not fully comply with the 
requirements prescribed by the CCA. Accordingly, these customers were entitled to redress for interest and fees charged on the 
relevant loans as a result of this technical non-compliance, notwithstanding there is unlikely to have been any customer detriment. 
During the year ended 31 December 2014, a provision of £1.0 million was recorded in relation to CCA non-compliance. A further 
provision of £0.1 million has been recorded in the year ended 31 December 2015. Remedial payments to customers affected were all 
made during the year and accordingly there is £nil provision at 31 December 2015.
33. Debt securities in issue
Debt securities in issue are repayable from the reporting date in the ordinary course of business as follows:

from time to time, such redemptions being limited to the net capital received from mortgage customers in respect of the underlying 
assets. There is no obligation for the Group to make good any shortfall. Further disclosure relating to the underlying assets is 
contained in Note 20.

Subordinated notes 38.1 36.8
During 2012, the Group issued £40 million subordinated 12.875 per cent loan notes, repayable in 2022, with an option for the Group 
to redeem early after five years. The interest rate is fixed until May 2017 . The loan notes were issued at a discount and are carried 
in the statement of financial position at amortised cost using an EIR of 18.597 per cent. In addition to the loan notes, warrants were 
issued by the Group’s Parent Company, Aldermore Group PLC. The warrants were valued at £2.2 million, and this was treated as 
a warrant reserve within equity in accordance with the accounting policy in Note 2(f). On 9 September 2015, the warrants were 
exercised resulting in 5.5 million ordinary £0.10 shares being issued (see Note 35).  169 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015

On 13 March 2015, the Company reorganised its share capital in preparation for listing on the LSE. The restructuring can be 
summarised as follows:
• 1,025,586 A1 ordinary shares, 131,593,114 C ordinary shares and 568,253 E ordinary shares were re-designated as deferred shares
• 406,886 C ordinary shares (nominal value of £0.0999 per share) were issued and allotted to C ordinary shareholders on a pro-rata 
basis by way of bonus issue using distributable reserves, resulting in an increase of £40,648 in share capital
• Each C ordinary share with a nominal value of £0.0999 was consolidated with a C ordinary share with a nominal value of £0.0001, 
resulting in 406,886 C ordinary shares with a nominal value of £0.10 each being in issue
• The following shares were re-designated as ordinary shares: 34,668,414 A1 ordinary shares, 58,704,268 A2 ordinary shares, 
3,854,632 B ordinary shares, 406,886 C ordinary shares, 54,405,224 D ordinary shares, and 84,016,023 E ordinary shares
• 63,944,554 ordinary shares were issued and allotted on a pro-rata basis to all shareholders (excluding holders of deferred shares) 
by way of bonus issue using distributable reserves, resulting in an increase of £6,394,455 in share capital
• The Company bought back 133,186,953 deferred shares for an aggregate price of £1 using distributable reserves. This resulted in 
the creation of a capital redemption reserve of £172,543 and a reduction in the Company’s share capital of the same amount
Following the reorganisation, 117 ,934,783 ordinary shares of £0.10 each were issued in the IPO at a price of £1.92 per share. Of the 
117 ,934,783 shares in the offer, 78,872,283 were sold by existing shareholders, with the remaining 39,062,500 being issued by the 
Company, resulting in an increase in share capital of £3,906,250 and share premium account of £71,093,750 (excluding costs).
Ordinary shares have full voting rights, dividend rights and distribution rights in the event of sale or wind up.
At 13 March 2015, after completion of the IPO, there were 339,062,500 shares in circulation.
Following the listing, the Company granted 174,920 shares to eligible employees as free share awards under the Share Incentive 
Plan (“SIP”). Further details regarding the SIP are provided in Note 36. The shares vested on 17 April 2015, resulting in an increase of 
£17 ,492 in share capital and a reduction in retained earnings of the same amount.
On 9 September 2015, the share warrants attached to the subordinated notes (see Note 2(f)) were exercised resulting in the issue 
of 3,668,110 ordinary £0.10 shares at a price of £0.89 per share and 1,834,054 ordinary £0.10 shares at a price of £1.23 per share. 
The aggregate nominal value of the shares issued was £550,216.40, whilst the total consideration was £5,520,504.32. The shares 
were issued to Centerbridge Credit Partners L.P ., Centerbridge Credit Partners TE Intermediate I, L.P ., Centerbridge Special Credit 
Partners AIV III, L.P ., and Centerbridge Special Credit Partners II, L.P . The mid-market closing price of the Company’s shares on 
9 September 2015, the date that the share warrants were exercised, was £2.93. The share issue resulted in an increase in share 
capital of £550,216 and share premium account of £4,970,288. The warrant reserve of £2,200,000 was transferred within equity to 
retained earnings.
At 31 December 2015, there were 344,739,584 ordinary £0.10 shares in circulation resulting in share capital of £34,473,958. Financial statements

Further details of each of the schemes are provided below.
a) Performance Share Plan
The Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) is open to senior employees including the Executive team. The grant date of awards was 
2 March 2015, with individuals being required to remain in employment until 2 March 2018. The awards are subject to a two-year 
holding period which ends on 2 March 2020 and are exercisable between that date and 1 March 2025.
Awards under the PSP are subject to performance conditions. Performance conditions are set by the Remuneration Committee each 
time awards are granted and determine the extent to which awards can become available to individuals. 
The performance conditions for these first awards relate to the growth in Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) for the period to 
31 December 2017 , measured from the date of admission to the LSE (13 March 2015) for 50 per cent of each award and Earnings Per 
Share (“EPS”) performance for the year ended 31 December 2017 for the remaining 50 per cent of each award. The outcome of the 
performance conditions, as assessed by the Remuneration Committee, will determine the vesting outcome of the awards and the 
shares available for exercise.
In addition, there are “underpin” performance conditions which must be met, including in relation to the TSR element of the award. 
The value of the TSR achieved, over the performance period, must be equal to or greater than the TSR of the median company of 
FTSE 350 companies, excluding Investment Trusts.
b) Pre-IPO award under the PSP
The Pre-IPO awards were granted to individuals, as a one-off reward to those who contributed significantly to the development of 
the Group in the build-up to its IPO. The awards were granted to a number of senior employees, including the Executive team. 
The grant date of the awards was 2 March 2015. The awards are subject to performance conditions which must be satisfied in order 
for individuals to be entitled to receive the shares awarded. If the performance conditions are achieved the awards will vest on 
31 December 2016.
The performance conditions relate to growth in TSR for the period to 31 December 2016, measured from the date of admission 
to the LSE (13 March 2015). The outcome of the performance conditions determine the extent to which shares awarded become 
available to individual participants. Similar “underpin” performance conditions apply to the awards as those in the PSP (see a) above), 
including the TSR condition based on the median of FTSE 350 companies excluding Investment Trusts.
c) Restricted Share Plan
The Restricted Share Plan (“RSP”) is open to a small number of senior employees engaged in risk functions. The grant date of awards 
was 2 March 2015, with individuals being required to remain in employment until 2 March 2018. The awards are subject to a two-year 
holding period which ends on 2 March 2020 and are exercisable between that date and 1 March 2025.
There are no financial performance conditions attached to the awards under the RSP . 171 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Strategic report Corporate governance Remuneration Risk management Financial statements Appendices
d) Share Incentive Plan
All employees are eligible to participate in the Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”). An award of “free shares” was granted under the 
SIP on 17 April 2015. Each eligible employee received shares worth £200, with an additional £200 for each year of service up to a 
maximum award of £1,000. The shares are subject to a minimum holding period of the shorter of three years from their award date 
or the date to when the employee ceases to be employed. There are no performance conditions associated with the share awards. 
Participants in the SIP are the beneficial owners of the shares granted to them, but not the registered owner. Voting rights over the 
shares are normally exercised by the registered owner at the direction of the participant.
e) Sharesave Plan
All employees are eligible to participate in the Sharesave Plan. The grant date of the awards was 29 October 2015, with individuals in 
the Plan contributing a set amount each month for three years, commencing in January 2016. At the end of the contribution period 
there is the option to buy shares in Aldermore Group PLC at an option price of £2.52, which was fixed at the grant date.
There are no financial performance conditions attached to the awards but the options are subject to service conditions based on 
employment and whether the employee continues to contribute to the Plan. Employees have the option but not the obligation to 
buy shares depending upon the share price at the end of the Plan. There are no holding conditions at the end of the Plan.
f) Deferred Share Plan
The Deferred Share Plan (“DSP”) is open to senior employees including the Executive team and represents the portion of the Annual 
Incentive Plan that is deferred to align the interests of senior employees and the Executive team with shareholders. Shares within 
the DSP may accrue dividend equivalents which may be settled in shares or cash equivalents. The awards are typically released in 
tranches of one-third on the first, second and third anniversary of the award, subject to continued employment.
There are no financial performance conditions attached to the awards under the DSP . Share awards for the deferred element of the 
2015 bonuses will be granted under this scheme in 2016. Shares worth £1.2 million are expected to be granted. Awards under the 
DSP are accounted for as equity settled share-based payments.

The B, C and E ordinary shares granted to employees in previous periods were included in the reorganisation of the Company’s 
share capital which took place on 13 March 2015 in preparation for the Company’s listing on the LSE. Of the 132 million C ordinary 
shares granted to employees, 113,593,114 were converted to deferred shares, on 13 March 2015, which the Company repurchased for 
total consideration of £1 and the remaining C shares were converted into ordinary shares on the same date.
As the awards under the DSP have yet to be granted, it is not possible to provide details of the specific number of awards granted. 
A charge of £1.2 million has been recorded in the 2015 income statement.
Determination of grant date fair values
Share awards
Share awards are not entitled to dividends until the awards vest, but the number of shares subject to vested PSP and RSP awards may 
be increased to reflect the value of dividends that would have been paid up to the end of the holding period for the awards. This is 
designed to deliver a benefit similar to that which ordinary shareholders may receive in respect of any dividends paid during the 
vesting period. Accordingly, the grant date fair value of the awards with no performance conditions other than service conditions has 
been taken as the market value of the Company’s ordinary shares at the grant date. Financial statements
172 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
36. Share-based payments continued
In respect of awards for which there are non-market performance conditions (e.g. EPS), the grant date fair value per award has been 
taken as the market value of an ordinary share at the grant date. A forecast is made of the number of awards expected to vest in 
order to determine the overall share-based payment charge to be recognised over the vesting period.
In respect of awards for which there are market performance conditions (e.g. TSR), the grant date fair value of each award is required 
to reflect the likelihood of achieving the market conditions within the valuation. For the awards concerned, the grant date fair values 
for each award were determined using stochastic simulation models with the following significant inputs:
Pre-IPO PSP
Ordinary share price £1.92 £1.92
Risk free rate 0.59% p.a. 0.90% p.a.

Share options (Sharesave Plan)
Options granted under the Sharesave Plan have no entitlement to dividends until they are exercised. The grant date fair value of the 
options were determined using a Black Scholes valuation model with the following significant inputs:

Exercise price £2.52
Risk free rate 0.89% p.a.

Expected life 3.25 years

 Based on Aldermore Group PLC share price volatility, from the date of listing (13 March 2015) to the grant date, measured on an annualised basis.
The overall share-based payment charge for the year ended 31 December 2015 totalled £3.4 million (31 December 2014: £0.6 million).
37. Contingent convertible securities
On 9 December 2014, the Company issued £75 million Fixed Rate Reset Additional Tier 1 Perpetual Subordinated Contingent 
Convertible Securities (the “Securities”). Net proceeds arising from the issuance, after deducting issuance costs and the associated 
tax credit totalled £74.0 million.
The Securities are perpetual and have no fixed redemption date. Redemption of the Securities is at the option of the Company on 
30 April 2020 and annually thereafter. The Securities bear interest at an initial rate of 11.875 per cent per annum until 30 April 2020 
and thereafter at the relevant Reset Interest Rate as provided in the Information Memorandum. Interest is payable on the Securities 
annually in arrears on each interest payment date commencing 30 April 2015 and is non-cumulative. The Borrower has the full 
discretion to cancel any interest scheduled to be paid on the Securities.
The Securities are convertible into ordinary shares of the Company in the event of the Group’s Common Equity Tier 1 ratio falling 
below 7 per cent.
As the Securities contain no obligation on the Company to make payments of principal or interest, they have been classified as 
equity instruments as required by IAS 32. Accordingly, the Securities have been included in equity at the fair value of the proceeds 
received less any direct costs attributable to the issue of the Securities, net of tax relief thereon. Any interest paid on the Securities, 
net of tax relief thereon, is a distribution to holders of equity instruments and has been recognised directly in equity on the payment 
date. Although there are number of additional terms relating to events such as acquisition and wind up, there are no circumstances 
in which the Group has an unavoidable obligation to issue a variable number of its own shares.
The Group has not separated any embedded derivative features because the Group has an accounting policy not to separate a 
feature that has already been considered in determining that the entire issue is a non-derivative equity instrument. 173 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015

Legislation
As a financial services Group, Aldermore Group PLC is subject to extensive and comprehensive regulation. The Group must 
comply with numerous laws and regulations, which significantly affect the way it does business. Whilst the Group believes there 
are no unidentified areas of failure to comply with these laws and regulations which would have a material impact on the financial 
statements, there can be no guarantee that all issues have been identified. 175 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015

a) Controlling parties
The Group was previously controlled by AnaCap Financial Partners, II L.P . (52.3 per cent. of voting rights) and AnaCap Financial 
Partners, L.P . (47 .7 per cent. of voting rights) who were the sole voting shareholders of Aldermore Group PLC. 
On 13 March 2015, the Company was admitted to the LSE, offering 117 ,934,783 ordinary shares, of which 78,872,283 shares were sold 
by the Selling shareholders. Upon admission, AnaCap Financial Partners L.P ., AnaCap Financial Partners II L.P ., AnaCap Derby Co-
Investment (No.1.) L.P . and
 
AnaCap Derby Co-Investment (No.2.) (collectively “the Principal Shareholders”) and the Company entered 
into the “Relationship agreement” . Details of the Relationship agreement were provided within the Prospectus issued prior to the 
admission to the LSE.
On 15 September 2015 the Principal Shareholders sold 40,885,613 Ordinary £0.10 shares on the open market.
At 31 December 2015, AnaCap Financial Partners L.P ., AnaCap Financial Partners II L.P ., AnaCap Derby Co-Investment (No.1.) L.P . 
and AnaCap Derby Co-Investment (No.2.) L.P held 11.26 per cent, 11.01 per cent, 9.54 per cent and 8.33 per cent of the Company’s 
ordinary share capital respectively. Although Anacap is no longer a controlling party for the Group it continues to have significant 
influence and is therefore considered to be a related party.
The Group had agreements in place with Syscap Limited (“Syscap”) at the start of the year. Syscap were previously under the control 
of Anacap Financial Partners II L.P . and AnaCap Financial Partners, L.P . Syscap ceased to be a related party when Anacap sold their 
interest on 20 February 2015. During the year the following agreements were in place between the Group and Syscap:
• The Group provides £5 million of block discounting facilities to Syscap Limited, a provider of business finance solutions. 
The facilities are secured by underlying receivables of short-term loans, primarily to solicitors’ practices which are funded at a 
discount to the face value of the loans. The facilities contain appropriate conditions relating to performance, non-performing deal 
substitution rights and default provisions in line with the Group’s standard commercial policies. Pricing on the facilities is subject to 
normal commercial terms
• Until 20 February 2015 Syscap introduced business of £9.6 million (year ended 31 December 2014: £21.9 million) and received 
commission of £0.1 million (year ended 31 December 2014: £0.4 million) of which £nil was outstanding as at 20 February 2015 
(31 December 2014: £nil) 
In addition, Anacap charged the Group investment monitoring fees of £29,000 for the year ended 31 December 2015 (year ended 
31 December 2014: £0.2 million). The balance outstanding at 31 December 2015 is £nil (31 December 2014: £0.1 million).
During 2015, the Group also incurred fees of £0.1 million in relation to the Shareholder-representative Directors (year ended 
31 December 2014: £nil).

Share-Based Payments (“SBP”)
As at 31 December 2014, certain KMP held a number of shares in the B, C and E classes. In preparation for the IPO, the rights to these 
shares were varied and the holdings re-designated.
 
A number of KMP were awarded shares in the Company under new share incentive plans created upon IPO. In total, KMP were 
granted awards over 5,938,906 shares. Further details of the share schemes, including performance conditions are provided 
in Note 36. In addition, a number of KMP participated in the Sharesave Plan, holding options over a total of 17 ,855 shares at 
31 December 2015. 
The aggregate value of transactions and outstanding balances related to KMP (as defined by IAS 24 “Related Party Disclosure”) were 
as follows:

At 31 December 2015 there are two loans with KMP for the value of £0.1 million (31 December 2014: four loans, £0.2 million). 
From 1 January 2015 until admission to the LSE a number of KMP had loans with the Company. Upon admission the Company 
forgave loans totalling £0.2 million. A number of KMP continue to have loans and deposits in the ordinary course of business with 
the Group. 
During 2014 and up to Admission, interest rates charged on loan balances outstanding from related parties were lower than the 
rates that would be charged in arm’s length transactions. Interest was charged on these loans at an annual rate of 0.8 per cent above 
1 month LIBOR. 
All deposit arrangements have been operated by the Group on commercial terms and conditions. 177 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015

 During the year the methodology used to calculate the fair value of loans and advances to customers has been enhanced based on more granular discounted cash flow calculations. 
Accordingly, the 31 December 2014 comparatives have been represented on this basis. 179 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Strategic report Corporate governance Remuneration Risk management Financial statements Appendices
Key considerations in the calculation of the disclosed fair values for those financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost 
include the following:
a) Cash and balances at central banks 
These represent amounts with an initial maturity of less than three months and as such their carrying value is considered a reasonable 
approximation of their fair value.
b) Loans and advances to banks
These represent either amounts with an initial maturity of less than three months or longer term variable rate deposits placed with 
banks, where adjustments to fair value in respect of the credit risk of the counterparty are not considered necessary. Accordingly the 
carrying value of the assets is considered to be not materially different from their fair value.
c) Loans and advances to customers
For fixed rate lending products the Group has estimated the fair value of the fixed rate interest cash flows by discounting those cash 
flows by the current appropriate market reference rate used for pricing equivalent products plus the credit spread attributable to 
the borrower. For standard variable rate lending products, and fixed rate products when they revert to the Group’s standard variable 
rate, the interest rate on such products is considered equivalent to a current market product rate and as such the Group considers 
the discounted future cash flows of these mortgages to be equal to their carrying value. The fair value estimations do not incorporate 
adjustments for changes in future credit risk, since loans were granted, however, incurred loss provisions are deducted from the fair 
value amounts.
d) Other assets and liabilities
These represent short-term receivables and payables and as such their carrying value is not considered to be materially different 
from their fair value.
e) Amounts due to banks
These mainly represent securities sold under agreements to repurchase which were drawn down from the Bank of England under the 
terms of the Funding for Lending Scheme. These transactions are collateralised by UK Government Treasury Bills, which have a low 
susceptibility to credit risk, so adjustments to fair value in respect of the credit risk of the counterparty are not considered necessary. 
Accordingly the carrying value of the liabilities are not considered to be materially different from their fair value.
f) Customers’ accounts
The fair value of fixed rate customers’ accounts have been determined by discounting estimated future cash flows based on rates 
currently offered by the Group for equivalent deposits. Customers’ accounts at variable rates are at current market rates and 
therefore the Group regards the fair value to be equal to the carrying value. The estimated fair value of deposits with no stated 
maturity is the amount repayable on demand.
g) Debt securities in issue 
As the securities are actively traded in a recognised market, with readily available and quoted prices, these have been used to value 
the securities. These securities are therefore regarded as having Level 1 fair values. 
h) Subordinated notes
The estimated fair value of the subordinated notes is based on discounted cash flows using interest rates for similar liabilities with 
the same remaining maturity, credit ranking and rating. The calculated fair value takes no account of the warrants issued separately 
to the holders of the subordinated notes, which have been separately accounted for as a capital contribution within equity on issue. 
The warrants were exercised during September 2015 (see Note 35). Financial statements

Level 1: Fair value determined using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2:  Fair value determined using directly or indirectly observable inputs other than unadjusted quoted prices included within 
Level 1 that are observable.
Level 3: Fair value determined using one or more significant inputs that are not based on observable market data.
The fair values of UK Gilts, Supranational bonds, Corporate bonds and Covered bonds are based on quoted bid prices in 
active markets.
The fair value of asset backed securities are based on indicative prices provided by market counterparties, but before relying on 
these prices, the Group has obtained an understanding of how the prices were derived to ensure that each investment is assigned an 
appropriate classification within the fair value hierarchy.
The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities are determined using widely recognised valuation methods for determining the fair 
values of common derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps that used only observable market data that require 
little management judgement and estimation. Credit value and debit value adjustments have not been applied as the derivative 
assets and liabilities are largely collateralised.
Fair value measurement – financial assets and liabilities held at amortised cost
All the fair values of financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost are considered to be Level 2 valuations which are 
determined using directly or indirectly observable inputs other than unadjusted quoted prices, except for debt securities in issue 
which are Level 1 and loans and advances to customers which are Level 3.  181 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015

Fair value of transferred assets and associated liabilities
Securitisation vehicle
The sale of the beneficial ownership of the loans and advances to customers to the securitisation vehicle by the Bank fail the 
derecognition criteria, and consequently, these loans remain on the statement of financial position of the Group. The Bank therefore 
recognises a deemed loan financial liability on its statement of financial position and an equivalent deemed loan asset is held on the 
securitisation vehicle’s statement of financial position. As the securitisation vehicle is consolidated into the Group with the Bank the 
deemed loans net out in the consolidated accounts. The deemed loans are repaid as and when principal repayments are made by 
customers against these transferred loans and advances.
The securitisation vehicle has issued fixed and floating rate notes which are secured on loans and advances to customers. The notes 
are redeemable in part from time to time, such redemptions being limited to the net capital received from mortgagors in respect of 
the underlying assets.
The Group retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. The Group benefits to the extent to which surplus income 
generated by the transferred mortgage portfolios exceeds the administration costs of these mortgages. The Group continues to 
bear the credit risk of these mortgage assets.
The results of the securitisation vehicle listed in Note 23 are consolidated into the results of the Group. The table below shows the 
carrying value and fair value of the assets transferred to the securitisation vehicle and its associated liabilities. The carrying value 
presented below are the carrying amounts recorded in the Group accounts. Some of the notes issued by the securitisation vehicle 
are held by the Group and as such are not shown in the consolidated statement of financial position of the Group.

Share fraud – warning 
to shareholders
In recent years, a number of other 
companies have become aware that their 
shareholders have received unsolicited 
phone calls or correspondence 
concerning investment matters. These are 
typically from overseas based “brokers” 
who target UK shareholders, offering 
to sell them what often turn out to be 
worthless or high-risk shares in US or 
UK investments. These operations are 
commonly known as “boiler rooms” . 
These “brokers” can be very persistent 
and extremely persuasive. We are not 
aware of any Aldermore Group investors 
having been targeted, but we would urge 
you to remain vigilant.
It is not just the novice investor that has 
been duped in this way; many of the 
victims had been successfully investing 
for several years. 5,000 people contact 
the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) 
about share fraud each year, with victims 
losing an average of £20,000
If you do not know the source of a call, 
check the details through the FCA 
website, www.fca.org.uk, and if you have 
any specific information, report it to the 
FCA using the Consumer Helpline (0800 
111 6768) or the online reporting form at 
www.fca.org.uk/scams
If you have any concerns whatsoever, do 
not take any action and do not part with 
any money without being certain that:
• You fully understand the transaction
• You know who you are dealing with 
and that they are registered with and 
authorised by the FCA

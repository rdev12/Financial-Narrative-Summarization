Meggitt’s 2013 results continued to demonstrate the breadth and 
resilience of its portfolio. Our equipment is installed on over 
60,000 aircraft worldwide—a growing fleet—with a stable 
aftermarket revenue stream stretching out for many decades. 
Our excellent win rate on the many new aircraft programmes 
entering service, which drove our investment in research and 
development of £134.9m (8.2% of revenue), gives us confidence in 
making further good progress in the years to come.

MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 3 Chairman’s statement
Oxford University’s Said Business School. 
The Meggitt Production System, the 
Group’s wide-ranging continuous 
improvement initiative, embodies a faculty 
of operational excellence for the large 
number of employees touched by it. 
As a leading employer of engineers and 
manufacturing experts, we are naturally 
committed to maintaining the industry 
pipeline of expertise. This will undoubtedly 
be stimulated by the opportunities arising 
from the UK government’s commitment to 
co-funding investment in the aerospace 
and defence industry. As a business we  
are picking up the baton, developing  
young talent, sponsoring students with 
engineering aspirations through the 
Arkwright Scholarship Trust. In turn,  
they are benefiting from mentoring by 
engineering graduates from our own 
highly successful international graduate 
development programme in which we take 
care to engage bright minds early in very 
challenging engineering projects. 
We are also enhancing the professional 
development of established Meggitt 
engineers. As an integrated Group, 
careers can now develop beyond business 
units and divisions; we have entered into  
a partnership with the Institution of 
Mechanical Engineers to provide 
continuous training, management and 
leadership development; and we are taking 
care of our subject matter experts, 
ensuring that those who wish to remain 
expert in their fields have career paths as 
promising as those who move into 
management roles. This includes plans  
for a Technical Fellowship programme  
to reward those at the pinnacle of 
achievement in their chosen field.
Doing business the right way
We have grown Meggitt with great 
determination, based on clear-cut 
principles and practice. There is zero 
tolerance for anything other than the fair 
and impartial conduct of business that is 
fully compliant with applicable laws and 
regulations worldwide and integrity in 
every business relationship. 
Meggitt was one of the first companies  
to commit to comprehensive integrity 
policies, programmes and practice within 
its aerospace and defence business 
operations when we signed a Statement  
of Adherence to the Global Principles of 
Business Ethics for the Aerospace and 
Defense Industry. As Chairman of the 
Group’s Ethics and Trade Compliance 
Committee, I am proud to say our 
programmes lead the industry.
Board of directors
In May, Meggitt Group Finance Director 
Stephen Young succeeded Terry Twigger 
as Chief Executive. Terry spent 12 years—
nine with Stephen—quadrupling Group 
revenue and increasing profitability 
fivefold. Doug Webb, who succeeds 
Stephen, has held senior financial 
positions across a broad range of 
industries. Before joining Meggitt, Doug 
was Chief Financial Officer of London 
Stock Exchange Group plc. 
David Robins will be retiring from the 
Board following the AGM on 7 May 2014 
after 12 years of service as a non-
executive director, during which time  
he acted as Senior Independent Director 
and Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee.
Looking ahead
Meggitt delivered a creditable set of 
results in 2013 despite some operational 
challenges and weakness in some 
markets, most notably the highly profitable 
civil aftermarket. 
Sequestration of US defence funding 
continues to generate uncertainty. 
However, our flexible manufacturing base 
enables us to redirect activity where 
demand remains strong, while retrofit, 
upgrade and outsourcing opportunities 
continue for Meggitt, as in the past, from 
greater utilisation and extension of 
existing programmes.
We look forward to making further 
progress in 2014 and beyond, driven by a 
highly resourceful workforce, underpinned 
by a resilient installed base of equipment, 
highly cash-generative business model 
and robust balance sheet. 
Sir Colin Terry Chairman
It is more than a decade since I joined 
Meggitt as a non-executive director, 
becoming Chairman in 2004. Since then, 
the Group has become progressively 
integrated, revenue has increased 
threefold and employee numbers have 
doubled. We have enjoyed growth 
organically and by acquisition, which has 
brought new capabilities and reinforced 
Meggitt’s smart engineering for extreme 
environments. 
Investing for growth
Meggitt continues to expand its market 
positions and capabilities through 
investment in research and development, 
facilities and, most important of all, its 
people. They are the backbone of our 
business and I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank them for their hard 
work in a challenging year. 
We benefit from a talented workforce 
across all disciplines, which we build on 
with Group-wide career opportunities and 
training at all levels. We place special 
emphasis on leadership development—
executive influencing, training in vital 
front-line supervision, plus strategy 
development work for future Meggitt 
leaders within programmes tailored by 
We have grown Meggitt with 
great determination, based on 
clear-cut principles and 
practice—the fair and impartial 
conduct of business that is 
fully compliant with applicable 
laws and regulations 
worldwide and integrity in 
every business relationship.

MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013
Chief Executive’s review
We have emerged from an 
intensive bid cycle resulting  
in technology sales into a 
significant number of new 
aircraft programmes, many 
involve a full suite of Meggitt 
capabilities, exceeding the 
shipset content of their 
predecessors. This is a very 
strong indicator of future 
revenue growth. 
Group strategy
In my first Annual Report and Accounts 
since becoming Meggitt’s Chief Executive, 
I am delighted to reaffirm my 
commitment to the strategy I was integral 
in developing since joining the Group as 
Finance Director in 2004. 
Meggitt’s strategy comprises four 
elements.
 Delivering innovation
We focus on highly-engineered 
components and sub-systems capable  
of withstanding increasingly harsh 
environments, such as in the next-
generation aero-engines. Our products 
must operate in extremes of pressure, 
temperature, impact, vibration and 
contamination in applications where 
certification requirements are 
demanding. 
We invest in manufacturing technologies 
such as automation and additive 
manufacturing, targeting product 
technology investment in areas where we 
see the greatest growth potential. Our 
power business, for example, continues to 
provide more electric solutions for our 
customers and we are embedding this 
capability increasingly across a broad 
range of Meggitt products. 
At the same time, we seek to leverage 
shipset content by combining the Group’s 
capabilities. Most recently, we deployed 
our sensing systems in tyre pressure 
monitoring for brake control systems and 
integrated polymers and composites with 
fluid control technology valves to create 
complete airborne fuel systems.
We supplement organic* growth with 
targeted acquisitions, increasing our 
range of capabilities and improving our 
market position.
  Securing positions on new 
platforms
Our leading-edge capabilities, intellectual 
property and longstanding track record of 
delivering reliable products, enable us  
to secure strong positions on new 
programmes, including the recently 
announced wheels and brakes contract 
on the Dassault 5X long-range business 
jet.
Because our products span multiple 
platforms across civil aerospace, military 
and energy markets, we are not 
dependent on single programmes, 
customers, regions or segments. 
We target specialist applications within 
these markets, generating revenue from 
original equipment and maintenance, 
overhaul, spares and repair services for 
the life of programmes, which can last  
for decades. 
Our customers’ technology roadmaps 
guide our investments. This is 
underpinned by rigorous product 
development, programme management, 
increased manufacturing capacity and 
regional support for original equipment 
manufacturers and their operators. 
We have longstanding relationships with 
major customers. Whether creating a 
critical component or sub-system for an 
aircraft engine or a heat exchanger for a 
floating offshore gas storage and 
processing vessel, we work together at 
the start of design phases to ensure 
demonstrable early-stage solutions.
  A c h i e v i n g o p er a ti o n a l 
excellence
Because superior performance on quality, 
cost and delivery are the building blocks 
of future growth, we are intensifying our 
investment in facilities, production 
systems, programme management  
and people. 
* Organic excludes the effect of acquisitions, 
disposals and foreign exchange. 5
MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013
 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION GOVERNANCE REPORTS
During 2013, we consolidated six factories 
into three larger, more efficient facilities. 
We moved a further two businesses to 
new, expanded sites to meet growth 
requirements. We also launched the 
Meggitt Production System (MPS) at 16 of 
our facilities, with a further 16 scheduled 
for 2014 and the remainder during 2015. 
MPS—our single, global approach to 
continuous improvement—will create the 
sustainable delivery and quality culture 
that confers competitive advantage 
beyond our technological expertise. It 
reinforces our commitment to developing 
our people and doing business the right 
way, further strengthening our customer 
partnerships. At the same time, Meggitt 
will become more cost-competitive. We 
will reduce working capital. We will 
reduce the cost of poor quality and, as 
MPS requires close relationships with 
suppliers who share our management 
standards and continuous improvement 
philosophy, our supply chain will become 
leaner and more effective. We have 
already seen significant operational 
improvements, with on-time delivery up 
by 10% and defective parts per million 
(our key performance indicator for 
quality) down by 54%.
  P r o v i d i ng t h r o ug h -l if e  
product support 
Once selected on a new platform, Meggitt 
often becomes the sole source for a given 
component for the life of the programme. 
Our equipment typically operates in harsh 
environments, generating a regular 
requirement for spares and repairs. This 
produces an annuity-like income stream 
over the life of the programme—often 
several decades.
We continue to invest in our product 
support capability. In 2013, we opened our 
new repair and overhaul centre in 
Singapore, doubling our capacity and 
introducing more Meggitt product lines, 
and launched a major review of the best 
way to deploy Meggitt’s growing 
aftermarket capability to our global 
customer base.
After the bid cycle
We have emerged from an intensive bid 
cycle resulting in technology sales into a 
significant number of new aircraft 
programmes, many involve a full suite of 
Meggitt capabilities, exceeding the 
shipset content of their predecessors. 
This is a very strong indicator of future 
revenue growth.
This accounts for R & D spend in 2013 
which, at 8.2% of revenue, was at a record 
level as we convert these new contracts 
into sustainable revenue streams. 
We are now moving into a major execution 
phase, which requires us to deliver new 
programmes on time and to specification 
and to meet new, tougher requirements in 
terms of quality, cost and delivery. The 
necessary improvement in operational 
performance will be supported by MPS  
and the recent appointment of a Chief 
Operating Officer. 
Performance in 2013
Revenue growth in 2013 was weaker than 
anticipated a year ago. This was due, 
mainly, to currency movements, a slower 
than expected recovery in civil aftermarket 
revenue and uncertainties around defence 
spending, particularly in the US. Supply 
chain and operational issues, while now 
under control, had an impact on revenues 
and costs in the second half, offset by good 
progress made in resolving legacy 
contract issues. Against this challenging 
background, total revenue rose 2% in the 
year (organic: +1%) with underlying 
earnings per share up 3% to 37.5p. Net 
debt decreased further to 564.6m (2012: 
642.5m) and net debt to EBITDA reduced to 
1.2x (2012: 1.3x). The recommended final 
dividend of 8.80p per share (2012: 8.20p) 
takes the full year dividend to 12.75p (2012: 
11.80p), an increase of 8%. 
Outlook
The outlook for our civil markets remains 
good, with further growth in aircraft 
deliveries anticipated in 2014 and beyond. 
During the latter half of 2013, air traffic 
growth accelerated to above the long term 
trend rate of 5% and we believe that the 
destocking seen over the last couple of 
years is coming to an end. We therefore 
maintain our view that civil original 
equipment and aftermarket revenues will 
grow at an average of 7 to 8% and 8 to 9% 
respectively, both on an organic basis, over 
the medium term. Aftermarket revenue 
will likely grow at less than this rate in 
2014 as the gradual recovery continues.
We anticipate a modest decline in military 
revenue in 2014, reflecting the substantial 
completion of the Bradley fighting vehicle 
and KC135 fuel tank retrofit contracts. 
Looking further ahead, uncertainty around 
military budgets, notably in the US, 
persists. As such, while we remain 
confident in delivering an average 
compound organic revenue growth rate of 
2% in our military markets over the 
medium term, this will be subject to 
modest reductions if sequestration 
impacts future budget cycles as initially 
envisaged. 
Energy, driven by continued strong 
demand for our printed circuit heat 
exchangers and new product introductions 
in the condition-monitoring market, should 
deliver organic revenue growth averaging 
greater than 10% over the medium term. 
Other markets should continue to see 
modest growth.
On this basis, we expect to make further 
good progress by delivering mid-single 
digit organic revenue growth in 2014, 
weighted towards the second half, and 6 to 
7% average organic revenue growth in the 
medium term.

Meggitt benefits from a balanced portfolio. Capability-based 
business units deploy technological know-how and intellectual 
property across all our markets so we are not dependent on single 
customers, individual programmes or market segments.
Investment cycle
We develop technology for applications involving product life-cycles 
measured in decades. Products must perform without fail in 
environmental extremes, requiring regular replacement or overhaul, 
generating strong returns from our initial investment over many years.
Our business model requires significant cash investment in the 
development phase of programmes and, for our wheels and brakes 
business, the production phase also. We then make strong positive 
cashflow in the in-service phase resulting in cash breakeven 
typically between years 11 and 18.
As our products are developed in line with our customers’ 
technology goals, we have performed strongly in the recent bid 
cycle, securing positions on key platforms and refreshing the 
long-term aftermarket pipeline. 
Our near-term business is weighted therefore towards investment 
in new development programmes, the source of sustainable growth 
over the long term.

Civil aerospace
Civil aerospace accounts for 45% of Group 
revenue, with products and sub-systems 
installed on almost every jet airliner, 
regional aircraft and business jet in 
service. The global fleet of civil aircraft on 
which Meggitt has content continues to 
grow, totalling over 41,000 aircraft today.
New aircraft deliveries drive sales of 
original equipment, and aircraft utilisation 
generates demand for spare parts and 
repairs over many decades. 
Original equipment
Aircraft deliveries encompass large jets 
(>100 seats), regional aircraft (<100 seats) 
and business jets. 
Large jet deliveries in 2013 stood at a 
record 1,279, 8% higher than in 2012. 
Continued growth is underpinned by an 
order book at the two major civil aircraft 
manufacturers, Boeing and Airbus, 
stretching out for seven years at current 
production levels, bolstered by new 
aircraft manufacturers investing in the 
large jet market including Bombardier, 
Sukhoi and COMAC. The high level of 
demand for new aircraft deliveries is 
driven primarily by high oil prices, the 
relatively low cost of debt and the wave of 
newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft coming 
to market including Boeing’s 787 and 
737MAX and Airbus’ A350XWB and 
A320neo.
Regional aircraft deliveries of 263 
represented an 11% increase on 2012, with 
growth driven by 70-plus seat aircraft. 
Growth looks set to continue over the 
medium term, mirroring the growing 
internationalisation of the regional aircraft 
fleet beyond the US. 
Business jet deliveries totalled 637, an 8% 
decrease on 2012. Deliveries are still 50% 
below the peak of 2008. However, 
inventories are continuing to decline and 
corporate profitability, historically a good 
driver of business jet demand, is forecast 
to rise in the coming years. As with 
regional aircraft, the fleet is becoming 
more global—customers in the Americas 
comprise 76% of the global business jet 
fleet but order trends suggest this will 
move to less than 60% over the next 
decade. Over the medium term, we see 
deliveries continuing to recover, driven by 
an improved economic growth outlook in 
developed economies and the large 
number of new aircraft models.
Meggitt’s principal markets, civil aerospace 
(45% of revenue), military (38%) and energy 
(11%), are characterised by long life-cycles  
and the requirement for smart engineering  
for extreme environments. This capability 
ranges from thermal management, condition 
monitoring and wheel, brake and brake control 
systems to high-integrity electronics and fire 
protection systems. Some of these capabilities 
have applications beyond our core markets, 
making up the remaining 6% of Group revenues.

Meggitt performance
Meggitt’s original equipment (OE) revenue  
grew organically by 11% in 2013. Large jet 
deliveries drive the majority of our OE 
revenues, involving the supply of products 
and sub-systems on engines and airframes 
across thermal and fluid control, fire 
protection, condition-monitoring and 
high-integrity electronics. Our largest 
exposure to regional aircraft and business 
jets is through our wheels and brakes 
business, which provides most original 
equipment free of charge to civil aircraft 
manufacturers. The strong OE performance 
is also driven in part by our high shipset 
values on new aircraft programmes, with  
order books and delivery forecasts for these 
programmes giving us confidence in future 
growth prospects with a medium term 
growth target of 7-8% per annum. 
Aftermarket
The civil aerospace aftermarket is driven 
primarily by aircraft utilisation which, in 
the case of large jets and regional aircraft, 
is measured using available seat 
kilometres (ASKs). We use take-offs and 
landings as a proxy for business jet 
performance. 
ASKs in the commercial aircraft fleet grew 
modestly in the first half of 2013, 
accelerating to give a full-year growth 
number of 4.5%, close to the 5% long term 
average. The Middle East and Africa saw 
particularly strong growth, with the US 
market showing a steady recovery. 
Regional aircraft utilisation picked up 
noticeably, driven by the recovery in North 
America. Business jet utilisation in the  
US and Europe continued to exhibit the 
gradual improvement seen for the last two 
years, with take-offs and landings in 2013 
up 1% versus 2012. We would normally 
expect our aftermarket revenues to follow 
these leading indicators after a lag of a  
few months.
Meggitt performance
Meggitt's organic aftermarket revenue was 
flat for the year, but up 3% in the fourth 
quarter, which is below the growth rate we 
would expect given the rise in aircraft 
utilisation over the course of the year. This 
is primarily due to a continuation of the 
destocking seen in 2012. Also, the bulk of 
ASK growth has been met by new aircraft, 
typically under warranty for three to five 
years after initial delivery, holding back 
growth in aftermarket demand. The rate of 
new aircraft deliveries has also driven a 
higher than normal rate of older aircraft 
cannibalisation and created a surplus of 
spare parts. 
Regional aircraft and business jets are 
important contributors to the Group’s 
aftermarket revenue and the recovery in 
regional aircraft utilisation in 2013 helped 
offset the effects of destocking at a 
significant large business jet customer. 
Aircraft utilisation remains very 
encouraging, with ASKs now tracking 
above the long term average. This gives us 
confidence in our medium term view of 
annual growth in aftermarket revenue of 8 
to 9%, after some of the current cyclical 
factors reduce in impact.

 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION GOVERNANCE REPORTS Market review continued 10
Military
Military accounts for 38% of Group 
revenue. Meggitt has equipment on over 
20,000 aircraft and a variety of ground 
vehicles, naval vessels and training 
installations worldwide. During 2013, 61% 
of our military revenue came from US 
customers, with 23% from Europe and 16% 
from the rest of the world. 
Defence budgets in some key markets 
were under pressure in 2013, notably in 
the US where the effect of Continuing 
Resolution plus sequestration affected 
spending levels and the timing and size of 
orders. However, European markets were 
stable and parts of the Middle East and 
Asia saw budget growth. The US defence 
budget remains constrained, although the 
Bipartisan Budget Act of December 2013 
alleviated some pressure by reducing the 
proposed cuts in 2014 and 2015 by $22 
billion and $9 billion respectively. 
Global defence spending is likely to remain 
restrained. As the operational tempo in 
Afghanistan slows down, this is likely to 
reduce equipment utilisation levels, 
limiting the demand for spare parts and 
repairs. However, opportunities remain for 
reset and upgrade of repatriated 
equipment and supplying new products as 
a significant tranche of military assets 
reaches the end of their useful lives. 
Meggitt performance
Meggitt’s military revenue declined 
organically by 3% in 2013—a very creditable 
performance given the market backdrop. 
Within this, sales to the US declined by 6%, 
sales to Europe increased by 12% and sales 
to the rest of the world increased by 4%. 
Our exposure to a broad range of fixed and 
rotary wing aircraft, ground vehicles, 
training facilities and naval vessels across 
original equipment and aftermarket 
spares and repairs, has enabled us to 
demonstrate resilience in a challenging 
environment over the last couple of years. 
We expect to continue to do so over the 
medium term. We have enjoyed 
considerable success, for example, 
securing retrofit programmes such as 
blast-proof fuel tanks for the Bradley 
fighting vehicle fleet and fuel bladders for 
the KC135 tanker aircraft. While we have 
now completed the Bradley retrofit 
contract and the KC135 contract is winding 
down, there are further opportunities for 
ground vehicle fuel tank retrofits and good 
growth in platforms on which we have 
content such as the A400M, P-8 Poseidon 
and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Accordingly, 
we are targeting 2% organic revenue 
growth in the medium term, excluding the 
impact of sequestration. 
Energy
Our energy business accounted for 11% of 
Group revenue in 2013. We target power 
generation and oil and gas markets with 
condition-monitoring hardware and 
software, control valves and printed circuit 
heat exchanger technology.
The market for condition monitoring and 
control valves has continued to grow, as 
high input costs drive operators to extract 
greater efficiency from their assets. As 
newer, more capable monitoring 
technologies come to market, operators 
will maximise their asset utilisation and 
minimise unplanned downtime by 
retrofitting new condition-monitoring 
systems onto existing plant and machinery.
The oil and gas heat transfer market 
remains robust. Exploration and production 
companies are increasingly turning to 
extraction sites which are further offshore 
and in deeper water, necessitating the 
commissioning of new equipment designed 
to operate in these increasingly harsh 
environments. These factors have resulted 
in good growth in activity for floating, 
production, storage and offload (FPSO) and 
floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) 
vessels, markets which are set to grow 
further in the coming years.
Meggitt performance
Meggitt’s energy revenue grew 5% in 2013. 
Sales to power generation customers  
were broadly flat and sales to oil and gas 
customers, principally through our Heatric 
printed circuit heat exchanger business, 
grew 11%. 
We saw good growth in our industrial 
valves business. Growth in our energy 
condition-monitoring segment was, 
however, hampered by a key raw material 
shortage and some production issues 
following the opening of our new facility  
in Southern California in October. These 
issues are now under control and we look 
forward to resuming growth in this 
business, augmented by the enhanced 
functionality of our VibroSight
®
 condition-
monitoring system which provides more 
information, better analysis and new 
decision support features to operators of 
rotating machinery.
Our Heatric business continued to grow 
nicely in 2013, with good progress made 
against the significant contract wins we 
have enjoyed in the last few years. This 
business is characterised by large, 
infrequent orders resulting in uneven 
growth. We are confident, however, that 
heightened activity levels in the FPSO and 
FLNG markets will deliver further strong 
growth over the next few years from the 
£600 million pipeline of opportunities in 
which we are actively engaged. 
Our confidence in our positioning in  
this market is reflected in our medium 
term growth target of greater than 10% 
per annum.

Over time, Meggitt believes the technology could be present in 
many of its product lines, enabling more precise use of raw 
materials, providing additional functionality and lowering 
inventory as small, complex products are printed on demand. 
For now, Meggitt is content to create a supply chain ready  
to design and certify a product for a military jet, on point to 
respond to its customers as the technology processes mature 
and customers’ own ALM strategies coalesce.
F
êted as the next disruptive technology in an ever-growing 
mound of press cuttings, Meggitt is already using 3-D 
printing (additive layer manufacturing—ALM) for 
aerospace components. To ensure the approach is not dispersed 
and shallow, the Group’s research and technology team is 
coordinating a project to ensure Meggitt’s in-house capability 
counts, creating its own powders, forging its own design 
methodology and, over the longer term, making its own 
manufacturing equipment.  
I want to build a complete valve out of 
components made through 3-D printing, 
strap it on a test engine and run it for 
4,000 hours.

MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013
 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION GOVERNANCE REPORTS
Principal risks and uncertainties
Types of risk
We categorise and monitor risk across 
strategic, operational, business 
environment and financial categories. 
• Strategic risk includes, for example, 
risks arising from making poor 
business decisions or sub-standard 
execution of business objectives.
• Operational risk covers risk in our 
business processes and programme 
risk, relating to technical, quality, 
project management or organisational 
risk.
• Business environment risk arises 
when external forces could significantly 
change the fundamentals driving our 
overall objectives and strategies.
• Financial risk encompasses key 
financial functions including the 
provision of adequate liquidity to meet 
our obligations and management of 
currency, interest rate, credit and other 
financial risks. 
Meggitt’s risk management framework includes  
a formal process for identifying, assessing and 
responding to risk to support the delivery of the 
Group’s strategy and business objectives. 
Risk management operates at all levels 
throughout Meggitt. The Board has overall 
responsibility for risk management including 
maintaining the Group’s risk governance structure 
and an appropriate internal control framework. 
Willis Risk Advisory Services have been appointed 
to assist with a review of the existing risk 
management processes against international 
standards and guidelines and to advise on process 
improvements, reporting and assurance.
During 2013, the Board approved an updated Risk 
Management Policy, a Group Risk Management 
Strategy and updated formats for regular Board 
reports and the Group Risk Register. This was 
supported by process and guidance documentation 
detailing the revised Group-wide framework. The 
implementation of an improved reporting and 
communication process will ensure the revised 
risk management framework is embedded 
properly across the Group.
Risk disclosure
Following our strategic review of the risk 
management process in 2013, we have 
evaluated our risk disclosure and have 
focused this report on our most 
significant risks. As a result, some of the 
risks we disclosed in 2012 are no longer 
included: risks relating to catastrophic 
events, the environment, health and 
safety, acquisitions, contract risk and 
organisational structure. General 
financial risks are no longer disclosed 
here but are described in the Chief 
Financial Officer’s review on pages 29 to 
30, including foreign exchange risk to 
reported results.
The risks outlined overleaf, which are not 
presented in order of priority, are those 
the Group believes are the principal ones 
it currently faces. However, additional 
risks, of which the Group is unaware, or 
risks the Group currently considers to be 
less significant, could have an adverse 
impact.

The Group uses a mix of financial and non-financial key 
performance indicators (KPIs) to measure execution against  
its strategic objectives. To ensure we deliver value to our 
shareholders over the cycle, financial KPIs balance short-term 
measures (underlying PBT and free cash flow in the year) with 
longer-term measures (organic revenue growth, return on 
trading assets and underlying EPS growth). Non-financial KPIs 
focus on investment in R&D to drive future revenues, the health 
and safety of our employees and raising standards of 
operational performance to satisfy our customers. 
 Organic revenue growth
Definition and basis of calculation
Revenue growth calculated by measuring current and prior year revenue at constant 
currency, excluding revenue from any businesses acquired or disposed of in those 
periods. To measure revenue at constant currency, current year revenue is restated 
using translation and transaction exchange rates prevailing in the prior year. See page 
27 for a reconciliation of organic revenue to revenue.
Organic revenue growth better represents underlying business performance and has 
replaced the previously reported revenue growth KPI which did not exclude the impact 
of currency or mergers and acquisitions.
Target
Mid-single digit in 2014. 6 to 7% over the medium term.
Result
Achieved 1.4% (2012: 5.8%). Average achieved over last five years: 1.1%.  
Average achieved over three years since target was set: 6.4%. See page 22  
for details.
Directors’ incentive plans
Organic revenue growth is proposed as a performance measure for the 2014  
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). See pages 50 to 51 for details. 
 Underlying PBT
Definition and basis of calculation
Underlying PBT is reconciled to statutory measures in note 10 of the Group financial 
statements. Prior year figures have been restated for the impacts of IAS 19 (Revised) 
and the treatment of net interest expense on retirement benefit obligations as 
described in note 44 of the Group financial statements.
Target
We do not publish profit targets.
Result
Achieved £377.8 million (2012: £366.0 million as restated). See page 24 for details.
Directors’ incentive plans
Underlying PBT is a performance measure in the 2013 and 2014 Short Term Incentive 
Plan (STIP). For the purpose of these plans, underlying PBT figures are measured at 
constant currency. See pages 49 and 51 for details.

MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013  Return on trading assets
Definition and basis of calculation
Underlying operating profit after tax expressed as a percentage of average trading 
assets. Underlying operating profit is defined and reconciled to statutory measures  
in note 10 of the Group financial statements. 
Trading assets are defined as net assets adjusted to exclude goodwill, other intangible 
assets arising on the acquisition of businesses, net debt, retirement benefit 
obligations, derivative financial instruments and deferred tax. 
Average trading assets are calculated as the average of trading assets at the start and 
end of the year. 
Return on trading assets measures performance by linking operating performance  
to management of working capital and capital investment. It replaces the previously 
reported return on sales KPI.
Target
Slight reduction in the short-term due to projected high level of investment needed  
to execute high volume of new platform contracts secured in recent years. Target is to 
achieve an average return on trading assets of 34.5% over the next three years. 
Result
Achieved 36.0% (2012: 40.8%). Average achieved over last five years: 36.9%. See page 
28 for details. 
Directors’ incentive plans
Return on trading assets is proposed as a measure for the 2014 LTIP. For the purpose 
of this plan, underlying operating profit after tax and trading assets are measured at 
constant currency. See pages 50 to 51 for details.
 Underlying EPS growth
Definition and basis of calculation
The percentage change in underlying earnings per share (EPS) from the previous year. 
Underlying EPS is reconciled to statutory measures in note 15 of the Group financial 
statements. 
Target
We do not publish profit targets. However, the proposed 2014 LTIP includes EPS targets 
equivalent to growth ranging from 5 to 10% per annum over the next three years.
Result
Achieved 2.7% (2012: 13.7%). Average achieved over last five years: 7.2%. See page 27 
for details.

 Free cash flow
Definition and basis of calculation
Cash generated excluding amounts in respect of acquisition of businesses, disposal of 
businesses and paid to shareholders. See page 29 for a reconciliation of free cash flow 
to statutory measures.
Free cash flow replaces the previously reported cash conversion KPI.
Target
We do not publish free cash flow targets. 
Result
Achieved £110.4 million (2012: £182.4 million). See page 28 for details. 
Directors’ incentive plans
Free cash flow, as defined above, is a performance measure in the 2014 STIP. Free 
cash flow adjusted to exclude capital expenditure was a measure in the 2013 STIP.  
For the purpose of these plans, actual and target free cash flow figures are measured 
at constant currency. See pages 49 and 51 for details.
 R&D investment
Definition and basis of calculation
Investment in research and development (R&D) expressed as a percentage of revenue. 
Investment is measured as total expenditure in the year and is not adjusted for 
amounts capitalised or amortised. Investment is measured gross of funding received 
from customers. 
Target
Investment of 6 to 8% per annum. This range reflects investment fluctuation within the 
industry cycle.
Result
Achieved 8.2% (2012: 7.6%). Average achieved over last five years: 7.6%. See page 28  
for details. 
Directors’ incentive plans
R&D investment is not a specific measure used in any directors' incentive plans. 
However, the 2014 LTIP proposes to include measures focussed on R&D  
programme management. See pages 50 to 51 for details.
 Accident/incident rate
Definition and basis of calculation
The number of injuries reportable under local laws and regulations multiplied by 
100,000, divided by the average employee headcount during the year. The method of 
calculation was revised in 2012 and it has not been practical to restate figures prior to 
2011 on this basis. 
Target
Year-on-year improvement with an ultimate goal of nil.
Result
2013: 317 (2012: 397). See page 33 for details. 
Directors’ incentive plans
Health and safety performance is included in the personal objectives of two executive 
directors.

  Reduction in defective  
parts per million (DPPM)
Definition and basis of calculation
Defective parts per million (DPPM) for the year expressed as a percentage 
improvement from that achieved at 31 December 2011, the date at which the Meggitt 
Production System introduced this consistent method of measurement. DPPM is 
defined as the number of defective parts returned by customers in the year multiplied 
by 1,000,000 and divided by the total number of parts delivered. 
Figures include the results of disposed businesses up to the date of sale and include 
the results of acquired businesses from the later of the start of the financial year 
following acquisition and the date the information is first available.
This new KPI monitors the success of the Meggitt Production System.
Target
To achieve the levels of performance excellence (e.g. sometimes referred to as 
'Supplier Gold') expected by our customers. We use simple on-time delivery and  
DPPM measures, aggregated at a Group level, to track overall progress towards  
these objectives. Given the complexity and variety of customer metrics, driven by  
the large number of customers we serve, we also track performance as reported  
by our customers through their own supplier scorecards.
Result
Cumulative improvement since 31 December 2011: 54% (2012: 32%). See page 5  
for details. 
Directors’ incentive plans
DPPM is a measure used in the 2013 STIP and is proposed as a measure for the 2014 
LTIP. For the purpose of these plans, it is measured by reference to the number of  
sites achieving individual targeted reductions in DPPM. See pages 49 to 51 for details.

Chief Financial Officer’s review
Revenue 
Total revenue increased by 2% to  
£1,637.3 million. As Table 2 (see page 24) 
demonstrates, softness in civil aftermarket 
and military were compensated for by 
strong growth in civil original equipment 
(OE). Organic growth was 1% after 
adjusting for the effects of acquisitions, 
disposals and foreign exchange. 
Total civil aerospace revenue grew 3% 
(organic: 4%), with strong organic growth 
in OE of 11%, predominantly on large jets, 
compensating for lower than expected 
growth in aftermarket (AM). The AM 
weakness was largely as a result of the 
continuation of the destocking seen in 
2012, although the growth trend improved 
as the year progressed, with organic 
growth of 2% and 3% respectively in  
Q3 and Q4. 
Total military revenue declined by 1% 
(organic: -3%), reflecting the anticipated 
effect of the drawdown from Afghanistan, 
a slowdown in orders in our defence 
systems business and the substantial 
completion of two large retrofit 
programmes, partly offset by good 
growth in our training business, 
particularly outside the US.
Total energy revenue increased by 5% in 
2013 (organic: +5%). The favourable 
demand environment for our printed 
circuit heat exchangers continued, with 
Heatric growing 11% in the year, although 
order and milestone timing impacted 
revenue in the second half. We saw good 
growth in demand for our innovative valve 
technology for the power generation 
market. Our revenue from energy 
condition monitoring was negatively 
impacted in the second half by the 
previously announced operational 
challenges encountered during the 
consolidation of our two US-based sensor 
businesses into a new west coast facility, 
and shortage of an important raw 
material. However, the market remains 
robust and we are confident that these 
issues are now under control. Our 
medium term expectation remains that 
our energy businesses will grow at 
greater than 10% per annum over the  
next few years.
Total revenue from other markets grew 
9% in 2013 (organic: +1% after adjusting 
for the Piezotech acquisition), with good 
growth in medical revenue offsetting 
weakness in laboratory test and 
measurement equipment.
Overall performance
Ongoing demand growth in civil original equipment and 
energy was tempered by softness in civil aftermarket and 
military, and operational challenges in the year caused a 
further drag on growth. Revenue grew 2% and underlying 
profit before tax grew 3%, driving a 3% increase in 
underlying EPS to 37.5p. With a strong order book and an 
improving trend in civil aftermarket, there is good 
momentum going into 2014.

with the flexibility to withstand the stresses and strains of 
take-off and landing. 
 
Virtually every US military aircraft carries the ballistically-
resistant and crashworthy fuel tanks we introduced 25 years 
ago. Today, we’re making a name for ourselves in IED-resistant 
fuel tanks for ground vehicles.  
 
That’s why, when we make the leap from component to system, 
the makers of a helicopter certified to the most stringent safety 
requirements of the Federal Aviation Administration know our 
landing will be sure.
M
eggitt has won a long-term contract starting now and 
running until 2030 for the Sikorsky S-92
®
 helicopter 
sponson fuel system. It is based on an innovative 
combination of Meggitt’s extreme environment composites, fuel 
and fluid control technologies. Of course, innovation gets you 
the attention but you won’t go far in our markets without the 
trust built up from industry relationships and experience 
spanning decades.  
  
We launched our long-life, lightweight bladder fuel cell 
technology 30 years ago, pioneering inner liners that do not dry 
out and become fatally brittle when empty for extended periods, 
If it was a flexible fuel tank you wanted, 
our name was on it. Now, after 
collaborating with experts from our 
Control Systems division, we can put 
Meggitt’s name to complete fuel systems. 
That’s what organic growth is all about,  
building value from within.

MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013
Meggitt Control Systems (MCS) designs 
and manufactures products which 
manage the flow of liquids and gases 
around gas turbines (both aerospace and 
industrial), and control the temperature 
of oil, fuel and air in aircraft. Its valve 
business also supplies industrial and 
airport ground fuelling products. The 
division represents 13% of Group revenue 
and generated 53% of its revenue from OE 
and 47% from the aftermarket. 
MCS reported revenue declined 4% in 
2013. On an organic basis (including 
adjusting for the disposal of the Meggitt 
Addison business during 2013 and the 
Meggitt Simi business in 2012), MCS 
revenue grew 2%, with strong civil OE 
(+8%) and energy (+14%) growth more 
than offsetting modest declines in civil 
AM (-2%) and military (-4%). The strong 
growth in civil OE was driven by large 
jets, reflecting the increased deliveries by 
the major manufacturers. Civil AM 
weakness resulted from a continuation of 
the destocking seen in 2012. Operating 
margins improved from 23.2% to 24.5% 
benefiting from favourable progress on a 
legacy product liability issue and 
following the disposal of the relatively 
lower margin cabin air conditioning 
business during the year.
Meggitt Polymers & Composites (MPC) 
has a strong military focus, representing 
60% of its revenue. It supplies flexible 
bladder fuel tanks, ice protection 
products and composite assemblies for a 
range of fixed wing and rotary aircraft and 
complex seals packages for civil and 
military platforms. These market 
segments are linked by their dependence 
on similar materials technology and 
manufacturing processes. MPC 
represents 11% of Group revenue.

Meggitt Aircraft Braking Systems (MABS) 
provides wheels, brakes and brake control 
systems for over 30,000 in-service aircraft 
and continues to develop innovative 
technology for new programmes including 
tyre pressure monitoring, auto-braking 
capability and steering and landing gear 
control systems across a broad range of 
programmes. The division targets sole 
source programmes and is particularly 
strong in regional aircraft and business 
jets. MABS represents 20% of Group 
revenue, generating 86% of its revenue 
from the aftermarket and 14% from  
OE sales.
MABS civil AM revenue (65% of divisional 
total) grew by 3% in 2013 with growth in 
regional aircraft and large jets offsetting a 
modest decline in business jets resulting 
from a significant destocking at one of our 
major customers. Civil OE saw strong 
growth, mainly from the sale of electronic 
brake control systems and A380 
components. Military revenue saw a 
modest increase owing in part to good 
growth in Blackhawk spares for the US 
DoD. Operating margins moved from  
37.6% to 37.0% reflecting the growth in 
lower margin military and civil OE sales. 
Profit 
The Board’s preferred measure of the 
Group’s trading performance is underlying 
profit. Underlying operating profit for the 
year grew 1% to £397.2 million (2012: 
£392.1 million). Headwinds included the 
mix effect of civil OE growing faster than 
civil AM, increased investment in the 
Meggitt Production System and some 
previously announced operational 
challenges encountered in the third 
quarter. These were offset by good 
progress on a legacy product liability issue 
and renegotiation of a loss-making 
contract, both of which had previously 
been provided for, resulting in an operating 
margin of 24.3% (2012: 24.4%).
Underlying net finance costs decreased  
to £19.4 million (2012: £26.1 million) as  
a result of cash generation and lower 
interest rates, including the benefit from 
the refinancing of maturing fixed rate 
private placement notes by lower rate  
bank debt.  
Underlying profit before tax increased by 
3% to £377.8 million (2012: £366.0 million). 
On a statutory basis, profit before tax 
decreased by 7% to £300.3 million (2012: 
£321.4 million), largely as a result of a 
£20.0 million exceptional charge to cover 
costs associated with the supply from a 
vendor of non-conforming raw material in 
one of our businesses, as communicated

Reported revenue in MPC declined 3% 
(organic: -5%). Civil revenue grew by 11% 
on an organic basis, with sales of polymer 
seals for large jets and composites for 
helicopters growing particularly strongly. 
As expected, military revenue declined 
following substantial completion of the 
KC135 and Bradley fuel tank retrofit 
contracts during the second half. These 
programmes contributed £16.5 million to 
revenue during 2013 (2012: £29.6 million). 
Operating margins moved from 18.1% to 
16.7% reflecting strong growth in the 
lower margin civil OE products replacing 
military work, and lower sales of higher 
margin ice-protection products.
Meggitt Sensing Systems (MSS) designs 
and manufactures highly engineered 
sensors to measure a variety of 
parameters such as vibration, 
temperature, pressure, fluid level and 
flow. Its products are designed to operate 
effectively in the extreme conditions of 
temperature, vibration and contamination 
that exist in an aircraft or on ground-based 
turbines. Sensors are combined into 
broader electronics packages, providing 
condition data to engine operators and 
maintenance providers, contributing to 
improved safety and lower operating 
costs. MSS has migrated these products 
into other specialist markets requiring 
similar capabilities, such as test and 
measurement, automotive crash test and 
medical pacemakers. It has also teamed 
with MABS, winning a number of new 
commercial tyre pressure monitoring 
system contracts. This progresses the 
strategy to apply our condition-monitoring 
capability beyond engines to structural 
parts of aircraft, where we see a 
considerable market opportunity. MSS 
represents 15% of Group revenue and 
generated 80% of its revenue from OE and 
20% from the aftermarket. MSS revenue is 
split 39% civil aerospace, 19% military and 
42% energy and other, of which the 
majority is energy.
MSS reported revenue was flat in the year, 
(organic: -2%, stripping out the effect of 
the Piezotech acquisition) with growth in 
military and medical products largely 
offsetting a decline in energy where the 
shortage of tourmaline limited the sales of 
some high margin components. MSS also 
experienced operational challenges 
associated with the consolidation of two 
US factories into one new facility in the 
second half. A solution to the tourmaline 
shortage is in process, and will be 
substantially complete by the end of the 
first half. Civil OE revenue saw good 
growth, offset by a decline in civil AM. 
Operating margins declined to 14.3% 
(2012: 15.1%) as a result of the operational 
challenges and OE/AM mix.
Meggitt Equipment Group (MEG) 
comprises a technologically diverse 
range of businesses (including PacSci), 
each of which has differentiated 
capabilities and a specific focus, ranging 
from fire protection systems through to 
sophisticated electronics and electro-
mechanical components and sub-
systems. The division represents 41%  
of Group revenue and generates 
approximately 70% of its revenue from  
OE and 30% from the aftermarket.
Reported revenue in MEG was up 4% on 
last year (organic: +3% including 
adjusting for the sale of Sunbank in 
December 2013 and the acquisition of 
Precision Micro in 2012). Civil aerospace 
increased by 4% on an organic basis 
driven mainly by demand for large jet OE 
products, and energy grew 11% as a 
result of continued good performance at 
our Heatric printed circuit heat exchanger 
business. Energy revenue growth was 
skewed towards the first half, reflecting 
the exceptional growth in the second half 
of 2012. Military revenue was broadly flat 
in the year, with good growth in the 
training businesses offsetting a decline  
in defence systems. Operating margins 
remained broadly flat at 23.5% (2012: 
23.8%), with incremental synergies from 
the PacSci acquisition and the 
renegotiation of a loss-making contract 
against which a provision had been held 
largely offsetting unfavourable mix.
Taxation
Meggitt’s underlying tax rate benefited 
from a one-off research and development 
credit in the US, reducing slightly to 21% 
(2012: 22%). We continue to expect an 
underlying rate of 22% in the medium 
term based on our current business mix. 
Cash tax paid as a percentage of 
underlying profit was 12% (2012: 9%). The 
rate of cash tax paid is lower than our 
underlying tax rate due to tax deductible 
items which do not affect underlying 
profit, including goodwill amortisation 
and tax relief on retirement benefit deficit 
reduction payments.
Our statutory tax rate, which includes 
items excluded from underlying profit 
was 14% (2012: 16%). 
Earnings per share (EPS)
Underlying EPS increased by 3% to 37.5 
pence (2012; 36.5 pence). An increase in 
shares in issue, which includes the 21% 
take up of scrip dividend on 2013 dividend 
payments, offset the benefits of the lower 
tax rate and resulted in EPS growth being 
in line with the growth in underlying profit 
before tax. 
Statutory EPS declined 2% to 29.4 pence 
(2012: 30.1 pence). The decline is smaller 
than that in statutory profit before tax 
with the reduction in statutory tax rate 
more than offsetting the higher number of 
shares in issue. 
Dividends
The Board has increased the 
recommended final dividend to 8.80 pence 
(2012: 8.20 pence) which would result in 
an 8% increase in the full-year dividend to 
12.75 pence (2012: 11.80 pence). Chief Financial Officer’s review continued 28

(2012: £36.1 million) in supplying equipment 
free of charge to new aircraft and making 
programme participation contributions, 
mostly in MABS, and we expect this to grow 
in the medium term as new regional 
aircraft and business jets equipped with our 
wheels and brakes are delivered.
Our leading edge capabilities incorporating 
high levels of embedded intellectual 
property, and our lengthy pedigree in our 
chosen markets, enable us to secure 
strong positions on new programmes such 
as the Dassault Falcon 5X announced in 
the second half of 2013. We target 
specialist applications where we can 
generate revenue from original equipment, 
with annuity-like maintenance, overhaul, 
spares and repair revenue for the life of 
programmes, which can last for decades. 
As our products are spread over multiple 
platforms and markets, we are not 
dependent on single programmes, 
customers or regions. 
Capital expenditure on property, plant 
and equipment and other intangible 
assets increased to £66.9 million (2012: 
£63.2 million). There has been substantial 
investment in our manufacturing facilities 
during 2013. We have consolidated six 
factories into three larger, more efficient 
facilities, and have built additional 
capacity in some of our businesses to 
meet future growth requirements. 
Examples of capacity growth include 
further investment at our Heatric printed 
circuit heat exchanger business in the UK 
and new, larger facilities for our power 
storage business in North America and 
our sensor business in Denmark. We have 
also continued to invest in the roll-out of a 
common ERP system across the Group. 
We believe superior performance on 
quality and delivery are the building blocks 
of future growth. As our customers 
continue to raise the bar, we are 
intensifying our investment in facilities, 
production systems, programme 
management and people. These 
investments ensure that we will continue 
to meet our customer expectations, and 
will further strengthen our customer 
partnerships.
Building future growth
The key pillars of our strategy are to 
deliver innovation, secure positions on 
new platforms in our chosen markets, 
develop and sustain a culture of 
operational excellence and provide our 
customers with world-class through-life 
support.
Innovation and technology development 
are aimed at adding new capabilities to 
our portfolio in response to customer 
requirements. During 2013, investment in 
R&D totalled £134.9 million or 8.2% of 
revenue (2012: £122.0 million, 7.6%), of 
which 18% was funded by customers. This 
is our highest ever level of R&D, and 
above our normal range of 6-8% of 
revenue, reflecting the very strong 
win-rate on new programmes. Areas of 
focus in 2013 included advancement on a 
number of wheel and brake technologies 
including electrically actuated braking 
and tyre pressure monitoring systems, 
developing our helicopter fuel system 
technology in line with Sikorsky’s 
requirements on the S92 programme, and 
the development of an environmentally 
responsible fire suppression technology 
to replace the use of halon as a 
suppressant in aerospace applications. 
We also continue to invest in transferring 
our core aerospace technologies across 
adjacent markets, and developing 
manufacturing techniques including 
additive manufacturing to enhance our 
prototyping and manufacturing 
capabilities.

2013 saw the launch of our global 
approach to continuous improvement—
the Meggitt Production System—which is 
already delivering tangible improvements 
in quality and delivery and which will, 
over the long term, create a sustainable 
competitive advantage based on our 
manufacturing and programme 
management capabilities. We will also 
become more cost competitive through 
the reduction in rework costs and  
working capital.
Finally, we continue to invest in our 
product support capability. In 2013, we 
opened our new repair and overhaul 
centre in Singapore, doubling our capacity 
and adding more Meggitt product lines, 
and launched a major review of the 
optimal way to deploy Meggitt’s growing 
aftermarket capability to our global 
customer base.
Cash flow and borrowings
Free cash flow of £110.4m (2012: 182.4m) 
reflects continued investment in R&D and 
capital expenditure as well as higher 
working capital due to the lower than 
anticipated revenue growth, delayed 
customer receipts and the timing of 
milestones in our Heatric business.
Net cash generated of £63.2 million (2012: 
£116.7 million) reflects the increases in 
R&D, capital expenditure and working 
capital referred to above, partially offset 
by net proceeds from M&A of £25.9 
million (2012: £5.2 million). Net debt 
decreased by 12% to £564.6 million (2012: 
£642.5 million).
To reflect the Board’s focus on efficient 
deployment of manageable capital, we 
have introduced a new Return on Trading 
Assets (ROTA) key performance indicator, 
which we track at both Group and 
individual business level. ROTA moved to 
36.0% in 2013 (2012: 40.8%) reflecting the 
investments in R&D, capital expenditure 
and working capital during the year. 29

single bank accounts for more than 6% of 
the Group’s total credit facilities and the 
credit rating of lenders is monitored by 
our treasury department. Our largest six 
lenders are Bank of America, Barclays, 
HSBC, JP Morgan, Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsubishi and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking 
Corporation. We also seek to maintain at 
least £200 million of undrawn committed 
facilities, net of cash, as a buffer.
b. Set-off arrangements
The Group utilises set-off and netting 
arrangements where possible to reduce 
the potential effect of counterparty 
defaults. All treasury transactions are 
settled on a net basis where possible and 
surplus cash is generally deposited with 
our lenders up to the level of their current 
exposure to us.
c. Refinancing risk
We seek to ensure the maturity of our 
facilities is staggered and refinancings 
are concluded in good time, typically 
more than 12 months before expiry.
d. Currency risk
To ensure we mitigate headroom erosion 
due to currency movements our credit 
facilities are denominated in US dollars, 
the currency in which most of our 
borrowings are held.

 Net debt 564.6 642.5
e. Covenant risk 
Meggitt’s committed credit facilities 
contain two financial ratio covenants—
interest cover and net debt to EBITDA. 
The covenant calculations are drafted to 
protect us from potential volatility caused 
by accounting standard changes, sudden 
movements in exchange rates and 
exceptional items. This is achieved by 
measuring EBITDA on a frozen GAAP 
basis, retranslating net debt and EBITDA 
at similar average exchange rates for the 
year and excluding exceptional items from 
the definition of EBITDA. We continue to 
have considerable headroom on both key 
financial covenant measures. 
 Covenant ratios (Table 9)
  Covenant 2013 2012
 Net debt/EBITDA ≤3.5x 1.2x 1.3x
 Interest cover ≥3.0x 22.0x 16.2x
Interest risk
Meggitt seeks to reduce the volatility 
caused by interest rate fluctuations on net 
debt. Our US private placements are 
subject to fixed interest rates whereas 
borrowings under our syndicated bank 
credit facilities are at floating rates. To 
manage interest rate volatility, we use 
interest rate derivatives to either convert 
floating rate interest into fixed rate or vice 
versa. Our policy is to maintain at least 
25% of net debt at fixed rates with a 
weighted average maturity of two years or 
more. At 31 December 2013, the 
percentage of net debt at fixed rates was 
46% (2012: 43%) and the weighted 
average period to maturity of the first 
25% was 5.4 years (2012: 5.4 years). 
Foreign exchange risk
The Group is exposed to both translation 
and transaction impacts due to changes 
in foreign exchange rates. These risks 
principally relate to the US dollar/Sterling 
rate, although exposure also exists in 
relation to other currency pairs including 
the US dollar/Swiss franc and US  
dollar/Euro. 
The results of overseas businesses are 
translated into sterling at weighted average 
exchange rates. Compared to 2012, the 
Group’s underlying profit before tax for  
the year benefited by £4.7 million from 
currency translation of which £3.4 million 
arose on US dollar denominated profits and 
Debt structure and financing
The Group’s borrowings comprise a 
combination of US private placement debt 
and syndicated bank credit facilities. 
During the year, the Group repaid, out of 
existing facilities, expiring US $180 
million private placement notes. There 
were no other changes in facilities 
available to the Group in the year. As at  
31 December 2013, the Group had 
undrawn committed credit facilities of 
£504 million after taking account of 
surplus cash (2012: £557 million). More 
than 96% of the Group’s existing 
committed facilities expire after 2015.

Debt financing risks
The Group seeks to minimise debt

We raise funds through private placement 
issuances and committed bank facilities 
to reduce reliance on any one market. 
Bank financing is sourced from around 15 
international institutions spread across 
North America, Europe and Asia. No  Chief Financial Officer’s review continued 30

Post-retirement benefit schemes
The Group’s principal defined benefit 
pension schemes are in the UK and US 
and are closed to new members. 
The total pension scheme deficits reduced 
to £189.8 million (2012: £241.2 million). 
Net of deferred tax, the deficits reduced 
to £139.9 million (2012: £169.3 million). 
The main drivers of the reduction were:
•  Net deficit reduction payments of  
£26.7 million (2012: £22.8 million). 
Regulations in the UK and US require 
repayment of deficits over time. In the 
UK, the 2012 triennial actuarial 
valuation was finalised during 2013 and 
a repayment plan agreed with the 
trustees. Under this agreement, the 
Group commenced making increased 
deficit payments from April 2013 with 
amounts due to gradually increase over 
the period to 2024. In the US, the level 
of deficit payments is principally driven 
by regulations. Amounts required to be 
paid decreased slightly in the year and 
are expected to remain relatively flat in 
2014. Overall, the Group expects deficit 
contributions to increase to £30.6 
million in 2014.
•  An actuarial gain on scheme assets of 
£25.5 million (2012: £28.8 million) 
principally driven by the continued 
global recovery in equity markets.
Meggitt has two other principal post-
retirement benefit schemes providing 
medical and life assurance benefits to 
certain US employees. The Group’s 
exposure to increases in future medical 
costs provided under these plans is 
capped. Both schemes are unfunded and 
have a combined deficit of £48.3 million 
(2012: £58.5 million). The main driver of 
the reduction was the increase in AA 
corporate bond rates used to measure 
scheme liabilities. Deficit payments 
during the year were £0.7 million (2012: 
£2.2 million).
In 2013, the Group adopted IAS 19 
(Revised 2011) which changed the 
calculation of certain items of pension 
expense. In addition, the definition of 
underlying profit measures was amended 
to exclude net pensions interest. Details 
of these changes are provided in note 44 
of the Group financial statements.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities are 
described on pages 8 to 14 which include 
those factors most likely to affect its 
future development, performance and 
position. The financial position of the 
Group is set out in this report and 
additional information is provided in the 
financial statements including note 3 
(Financial risk management), note 28 
(Bank and other borrowings) and note 30 
(Derivative financial instruments). Details 
of the principal risks and uncertainties to 
which the Group is exposed, and the 
mitigation plans in place, are set out on 
pages 15 to 17.
The Group describes in the Strategic 
report on pages 4 to 7 its cash generative 
business model designed to deliver 
organic revenue growth of 6-7% in the 
medium term and its resilience to one-off 
global shock events. The Group continues 
to be cash generative even at the current 
peak in the investment cycle, has 
considerable headroom against existing 
bank facilities and covenants and there is 
no material facility expiry before 2016. 
Accordingly, after making enquiries, the 
directors have formed a judgement, at the 
time of approving the financial 
statements, that there is a reasonable 
expectation that the Group and the 
Company have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason, the 
directors continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the Group and 
Company financial statements.
the balance on other currencies. Each five 
cent weakening of the US dollar versus the 
2013 average rate of £1:$1.57 will adversely 
impact 2014 revenue by approximately 
£35 million, with the converse also being  
true. The sensitivity of 2014 underlying 
profit before tax to a five cent move in  
the translation rate is approximately  
£8.0 million.
The net assets of overseas businesses 
are translated into sterling at year end 
exchange rates. The resultant exchange 
rate exposure is mitigated through 
holding our net debt principally in the 
currencies of those businesses.
Transaction risk arises where revenues 
and/or costs of our businesses are 
denominated in a currency other than 
their own. We hedge known and some 
anticipated transaction currency 
exposures based on historical experience 
and projections. Our policy is to hedge at 
least 70% of the next 12 months’ 
anticipated exposure and to permit the 
placing of cover up to five years ahead. 
Compared to 2012, the Group’s underlying 
profit before tax for the year benefited by 
£3.7 million from currency transaction 
movements, of which £1.6 million relates 
to US dollar/Sterling exposure and the 
balance to other currency pairs. Each five 
cent movement of the US dollar versus 
the 2013 average hedged rate of £1 = 
$1.62 impacts underlying profit before  
tax by approximately £2.5 million. At  
31 December 2013, $/£ cover for 
estimated 2014 exposure was 100% 
hedged at an average rate of $1.53 and  
we have covered approximately 50% of 
our $/£ exposures for the next three 
subsequent years at an average rate  
of $1.56.

2013 Activity
Environment
Meggitt strives to achieve the highest level 
of environmental performance throughout 
our businesses based on standards and 
procedures set by Group leadership. To 
achieve the goals of our Environmental 
Policy, Meggitt’s environmental 
management programme includes setting 
environmental targets, communicating 
regulatory developments, training and 
information-sharing, data analysis and 
internal and external auditing of 
environmental management systems  
and practices.
Our global environmental audit 
programme, supported by external 
consultants, includes a comprehensive 
review of applicable regulatory 
requirements and best practice standards 
at all manufacturing facilities every  
three years. In total, 11 sites were  
audited in 2013. 
78% of our manufacturing facilities had 
achieved ISO 14001 standard certification 
by the end of 2013. All facilities should 
achieve certification by the end of 2014. 
Performance
Table 1 shows our performance for  
key environmental metrics. Site 
consolidations, which reduced floor space, 
and gas efficiency initiatives completed at 
our aircraft braking systems facilities in 
Akron, USA and Coventry, UK contributed 
to a drop in gas consumption relative to 
revenue in 2013. 
The fall in water consumption relative to 
revenue is attributable to water 
conservation measures implemented at 
many of our facilities. For example, water 
recirculating systems installed at our 
North Hollywood, US facility resulted in a 
57% decrease in water consumption on 
2012. One of our facilities in Oregon, US 
installed thermostatically-controlled 
water recirculation systems saving 50% of 
the water normally used in mould-cooling 
tanks. 
The rise in total waste was due, primarily, 
to non-recyclable construction debris as  
a result of site consolidations and from 
waste produced by the Precision Micro 
facilities acquired in 2012. 
Although site consolidations generate 
additional waste, our site consolidation 
projects always include plans to minimise 
our environmental impact and waste. Our 
contractors for the site consolidation at 
Orange County, US diverted more than 
70% of waste generated to a recycling 
facility and were selected partly on the 
basis of their environmental and waste 
management credentials.

Performance against five-year targets
Table 2 shows our performance against 
internally set five-year targets. We have 
met our target for CO
2
 emissions one year 
early, and will be setting a new five-year 
target using 2014 as the baseline year. Our 
performance is on track to meet targets 
for most metrics, but acquisitions, facility 
consolidations and increased production 
of carbon brakes has impacted our 
progress on electricity reduction and 
waste recycled. 
Greenhouse gas emissions (GHG)
Table 3 shows GHG emissions data 
required to be reported under the Large 
and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulation 2008 
as amended in August 2013. The sites 
reporting GHG data are the same as those 
consolidated in the Group’s financial 
statements. 
Saving energy 
In 2013, we continued to seek 
improvements in our operations and 
processes to achieve reductions in energy 
consumption and improve efficiencies. For 
example:
• Significant lighting, heating and 
ventilation system upgrades were made 
as part of the site consolidation at 
Orange County, US.
•  Several facilities have replaced 
inefficient air compressors with 
energy-efficient variable speed drive 
compressors, resulting in a saving of 
approximately 1,250 tonnes of carbon 
per year. 
•  Several facilities continued to upgrade 
offices and production floors with 
high-efficiency compact fluorescent 
lighting, saving approximately 200 
tonnes of carbon per year. One of our 
facilities in Oregon, US only illuminates 
office and production floor space when 
occupied, after installing wireless 
activity sensors. 
• The carbon refurbishment programme 
at our facility in Akron, US has 
continued to expand in 2013 with a 54% 
increase in carbon discs recovered and 
refurbished from 2012. Reductions to 
processing time and associated energy 
consumption of around 75% resulted in 
savings of approximately 1,600 tonnes of 
CO
2
 in 2013. 
REACH
Compliance with the European Community 
regulation on Registration, Evaluation, 
Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals 
(REACH) is managed by the Group’s REACH 
Steering Committee which continues to 
address the risks associated with the 
potential obsolescence of chemicals used 
by aerospace manufacturers. We 
continuously track substances regulated 
under REACH and work closely with our 
chemical suppliers to ensure substances 
are registered and will be approved for 
continued use, or a suitable alternative 
identified. 
Obsolescence
In 2013, our Obsolescence Review Board 
(ORB) was instrumental in addressing the 
potential impact of new US legislation on 
conflict minerals, establishing protocols 
for understanding how materials are 
sourced and their paths into our 
manufacturing facilities and products. 
The ORB developed a Counterfeit and 
Fraudulent Material Avoidance Policy 
requiring our businesses to develop a 
process that will protect our supply chain 
from counterfeit parts. We continued to 
collaborate with several customers and 
suppliers to identify and test alternatives 
to address the increasingly restricted use 
of particular substances following global 
regulatory developments (including 
REACH, described above).

that in October 2013 one of our employees 
died in an incident involving a test 
laboratory autoclave at our facility in 
Rockmart, US. An investigation is 
underway by regulatory authorities to 
determine the cause and we are providing 
our full support.
In 2013, we continued to implement 
measures to improve safety in the 
workplace. These included:
•  Group-wide online health and safety 
awareness training for all employees;
•  Integrated daily health and safety 
inspections and reviews as part of the 
Meggitt Production System;
•  A behavioural health and safety 
programme implemented at our facility 
in Loughborough, UK, which contributed 
to a 75% improvement in its Reporting 
of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous 
Occurrences Regulations (RIDDOR) 
frequency and lost time incident rates 
and lost days. We plan to roll out this 
programme to a number of sites across 
the Group in 2014;
•  Continued implementation of the 
MoveSmart® programme at our facility 
in Rockmart,US designed to reduce the 
number of musculoskeletal injuries; 
•  Improved reporting and investigation of 
near-miss accidents and unsafe 
conditions, with special emphasis on 
root-cause analysis and developing 
timely corrective action plans; and 
•  Continued dissemination of information 
and best practice through intra-Group 
HSE conferences, health and safety 
alerts and all-employee safety bulletins.
These measures have resulted in 
improvements in health and safety 
performance across the Group and 
outstanding achievements at some of our 
sites. We experienced a significant 
reduction in reportable incidents and 
associated incident rates across the 
Group, as shown in Table 4. In 2013, 80% 
of our manufacturing facilities achieved at 
least a Bronze Meggitt Safety Star award 
reflecting a 25% improvement in health 
and safety performance over the three-
year average performance for years 2009 
to 2011. Of those, 20 facilities will receive 
a Platinum Safety Star award for 
outstanding performance in achieving no 
work-related lost time accidents and 
incurring no lost work days in 2013. 
Ethics and business conduct  
and trade compliance
Our ethics and business conduct 
programme commits us to conducting 
business fairly, impartially and in 
compliance with laws and regulations and 
acting with integrity and honesty in our 
business relationships.
In 2013, we provided training on promoting 
mutual respect, the UK Bribery Act and 
preventing harassment in the workplace 
and held two in-house ethics conferences 
where facility-based ethics coordinators 
reviewed and provided feedback on the 
Ethics Programme. As a result of this 
feedback, we launched a web application 
for the Ethics Line which allows questions 
or concerns to be submitted by email and 
agreed to update our Ethics Guide. 
The Board revised our Ethics and 
Business Conduct Policy and Code of 
Conduct this year along with the Anti-
Corruption Policy, and we launched a 
Distributors’ Policy. 
We have a highly-developed trade 
compliance programme, based on the 
Nunn-Wolfowitz Task Force Report of 
2000 (the influential report on export 
compliance best practice) and guidelines 
issued by the regulatory authorities. 
During 2013, we continued to implement 
our global trade management software 
solution to enhance our trade compliance 
programme and began implementation of 
our enhanced import compliance 
programme at several US facilities. We 
also implemented Phase 1 of the US 
Government’s Export Control Reform 
programme. 
Local communities and 
charitable donations
Individual Meggitt facilities work with the 
local community and support charities at 
their discretion. Education Business 
Partnerships and the UK Government’s 
STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering 
and Mathematics) initiative were 
supported locally. Meggitt’s headquarters, 
based in Dorset, UK, continued to sponsor 
the Arkwright Scholarship Trust, the 
Institute of Mechanical Engineers’ 
Schools Aerospace Challenge, the local 
Community Foundation and the Poole 
Hospital Staff Excellence Awards.
Our employees
Learning, career development, employee 
engagement, strong leadership and 
effective teamwork are vital components 
of Meggitt’s performance culture. 
In 2013, we undertook our second 
all-employee survey. 62% of our 
workforce participated—1,500 more than 
last time. Overall engagement levels are 
7% higher than the global benchmark: 
people are proud to work for Meggitt and 
would recommend us as an employer.

Human rights
Respect for human rights is at the heart of 
Meggitt’s Code of Conduct, which we apply 
across all our businesses. 
Employee consultation 
The Group regards employee 
communication as a vital business 
function. Communication and consultation 
is carried out at facilities by operations 
directors and other line managers using a 
variety of forums including daily meetings 
on shop floors, monthly all-employee 
‘Town Hall’ meetings, team briefings and 
works councils. We respect all employee 
relations regulations. 
Corporate communications take a variety 
of forms, including presentations from the 
Chief Executive via audio-visual media, 
global web-enabled conferences, 
publications such as the Meggitt Review 
and a variety of electronically-distributed 
newsletters. Results presentations are 
disseminated across the Group, which 
enhance our employees’ understanding  
of the financial and economic factors 
affecting its performance. 
The directors encourage employees to 
become shareholders to improve active 
participation in, and commitment to, the 
Group’s success. This policy has been 
pursued for all UK employees through  
the Share Incentive Plan and the 
Sharesave Scheme.

Stephen Young 
Chief Executive
3 March 2014
Our employees (continued) 
Various initiatives are underway, many of 
which have overt goals to improve or 
sustain engagement. Investment in learning 
and development is one of these. We 
continue to increase the amount of 
corporate training, where people from 
different businesses get to meet, share 
views and learn together. The most 
significant investment is in the Meggitt 
Production System (MPS), our single, global 
approach to the application of ‘lean’ tools 
and other continuous improvement 
practices. The purpose of MPS is to ensure 
that everything we do and everyone who 
does it supports the front line of our 
business. 
In 2013, we launched a state-of-the art 
human resources information system, in 
part, to facilitate performance and talent 
management processes. Advanced 
analytical tools will enable us to fine-tune 
our personnel requirements Group-wide, 
while ensuring that professional 
development can be managed effectively 
for all employees. Individual goals are 
now more easily connected to the strategy 
of business units and the Group as a 
whole. The human resources information 
system is a lever for behavioural change 
that leads to the kind of performance 
culture employees want to play a part in. 
Equal opportunities
The Group supports equal employment 
opportunities and opposes all forms of 
unlawful or unfair discrimination. It is Group 
policy to give full and fair consideration to 
job applications from disabled people, to

MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013
 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION GOVERNANCE REPORTS
Chairman’s introduction
Throughout the financial year ended 31 December 2013 and to 
the date of this report, we have complied with the provisions set 
out in the UK Corporate Governance Code 2012 published by the 
Financial Reporting Council (the “Code”). The Company has 
applied the main and supporting principles set out in the Code. 
An explanation of how the main principles have been applied is 
set out in this report and in the Directors’ remuneration report, 
the Nominations Committee report and the Audit Committee 
report. A number of new disclosure requirements are reflected 
in this report (in particular, as required under the Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013 and the Code).
The Board is committed to maintaining high standards of 
corporate governance, which are fundamental to discharging our 
responsibilities. As Chairman, I encourage open and transparent 
discussion and constructive challenge. It is my responsibility to 
ensure that Meggitt is governed and managed in the best 
interests of shareholders and wider stakeholders. In this report, 
we set out our governance framework and explain how sound 
and effective corporate governance practices support our 
strategy of creating long-term, sustainable growth.
Leadership
In 2013, Terry Twigger retired from the Board, having served as 
Chief Executive for over 12 years. He was replaced by Stephen 
Young (who was, until that time, Group Finance Director) with 
effect from 1 May 2013. In early June, we appointed Doug Webb 
as Chief Financial Officer. On behalf of the Board, I would like to 
thank Terry for his contribution to the success of Meggitt and 
welcome Stephen and Doug to their new roles. I am pleased to 
report that we have seen a smooth transition during the 
succession period. Stephen and Doug have visited our facilities, 
customers and shareholders, emphasising our continued 
commitment to returns to shareholders and to improving 
operational performance and customer service through 
initiatives such as the Meggitt Production System.
Effectiveness
After our successful external Board evaluation in 2012, we 
returned to an internal evaluation in 2013, using lessons learned 
from the external process. The main findings and 
recommendations of the evaluations in 2013 were to enhance our 
strategy reviews and risk management process and continue to 
improve the annual Board schedule, including site visits and 
operational and functional presentations. A full description of the 
process and outcome of this year’s formal and rigorous review is 
on page 41.
Accountability
The Board, led by executive management, has enhanced our risk 
management process and reporting in 2013. We have 
consolidated our key risks detailed in the Annual Report: our 
shareholders can read about the most significant risks and 
uncertainties and the revised risk management process on  
pages 15 to 17.
The Board and Audit Committee have sought to improve this 
Annual Report and to ensure that it is fair, balanced and 
understandable.
Remuneration
During the year, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the 
directors’ remuneration package and prepared the Group’s 
remuneration policy for inclusion in this year’s Directors’ 
remuneration report and submission to shareholders for 
approval at the AGM in 2014. The Directors’ remuneration report 
(pages 47 to 67) provides a detailed review of the Committee’s 
2013 activity, vesting outcomes and remuneration policy and 
proposals for 2014 and beyond.

 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION GOVERNANCE REPORTS
In advance of any Board meetings impacted by the absence of 
directors, the Chairman discussed the matters to be covered at 
the meeting with, and ascertained the views of, those directors. 
Chairman
•  Sir Colin Terry met the independence criteria on appointment 
as Chairman on 1 July 2004.
•  The roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive are separate 
and a clear division of responsibilities has been approved and 
agreed in writing by the Board. These were reviewed and 
updated by the Board in 2013.
•  The Chairman is responsible for setting the Board’s agenda 
and ensuring that adequate time is available for discussion of 
agenda items (including strategic issues); leading the Board; 
and ensuring its effectiveness.
•  The Chairman facilitates the contribution of non-executive 
directors and oversees the relationship between them and the 
executive directors. The Chairman holds meetings with other 
non-executive directors without executive directors present.
•  The Chairman is responsible for ensuring directors receive 
accurate, timely and clear information and is satisfied that 
effective communication, principally by the Chief Executive  
and Chief Financial Officer, is undertaken with shareholders.
•  The Chairman agrees a personalised approach to the training 
and development of each director and reviews this regularly.
Senior Independent Director
The role of Mr Williams, as Senior Independent Director, is to:
•  Make himself available to shareholders if they have concerns 
that cannot be resolved through normal channels;
•  Chair the Nominations Committee when it is considering the 
Chairman of the Board’s succession; and
•  Meet with the non-executive directors at least once a year  
to appraise the Chairman’s performance.
Non-executive directors
•  The non-executive directors play a full part by constructively 
challenging and contributing to the development of the Group’s 
strategy. 
•  The non-executive directors scrutinise the performance of 
executive management and monitor the reporting of the 
Group’s performance, the integrity of financial information  
and the effectiveness of financial controls and risk 
management systems.
•  The non-executive directors are responsible for determining 
appropriate levels of remuneration for the executive directors 
and participating in the selection and recruitment of new 
directors and succession planning.
•  The terms and conditions of appointment of non-executive 
directors are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office during normal business hours. 
The role of the Board 
The Board retains full and effective control of the Group and  
is collectively responsible for its success. It sets the Group’s 
strategy, ensures appropriate resources are in place to achieve 
the Group’s objectives and reviews performance regularly.
The Board is responsible for setting the Group’s values and 
standards and for ensuring obligations to shareholders, 
employees and others are met. 
There is a Schedule of Matters Reserved for the Board (last 
updated in 2012) which sets out the matters on which the Board 
must make the final decision; these include, for example, 
changes to the Group’s capital structure, acquisitions and 
disposals above a certain threshold, approval of results 
announcements, annual reports and dividends. If a decision is 
not reserved for the Board, then authority lies, in accordance 
with an authorisation policy, with a Board committee, 
management committee, the Chief Executive or other executive 
director, divisional president or site director/general manager.

Effectiveness
Composition
The Board considers it has a good balance of executive  
and non-executive directors, is of an appropriate size and 
includes the independence, skills, experience and knowledge  
to enable the directors to discharge their respective duties and 
responsibilities effectively. All of the non-executive directors  
are considered independent under the Code, with the exception 
of Mr Robins who has served on the Board for over nine years.  
Mr Robins is retiring from the Board after the 2014 AGM.
All non-executive directors are asked to join the Audit, 
Remuneration and Nominations Committees on appointment. 
Chairmanship of Committees is considered during discussions 
on composition and succession. No one other than Committee 
chairmen and members are entitled to attend the meetings, 
although others may be invited. Committee chairmen, members 
and regular meeting invitees are noted in the respective 
Committee reports below. 
Each of these Committees has specific written terms of 
reference issued by the Board and adopted by the relevant 
Committee. These are available on our website. All Committee 
chairmen report orally on the proceedings of their Committees 
at the next meeting of the Board. Where appropriate, the 
Committee chairmen also make recommendations to the Board 
in respect of appropriate matters, for example, the fairness, 
balance and understandability of the Annual Report. Further 
details of the composition and operation of these Committees 
are set out in the Audit Committee report, the Nominations 
Committee report and Directors’ remuneration report. 
Appointments to the Board
There is a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the 
appointment of new directors to the Board. Full details are 
available in the Nominations Committee report set out on page 
46 which also provides details of the role and activities of the 
Nominations Committee. 
Commitment
The letters of appointment for the Chairman and non-executive 
directors set out the expected time commitment required of 
them and are available for inspection by any person during 
normal business hours at the Company’s registered office and  
at the AGM. Other significant commitments of the Chairman  
and non-executive directors are disclosed on appointment and 
require approval thereafter.
In 2013, the Chairman became chairman of AviaMediaTech 
Limited. Sir Colin confirms that he continues to have sufficient 
time to discharge his role as Chairman of the Board.
Company Secretary
The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is  
a matter for the Board. 
The work of the Board in 2013
During the year, the Board approved the acquisition of Piezotech 
LLC and the disposal of Meggitt (Addison), Inc. and the Sunbank 
Family of Companies LLC. It also approved the appointment of  
Mr Young as Chief Executive and Mr Webb as Chief Financial 
Officer. It received regular reports from executive management 
on strategy and business performance, financial performance 
(including treasury activity) and corporate affairs (including risk, 
legal and compliance). The Board visited a number of facilities 
during the year, across all business divisions. The Board 
received and discussed:
•  An update on Group strategy, including market and competitive 
environment and strategic priorities;
•  The Group budget for 2014; 
•  Business unit and functional updates and presentations on 
senior executive succession, operations, IT security, and 
investor relations;
•  Reports on internal control, risk management and going 
concern; and
•  Reports on the activities of its committees.
The Board reviewed and approved:
•  The 2012 Annual Report and Accounts, the 2012 full-year 
results announcement and the 2013 interim results 
announcement;

 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION GOVERNANCE REPORTS
Accountability 
Financial and business reporting
The financial statements contain an explanation of the directors’ 
responsibilities in preparing the Annual Report and the financial 
statements (page 70) and a statement by the auditors concerning 
their responsibilities (page 73). The directors also report that the 
business is a going concern (page 30), detail on how the Group 
generates and preserves value over the longer term (the 
business model) and the Group’s strategy for delivering its 
objectives in the Strategic report (pages 1 to 34).
Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal 
control and for maintaining and reviewing its financial and 
operational effectiveness. The system of internal control is 
designed to manage, but not to eliminate, the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives and to provide reasonable but not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. The 
Group’s system of internal controls includes: 
•  An on-going risk management process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the 
Group that was in place for 2013 and up to the date of approval 
of the Annual Report. This process is regularly reviewed by the 
Board and accords with the Turnbull Guidance. The risk 
management process is described in more detail on pages 15 
to 17;
•  An effective internal audit function which, primarily, performs 
business unit reviews by rotation (including finance, IT, HR, 
ethics and the bid process);
•  Compliance programmes and external audits (including trade 
compliance, ethics, anti-corruption, health, safety and 
environmental);
•   A business performance review process (including financial, 
operational and compliance performance);
•  Process controls, including the bid process, programme 
execution, financial and IT security;
• The forecasting, budget and strategic plan processes;
•  A whistleblowing line to enable employees to raise concerns; 
and
• Group insurance and business continuity programmes.
The Board and Audit Committee applied the following processes 
in 2013 and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report in 
order to review the effectiveness of the system of internal 
controls:
• Reviews of the risk management process and risk register;
•  Written and verbal reports to the Audit Committee from 
internal and external audit on progress with internal control 
activities, including:
 –  reviews of business processes and activities, including 
action plans to address any identified control weaknesses or 
recommendations for improvements to controls or 
processes;
 –  the results of internal audits;
 –  internal control recommendations made by the external 
auditors; and 
 –  follow-up actions from previous internal control 
recommendations; 
Development
The Board is supplied with the information it needs to discharge 
its duties. All new directors receive an appropriate induction to 
the business, including meetings with other directors, senior 
management, auditors, brokers and other professional advisors 
as appropriate, site visits and a comprehensive induction pack. 
We will continue to enhance the induction process as feedback  
is received and incorporated from recently recruited directors. 
The Company Secretary facilitates the induction of new directors 
and assists with professional development where required.
Directors are encouraged to update their skills regularly and 
their training needs are assessed as part of the Board evaluation 
process. Their knowledge and familiarity with the Group is 
facilitated by access to senior management, reports on the 
business and visits to the Group’s operating facilities. Resources 
are available to all directors for the purposes of developing and 
updating their knowledge and capabilities.
Information and support
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring the directors receive 
accurate, timely and clear information. The Company Secretary 
is responsible for ensuring good information flows within the 
Board and committees and between senior management and 
non-executive directors. The Board members have regular 
discussions about their information and support requirements, 
and are involved in setting the annual Board schedule.
The Board and its committees have been provided with sufficient 
resources to undertake their duties. All directors have had 
access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary  
who is responsible to the Board for advising on all governance 
matters. The Board allows all directors to take external 
independent professional advice at the Group’s expense.
Board performance evaluation
In 2013, the Board evaluated its own effectiveness, together  
with the effectiveness of the Chairman, individual directors, its 
committees, auditors and remuneration advisers and agreed  
its objectives for 2014. The effectiveness reviews covered 
strategy, risk management, the annual Board schedule, 
composition, succession, the appointment process, diversity, 
remuneration, audit and open channels of communication.
The evaluation in 2013 was undertaken internally (applying 
lessons learned from the externally facilitated review in 2012). 
The 2013 evaluation was carried out using questionnaires and 
group and individual discussions. The Board continues to be 
thoroughly engaged with the review process, with the main 
findings and recommendations of the 2013 evaluation identifying 
the need to enhance strategy reviews and the risk management 
process and implement continued improvements to the annual 
Board schedule, adding more facility visits and operational and 
functional presentations.  42 Corporate governance report continued
MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013
Constructive use of the Annual General Meeting
The Board uses the AGM to communicate with its shareholders.
Proxy appointment forms for each resolution provide 
shareholders with the option to direct their proxy to vote for or 
against resolutions or to withhold their vote. All proxy votes for, 
against and withheld are counted by the Company’s Registrars 
and the level of voting for, against and withheld on each 
resolution is made available after the meeting and on the Group’s 
website. The proxy form and the voting results announcement 
make it clear that a vote withheld is not a vote in law and will not 
be counted in the calculation of the proportion of votes for and 
against the resolution.
Separate resolutions are proposed at the AGM on substantially 
separate issues and there is a resolution relating to the financial 
statements. The Notice of AGM and related papers are sent to 
shareholders at least 20 working days before the meeting.
The respective Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and 
Nominations committees are available at the AGM to respond  
to questions. It is usual for all other directors to attend.
At the AGM to be held on 7 May 2014, shareholders’ consent  
will be sought on the following special business, in addition to 
routine business:
(i)  approval of the Remuneration Policy;
(ii) approval of a new Long Term Incentive Plan; and
(iii) authority to convene general meetings on 14 clear days’  
  notice in accordance with the Articles (on the terms set out  
  in the Notice of Meeting).
All directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first 
AGM after their appointment and have been subject to re-election 
annually since 2012 in compliance with the Code. In 2014, all 
directors will be subject to election or re-election except for  
Mr Robins, who will retire from the Board at the end of the AGM 
on 7 May 2014.

The Board confirms that it has not been advised of any significant 
failings or weaknesses in the Group’s internal controls.
Remuneration
A separate Remuneration Committee report is set out on pages 
47 to 67 and provides details of our remuneration policy and  
how it has been implemented, together with the activities of the 
Remuneration Committee. 
Relations with shareholders
The Group values its dialogue with institutional and private 
investors. 
The Board communicates with private investors via direct 
communication with investor relations and the Company 
Secretary, material distributed or made available on the investor 
relations section of our website and at the AGM (see below).
Effective communication with fund managers, institutional 
investors and analysts about the Group’s strategy, performance 
and policies is promoted by meetings involving the Chief 
Executive and Chief Financial Officer. The Board receives  
reports from the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer  
and the Head of Investor Relations on the views of shareholders, 
which are discussed.
The Chairman and other non-executive directors are available  
to attend meetings with shareholders and a number of such 
meetings on corporate governance took place in 2013. Directors’ 
understanding of major shareholders’ views is enhanced by 
reports from the Head of Investor Relations, our brokers and 
attending analysts’ briefings. Analysts’ notes on the Group are 
made available to all directors.
In 2013, a consultation was undertaken with significant 
shareholders covering a revised proposed remuneration 
package and policy. The process and outcome of this 
consultation are described on page 56. 43 Audit Committee report

Board that this process was both followed and effective. 
Chairman’s introduction
I am pleased to present the report of the Audit Committee for 2013. 
I chair the Audit Committee and as a Fellow of the ICAEW, Audit 
Committee Chairman of DP World Limited and former Finance 
Director at Bunzl plc, I bring recent and relevant financial 
experience to the Committee. My fellow committee members 
throughout 2013 were Guy Berruyer, Philip Cox, Paul Heiden and 
Brenda Reichelderfer, who attended all three Committee meetings 
during the year. By invitation, there were a number of other regular 
attendees including the Chief Financial Officer, the Group Financial 
Controller and the internal and external auditors. The Chairman of 
the Board, the Chief Executive, the Corporate Affairs Director and 
David Robins also attended by invitation. 
The key role of the Audit Committee is to provide confidence in 
the integrity of our processes and procedures relating to internal 
financial control and corporate reporting. The Board relies on 
the Committee to review financial reporting and to appoint and 
oversee the work of the internal and external auditors. 
The work of the Committee in 2013 is described below in detail 
and included providing advice to the Board on whether these 
accounts are fair, balanced and understandable.

MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013
Significant judgements relating to the financial statements
The table below summarises the significant judgements considered by the Committee in respect of the Group’s financial statements:
Significant judgements Action
Goodwill and other intangible 
assets arising on an 
acquisition
The principal judgements are management’s determination of the level at which impairment testing 
should be performed (including the change in the year whereby certain business units are now 
aggregated as Cash Generating Units (‘CGU’s)), the achievability of CGU business plans (and therefore 
future cash flows) and the appropriateness of the discount rates applied to future cash flows. The 
Committee addressed this through consideration of a report from management setting out the basis 
for the assumptions and providing a sensitivity analysis on key assumptions and an analysis of the 
headroom for each CGU. The Committee agreed the assumptions made by management were 
appropriate and that no impairment was required.
Development costs  
and programme  
participation costs
The Committee considered the method of testing for potential impairment used by management, the 
reasonableness of assumptions used on specific programmes with limited headroom and the aggregation 
of related intangible assets at an aircraft platform level. The Committee addressed this through 
consideration of a report from management covering these areas, exposure to different platforms and  
a sensitivity analysis on specific programmes. The Committee concluded that the assumptions made by 
management were reasonable and the carrying value of deferred costs appropriate.
Provision for environmental 
and legal matters
The key areas reviewed by the Committee were the ongoing environmental liabilities relating to 
historic sites, the impact of the administrative settlement with the US Government regarding historic 
export violations and other litigation matters. The Committee considered a report from management 
setting out the basis for the judgements made on each of these items and the extent to which this was 
supported by third party legal and other specialist advice. Additionally, the Board met separately with 
internal legal counsel and received reports from the Group Corporate Affairs Director regarding the 
above matters and these discussions were shared with the Audit Committee. The Committee agreed 
with the judgements made by management. 
Provision for onerous 
contracts
The key areas reviewed by the Committee were the issue relating to the supply from a vendor of 
non-conforming raw material identified in the year and judgements made by management relating to 
selling prices, product quantities and unit costs on a small number of onerous production contracts. 
The Committee considered a report from management setting out the bases for the judgements made 
on each of these items. Additionally, sensitivities were discussed on assumptions which were not 
contractually agreed at the balance sheet date. The Committee agreed with the accounting treatment 
adopted. 
Retirement benefit  
obligations
Assumptions on mortality, inflation and the rates at which scheme liabilities are discounted can have a 
significant impact on the value at which retirement benefit obligations are included in the financial 
statements. The Committee considered a report from management setting out the basis on which the 
2013 assumptions had been determined and benchmarking the Group’s assumptions used in the 2012 
consolidated financial statements against those disclosed by other large corporate entities. The 
Committee concluded that the assumptions recommended, and which were supported by third party 
actuarial advice, were appropriate.
Income taxes Judgements have to be made by management on the tax treatment of a number of transactions in 
advance of the ultimate tax determination being known. In determining the appropriateness of the 
estimates made, the Committee considered a report from management setting out the basis for the 
judgements and also met with the Group’s independent tax advisors, Deloitte LLP, during the year. The 
Committee also discussed with management the basis for determining the extent to which deferred 
tax assets and liabilities were offset against one another in both the current and prior accounting 
period. The Committee concluded that the position taken was appropriate.
Treatment of exceptional 
operating items
The Audit Committee discussed the treatment and disclosure of items included within exceptional 
operating items. In particular, the Committee discussed the treatment of the issue relating to the 
supply from a vendor of non-conforming raw material and agreed that the nature of the item and its 
significance was such that it should be treated as an exceptional operating item. The Committee also 
considered the treatment of other exceptional items and noted they were treated appropriately and 
consistently year on year. The Committee concluded that the treatment and disclosure of exceptional 
operating items was appropriate.
The Committee also discussed each of the above judgements with the external auditors in reaching their conclusions. 45

fee). Fees paid related to services permitted to be provided by 
PwC under the Group’s policy on non-audit services. 
The Group’s policy on non-audit services covers which services 
can be provided and which generally cannot be provided (for 
example internal audit services, tax planning). The full policy is 
disclosed on our website.
On balance, the Committee is satisfied that the overall levels of 
audit-related and non-audit fees are not material relative to the 
income of the office of PwC conducting the audit or PwC as a 
whole and therefore the objectivity and independence of the 
external auditors was not compromised.
Internal audit
The Committee agrees the annual internal audit plan which is 
developed according to a risk assessment process and ensures 
that adequate resources are available to execute the plan. At 
each meeting, the Committee receives a status update on the 
audit programme and reviews, discusses and challenges any 
significant issues arising and monitors implementation by the 
business of the recommendations made. All significant Group 
sites are visited by internal audit at least every three years. In 
2013, internal audits were carried out at a number of Group sites, 
including pre and post-SAP implementation audits and the 
annual audit of the finance shared service centres. It was also 
agreed that additional IT areas would be added to the scope of 
internal audit in 2014.
The Committee met internal audit without executive 
management present. No concerns were raised at the meeting 
and it was confirmed that internal audit had been able to carry 
out their work and offer constructive challenge to executive 
management during the year. 
The Committee considered the effectiveness of internal audit  
and confirmed that they were satisfied. 
Whistleblowing
The Committee is responsible for reviewing the process for 
handling allegations from whistleblowers and has confirmed that 
it is satisfied with the Group’s process. Whistleblowing is covered 
under our Ethics and Business Conduct Policy, which is available 
on our website.
The Group sponsors an independently operated and monitored 
Ethics Line, enabling employees to report concerns about 
possible misconduct, with proportionate and independent 
investigation and appropriate follow-up action. Whistleblowing 
reports are reviewed regularly by the Ethics and Trade 
Compliance Committee of the Board and the Audit Committee is 
responsible for reviewing whistleblowing procedures annually. 
On behalf of the Audit Committee
David Williams
Chairman of the Audit Committee

Key areas of oversight
External audit
The external auditors are PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) 
who were appointed as Group auditors on 2 October 2003 after  
a competitive tender. There are no contractual obligations 
restricting the Committee’s choice of external auditors.
The lead audit partner is Mr A Paynter whose appointment in  
this role commenced with the audit for the financial year ended  
31 December 2013. Mr Paynter has had no previous involvement 
with the Group in any capacity.
The Committee assessed the effectiveness of PwC and the 
external audit process using a questionnaire and a Committee 
discussion on the responses to the questionnaire. The Committee 
was satisfied with PwC’s performance and the external audit 
process and that they had employed an appropriate level of 
professional challenge in fulfilling their role. The Committee has 
determined, on the basis of the satisfactory outcome of the 
evaluation, that the external audit will not be subject to tender  
in 2014. It has recommended that the Board submit the  
re-appointment of PwC to shareholders for approval at the  
AGM in 2014. 
The Committee keeps under review the ongoing legislative 
proposals on audit tendering and rotation from the EU and the 
Competition Commission, and will implement them when they 
become final. These proposals have effectively superseded the 
comply-or-explain provision in the Code, which would have applied 
to the Company for the first time this year. The FRC plans to 
withdraw this tendering provision during 2014. Subject to the 
changing regulatory regime and the Committee continuing to be 
satisfied with the effectiveness of the auditors, which they will 
consider annually, the Group does not expect to put the external 
audit services out for tender before the end of the current audit 
partner rotation period in 2018, i.e. after the audit for the financial 
year ending 31 December 2017. 
The Committee met with PwC without executive management 
present and there were no concerns raised at that meeting. It  
was confirmed that the external auditors had been able to offer 
rigorous and constructive challenge to executive management 
during the year.
Non-audit services
The Group places great importance on the independence of its 
external auditors and is careful to ensure their objectivity is not 
compromised. The Committee agrees the fees paid to external 
auditors for their services as auditors and is required to approve, 
in advance, any fees to the external auditors for non-audit 
services in excess of £0.1 million. Details of the fees paid for 
audit services, audit-related services and non-audit services can 
be found in note 8 to the financial statements. The fees paid for 
non-audit services in 2013 were £0.1 million (6% of the total audit  46 Nominations Committee report
MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013
Terms of reference
The Committee operates within agreed Terms of Reference (last 
updated in 2012 and scheduled for review in 2014) which are on 
our website.
Responsibilities
The Committee reviews the structure, size and composition 
(including the skills, knowledge, experience and diversity)  
of the Board and, in consultation with the directors, makes 
recommendations to the Board on any proposed changes. 
Decisions on Board changes are taken by the Board as a whole. 
In performing its duties, the Committee has access to the 
services of the Company Secretary and may seek external 
professional advice at the Group’s expense.
Board diversity
The Board confirms a strong commitment to diversity (including, 
but not limited to, gender diversity) at all levels of the Group. The 
Board’s policy on diversity commits Meggitt to:
•  Ensuring the selection and appointment process for 
employees and directors includes a diverse range of 
candidates;
•  Aspiring to achieve 25% of Board positions to be filled by 
women by 2015 and monitoring progress in achieving this; 
•  Disclosing statistics on gender diversity in every Annual 
Report (see below and page 34); and
•  Reviewing this policy from time to time and continuing to 
disclose this policy in the Annual Report.
The Board remains committed to ensuring that the directors 
bring a wide range of skills, knowledge, experience, backgrounds 
and perspectives. Our non-executive directors are from the  
UK, US and France, and have a range of different skills and 
experience, from energy to aerospace, financial, technology and 
city backgrounds to an electrical engineer and a serving chief 
executive. At 31 December 2013, 10% of the Board were female. 
The Board will review our Board diversity target in 2014 in light  
of succession planning objectives and will publish any proposed 
changes in our 2014 Annual Report.
External search consultancies
During 2013, the Committee used Russell Reynolds Associates  
to assist in the search for the Chief Financial Officer and  
another senior financial appointment below Board level.  
Russell Reynolds Associates do not have any other connection 
with the Group. 
On behalf of the Nominations Committee
Sir Colin Terry
Chairman of the Nominations Committee
3 March 2014
Chairman’s introduction
The Nominations Committee plays a leading role in assessing 
the balance of skills and experience on the Board and the 
Group’s principal committees. The Committee identifies the 
roles and capabilities required to meet the demands of the 
business and, with due regard to diversity, ensures that a 
succession plan is in place. Candidates continue to be considered 
on merit against specific criteria determined by the Committee.
During 2013, a successor was appointed for Mr Young as Group 
Finance Director, after the announcement on 9 January 2013 of 
his appointment as Chief Executive effective from 1 May 2013. 
Following a rigorous search process using executive search firm 
Russell Reynolds Associates, involving both external and internal 
candidates, Mr Doug Webb was appointed as Chief Financial 
Officer on 6 June 2013. Mr Webb is a chartered accountant and 
was most recently Chief Financial Officer at London Stock 
Exchange Group Plc and, prior to that, Chief Financial Officer at 
QinetiQ Group Plc. Mr Webb’s extensive experience in senior 
international financial positions across a range of industries 
including defence, aerospace, engineering, technology and 
financial services make him an outstanding appointment for the 
role of Chief Financial Officer.
As well as considering matters relating to succession and 
composition, the Committee confirmed it was satisfied with its 
own effectiveness as a result of its 2013 evaluation. 
We announced on 27 February 2014 that David Robins will  
retire from the Board at the end of the 2014 AGM. Throughout  
his time on the Board, David has always offered good advice and 
independent challenge, and we have certainly benefitted from his 
significant financial markets experience. On behalf of the Board, 
I would like to thank David for his appreciable contribution to the 
Board and the Group over the last 12 years. 
In 2014, the Committee will continue to review the composition of 
the Board and succession plans for executive and non-executive 
directors.

MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013
 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION GOVERNANCE REPORTS
Chairman’s introduction and annual statement
It is my pleasure to present the Directors’ remuneration report for the year ended  
31 December 2013. The Remuneration Committee (Committee) hope that you find the 
new layout of the report (incorporating this annual statement, the Policy report and an 
annual report on remuneration) to be clear and transparent. The Policy report and 
annual report on remuneration will be submitted separately to shareholders for 
approval at our AGM on 7 May 2014. Shareholders will separately be asked to approve  
a new Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) which, if approved, will replace the Equity 
Participation Plan (EPP) and Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) from 2014 
onwards.
Pay philosophy
Executive remuneration packages at Meggitt are designed to attract, motivate and 
retain directors of a high calibre, to recognise the international nature of the Group’s 
business and to reward the directors for delivering value to shareholders. The package 
targets fixed pay at market competitive levels to companies of a similar size and with 
similar operating characteristics, supplemented by performance related annual 
bonuses and an equity-based long term incentive plan designed to reward and 
incentivise growth, and provide a strong link to Group and individual performance. 
2013 activity
The key activity of the Committee in 2013 was to review the remuneration package and 
policy for senior executives, taking into account shareholders’ interests and views on pay 
structure simplicity and other areas of good practice, whilst keeping the package and 
policy aligned with our stated pay philosophy. The major changes we consulted on were:
(i) simplifying the long term incentive structure into a single LTIP and introducing 
performance measures which reflect Meggitt’s strategic goals (see page 50);
(ii) introducing annual bonus deferral into shares (see page 49);
(iii) introducing clawback provisions (see pages 49 to 50); and
(iv) increasing directors’ share ownership guidelines (see page 51).
The intended remuneration arrangements for 2014 outlined in this report are based  
on this revised remuneration package and Policy.
2013 performance
Ongoing demand growth in civil original equipment and energy was tempered by 
softness in the civil aftermarket and military, and operational challenges in the year 
caused a further drag on growth. Revenue grew 2% and underlying profit before tax 
grew 3%, driving a 3% increase in underlying EPS to 37.5p. With a strong order book  
and an improving trend in civil aftermarket, there is good momentum going into 2014. 
ESOS awards made in 2011 vested at 76.0% based on three-year cumulative underlying 
EPS performance to 31 December 2013 (see page 59). Performance of the EPP awards 
made in August 2011, where vesting has not yet been confirmed, is shown on page 58. 
The Committee has used its discretion to reduce the vesting outcome under the Short 
Term Incentive Plan (STIP) (for 2013 performance) and ESOS and EPP (for the EPS 
element of awards vesting in 2014) in relation to the supply from a vendor of non-
conforming raw material in 2012, which was discovered in 2013 and impacted our 
customers. This issue was caused by a process failure at a properly qualified supplier, 
and was recovered by the Group with all necessary diligence. However, the Committee 
feels the financial impact felt by shareholders should be recognised and has therefore 
used its discretion to reduce the STIP and LTIP (see annual report on remuneration). 
This Directors’ remuneration report has been prepared in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013.  
The report meets the requirements of the UK Listing Authority’s Listing Rules and  
the Disclosure and Transparency Rules. In this report we describe how the principles 
relating to directors’ remuneration, as set out in the Code, are applied in practice. The 
Committee confirms that throughout the financial year the Company has complied with 
the Code. We have identified which sections of the report are audited.

The Policy report
This section of the report sets out the Remuneration Policy for the directors, which shareholders will be asked to approve at the 2014 
AGM. The Committee intends that the Policy will come into effect from our AGM on 7 May 2014. 
Executive Director Remuneration Policy Table
Base salary
Function To attract and retain talent by ensuring base salaries are competitive in the relevant talent market.
Operation Salary will be reviewed by the Committee annually, in February, with changes effective from 1 April of that year. 
Salaries for the year under review are disclosed in the annual report on remuneration.
In deciding salary levels, the Committee considers personal performance including how the individual has helped 
to support the strategic objectives of the Group. The Committee will also consider employment conditions and 
salary levels across the Group, and prevailing market conditions.
Salaries are paid to existing directors in GBP; however the Committee reserves the right to pay future and 
existing directors in any other currency (converted at the prevailing market rate when a change is agreed). 
Opportunity It is not anticipated that percentage salary increases for executive directors will exceed those of the wider 
workforce over the period this Policy will apply. Where increases are awarded in excess of the wider employee 
population, for example if there is a material change in the responsibility, size or complexity of the role, the 
Committee will provide the rationale in the relevant year’s annual report on remuneration.
Performance 
metrics
None explicitly, but salaries are independently benchmarked periodically against FTSE companies in similar 
industries and those with similar market capitalisation. Personal performance is also taken into account when 
considering salary increases.
 
Pension
Function To provide post-retirement benefits for executive directors in a cost-efficient manner.
Operation The pension plans operated by the Group which executive directors are, or could be, members of are: 
– Meggitt Pension Plan (defined benefit pension plan, closed to new members). 
– Meggitt Workplace Savings Plan (defined contribution personal pension scheme, open to new members). 
Salary is the only element of remuneration that is pensionable. There are no unfunded pension promises or 
similar arrangements for directors.
Opportunity From 2013, it has been our Policy that new executive director external appointments (including Mr Webb) are eligible 
for a pension allowance of 25% of salary, payable either as pension contribution up to any limit set in current 
regulations or, above such limits, in cash. Where agreements have been made prior to the approval of this Policy 
which entitle an executive to receive a pension allowance higher than 25% of salary, pension allowances up to a 
maximum of 50% of salary, will be paid; Mr Young and Mr Green had agreements prior to the approval of this Policy 
which entitles them to receive a pension allowance of 50% of salary and this arrangement will continue for these 
directors.

Benefits
Function To provide non-cash benefits which are competitive in the market in which the executive director is employed. 
Operation The Group may provide benefits including, but not limited to, a company car or car allowance, private medical 
insurance, permanent health insurance, life assurance, a fuel allowance, a mobile phone, relocation costs and 
any other future benefits made available either to all employees globally or all employees in the region in which 
the executive director is employed. 
Opportunity Benefits vary by role and individual circumstances; eligibility and cost is reviewed periodically. Benefits in respect 
of the year under review are disclosed in the annual report on remuneration. It is not anticipated that the costs of 
benefits provided will increase significantly in the financial years over which this Policy will apply, although the 
Committee retains discretion to approve a higher cost in exceptional circumstances (e.g. to facilitate recruitment, 
relocation, expatriation etc) or in circumstances where factors outside the Group’s control have changed 
materially (e.g. market increases in insurance costs).
Performance 
metrics
None.
Annual bonus - STIP
Function To incentivise executive directors on delivering annual financial and personal targets.
Operation Performance measures, targets and weightings are set at the start of the year.
The performance period of the STIP is a financial year. After the end of the financial year, to the extent that the 
performance criteria have been met, 75% of the STIP award is paid in cash to the director. The remaining 25% of 
the award will be deferred into shares and released (with no further performance conditions attached, and no 
matching shares provided) after a further period of two years.
The Committee will have the discretion to apply clawback to reduce the size of deferred STIP awards in the event 
of a material misstatement of results or personal misconduct, and such awards will lapse in certain leaver 
circumstances (see page 54 for details).
Opportunity The STIP provides for a maximum award opportunity of up to 150% of salary in normal circumstances with an 
on-target opportunity of 100% of salary and an opportunity of 50% of salary at threshold for any single measure. 
The Committee has discretion to make a STIP award of up to 200% of salary in exceptional circumstances (e.g.  
a substantial contract win which has a significant positive financial impact in the long term but which has no, or 
negative, short term financial impact). Dividends accrue on unvested deferred STIP awards over the vesting 
period and are released on the vesting date.
Performance 
metrics
STIP awards are based on the achievement of financial and personal performance targets. For the executive 
directors, two thirds of the STIP will be weighted to financial performance, with the remainder subject to personal 
performance. The relative weightings of the financial and personal elements for any STIP period, and the 
measures used to assess financial and non-financial performance, will be set by the Committee in its absolute 
discretion to align with the Group’s operating and strategic priorities for that year.
The award for performance under each element of the STIP will be calculated independently. The Committee will 
have discretion to review the consistency of the pay-out of the financial and personal elements and adjust the 
total up or down (within the levels specified above) if it does not consider this to be a fair reflection of the 
underlying performance of the Group or the individual. 
The personal performance element will typically be based on three to five objectives relevant to the executive’s 
role.
Details of the measures, weightings and targets applicable to the STIP for each year, including a description of 
how they were chosen and whether they were met, will be disclosed retrospectively in the annual report on 
remuneration for the following year (subject to commercial sensitivity). 50 Directors’ remuneration report continued
MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)—subject to shareholder approval
Function To align the interests of executive directors with shareholders in growing the value of the Group over the long 
term.
Operation The LTIP, the introduction of which is subject to shareholder approval at the 2014 AGM, would replace the EPP and 
ESOS. Under the LTIP, executive directors will be eligible to receive annual awards over Meggitt shares vesting 
after three years subject to the achievement of stretching performance targets. 
Whilst it is the current intention that LTIP awards will be in the form of nil cost options, the LTIP provides, at the 
absolute discretion of the Committee, for awards over conditional shares, market value share options and 
phantom awards.
The Committee will have the discretion to apply clawback to reduce the size of unvested LTIP awards in the event 
of a material misstatement of results or personal misconduct.
Opportunity Executive directors will normally be eligible for annual LTIP awards of 220% of salary. Awards up to a maximum 
of 300% of salary may be granted in exceptional circumstances (e.g. to support the recruitment of a key executive 
or to recognise exceptional individual performance). The award opportunity under the LTIP has been calibrated to 
be equivalent, in fair value terms, to that granted in aggregate under the previous EPP/ESOS structure.
30% of an award will vest if performance against each performance condition is at threshold and 100% if it is at 
maximum, with straight line vesting in between.
Dividends accrue on unvested LTIP awards over the vesting period and are released, to the extent the LTIP award 
vests, on the vesting/exercise date.
Performance 
metrics
Vesting of LTIP awards is subject to continued employment and performance against three measures, which are 
intended to be as follows:
• Earnings per Share (EPS);
• Return on Trading Assets (ROTA), which is underlying operating profit after tax divided by net trading assets, 
measured at constant currency. Net trading assets are adjusted to exclude goodwill and other intangibles 
arising on the acquisition of a business, derivative financial instruments, retirement benefit obligations, 
deferred tax and net debt; and
• Strategic goals (typically to be based on three strategic priorities around execution, growth and innovation).
The way these measures link to our KPIs can be seen on pages 18 to 21. It is the current intention that the 
weighting of the measures will be equal (i.e. one third each) but that the Committee will consider, and adjust if 
deemed appropriate, the weighting at the start of each LTIP cycle. Any commercially-sensitive information on 
measures, targets and performance will be disclosed retrospectively.
Awards made under the LTIP will have a performance period of three financial years, starting from 1 January of 
the year in which the award is made and ending on 31 December of the third year. If no entitlement has been 
earned at the end of the relevant performance period, awards will lapse. 
Vesting of the strategic element will also be subject to a discretionary assessment by the Committee of the extent 
to which achievement of the strategic objectives is consistent with the underlying financial performance over the 
three-year period.
The measures and targets in operation for grants made under the ESOS and EPP in the current year, and which 
are not deemed commercially sensitive are disclosed in the annual report on remuneration. 
Sharesave Scheme and Share Incentive Plan
Function To align the interests of employees and shareholders by encouraging all employees to own Meggitt shares.
Operation Sharesave—All employee scheme under which all UK employees (including executive directors) may save up to 
the maximum monthly savings limit (as determined by legislation) over a period of three or five years. Options 
under the Sharesave Scheme are granted at a discount of up to 20% to the market value of shares at the date of 
grant.
Share Incentive Plan—All employee scheme under which (i) all UK employees (including executive directors) may 
contribute up to the monthly maximum (as determined by legislation) to purchase shares monthly from pre-tax 
pay; and (ii) all UK employees (including executive directors) may receive free shares up to the annual maximum 
value (as determined by legislation).
Opportunity Savings, contributions and free shares are capped at the prevailing legislative limit at the time UK employees are 
invited to participate.

Notes to the Policy table
The Committee is satisfied that the above Policy is in the best interests of shareholders and does not promote excessive risk-taking. 
The Committee retains discretion to make minor, non-significant changes to the Policy without reverting to shareholders.
Payments from outstanding awards
Outstanding awards are currently held by the directors under the EPP and the ESOS, the Group’s long term incentives operated prior 
to the introduction of the proposed LTIP in 2014. These awards will continue to vest (subject to performance conditions being met) 
and be capable of exercise during the period over which this Policy applies. The tables on pages 66 to 67 highlight outstanding and 
vested awards.
Approach to target setting and performance measure selection
Targets applying to the STIP and LTIP are reviewed annually, based on a number of internal and external reference points, including 
the Group’s strategic plan, analyst forecasts for Meggitt and its sector comparators, historical growth achieved by Meggitt and its 
sector comparators and external expectations for growth in Meggitt’s markets. 
STIP
The performance measures used under the STIP reflect financial targets for the year and non-financial performance objectives. The 
Policy provides the Committee with flexibility to select appropriate measures on an annual basis.
STIP performance targets are set to be stretching but achievable, with regard to the particular personal performance objectives and 
the economic environment in a given year. For financial measures, ‘target’ is based around the annual budget approved by the Board. 
Prior to the start of the financial year, the Committee sets an appropriate performance range around target, which it considers 
provides an appropriate degree of ‘stretch’ challenge and an incentive to outperform.
LTIP
It is proposed that the vesting of future LTIP awards is linked to EPS, ROTA and the achievement of long-term strategic goals.
EPS is considered by the Board to be the most important measure of Meggitt’s financial performance. It is highly visible internally,  
is regularly monitored and reported, and is strongly motivational for participants. EPS targets will continue to be set on a nominal 
cumulative (pence) basis to incentivise consistent performance and reflect the fact that Meggitt’s profits are generated to a large 
degree outside the UK and not significantly influenced by UK retail price inflation.
ROTA helps to balance the achievement of growth and returns. The Committee believes ROTA is a good internal proxy for total 
shareholder return (TSR) which focuses executives on managing the balance sheet and Meggitt’s operational performance, whilst 
also being less remote for participants below Board level. The definition of net trading assets for ROTA excludes goodwill and other 
intangible assets arising when a business is acquired, to reflect that acquisitions are not within the control of the majority of 
participants. In order to safeguard against poor acquisitions the Committee has overall discretion to reduce the outcome under the 
ROTA element if in its opinion the outcome does not reflect the underlying financial performance of the Group. The performance of 
acquisitions against Board approved targets is also monitored separately. 
The Committee believes that the strategic goals component will help reinforce the realisation of Group strategy and the achievement 
of key non-financial and strategic goals over long product cycles which drive long-term value at Meggitt. The element will typically 
comprise a scorecard of three-year targets across a maximum of three core strategic areas for the Group. The Committee believes 
that this approach will enable it to reflect the Group’s long-term nature and shifting strategic priorities in the LTIP to ensure 
executives’ interests remain closely aligned with those of our shareholders over time. Specific measures and targets for each area 
will be developed and clearly defined at the start of each three-year cycle to balance leading and lagging indicators of performance. 
Vesting of this element is subject to a discretionary assessment by the Committee of the extent to which achievement of the strategic 
objectives is consistent with Meggitt’s underlying financial performance over the performance period.
Remuneration policy for other employees
The remuneration policy for other employees is based on broadly consistent principles as that for executive directors. Annual salary 
reviews take into account Group performance, local pay and market conditions, and salary levels for similar roles in comparable 
companies. Some employees below executive level are eligible to participate in annual bonus schemes; opportunities and 
performance measures vary by organisational level, geographical region and an individual’s role. Senior executives are eligible for 
LTIP on similar terms as the executive directors, although award opportunities are lower and vary by organisational level. All UK 
employees are eligible to participate in the Sharesave Scheme and Share Incentive Plan on identical terms.
Share ownership guidelines
During the year, the Committee increased the minimum shareholding guidelines for executive directors from 100% to 300% of base 
salary for the Chief Executive and from 100% to 200% of base salary for each of the other executive directors. There is no set time 
frame within which directors have to meet the guideline, however until they meet the guideline they are not permitted to sell more 
than 50% of the after-tax value of a vested share award. The shareholding requirement ceases when a director leaves the Group. 
Further information on the shareholding requirement is in the annual remuneration report (see page 65). 52 Directors’ remuneration report continued

Potential reward opportunities are based on Policy, applied to 2014 base salaries and 2014 incentive opportunities. Note that the LTIP 
awards granted in a year will not normally vest until the third anniversary of the date of grant, and the projected value excludes the 
impact of share price movement or dividend accrual.
The ‘Maximum’ scenario reflects fixed remuneration (salary and benefits and pension), plus maximum payout under all incentives 
(150% of salary under the STIP, and full vesting of LTIP awards).
The ‘On-target’ scenario reflects fixed remuneration as above, plus target STIP (based on two-thirds of maximum opportunity) and 
LTIP threshold vesting (30% vesting). 
The ‘Minimum’ scenario reflects fixed remuneration only, being the only elements of the executive directors’ remuneration package 
not linked to performance.
Non-executive directors’ remuneration policy table
Non-executive directors are submitted for re-election annually, do not have a contract of service and are not eligible to join the 
Group’s pension or share schemes. Details of the Policy on fees paid to our non-executive directors are set out in the table below:
Fees
Function To attract and retain non-executive directors of the highest calibre with broad commercial and other experience 
relevant to the Group.
Operation Fee levels are reviewed annually, with any adjustments effective 1 April each year. The fees paid to the Chairman 
of the Board are determined by the Committee, while the fees for all other non-executive directors are reviewed 
by a committee of the Board formed of executive directors. Fees for the year under review and for the current 
year are disclosed in the annual report on remuneration.
Additional fees are paid to the chairmen of the Remuneration and Audit Committee and to the Senior Independent 
Director, to reflect the additional time commitment of these roles.
In deciding fee increases, the committees consider employment conditions and salary increases across the 
Group, and prevailing market conditions.
Currently, all fees are paid in GBP, however the committees reserve the right to pay future and existing non-
executive directors in any other currency (converted at the prevailing market rate when a change is agreed) .
Opportunity Fee increases will be applied taking into account the outcome of the annual review. The maximum aggregate 
annual fee for all non-executive directors (including the Chairman) as provided in the Company’s Articles of 
Association is £1,000,000.

Recruitment
External appointments
In cases of hiring or appointing a new executive director from outside the Group, the Committee may make use of all existing 
components of remuneration, as follows:
Component Approach
Maximum annual 
grant value
Base salary The base salaries of new appointees will be determined based on the experience and skills 
of the individual, internal comparisons, employment conditions and salary levels across 
the Group, and prevailing market conditions. Initial salaries may be set below market and 
consideration given to phasing any increases over two or three years subject to 
development in the role.
N/A

Workplace Savings Plan (defined contribution plan) or receive a cash pension allowance of 
25% of salary in lieu.

STIP The structure described in the Policy table will apply to new appointees with the relevant 
maximum being pro-rated to reflect the proportion of employment over the year. Targets

150% of salary  
(200% in exceptional 
circumstances)
LTIP New executive director appointees will be granted awards under the LTIP on similar terms 
as other executives, as described in the Policy table.
220% of salary 
(300% in exceptional 
circumstances)
In determining the appropriate remuneration structure and levels, the Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors to 
ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of Meggitt and its shareholders. The Committee may make an award in respect of 
a new appointment to ‘buy out’ incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer, i.e. over and above the approach 
outlined in the table above. Any such compensatory awards will be made under existing share schemes, where appropriate, and will 
be subject to the normal performance conditions of those schemes. 
The Committee may also consider it appropriate to structure ‘buy-out’ awards differently to the structure described in the Policy 
table, exercising the discretion available under UKLA Listing Rule 9.4.2 R where necessary to make a one-off award to an executive 
director in the context of recruitment. In doing so, the Committee will consider relevant factors including any performance conditions 
attached to these awards, the likelihood of those conditions being met and the proportion of the vesting period remaining. The value 
of any such buy-out will be fully disclosed.
Internal promotion
In cases of appointing a new executive director by way of internal promotion, the Policy will be consistent with that for external 
appointees, as detailed above. Any commitments made prior to an individual’s promotion will continue to be honoured even if they 
would not otherwise be consistent with the Policy prevailing when the commitment is fulfilled, although the Group may, where 
appropriate, seek to revise an individual’s existing service contract on promotion to ensure it aligns with other executive directors 
and prevailing market best practice; in 2013, the Committee reviewed Mr Young’s service contract, which was subsequently updated 
on 1 May, on his promotion to Chief Executive.
Disclosure on the remuneration structure of any new executive director, including details of any exceptional payments will be 
disclosed in the RIS notification made at the time of appointment and in the annual report on remuneration for the year in which the 
recruitment occurred.
Non-executive directors
In recruiting a new non-executive director, the Committee will use the Policy as set out in the table on page 52. 54 Directors’ remuneration report continued
MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013
Service contracts and exit payment policy
Executive director service contracts, including arrangements for early termination, are carefully considered by the Committee and 
are designed to recruit, retain and motivate directors of the quality required to manage the Group.
The Committee’s Policy is that executive director service contracts should be terminable on no more than 12 months’ notice. The 
Committee’s approach to payments in the event of termination of employment of a director is to take account of the particular 
circumstances, including the reasons for termination, individual performance, contractual obligations and the rules of the Group’s 
applicable incentive plans which apply to share awards held by the executive directors:
•  Compensation for loss of office in service contracts 
Except as set out in the table below, under the terms of their service contracts, the executive directors may be required to work during 
their notice period or may, if the Company decides, be paid in lieu of notice if not required to work the full notice period. Payment in 
lieu of notice will be equal to base salary plus the cost to the Group of providing the contractual benefits (pensions allowance, health 
insurance and company car or car allowance) that would otherwise have been paid or provided during the notice period. Payments will 
be in equal monthly instalments and will be subject to mitigation such that payments will either reduce, or stop completely, if the 
executive director obtains alternative employment. 
  An executive director’s employment can be terminated by the Group without notice or payment in lieu of notice in specific 
circumstances including summary dismissal, bankruptcy or resignation. 
•  Treatment of STIP 
Executive directors have no automatic entitlement to any bonus on termination of employment under the STIP, but the Committee 
may use its discretion to award a bonus (normally pro-rated). 
  Where any bonus is deferred into shares, the award will normally lapse if an executive director’s employment terminates unless 
the executive director leaves for specified ‘good leaver’ reasons. The ‘good leaver’ reasons are death, redundancy, retirement, 
injury, disability, the business or company which employs the executive director ceasing to be part of the Group, any other 
circumstances in which the Committee exercises discretion to treat the executive director as a ‘good leaver’ or on a change of 
control. If the executive director is a ‘good leaver’ their award will vest on the normal vesting date, or earlier on a change of control, 
and would not be subject to pro-rating.
•  Treatment of long term incentive plan awards 
The treatment of awards under the ESOS and the EPP is governed by the rules of plans which have been approved by shareholders 
and is described below. Similar treatment will apply under the new LTIP which shareholders are being asked to approve at the  
2014 AGM.
  Awards under the plans will normally lapse if an executive director’s employment terminates unless the executive director leaves 
for specified ‘good leaver’ reasons. The ‘good leaver’ reasons are the same as described above. If the executive director is a ‘good 
leaver’, awards will vest to the extent that the attached performance conditions are met, but on a time pro-rated basis, with 
Committee discretion to allow early vesting. Under the EPP and ESOS awards vest as soon as practicable after an employee has 
left. Under the LTIP awards will vest on the normal vesting date. 55

12 months 6 months Mr Green’s service contract was entered into before 27 June 
2012 and has not been modified or renewed after that date. As 
such, remuneration or payments for loss of office that are 
required to be made under Mr Green’s service contract are 
not required to be consistent with the Policy set out above. 
Payments to Mr Green under his service contract differ from 
the Policy set out above in the following respects: 
On termination of employment, Mr Green is entitled to a 
liquidated damages payment equal to his salary and the value 
of his contractual benefits (bonus, pension allowance, 
insurance and company car or car allowance) at the date of 
termination, pro-rated to the remaining notice period less an 
amount equal to 5% of the aggregate sum and the Committee 
shall exercise its discretion under the Group’s share plans to 
treat Mr Green as a ‘good leaver’. 
On change of control, Mr Green may give notice to terminate 
his employment within 6 months of the event and upon such 
termination he shall become entitled to the liquidated 
damages payment summarised above. 
External appointments held by executive directors
The Board believes that the Group can benefit from experience gained when executive directors hold external non-executive 
directorships. Executive directors are allowed to hold external appointments and to receive payment provided such appointments are 
agreed by the Board or Committee in advance, there are no conflicts of interests and the appointment does not lead to deterioration 
in the individual’s performance. Details of external appointments and the associated fees received are included in the annual report 
on remuneration on page 64.
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Company 
The Committee does not consult with employees specifically on executive remuneration policy and framework but does seek to 
promote and maintain good relations with employee representative bodies—including trade unions and works councils—as part of its 
broader employee engagement strategy and consults on matters affecting employees and business performance as required in each 
case by law and regulation in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates. Salary increases made elsewhere in the Group are 
amongst the data that the Committee considers in determining salaries for executive directors. 
Consideration of shareholder views 
The Committee considers shareholder views received during the year and at the AGM each year, as well as guidance from 
shareholder representative bodies more broadly. The majority of shareholders continue to express support of remuneration 
arrangements at Meggitt.  56 Directors’ remuneration report continued

During the year, the Committee’s independent remuneration advisor was Kepler Associates (‘Kepler’). Kepler, appointed in 2010, was 
selected by the Committee as a result of a competitive tender process. The Committee evaluates the support provided by Kepler 
annually and is comfortable that they provide independent remuneration advice to the Committee. Kepler provide guidance on 
remuneration matters at Board level and below. Kepler do not have any other connection with the Group. Kepler is a member of the 
Remuneration Consultants Group and adheres to its code of conduct (www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com). Their total fees in 
2013 were £87,000.
Shareholder consultation and 2013 AGM voting 
A consultation letter was issued in October 2013 to our top 20 shareholders covering over 65% of our shareholder base on a revised 
remuneration package and policy, principally covering the proposed introduction of bonus deferral arrangements and a new LTIP 
(with clawback provisions attached to both), on which we received positive feedback from most of these investors. We issued a 
second letter in December 2013 with clarifications, particularly related to LTIP performance measures. The majority of responses 
were supportive and therefore the Committee agreed to propose the Policy unchanged for shareholder approval at the AGM.
Following feedback received from investor advisory bodies in advance of the 2013 AGM, the Committee also reviewed the level of 
pension contribution for Mr Young and Mr Green (50% of salary). These arrangements reflect contractual provisions to participate in 
the Meggitt Pension Plan (MPP), a defined benefit scheme. On reaching the government’s Lifetime Allowance (which Mr Young and Mr 
Green both reached in April 2012), executives may cease accruing further benefit under the MPP and receive the 50% allowance on 
their full salary. As part of the wider review of executive remuneration, the Committee considered ways to address this concern. The 
Committee decided that rather than rebalance the package (e.g. through significant salary increases or higher incentive 
opportunities), it was simpler and more equitable to make no changes to these legacy pension arrangements. As stated in the Policy 
report, however, pension contributions for new executive directors (as provided to Mr Webb) will be limited to 25% of salary.

 Mr Twigger was a director of the Company from 1 January 2013 until 1 May 2013, but continued as an employee until 30 June 2013. Remuneration 
received as a result of his role as CEO is disclosed in this table. Details of remuneration for the period 1 May to 30 June 2013 is disclosed under 
payments to past directors on page 62.

 EPP is calculated as the number of shares vesting based on performance measures substantially completed during the year, valued at the market 
value of the shares. For 2013, the figure represents the vesting outcome of the EPS element of the 2011 EPP award (the performance period ended on 
31 December 2013) and an estimate of the outcome under the TSR element of the 2011 EPP award (the performance period of which will end in August 
2014) based on performance to 31 December 2013. The market value of vested shares is based on the average share price over the last quarter of 2013 
of 526.38p. For 2012, the figure represents the actual vesting outcome of 2010 EPP award valued at the share price on the date of vesting (533.00p on 
16 August 2013). The valuation of the 2011 EPP award will be updated for the actual vesting outcome of the TSR element in August 2014 and the share 
price on date of vesting (17 August 2014) in next year’s annual report on remuneration. Further details on performance criteria, achievement and 
resulting vesting levels can be found on pages 58 to 59. 
5
 ESOS is calculated as the number of shares vesting based on performance measures substantially completed during the year, valued at the difference 
between the market value of the shares and the exercise price of the award. For 2013, the figure represents the vesting outcome of the 2011 award. The 
market value of vested shares is based on the average share price over the last quarter of 2013 of 526.38p and an exercise price of 351.70p. For 2012, 
the 2010 award vested at 100% and the market value and exercise price were 489.70p and 286.10p respectively. The valuation of the 2011 ESOS award 
will be amended for the share price on date of vesting (2 March 2014) in next year’s annual report on remuneration. Further details on performance 
criteria, achievement and resulting vesting levels can be found on page 59.

2010 EPP 
As disclosed in the 2012 Remuneration report, the Committee determined that 50% of the 2010 EPP award subject to the three-year 
cumulative underlying EPS performance condition vested in full, based on performance to 31 December 2012. The remaining 50% of the 
award was dependent on the Group’s TSR performance compared to a group of 17 international aerospace and defence companies over 
the three-year period to 16 August 2013. TSR for all comparator companies is measured on a common currency basis.

Following confirmation of the vesting outcome of this TSR element, the overall vesting outcome for the 2010 EPP award (taking into 
consideration the outcomes of both the EPS and TSR elements) is 87.9% of maximum.
To allow for comparability going forward, the Committee has elected to capture the vesting of the entire 2010 EPP award in the

 Based on 2013 salary.
Consistent with awards made in 2012, vesting of EPP awards granted in 2013 is dependent on the achievement of three-year targets 
relating to cumulative underlying EPS, cash conversion and relative TSR outperformance. The three-year period over which 
performance will be measured will be the three financial years ending 31 December 2015. This includes the performance period for the 
TSR element, which the Committee considered it appropriate to align with the other performance measures. The performance 
measures are as follows:

Total pension entitlements (audited)
The table below sets out details of the pension entitlements under the Meggitt Pension Plan (MPP) for Mr Young, Mr Green and Mr 
Twigger (until his retirement from the Board on 1 May 2013). 
Under the MPP, Mr Young, Mr Green and Mr Twigger accrued defined benefits at 3% of salary per annum up to the Scheme Cap and 
were entitled to a cash supplement equivalent to 50% of salary above the Scheme Cap. Since reaching the government’s Lifetime 
Allowance Mr Young, Mr Green and Mr Twigger ceased accruing further benefit under the MPP and received a 50% pension allowance 
on their full salary. 
Mr Young and Mr Green both reached the Lifetime Allowance in April 2012 and ceased to accrue further benefit under the MPP and 
instead received a 50% allowance on their full salary. Mr Twigger also received a 50% of pension allowance on his full salary until he 
retired from his employment with the Company on 30 June 2013. 
Mr Young and Mr Green’s dependants remain eligible for dependants’ pensions and the payment of a lump sum on death in service.

Mr Twigger ceased to be a director on 1 May 2013, and retired on 30 June 2013. Details of Mr Twigger’s remuneration for the period  
1 January to 1 May 2013 (including the full value of long-term incentive awards that vested on his retirement from the Group) are 
disclosed in the single total figure of remuneration table on page 57. For the period 1 May to 30 June 2013, Mr Twigger continued to 
receive base pay and contractual benefits, and was eligible to receive a pro-rated STIP award for this additional period worked; in 
total, this amounted to £209,000.
Review of past performance
The remuneration package is structured to help ensure alignment with shareholders. There is no direct correlation between share 
price movement and the change in the value of the pay package in any one year (as the remuneration package comprises several 
components, some fixed, and others based on non-financial measures) the charts below show how the CEO’s pay has been sensitive 
to the share price over the last five years. 
This graph illustrates the Company’s performance compared to the FTSE100 Index, which is considered the most appropriate broad 
equity market index against which the Group’s performance should be measured. Performance, as required by legislation, is 
measured by TSR over the five year period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2013:

This year, salary adjustments have been harmonised at 1 April across the Group where possible. Where this has delayed an 
adjustment from January to April, the award has been prorated by 15/12ths: i.e. for a 3% adjustment in January, this is commuted to a 
3.75% adjustment in April. This has been applied to the salary awards for Mr Young and Mr Webb. Mr Green’s salary continues to be 
below competitive levels and it was agreed to increase his salary by 5.85%. 
For context, salary adjustments across the Group vary from region to region according to local salary inflation; in the UK and the US 
this is 3%, which will be prorated to 3.75% when applied to the 15 month period described above.
Pension and benefits
There were no changes in pension contribution rates or benefit provision.

dividend. During 2013, the Company made the Meggitt PLC  
share dividend plan available for the dividends paid in May 2013 
(the final dividend for 2012) and in October 2013 (the interim 
dividend for 2013). The cash dividend necessary to give an 
entitlement to one new ordinary share was fixed at 482.02p  
and 534.80p respectively. 69

resolution. The directors may exercise all the powers of the 
Company subject to the provisions of relevant legislation, the 
Articles and any directions given by the Company in general 
meeting. 
The powers of the directors include those in relation to the issue 
and buyback of shares. At each AGM, the shareholders are 
requested to renew the directors’ powers to allot securities in the 
Company up to the value specified in the notice of meeting and to 
renew the directors’ powers to allot securities without the 
application of pre-emption rights up to the value specified in the 
notice of meeting in accordance with the Articles. The Company 
can seek authority from the shareholders at the AGM to purchase 
its own shares.
The Group has significant financing agreements which include 
change of control provisions which, should there be a change of 
ownership of the Company, could result in renegotiation, 
withdrawal or early repayment of these financing agreements. 
These are a USD 400 million revolving credit agreement dated 
July 2012, a USD 700 million revolving credit agreement dated 
April 2011, a USD 600 million note purchase agreement dated 
June 2010 and a USD 250 million note purchase agreement dated 
June 2003. 
There are a number of other long-term commercial agreements 
that may alter or terminate upon a change of control of the 
Company following a successful takeover bid. These 
arrangements are commercially confidential and their disclosure 
could be seriously prejudicial to the Company.  70

Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, 
the Directors’ remuneration report and the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations. Company law 
requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the directors have elected to 
prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the EU and the Company financial statements in 
accordance with UK GAAP. Under company law, the directors 
must not approve the financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the 
Group for that period. 
In preparing these financial statements, the directors are 
required to:
•  select suitable accounting policies and apply them 
consistently;
•  make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; and
•  state whether IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the UK have 
been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the Group and Company financial statements 
respectively.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to: (i) show and explain the Group’s 
and the Company’s transactions; (ii) disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and the 
Company; and (iii) enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements and the Directors’ remuneration report comply with 
the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the International Accounting Standards 
Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Group and the Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.  71

 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION GOVERNANCE REPORTS
Overview of our audit approach
Materiality
We set certain thresholds for materiality. These helped us to determine 
the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate 
the effect of any misstatements, both individually and on the financial 
statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for 
the Group financial statements as a whole to be £14 million, which 
represents approximately 5% of profit before tax. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them any 
misstatements identified during our audit above £500,000 as well as 
misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted 
reporting for qualitative reasons.
Overview of the scope of our audit
The Group financial statements are a consolidation of a significant 
number of reporting units, comprising the Group’s operating 
businesses and centralised functions. In establishing our approach  
to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be 
performed at the reporting units by us, as the group engagement team, 
or other audit teams within PwC UK and from other PwC network firms 
operating under our instruction. Where the work was performed by 
other audit teams, we determined the level of involvement we needed 
to have in the audit work at those reporting units to be able to conclude 
whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a 
basis for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our assessment of significance and risk a full scope audit 
was performed over the complete financial information of 11 reporting 
units, and targeted audit procedures over specific balances or 
transactions were performed at a further 21 reporting units. Together 
these 32 reporting units accounted for 91% of Group profit before tax. 
This together with additional procedures performed at the Group level, 
including testing the consolidation process, gave us sufficient 
appropriate audit evidence for our opinion on the Group financial 
statements as a whole. 
Areas of particular audit focus
In preparing the financial statements, the directors made a number  
of subjective judgements, for example over significant accounting 
estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future 
events that are inherently uncertain. We primarily focused our work in 
these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available 
evidence, forming our own judgements and evaluating the disclosures 
in the financial statements.
In our audit, we tested and examined information, using sampling and 
other auditing techniques, to the extent we considered necessary to 
provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtained 
audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, 
substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
We considered the following areas to be those that required particular 
focus in the current year. This is not a complete list of all risks or areas 
of focus identified by our audit. We discussed these areas of focus with 
the Audit Committee. Their report on those matters that they 
considered to be significant issues in relation to the financial 
statements is set out on page 44. 
Report on the Group financial statements
Our opinion 
In our opinion the Group financial statements, defined below:
•  give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at  
31 December 2013 and of the Group’s profit and cash flows for the 
year then ended;
•  have been properly prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union; and 
•  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder 
of this report.
What we have audited
The Group financial statements, which are prepared by Meggitt PLC, 
comprise:
• the Consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2013;
•  the Consolidated income statement and Consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income for the year then ended;
•  the Consolidated statement of changes in equity and Consolidated 
cash flow statement for the year then ended; and
•  the notes to the Group financial statements, which include a 
summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory 
information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation comprises applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union.
Certain disclosures required by the financial reporting framework have 
been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report, rather than in the 
notes to the financial statements. These are cross-referenced from the 
financial statements and are identified as audited.
What an audit of financial statements involves 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards  
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’). An audit involves 
obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:
•  whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed;
•  the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We read all the financial and non-financial information in the ‘Annual 
Report and Accounts’ (the ‘Annual Report’) to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited Group financial statements and to 
identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based  
on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications 
for our report.
Independent auditors’ report to the  
members of Meggitt PLC 72
MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013
Area of focus How the scope of our audit addressed the area of focus
Valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill and intangible assets represent the largest assets 
within the Group’s balance sheet.
The directors’ assessment of the carrying value of goodwill 
and intangible assets and the annual impairment review the 
directors are required to perform is described in notes 18 to 20 
of the financial statements.
This assessment of the carrying value of these assets is 
inherently subjective due to the judgement involved in estimating 
future cash flows and in calculating the discount rate to apply to 
these cash flows.
Our work included testing management’s impairment models including the cash 
flows and evaluating and corroborating key inputs used in these models.
We performed sensitivity analysis over the significant assumptions used in 
the models to ascertain the point at which an impairment would be triggered, 
and considered the likelihood of such a change in the key assumptions, either 
individually or in aggregate. The significant assumptions included forecast sales 
over the next five years, the discount rate and the terminal growth rate.
We read the disclosures in the financial statements included in note 18 in 
respect of management’s impairment testing and considered whether these 
were consistent with the conclusions of our audit work and met the disclosure 
requirements of the relevant accounting standards.
Provisions for environmental, legal and other matters
The Group has a number of material provisions in respect of 
environmental, legal and other matters. These are set out in 
note 31 to the financial statements. These provisions require 
the directors to make estimates of the likely future cash flows 
that will be required to settle the Group’s obligations. These 
estimates are inherently subjective and therefore give rise to 
greater audit risk.
The Group has an experienced team who are responsible for managing 
environmental, legal and other matters and this expertise is supplemented by 
the use of external third party experts where appropriate. Our audit procedures 
included an assessment of the experience and expertise of those third parties 
involved in determining the provisions, and the scope of their work. 
We evaluated the existing obligations of the Group, corroborating key facts 
surrounding these obligations (including obtaining third party expert reports 
from the Group’s external specialists where appropriate), assessed the extent of 
any insurance coverage and tested the associated provisions – for example we 
recalculated provisions and independently assessed future cost estimates. We also 
used our own experience of similar situations to develop an independent view of 
the adequacy of the provisions.
Risk of fraud in revenue recognition 
ISAs (UK & Ireland) presume there is a risk of fraud in revenue 
recognition because of the pressure management may feel to 
achieve results.
In assessing this risk for the Group we concluded that most 
significant areas of risk related to revenues where contract 
accounting principles are followed (as this involves judgement 
over future cost estimates and percentage of completion),  
and where adjustments to revenues are made as a result of 
manual journals.
We tested revenues recognised under contract accounting by checking that an 
appropriate amount of revenue had been recognised which fairly reflected the  
stage of completion of the contract. We also evaluated the design of the key 
controls management has in place over contract accounting and tested some  
of these controls.
We tested manual journal entries impacting revenue at in-scope reporting  
units and at a Group level. Our work specifically focused on understanding the 
reasons for the adjustments and corroborating the adjustments to appropriate 
audit evidence.
Risk of management override of internal controls
ISAs (UK & Ireland) require that we consider this. We considered whether there was evidence of bias by the directors in the 
significant accounting estimates and judgements relevant to the financial 
statements. We also assessed the overall control environment of the Group, 
including arrangements for staff to “whistle-blow” inappropriate actions, and 
interviewed senior management and the Group’s internal audit function.
We analysed manual journals at in scope reporting units to identify higher risk 
journals and we performed detailed testing over the higher risk manual journal 
entries identified. We also tested any significant adjustments made to the financial 
statements at a Group level.

 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION GOVERNANCE REPORTS
Other information in the Annual Report
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our 
opinion, information in the Annual Report is:
•  materially inconsistent with the information in the audited Group 
financial statements; or
•  apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of 
performing our audit; or
• is otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Responsibilities for the financial statements and  
the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors 
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ responsibilities 
(set out on page 70), the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Group 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for 
the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of 
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, 
in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other 
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into 
whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior 
consent in writing.
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the Company financial statements of 
Meggitt PLC for the year ended 31 December 2013 and on the 
information in the Directors’ remuneration report that is described as 
having been audited.

Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ 
statement, set out on page 30, in relation to going concern. We have 
nothing to report having performed our review.
As noted in the Chief Financial Officer’s review, the directors have 
concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the Group’s financial 
statements using the going concern basis of accounting. The going 
concern basis presumes that the Group has adequate resources to 
remain in operation and that the directors intend it to do so for at least 
one year from the date the financial statements were signed. As part of 
our audit we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going 
concern basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, 
these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
Opinion on matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Strategic report and the 
Directors’ report for the financial year for which the Group financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the Group financial 
statements.
Other matters on which we are required to report  
by exception
Adequacy of information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit. We have no exceptions to report arising from 
this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by 
law have not been made. We have no exceptions to report arising from 
these responsibilities.
Corporate governance statement
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the 
Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s 
compliance with nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(‘the Code’). We have nothing to report having performed our review.
On page 70 of the Annual Report, as required by the Code Provision 
C.1.1, the directors state that they consider the Annual Report taken  
as a whole to be fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for members to assess the Group’s 
performance, business model and strategy. On page 44, as required by 
C.3.8 of the Code, the Audit Committee has set out the significant 
matters that it considered in relation to the financial statements, and 
how they were addressed. Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required 
to report to you if, in our opinion:
•  the statement given by the directors is materially inconsistent with 
our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing 
our audit; or
•  the section of the Annual Report describing the work of the Audit 
Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated 
by us to the Audit Committee.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 74

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
Transactions between, and balances with, Group companies are 
eliminated together with unrealised gains on inter-group transactions. 
Unrealised losses are eliminated to the extent the asset transferred is 
not impaired. The accounting policies of acquired businesses are 
changed where necessary to be consistent with those of the Group.
The following items in respect of the acquisition and disposal of 
subsidiaries are excluded from the underlying profit measures used by 
the Board to monitor and measure the underlying performance of the 
Group (see note 10):
• Any amounts by which the fair value of net assets of an acquired  
 subsidiary exceed the cost of acquisition; 
• Acquisition related expenses; 
• Any gain or loss arising from the disposal of a subsidiary;and 
• Any changes in the fair value of contingent consideration payable in  
 respect of the acquisition of a subsidiary or receivable in respect of  
 the disposal of a subsidiary. 
 
Foreign currencies
Functional and presentational currency
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds 
sterling. Items included in the financial statements of each of the 
Group’s subsidiaries are measured using the functional currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates.
Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of 
exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are reported at the 
rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date. Exchange 
differences on retranslating monetary assets and liabilities are 
recognised in the income statement except where they relate to 
qualifying cash flow hedges or net investment hedges in which case 
exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income. 
Foreign subsidiaries
The results of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the average rates 
of exchange for the period. Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries 
are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet 
date. Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the results 
and opening net assets of foreign subsidiaries are recognised as a 
separate component of equity in hedging and translation reserves. 
Exchange differences on borrowings designated as net investment 
hedges of foreign subsidiaries are also recognised in hedging and 
translation reserves. 
When a foreign subsidiary is sold, the cumulative exchange differences 
relating to the retranslation of the net investment in the foreign 
subsidiary are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain 
or loss on disposal. This applies only to exchange differences recorded 
in equity after 1 January 2004. Exchange differences arising prior to  
1 January 2004 remain in equity on disposal as permitted by IFRS 1 
(‘First time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards’). 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition of a 
foreign subsidiary are treated as assets and liabilities of the subsidiary 
and are retranslated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the balance 
sheet date.
1. Basis of preparation
Meggitt PLC is a public limited company listed on the London Stock 
Exchange, domiciled in the United Kingdom and incorporated in 
England and Wales with the registered number 432989. Its registered 
office is at Atlantic House, Aviation Park West, Bournemouth 
International Airport, Christchurch, Dorset, BH23 6EW.
Meggitt PLC is the parent company of a Group whose principal 
activities during the year were the design and manufacture of high 
performance components and sub-systems for aerospace, defence 
and other specialist markets, including energy, medical, industrial, 
test and automotive. 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union and the Companies Act 
2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The consolidated 
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis 
under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of 
certain financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative 
instruments) at fair value.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group in the 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements are set out below. 
These policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented 
unless stated otherwise. 
 
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of 
the Company and all of its subsidiaries. A subsidiary is an entity over 
which the Group has the power to govern its financial and operating 
policies. The existence and nature of potential voting rights that are 
currently available to the Group are considered when determining 
whether the entity is a subsidiary. The results of subsidiaries acquired 
are consolidated from the date on which control passes to the Group. 
The results of subsidiaries disposed are consolidated up to the date on 
which control passes from the Group. 
The cost of an acquisition is the fair value of consideration provided, 
including the fair value of any contingent consideration, as measured at 
the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent 
consideration are recorded in the income statement. Identifiable 
assets and liabilities of an acquired business that meet the conditions 
for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the 
date of acquisition. To the extent the cost of an acquisition exceeds the 
fair value of net assets acquired, the difference is recorded as 
goodwill. To the extent the fair value of net assets acquired exceeds the 
cost of an acquisition, the difference is recorded immediately in the 
income statement. Acquisition related expenses are  recognised in the 
income statement as incurred.
When a subsidiary is acquired, the fair values of its identifiable assets 
and liabilities are finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date. All 
fair value adjustments are recorded with effect from the date of 
acquisition and consequently may result in the restatement of 
previously reported financial results.
When a subsidiary is disposed, the difference between the fair value of 
consideration received or receivable and the value at which net assets 
of the subsidiary were recorded, immediately prior to disposal, is 
recognised in the income statement. Any contingent consideration 
receivable is measured at fair value at the date of disposal in 
determining the gain or loss to be recognised. Contingent 
consideration is measured at fair value at each subsequent balance 
sheet date, with any changes in fair value recorded in the income 
statement. 80

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
Exceptional operating items
Items which are significant by virtue of their size or nature, which are 
considered non-recurring and which are excluded from the underlying 
profit measures used by the Board to monitor and measure the 
underlying performance of the Group (see note 10) are classified as 
exceptional operating items. They include, for instance, adjustments to 
the fair value of contingent consideration payable in respect of an 
acquired business or receivable in respect of a disposed business, 
costs directly attributable to the acquisition or disposal of businesses, 
the costs of integrating significant acquisitions, significant site 
consolidation and other restructuring costs and gains or losses made 
on the disposal of businesses. Additionally in 2013, given its 
significance and non-recurring nature, the raw material supply issue 
described in note 11 has been treated as an exceptional operating item. 
Exceptional operating items are included within the appropriate 
consolidated income statement category but are highlighted separately 
in the notes to the financial statements. 
 
Intangible assets
Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair 
value of the Group’s share of identifiable net assets acquired and 
liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed. Goodwill is tested annually 
for impairment, and also whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is carried 
at cost less amortisation charged prior to 1 January 2004 less 
accumulated impairment losses. In the event the subsidiary to which 
goodwill relates is disposed of, its attributable goodwill is included in 
the determination of the gain or loss on disposal.
Research and development
Research expenditure is recognised as an expense in the income 
statement as incurred. Development costs incurred on projects where 
the related expenditure is separately identifiable, measurable and 
management are satisfied as to the ultimate technical and commercial 
viability of the project based on all relevant available information are 
recognised as an intangible asset. Capitalised development costs are 
carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment. 
Amortisation is charged over the periods expected to benefit, typically 
up to 10 years, commencing with the launch of the product. 
Development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalisation are 
expensed as incurred.
Programme participation costs
Programme participation costs consist of incentives given to Original 
Equipment Manufacturers in connection with their selection of the 
Group’s products for installation onto new aircraft where the Group 
has obtained principal supplier status. These incentives comprise cash 
payments and/or the supply of initial manufactured parts on a free of 
charge or deeply discounted basis. Programme participation costs are 
recognised as an intangible asset and carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and any impairment. Amortisation is charged over the 
periods expected to benefit from receiving the status of principal 
supplier (through the sale of replacement parts), typically up to 15 
years. 
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Segment reporting
Operating segments are those segments for which results are 
reviewed by the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’) to 
assess performance and make decisions about resources to be 
allocated. The CODM has been identified as the Board. The Group has 
determined that its current segments are Meggitt Aircraft Braking 
Meggitt Systems, Meggitt Control Systems, Meggitt Polymers & 
Composites, Meggitt Sensing Systems and the Meggitt Equipment 
Group. 
The principal profit measure reviewed by the CODM is ‘underlying 
operating profit’ as defined in note 10. A segmental analysis of 
underlying operating profit is accordingly provided in the notes to the 
financial statements. 
Segmental information on assets is provided in respect of ‘trading 
assets’ which are defined to exclude from total assets amounts which 
the CODM does not review on a segmental level. Excluded assets 
comprise centrally managed trading assets, goodwill, other intangible 
assets (excluding software assets), derivative financial instruments, 
deferred tax assets, current tax recoverable and cash and cash 
equivalents.
No segmental information is provided in respect of liabilities as no 
such measure is reviewed by the CODM.  
 
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents the fair value of consideration received or 
receivable in respect of goods and services provided in the normal 
course of business to external customers, net of trade discounts, 
returns and sales related taxes. 
Sale of goods
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of 
ownership have transferred to the customer, managerial involvement 
and control of the goods is not retained by the Group, the revenue and 
costs associated with the sale can be measured reliably and the 
collection of related receivables is probable. In the majority of 
instances these conditions are met when delivery to the customer 
takes place. In a minority of instances ‘bill and hold’ arrangements 
exist whereby revenue is recorded prior to delivery but only when the 
customer has accepted title to the goods, the goods are separately 
identifiable and available for delivery on terms agreed with the 
customer and normal credit terms apply.
Contract accounting revenue
The Group is usually able to reliably estimate the outcome of a contract 
at inception and accordingly recognises revenue and cost of sales by 
reference to the stage of completion of the contract. Revenue is 
typically measured by applying to the total contract revenue, the 
proportion costs incurred in the period for work performed bear to the 
total estimated contract costs. Where it is not possible to reliably 
estimate the outcome of a contract, revenue is recognised equal to the 
costs incurred, provided recovery of such costs is probable. If total 
contract costs are forecast to exceed total contract revenue then the 
expected loss is recorded immediately in the income statement.
Revenue from services
Revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the 
contract. For ‘cost-plus fixed fee’ contracts, revenue is recognised 
equal to the costs incurred plus an appropriate proportion of the fee 
agreed with the customer. For other contracts, stage of completion is 
typically measured by reference to contractual milestones achieved, 
number of aircraft flying hours or number of aircraft landings.
Revenue from funded research and development
Revenue is recognised according to the stage of completion of the 
contract. The stage of completion is typically measured by reference to 
contractual milestones achieved. 81
MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013
 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION GOVERNANCE REPORTS
Taxation
Tax payable is based on taxable profit for the period, calculated using 
tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full using the liability method on temporary 
differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
corresponding book values as recorded in the Group’s financial 
statements. Deferred tax is provided on unremitted earnings of foreign 
subsidiaries, except where the Group can control the remittance and it 
is probable that the earnings will not be remitted in the foreseeable 
future. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent it is 
probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised. Where deferred tax arises on 
the initial recognition of an asset or liability, other than in a business 
combination, and the recognition gives rise to no impact on taxable 
profit or loss, then deferred tax is not recognised. Deferred tax is 
calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date.
Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in the income statement, 
other comprehensive income or directly in equity depending on where 
the item to which they relate has been recognised.
Impairment of non-current non-financial assets
Assets are reviewed for impairment annually and also whenever events 
or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be 
recoverable. To the extent the carrying value exceeds the recoverable 
amount, the difference is recorded as an expense in the income 
statement. The recoverable amount used for impairment testing is the 
higher of the value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. For the 
purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped at the lowest level 
for which there are separately identifiable cash flows which are largely 
independent of cash flows from other assets or groups of assets. At 
each balance sheet date, previously recorded impairment losses, other 
than any relating to goodwill, are reviewed and if no longer required 
reversed with a corresponding credit to the income statement.
Inventories
Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost represents materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related 
production overheads, based on normal operating capacity, and is 
determined using the first-in first-out (FIFO) method. Net realisable 
value is based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected 
to be incurred to completion and disposal. 
When a subsidiary is acquired, finished goods are valued at fair value, 
which is typically estimated selling price less costs of disposal and a 
reasonable profit allowance for the selling effort. Work in progress is 
also valued at fair value at acquisition, which is typically estimated 
selling price less costs to complete, costs of disposal and a reasonable 
profit allowance for work not yet completed. When this inventory is 
subsequently disposed post acquisition, the fair value is charged to the 
income statement. The difference between the fair value of the 
inventory disposed and its actual cost of manufacture is excluded from 
the underlying profit measures used by the Board to monitor and 
measure the underlying performance of the Group (see note 10).
Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where 
appropriate and for unrealised profits on items of inter-group 
manufacture. 
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Other intangible assets
a) Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination
For acquisitions, the Group recognises intangible assets separately 
from goodwill provided they are separable or arise from contractual or 
other legal rights and their fair value can be measured reliably. 
Intangible assets are initially recognised at fair value, which is 
regarded as their cost. Intangible assets are subsequently held at cost 
less accumulated amortisation and any provision for impairment. 
Where the intangible assets recognised have finite lives their cost is 
amortised on a straight-line basis over those lives. The nature of 
intangible assets recognised and their estimated useful lives are as 
follows:
Customer relationships .............................. Up to 25 years
Technology  .................................................. Up to 25 years
Trade names and trademarks .................... Up to 25 years
Order backlogs ............................................ Over period of backlog  
                                                                          (typically up to 3 years)
Amortisation of intangible assets acquired as part of a business 
combination is excluded from the underlying profit measures used by 
the Board to monitor and measure the underlying performance of the 
Group (see note 10).
b) Other purchased intangible assets
Purchased licences, trademarks, patents and software are carried at 
cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is charged on a 
straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic life, typically 
over periods up to 10 years. 
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any impairment, except for land which is shown at 
cost less any impairment. Cost includes expenditure directly 
attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Depreciation is calculated 
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as 
follows:
Freehold buildings ...................................... Up to 50 years
Leasehold property ..................................... Over period of lease
Plant and machinery ................................... 3 to 10 years
Furnaces ...................................................... Up to 20 years
Fixtures and fittings .................................... 3 to 10 years
Motor vehicles.............................................. 4 to 5 years
Assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed annually and 
adjusted if appropriate.
When property, plant and equipment is disposed, the difference 
between sale proceeds, net of related costs, and the carrying value of 
the asset is recognised in the income statement.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the construction or production 
of qualifying assets, are capitalised as part of the cost of those assets 
until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended 
use. Qualifying assets are those that necessarily take a substantial 
period of time to get ready for their intended use, which would generally 
be at least twelve months. All other borrowing costs are recognised in 
the income statement in the period in which they are incurred. 82
MEGGITT PLC RE PORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
Provisions
Provision is made for environmental, legal and regulatory liabilities, 
onerous contracts and product warranty claims when the Group has a 
present obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than not 
that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are 
discounted to present value where the impact is significant, using a 
pre-tax rate. The discount rate used is based on current market 
assessments of the time value of money, adjusted to reflect any risks 
specific to the obligation which have not been reflected in the 
undiscounted provision. The impact of the unwinding of discounting is 
recognised in the income statement within net finance costs.
Retirement benefit schemes
For defined benefit schemes, pension costs and the costs of providing 
other post-retirement benefits, principally healthcare, are charged to 
the income statement in accordance with the advice of qualified 
independent actuaries. Past service costs are recognised immediately 
in the income statement unless the changes are dependent on 
employees remaining in service for a particular period in which case 
costs are recognised on a straight-line basis over that period. 
Retirement benefit obligations represent, for each scheme, the 
difference between the fair value of the schemes’ assets and the 
present value of the schemes’ defined benefit obligations measured at 
the balance sheet date. The defined benefit obligation is calculated 
annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit 
method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is 
determined by discounting the defined benefit obligations using 
interest rates of high quality corporate bonds denominated in the 
currency in which the benefits will be paid and with terms to maturity 
comparable with the terms of the related defined benefit obligations. 
Remeasurement gains and losses are recognised in the period in 
which they arise in other comprehensive income.
For defined contribution schemes, payments are recognised in the 
income statement when they fall due. The Group has no further 
obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Share-based compensation
The Group operates a number of equity-settled and cash-settled 
share-based compensation schemes.
For equity-settled schemes, the fair value of an award is measured at 
the date of grant and reflects any market-based vesting conditions. 
Non market-based vesting conditions are excluded from the fair value 
of the award. At the date of grant, the Group estimates the number of 
awards expected to vest as a result of non market-based vesting 
conditions and the fair value of this estimated number of awards is 
recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the period for which services are received. At each balance 
sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of awards 
expected to vest as a result of non market-based vesting conditions 
and adjusts the amount recognised cumulatively in the income 
statement to reflect the revised estimate. When awards are exercised 
and the Company issues new shares, the proceeds received, net of any 
directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to share capital 
(nominal value) and share premium.
For cash-settled schemes, the total amount recognised is based on the 
fair value of the liability incurred. The fair value of the liability is 
remeasured at each balance sheet date with changes in fair value 
recognised in the income statement for the period.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are stated initially at fair value, then measured at 
amortised cost less any provisions for impairment. Provisions for 
impairment are recognised in the income statement, when there is 
objective evidence the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due 
according to the original terms of the receivables. The impairment 
recorded is the difference between the carrying value of the receivable 
and its estimated future cash flows discounted where appropriate. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits held at  
call with banks. Bank overdrafts are disclosed as current liabilities, 
within bank and other borrowings, except where the Group participates 
in offset arrangements with certain banks whereby cash and overdraft 
amounts are offset against each other.
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently 
held at amortised cost. Trade payables are not interest bearing.
Leases
Leases where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards  
of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are 
capitalised at commencement of the lease at the lower of fair value of 
the leased asset and present value of the minimum lease payments. 
Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance 
charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the finance balance 
outstanding. The corresponding lease obligations, net of finance 
charges, are included in liabilities. Assets acquired under finance 
leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or 
the lease term.
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of 
ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating 
leases. Payments made under operating leases, net of any incentives 
received from the lessor, are charged to the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the period of the lease. 
Dividends
Interim dividends are recognised as liabilities when they are approved 
by the Board. Final dividends are recognised as liabilities when they 
are approved by the shareholders.
Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value being proceeds 
received less directly attributable transaction costs incurred. 
Borrowings are generally subsequently measured at amortised cost 
with any transaction costs amortised to the income statement over the 
period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Certain 
borrowings however are designated as fair value through profit and 
loss at inception, if the Group has interest rate derivatives in place 
which have the economic effect of converting fixed rate borrowings into 
floating rate borrowings. Such borrowings are measured at fair value 
at each balance sheet date with any movement in fair value recorded in 
the income statement within net operating costs. Movements in fair 
value are excluded from the underlying profit measures used by the 
Board to monitor and measure the underlying performance of the 
Group (see note 10).
Any related interest accruals are included within borrowings. 
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an 
unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 
months after the balance sheet date. 83
MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013
 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION GOVERNANCE REPORTS
Derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting
Where derivatives do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, 
changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the income 
statement. The Group utilises a large number of foreign currency 
forward contracts to mitigate against currency fluctuations. The Group 
has determined the additional costs of meeting the extensive 
documentation requirements in order to apply hedge accounting under 
IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ are not 
merited. Gains and losses arising from measuring these contracts at 
fair value are excluded from the underlying profit measures used by 
the Board to monitor and measure the underlying performance of the 
Group (see note 10). 
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of new shares are deducted from the proceeds 
recorded in equity. 
Own shares represent shares in the Company that are held by an 
independently managed Employee Share Ownership Plan. 
Consideration paid for own shares, including any incremental directly 
attributable costs, is recorded as a deduction from equity. When such 
shares are sold any consideration received, net of any directly 
attributable costs, is recorded within equity.
Adoption of new and revised accounting standards
During the year, the following new accounting standard, and revision 
and amendment to existing standards, became effective and had a 
significant impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements:
• IAS 19 (Revised 2011), ‘Employee benefits’. The impact of this  
 revision on the Group’s consolidated financial statements, including  
 restatement of comparatives, is set out in note 44;  
• IAS 1 (Amended), ‘Presentation of financial statements’. The main  
 change for the Group arising from this amendment is with regard to  
 the way in which items are presented in the consolidated statement  
 of comprehensive income. Items are now required to be presented  
 according to whether or not they may be reclassified to the income  
 statement in future accounting periods; and 
• IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’. This standard has not had any  
 significant impact on amounts recognised in the consolidated  
 financial statements. It has however, required additional disclosures  
 which are set out in note 29. 
Recent accounting developments
A number of new standards and amendments and revisions to existing 
standards have been published and are mandatory for the Group’s 
future accounting periods. They have not been adopted early in these 
consolidated financial statements. None of these are expected to have 
a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements when they 
are adopted except as disclosed below;
• IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’. The main change is expected to  
 relate to the way in which movements in the fair value of the Group’s  
 fixed rate borrowings, attributable to changes in the Group’s own  
 credit risk, are accounted for. The Group is yet to assess the full  
 impact of IFRS 9 which becomes effective for accounting periods  
 beginning on or after 1 January 2015. This standard is subject to  
 endorsement by the European Union.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure 
to interest rate risk and foreign currency transactional risk. Derivative 
financial instruments are recognised at fair value on the date the 
derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured  
at fair value at each balance sheet date using values determined 
indirectly from quoted prices that are observable for the asset or 
liability. 
The method by which any gain or loss arising from remeasurement  
is recognised depends on whether the instrument is designated as  
a hedging instrument and if so the nature of the item hedged. The 
Group recognises an instrument as a hedging instrument by 
documenting, at inception of the instrument, the relationship between 
the instrument and the hedged item and the objectives and strategy for 
undertaking the hedging transaction. To be designated as a hedging 
instrument, an instrument must also be assessed, at inception and on 
an ongoing basis, to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair 
values or cash flows of hedged items. 
To the extent the maturity of the financial instrument is more than 12 
months from the balance sheet date, the fair value is reported as a 
non-current asset or non-current liability. All other derivative financial 
instruments are reported as current assets or current liabilities. 
Fair value hedges
Changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments, that are 
designated and qualify as fair value hedges, are recognised in the 
income statement within net operating costs together with changes in 
fair value of the hedged item. Any difference between the movement in 
fair value of the derivatives and the hedged item is excluded from the 
underlying profit measures used by the Board to monitor and measure 
the underlying performance of the Group (see note 10). The Group 
currently only applies fair value hedge accounting to the hedging of 
fixed interest rate risk on borrowings.
Cash flow hedges
Changes in fair value of the effective portion of derivative financial 
instruments, that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, are 
initially recognised in other comprehensive income. Changes in fair 
value of any ineffective portion are recognised immediately in the 
income statement within net operating costs. 
To the extent changes in fair value are recognised in other 
comprehensive income, they are recycled to the income statement in 
the periods in which the hedged item affects the income statement. 
The Group currently only applies cash flow hedge accounting to the 
hedging of floating interest rate risk on borrowings.
If the forecast transaction to which the cash flow hedge relates is  
no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income 
statement immediately. If the hedging instrument is sold, expires or no 
longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting the cumulative gain or 
loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is 
transferred to the income statement when the forecast transaction is 
recognised in the income statement.
Net investment hedges
Hedges of net investments of foreign subsidiaries are accounted for in 
a similar way to cash flow hedges. Changes in fair value of the effective 
portion of any hedge are recognised in other comprehensive income. 
Changes in fair value of any ineffective portion are recognised 
immediately in the income statement within net operating costs. 
Cumulative gains and losses previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement if the 
foreign subsidiary to which they relate is disposed. 84

3. Financial risk management
Financial risk factors
The Group’s operations expose it to a number of financial risks including market risk (principally foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk), 
credit risk and liquidity risk. These risks are managed by a centralised treasury department, in accordance with Board approved objectives, 
policies and authorities. Regular reports monitor exposures and assist in managing the associated risks. 
Market risk
Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and is subject to foreign exchange risks on future commercial transactions and the retranslation of the results 
of, and net investments in, foreign subsidiaries. The principal exposures arise with respect to the US dollar against the Pound sterling. To mitigate 
risks associated with future commercial transactions, the Group policy is to hedge known and certain forecast transaction exposures based on 
historical experience and projections. The Group hedges at least 70% of the next 12 months anticipated exposure and can hedge up to five years 
ahead. Details of hedges in place are provided in note 30. The Group does not currently hedge exposures arising from the retranslation of the 
results of foreign subsidiaries. The Group uses borrowings denominated in the relevant currencies to hedge its net investments in foreign 
subsidiaries. 
Interest rate risk
The Group has borrowings issued at both fixed and floating rates of interest. Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value 
interest rate risk whereas borrowings issued at floating rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. The Group’s policy is to maintain at 
least 25% of its net debt at fixed rates. The Group mitigates interest rate risks through swaps which have the economic effect of converting fixed 
rate borrowings into floating rate borrowings and floating rate borrowings into fixed rate borrowings. Details of hedges in place are provided in 
note 30.
Credit risk
The Group is not subject to significant concentration of credit risk with exposure spread across a large number of customers across the world. In 
addition, many of the Group’s principal customers are either government departments or large multinationals. Policies are maintained to ensure 
the Group makes sales to customers with an appropriate credit history. Letters of credit, or other appropriate instruments, are put in place to 
reduce credit risk where considered necessary. The Group is also subject to credit risk on the counterparties to its other financial instruments 
which it controls through only dealing with highly rated counterparties and netting transactions on settlement wherever possible.
Liquidity risk
The Group maintains sufficient committed facilities to meet projected borrowing requirements based on cash flow forecasts. Additional 
headroom is maintained to protect against the variability of cash flows and to accommodate small bolt-on acquisitions. Key ratios are monitored 
to ensure continued compliance with covenants contained in the Group’s principal credit agreements. The following table analyses the Group’s 
non-derivative financial liabilities and derivative assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the 
contractual undiscounted cash flows:

Sensitivity analysis
The Group’s principal exposures in relation to market risks are to changes in the exchange rate between the US dollar and Pound sterling and to 
changes in US interest rates. The table below illustrates the sensitivity of the Group’s results to changes in these key variables at the balance 
sheet date. The analysis covers only financial assets and liabilities held at the balance sheet date and is made on the basis of the hedge 
designations in place on those dates and assuming no hedge ineffectiveness. 
 2013 2012
 
 Income

 £’m
USD/GBP exchange rate +/- 10% 25.2 36.1 18.4 50.4
US yield curve +/- 1% 4.6 4.1 3.2 5.0
The impact on equity from movements in the exchange rate comprises £46.3 million (2012: £57.6 million) in respect of US dollar net debt, offset by 
£10.2 million (2012: £7.2 million) in respect of other financial assets and liabilities. However, as all US dollar debt is designated as a net investment 
hedge, this element of the impact is entirely offset by the retranslation of foreign subsidiaries.
Capital risk management
The Group’s objective when managing its capital structure is to minimise the cost of capital while maintaining adequate capital to protect against 
volatility in earnings and net asset values. The strategy is designed to maximise shareholder return over the long term. The relative proportion of 
debt to equity will be adjusted over the medium term depending on the cost of debt compared to equity and the level of uncertainty facing the 
industry and the Group. The Group’s current post-tax average cost of capital is approximately 8% (2012: 8%). The Group’s committed credit 
facilities contain two principal financial covenants. The Group has complied with these covenant requirements for the year ended 31 December 
2013. Further details on the covenant requirements and the Group’s performance against these can be found on page 29 of the Chief Financial 
Officer’s review. The capital structure of the Group at the balance sheet date is as follows:

4. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
In applying the Group’s accounting policies set out in note 2, the Group is required to make certain estimates and judgements concerning the 
future. These estimates and judgements are regularly reviewed and revised as necessary. The estimates and judgements that have the most 
significant effect on the amounts included in these financial statements are as follows:
Goodwill
Each year the Group carries out impairment tests of goodwill which require estimates to be made of the value in use of its cash generating units 
(‘CGUs’). These value in use calculations are dependent on estimates of future cash flows, long-term growth rates and appropriate discount rates 
to be applied to future cash flows of the CGUs. Further details on these estimates and sensitivities of the carrying value of goodwill to these 
estimates are provided in note 18.
Fair value of intangible assets acquired in a business combination
On the acquisition of a business, it is necessary to attribute fair values to any intangible assets acquired, provided they meet the criteria to be 
recognised. The fair values of these intangible assets are dependent on estimates of attributable future revenues, margins, cash flows and 
appropriate discount rates to be applied to future cash flows. Identified intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or if events 
or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Estimates are also required of the useful life of the identified 
intangible assets and these estimates are reviewed at least annually, and revised if appropriate. The Group takes advice from third parties in 
determining the fair values and useful lives of intangibles arising on significant acquisitions (see note 20 for further details).
Development costs and programme participation costs
The Group capitalises development costs and programme participation costs provided they meet certain criteria. Costs are only capitalised 
where the Group is satisfied as to the ultimate commercial viability of the project based on available information. Projects typically involve 
long-term relationships on aircraft platforms and, in assessing commercial viability, estimates need to be made of aircraft volumes, aftermarket 
revenues which are dependent on aircraft utilisation, fleet lives and operator service routines, costs of manufacture and, in the case of 
development costs, the costs to complete the development activity. Capitalised costs are subject to impairment testing at least annually and, 
where headroom is limited or if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable, more frequently (see note 
19 for further details). 86
MEGGITT PLC RE PORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013
4. Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued
Environmental matters
The Group is involved in the investigation and remediation of certain sites for which it has been identified as a potentially responsible party under 
US law. Advice is received by the Group from its environmental consultants and legal advisors to assist in the determination of the timing and 
estimation of the costs the Group may incur in respect of such claims and appropriate provisions are made. The Group has extensive insurance 
arrangements in place to mitigate the impact of historical environmental events on the Group. To the extent estimates in respect of claims change 
as more information becomes available, adjustments are made to the carrying value of these provisions and, if the costs are determined to be 
covered by insurance, to the amounts recoverable from insurers (see note 31 for further details).
Legal and regulatory
The Group is subject to legal proceedings and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business. The Group is required to assess the 
likelihood of any adverse judgements or outcomes, as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the provisions required for 
these matters is based on a careful analysis of each individual issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel. However, actual losses incurred 
could differ from the original estimates (see note 31 for further details).
Onerous contracts
The Group makes provision for any expected losses arising from onerous contracts which require estimates to be made of future contract 
revenues, margins, potential claims from third parties and cash flows. These estimates are dependent on a number of factors including 
anticipated sales volumes, future pricing, production costs and the outcome of negotiations with third parties. To the extent these estimates 
change as more information becomes available, adjustments are made to the carrying value of these provisions. However, actual losses incurred 
could differ from the original estimates (see note 31 for further details).
Retirement benefit obligations
The liability recognised in respect of retirement benefit obligations is dependent on a number of estimates including those relating to mortality, 
inflation, salary increases and the rate at which liabilities are discounted. External actuarial advice is taken with regard to the most appropriate 
assumptions to use. During 2013, the determination of the discount rate for the UK scheme was impacted by a reduction in the number of high 
quality UK corporate bonds, following the UK sovereign credit rating downgrade. Advice from the Group’s UK actuary was taken as to the extent to 
which adjustments should be made within the reduced population of high quality bonds for individual bonds with significantly different yields, how 
to reflect the shortage of bonds at the long end of the yield curve and whether to expand the population based on issue size. Further details on 
these estimates and sensitivities of the retirement benefit obligations to these estimates are provided in note 33.
Income taxes
In determining the Group’s provisions for income tax and deferred tax, it is necessary to consider transactions in a small number of key tax 
jurisdictions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. To the extent the final outcome differs from the tax that has been provided, 
adjustments will be made to income tax and deferred tax balances held in the period the determination is made. If the actual outcome of events 
differed by 10% from the estimates made at 31 December 2013, the impact on the tax charge would be approximately £4.0 million. Judgements 
also need to be made as to the extent to which deferred tax assets and liabilities can be offset against one another (see note 32 for further details).

million) relating to the disposal of inventory revalued in business combinations has been charged to cost of sales, with the balance of £67.8 
million (2012: £65.1 million) included within net operating costs.
a. The Group excludes from its underlying profit figures the amortisation of intangible assets acquired in business combinations.

b.  IFRS 3 requires finished goods acquired in a business combination to be valued at fair value, which is typically estimated selling price less costs 
of disposal and a reasonable profit allowance for the selling effort. Work in progress acquired in a business combination is also valued at fair 
value, which is typically estimated selling price less costs to complete, costs of disposal and a reasonable profit allowance for work still to be 
carried out. The fair value of acquired inventory is thus significantly higher than the actual cost of manufacture of the same items built post 
acquisition, the value of which includes no profit element. The difference between the fair value of the inventory disposed of and its actual cost 
of manufacture is excluded from the Group’s underlying profit figures. 
c.  Although the Group uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against foreign currency exposures, it has decided that the costs of 
meeting the extensive documentation requirements to be able to apply hedge accounting under IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement’ are not merited. The Group’s underlying profit figures exclude amounts which would not have been recorded if hedge accounting 
had been applied. 
  Where interest rate derivatives do not qualify to be hedge accounted, movements in the fair value of the derivatives are excluded from 
underlying profit. Where interest rate derivatives do qualify to be hedge accounted, any difference between the movement in the fair value of 
derivatives and in the fair value of fixed rate borrowings is excluded from underlying profit.

d.  As referred to in note 44, in 2013 the Group has adopted IAS 19 (revised 2011), ‘Employee benefits’. This revised standard has led to the net 
pension finance cost recorded in the income statement becoming more significant. As net pension finance cost is a non-cash, non-trading item, 
the Board has decided to exclude it from the underlying profit measures it uses to monitor and measure the underlying trading performance of 
the Group. Prior year underlying profit measures have been restated accordingly. 92

a.  This principally relates to the consolidation of the Group’s two North American sensor businesses onto a single new site in California, USA 
and the consolidation of the Group’s two UK avionics businesses onto a single existing site in Hampshire, UK. These two consolidations were 
substantially completed in 2013.
b.  The integration of PacSci has now been substantially completed, following the consolidation in 2013 of the Group’s fire suppression business, 
acquired as part of the PacSci acquisition, onto the existing site of its fire detection business in California, USA.
c.  On 23 May 2013, the Group disposed of the shares of Meggitt (Addison), Inc. and realised a gain of £14.9 million. On 20 December 2013, the 
Group disposed of the shares of the Sunbank Family of Companies LLC and realised a loss of £5.9 million (see note 43). Cash expenditure 
relates to business disposal expenses which have been treated as an exceptional operating item. Proceeds from the disposal of businesses are 
reported separately as part of cash outflow from investing activities (see note 43).
d.  On 1 November 2013, the Group announced it had identified an issue relating to the supply from a vendor of non-conforming raw material in one 
of our businesses. A solution is in place, including where necessary the replacement of the relevant parts over the next few years. The cost of 
this issue is estimated to be £20.0 million.
The tax credit in respect of exceptional operating items was £10.7 million (2012: £5.4 million).

The Finance Act 2012, included legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax in the UK to 23% with effect from 1 April 2013. The Finance 
Act 2013, included legislation to further reduce the main rate of corporation tax in the UK to 21% with effect from 1 April 2014 and to 20% with 
effect from 1 April 2015. As these changes were substantively enacted during the year, they have been reflected in the consolidated financial 
statements. The impact of these changes on net deferred tax liabilities at 31 December 2013, profit for the year (underlying and statutory) and 
comprehensive income for the year has not been significant.

15. Earnings per ordinary share
Earnings per ordinary share (‘EPS’) is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to owners of the Company by the weighted average number of 
shares in issue during the year. The weighted average number of shares used excludes any shares bought by the Group and held during the year 
by an independently managed Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust (see note 36). The weighted average number of own shares excluded was Nil 
million shares for both this and the prior year. The calculation of diluted EPS adjusts the weighted average number of shares to reflect the 
assumption that all potentially dilutive ordinary shares convert. For the Group this means assuming all share awards in issue are exercised.

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if there is any indication of impairment. No impairment charge was required in the 
year (2012: £Nil) and the cumulative impairment charge recognised to date is £Nil (2012: £Nil). The total amount of goodwill and other intangible 
assets acquired as part of a business combination in the year that are expected to be deductible for tax purposes is £24.8 million (2012: £Nil).
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash generating units (‘CGUs’) which principally comprise its individual 
business operations. Goodwill is initially allocated, in the year a business is acquired, to CGUs expected to benefit from the acquisition. 
Subsequent adjustments are made to this allocation to the extent operations to which goodwill relates are transferred between CGUs. 
An analysis of goodwill by principal CGU is shown below:

Total 1,457.1 1,494.2
*  During the year, the Group determined that the cash flows of certain individual business operations were now so closely related to those of 
other business unit operations within the Group, they no longer met the definition of a CGU. Accordingly, Meggitt Safety Systems, Inc. and 
Pacific Scientific HTL are now treated as a single CGU and MSS SBU is treated also as a single CGU.  96
MEGGITT PLC RE PORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013
18. Goodwill continued 
For each CGU, the Group has determined its recoverable amount from value in use calculations. The value in use calculations are based on cash 
flow forecasts derived from the most recent budgets and plans for the next five years, as approved by management in December 2013. Cash flows 
for periods beyond five years are extrapolated using estimated growth rates. The resultant cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax discount 
rate appropriate for the relevant CGU. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are shown below:
•  Sales volumes, selling prices and cost increases over the five years covered by management’s detailed plans. Sales volumes are based on 
industry forecasts and management estimates for the businesses in which each CGU operates including forecasts for OEM deliveries of large 
jets, regional aircraft and business jets, air traffic growth and military spending by the US DoD and other major governments. Selling prices 
and cost increases are based on past experience and management expectations of future changes in the market. Overall a cautious approach 
to volume levels, selling prices and cost increases has been taken given the continued global economic uncertainty. The extent to which these 
assumptions affect each principal CGU with a significant level of goodwill are described below.
  MABS, Meggitt (North Hollywood), Inc., Meggitt Safety Systems, Inc./Pacific Scientific HTL and MSS are broadly spread across both civil aerospace 
and military platforms with Meggitt (North Hollywood), Inc. and MSS also operating in the energy sector. MABS is a leading supplier of wheels, 
brakes and brake control systems, particularly for regional aircraft, business jets and military aircraft. Meggitt (North Hollywood), Inc. designs 
and manufactures fluid control devices and systems for most aircraft types and has a higher content on large jets. Meggitt Safety Systems, Inc./
Pacific Scientific HTL designs and manufactures fire protection and control systems for large, regional, business and military aircraft. MSS is a 
leading provider of high-performance sensing and condition-monitoring solutions for high-value rotating machinery and other assets and, 
within the aerospace sector, has a higher content on large jets. All four CGUs have significant OEM and aftermarket revenue derived from sole 
source positions with the aftermarket, where platform lives can be up to thirty years for civil aircraft and longer for military, representing the 
greater proportion of revenue except for MSS which has a higher OEM content. Meggitt (Rockmart), Inc. and Meggitt Training Systems, Inc. both 
operate mainly in military markets. The principal customer of Meggitt (Rockmart), Inc. is the US DoD to whom Meggitt (Rockmart), Inc. are a 
leading supplier of flexible fuel tanks. Meggitt Training Systems, Inc. supplies integrated live and virtual training packages for armed forces and 
law enforcement agencies across the world. 
  In civil aerospace, growth in capacity terms, measured in available seat kilometres (ASK’s), is forecast to grow in line with the long-term trend 
rate of 5%, which together with the Group’s growing fleet and price increases, should drive an increase in aftermarket revenue of 8 to 9% per 
annum over the medium term. The Group’s continuing confidence in air passenger travel growth is supported by the sustained high levels of 
order intake at Boeing and Airbus. Large jet deliveries increased by 8% in 2013, and the Group expects good delivery growth over the next 5 
years underpinned by continued strong recent order intake and a backlog at Boeing and Airbus which equates to over 7 years of deliveries at the 
current production rate. Deliveries of regional aircraft increased by 11% in 2013, with modest growth anticipated over the next few years, driven 
principally by demand for 70-90 seat aircraft, on which the Group has a strong shipset content. Total business jet deliveries decreased by 5% in 
2013 but deliveries of super-midsize and long-range aircraft, where the Group benefits from particularly strong market positions, grew 
strongly. Further growth is anticipated in this market over the next 5 years, driven by increasing internationalisation of the customer base and 
the ongoing improvement in the US economy. In military markets, defence budgets are likely to remain under pressure over the medium term. 
Sequestration has been implemented in the US, and although the effect in 2014 is unlikely to be as severe as initially anticipated, a cautious 
stance on near-term revenue growth has been assumed. However, the Group has key positions on future growth platforms and, in the absence 
of any clarity on where cuts will ultimately fall, continues to anticipate average compound organic military growth of around 2% per annum in 
the medium term.
•  Growth rates used for periods beyond those covered by management’s detailed budgets and plans. Growth rates are derived from 
management’s estimates which take into account the long-term nature of the industry in which each CGU operates, external industry forecasts 
of long-term growth in the aerospace and defence sectors, the extent to which a CGU has sole source position on platforms where it is able to  
share in a continuing stream of highly profitable aftermarket revenues, the maturity of the platforms supplied by the CGU and the technological  
content of the CGU’s products. For the purpose of impairment testing, a conservative approach has been used and where the derived rate is  
higher than the long-term GDP growth rates for the countries in which the CGU operates (UK: 2.4% (2012: 2.3%), US: 2.4% (2012: 2.4%)), the  
latter has been used.
•  Discount rates applied to future cash flows. The Group’s pre-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC) was used as the foundation for 
determining the discount rates to be applied. The WACC was then adjusted to reflect risks specific to the CGU not already reflected in the future 
cash flows for that CGU. The discount rates used were as follows: MABS 10.3% (2012: 10.8%), Meggitt (North Hollywood), Inc., 11.0% (2012: 
11.1%), Meggitt Safety Systems, Inc./Pacific Scientific HTL 10.8% (2012: 9.6%), Meggitt (Rockmart), Inc. 10.7% (2012: 11.2%), and Meggitt Training 
Systems, Inc. 10.9% (2012: 10.0%). The discount rates used for ‘Other’ CGU’s ranged between 9.3% to 10.9% (2012: 8.4% to 11.3%).
A sensitivity analysis was carried out for each CGU to determine the extent to which its assumptions would need to change for the calculated 
recoverable amounts from value in use, to fall below the carrying value of goodwill of the CGU. Management has concluded that no reasonably 
foreseeable change in the key assumptions used in the impairment model would result in a significant impairment charge being recorded in the 
financial statements. The principal CGU with the least headroom in percentage terms is MABS. ‘Other’ goodwill of £270.6 million (2012: £312.9 
million) relates to approximately 10 individual CGUs for which sensitivities at the aggregated level are also provided below.  
To require an impairment in the Group financial statements, one of the following would be required:

trade and other receivables, allowances are made within the book value for credit risk.  
Derivative financial instruments measured at fair value, is classified as level 2 in the fair value measurement hierarchy, as they have been 
determined using significant inputs based on observable market data. The fair values of foreign currency forward contracts have been derived 
from forward exchange rates observable at the balance sheet date together with the contractual forward rates. The fair values of interest rate 
derivatives have been derived from forward interest rates based on yield curves observable at the balance sheet date together with the  
contractual interest rates.
The non-current portion of bank and other borrowings measured at fair value, is classified as level 3 in the fair value measurement hierarchy, as 
it has been determined using significant inputs which are a mixture of those based on observable market data (interest rate risk) and those not 
based on observable market data (credit risk). The fair value attributable to interest rate risk has been derived from forward interest rates based 
on yield curves observable at the balance sheet date together with the contractual interest rates and with the credit risk margin kept constant. 
The fair value attributable to credit risk has been derived from quotes from lenders for borrowings of similar amounts and maturity periods. 
Similar methods of valuation have been used to derive the fair value of the non-current portion of bank and other borrowings which is held at 
amortised cost but for which a fair value is provided in the table above.
There were no transfers of assets or liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy during the year.

The largest movement in credit spread  seen in a six month period since inception of the borrowings is 75 basis points. A 75 basis point movement 
in the credit spread used as an input in determining the fair value at 31 December 2013, would impact profit before tax by approximately £10.0

Interest rate swaps
The total notional principal amount of outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 December 2013 is £338.1 million (2012: £344.5 million), of 
which £60.4 million will expire in 2017, £96.6 million will expire in 2018, £105.6 million will expire in 2020 and £75.5 million will expire in 2022. The 
contracts are all denominated in USD. Of the notional principal amount outstanding, £96.6 million (2012: £98.4 million) has the economic effect of 
converting floating rate US dollar borrowings into fixed rate US dollar borrowings and £241.5 million (2012: £246.1 million) has the economic 
effect of converting fixed rate US dollar borrowings into floating rate US dollar borrowings. To the extent they meet the criteria for hedge 
accounting, the floating rate to fixed rate swap contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges and the fixed rate to floating rate swap contracts 
as fair value hedges. 
Cross currency swaps
At 31 December 2012, the Group had entered into cross currency swaps which were used to synthetically convert US dollar denominated 
borrowings into Euro denominated borrowings to hedge against Euro denominated assets of overseas subsidiaries. The swaps were accounted 
for as net investment hedges. The swaps expired during 2013.
Foreign currency forward contracts
Although the Group uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against foreign currency exposures, it has decided that the costs of 
meeting the extensive documentation requirements to be able to apply hedge accounting under IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement’ are not merited.

a)  Provision has been made for known exposures arising from environmental remediation, health and safety liabilities, product liability 
matters, legal proceedings and contractual disputes in a number of businesses. The Group’s operations and facilities are subject to laws and 
regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants and hazardous substances into the ground, air and water as well as the handling, storage 
and disposal of such materials and other environmental matters. Failure to comply with its obligations potentially exposes the Group to serious 
consequences, including fines, other sanctions and limitations on operations. The Group is involved in the investigation and remediation of 
current and former sites for which it has been identified as a potentially responsible party under US law. Provision has been made for the 
expected costs arising from these sites based on information currently available. A receivable has been established to the extent these costs 
are recoverable under the Group’s environmental insurance policies or from other parties (see note 23). A number of asbestos-related claims 
have been made against subsidiary companies of the Group. To date, the amount connected with such claims in any year has not been material 
and many claims are covered fully or partly by existing insurance and indemnities. There is a provision for claims which cannot be recovered 
from insurers. During the year, an administrative settlement was reached with the US Government following its investigation of alleged 
violations of US export control laws by certain  subsidiaries  of the Group. Under the terms of the 30-month consent agreement, Meggitt-USA, 
Inc. was assessed a civil penalty of USD 25 million, of which USD 22 million was suspended on condition the Government approves certain 
past or future remedial costs incurred or to be incurred by the Group’s US subsidiaries. In addition, the Group will be required to implement 
additional future compliance measures. No provision is held for the suspended penalty as it is not considered probable that such amounts 
will be payable. The provisions are expected to be substantially utilised over the next ten years and are discounted, where appropriate, using a 
discount rate appropriate to each provision.  
b)  Onerous contracts include lease obligations and trading contracts. Provision has been made for the estimated rental shortfall in respect of 
properties with onerous lease obligations. These will be utilised over the lease terms typically up to five years and are discounted, where 
appropriate, using a discount rate appropriate to each provision. Provision has also been made for estimated losses under certain trading 
contracts. As described in note 11, during 2013 the Group has been made aware of an issue relating to the supply from a vendor of non-
conforming raw material in one of our businesses. Provision has been made for the estimated future costs associated with this matter, which 
include the provision of a number of free of charge replacement parts to customers over a period of several years. There are a number of 
uncertainties regarding the ultimate amounts that will be payable, including the extent to which replacement parts will be required. However, 
the directors believe, based on the information currently available, that the ultimate outcome will not be significantly different from that 
recognised. During 2013, the Group made significant progress in resolving a small number of other contractual matters and accordingly was 
able to reduce, or release, provisions previously created in respect of these matters. Onerous trading contract provisions are expected to be 
substantially utilised over the next ten years and are discounted, where appropriate, using a discount rate appropriate to each provision.
c)  Provision has been made for product warranty claims. These provisions are expected to be utilised over the next three years.  108

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities 
and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same tax authority. During 2013, the Group reassessed the extent to which deferred tax assets 
could be offset against deferred tax liabilities and determined that an element of the gross deferred tax asset relating to retirement benefit 
obligations met the criteria for offset. Accordingly this offset has been reflected in the balance sheet at 31 December 2013. The Group has not 
restated the balance sheet at 31 December 2012, as the adjustment would not have had a significant impact on total assets and would have had no 
impact on net assets, income for the year or other comprehensive income for the year. The balances after allowing for such offsets are as  
follows:

32. Deferred tax continued
The Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets of £8.9 million (2012: £10.0 million), the majority of which relates to capital losses in the UK. 
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items, as it is not regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. 
Deferred tax assets not recognised would be recoverable in the event that they reverse and suitable taxable profits are available. There are no 
unremitted earnings in foreign subsidiaries that would give rise to a tax liability in the event of those subsidiaries remitting their earnings.
33. Retirement benefit obligations
Pension schemes
The Group operates a number of pension schemes for the benefit of its employees. The nature of each scheme which has a significant impact on 
the financial statements is as follows: 
•  In the UK, the Group operates a funded defined benefit scheme which is closed to new members but open to future accrual for existing 
members;
•  In the US, the Group operates five defined benefit schemes, all of which are closed to new members. With two exceptions, these schemes are 
open to future accrual for existing members. The schemes are a mixture of funded and unfunded schemes; and
•  In Switzerland, the Group operates a funded defined benefit scheme which is open to new members and to future accrual. 
The UK and US schemes provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life. The benefits provided depend on a 
member’s length of service. For the majority of schemes, the benefits are dependent on salary at retirement or average salary over employment in 
the final years leading up to retirement. In the US, one scheme provides a fixed benefit for each year of service. The Swiss scheme has many of the 
characteristics of a defined contribution scheme but provides for certain minimum benefits to be guaranteed to members. 
For all funded schemes, benefit payments are made from funds administered by third parties unrelated to the Group. The assets of such schemes 
are held in trust funds, or their equivalent, separate from the Group’s finances. Scheme assets held in trusts, or their equivalent, are governed by 
local regulations and practice in each country, as is the nature of the relationship between the Group and the trustees (or equivalent) and their 
composition. For all unfunded schemes, benefit payments are made by the Group as the obligations fall due. 
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution schemes under which the Group has no further obligations once the contributions have 
been paid.
Healthcare schemes
The Group has two principal other post-retirement benefit schemes providing medical and life assurance benefits to certain employees, and 
former employees, of Meggitt Aircraft Braking Systems Corporation and Meggitt (Rockmart), Inc. These schemes are unfunded.

In determining the fair value of scheme liabilities, the Group uses mortality assumptions which are based on published mortality tables adjusted 
to reflect the characteristics of the scheme populations. The Group’s mortality assumptions in the UK are based on recent mortality 
investigations of Self Administered Pension Schemes adjusted to reflect the profile of the membership of the Plan, which include the results of a 
postcode analysis of members used to support the 2012 triennial UK actuarial valuation. Allowance has been made for rates of mortality to 
continue to fall at the rate of 1.25% per annum. In the US, mortality assumptions are based on the RP2000 IRS RPA tables.

Details on the sensitivity of scheme liabilities to changes in assumptions are provided below:
•  The impact of a 10 basis point reduction in discount rate would cause scheme liabilities at 31 December 2013 to increase by approximately  
£14.4 million;
•  The impact of a 10 basis point increase in inflation and salary inflation rates would cause scheme liabilities at 31 December 2013 to increase by 
approximately £10.7 million;
•  The impact of assuming every scheme member were to live for an additional year would cause scheme liabilities at 31 December 2013 to 
increase by approximately £22.7 million.
The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while keeping all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely 
to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to 
significant actuarial assumptions, the same method of calculating the defined benefit obligation has been used as when calculating the 
retirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet. The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis 
did not change compared to the previous year.  
In the US, regulatory bodies are currently consulting on a new set of mortality tables which reflect recently observed longevity experience. New 
mortality tables are expected to be finalised in the next two years and will, once adopted, likely provide for increased longevity and accordingly 
higher retirement benefit scheme liabilities for most US schemes. It is not yet possible to quantify the impact any changes may have on our 
schemes’ retirement benefit liabilities. 112

Risks
The Group is exposed to a number of risks arising from operating its defined benefit pension and healthcare schemes, the most significant of 
which are detailed below:
Asset volatility 
In determining the present value of schemes’ defined benefit obligations, liabilities are discounted using interest rates of high quality corporate 
bonds. To the extent the actual return on schemes’ assets is below this yield, the retirement benefit obligations recognised in the consolidated 
financial statements would increase. This risk is partly mitigated by funded schemes investing in matching corporate bonds, such that changes in 
asset values are offset by similar changes in the value of scheme liabilities. However, the Group also invests in other asset types such as equities, 
property, commodities, derivatives and hedge funds where movements in asset values may be uncorrelated to movements in the yields on high 
quality corporate bonds. The Group believes that, due to the long-term nature of its scheme liabilities, it is appropriate to invest in assets which 
are expected to out-perform corporate bonds over this timeframe. Scheme assets are well diversified, such that the failure of any single 
investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets. The Group actively monitors how the duration and expected yield of 
scheme assets are matching the expected cash outflows arising from the pension obligations. For each funded scheme, there is a ‘glide-path’ in 
place which provides, to the extent the funding position improves, for asset volatility to be reduced by increased investment in long-term fixed 
interest securities with maturities that match the benefit payments as they fall due.
Interest rate risk
In determining the present value of schemes’ defined benefit obligations, liabilities are discounted using interest rates of high quality corporate 
bonds. If these yields fall, the retirement benefit obligations recognised in the consolidated financial statements would increase. This risk is 
partly mitigated through the funded schemes investing in matching assets as described above. 
Inflation rate risk
In determining the present value of schemes’ defined benefit obligations, estimates are made as to levels of salary inflation, inflation increases 
that will apply to deferred benefits during deferment and pensions in payment, and healthcare cost inflation. To the extent actual inflation exceeds 
these estimates, the retirement benefit obligations recognised in the consolidated financial statements would increase. Salary inflation risk is 
partly mitigated in both the UK and US schemes by linking benefits in respect of future service to average salaries over a period of employment 
rather than final salary at retirement. Benefits in respect of certain periods of past service are still linked to final salary at retirement. In the UK, 
inflation risk in respect of deferred benefits and pensions in payment is mitigated by caps on the levels of inflation under the scheme rules. In the 
US and Switzerland, the schemes provide for no inflation to be applied to benefits in deferment or retirement. Exposure to inflation on US 
healthcare costs has been mitigated by freezing Group contributions to medical costs at 2011 cost levels.  
Longevity risk
In determining the present value of schemes’ defined benefit obligations, assumptions are made as to the life expectancy of members during 
employment and in retirement. To the extent life expectancy exceeds this estimate, the retirement benefit obligations recognised in the 
consolidated financial statements would increase. This risk is more significant in the UK plan, where inflationary increases result in higher 
sensitivity to changes in life expectancy. The Group currently does not use derivatives, such as longevity swaps, to mitigate this risk.
The Group has not changed the processes used to manage defined benefit scheme risks during the year. 
Other information 
In the UK, the last triennial valuation was in 2012 following which the Group agreed with the UK trustees to progressively increase deficit 
reduction payments, with the aim being to eliminate the deficit by 2024. In the US, deficit reduction levels are driven by regulations and provide for 
deficits to be eliminated over periods up to 15 years. There is no significant deficit in the Swiss scheme. The estimated Group contributions 
expected to be paid to the schemes during 2014 are £46.4 million.

cash-settled share appreciation rights were converted into equity-settled share appreciation rights (see note 35).
35. Share-based payment
The Group operates a number of share schemes for the benefit of its employees. The total expense recorded in the income statement in respect of 
such schemes was £11.9 million (2012: £12.3 million) (see note 9). The nature of each scheme which has a significant impact on the expense 
recorded in the income statement is set out below. 
Meggitt 1996 Executive Share Option Scheme and Meggitt Executive Share Option Scheme 2005 
Equity-settled
Share awards are granted to certain senior executives at an award price equal to the market price of the shares on the day before the grant is 
made. The awards are generally exercisable at the earliest three years after the grant is made. Awards can only be exercised if the Group meets 
an earnings per share performance condition. The Group has no obligation, legal or constructive, to settle the awards in cash. Awards under Part 
A of the schemes provide for the executive on exercise to be entitled, on payment of the award price, to the number of shares under award. 
Awards under Part B of the schemes are in the form of equity-settled share appreciation rights (SAR’s) and provide for the executive on exercise 
to be entitled to receive equity equivalent to the gain in value between the award price and the market price on the date of exercise. 
During the year, 3.4 million awards (2012: Nil) previously issued as cash-settled, were modified to equity-settled. Of these awards, 0.6 million had 
not fully vested and were remeasured to fair value at the date they were modified. The fair value derived, is being expensed to the income 
statement over the remaining vesting period.
An expense of £2.5 million (2012: £3.1 million) was recorded in the year in respect of all equity-settled awards. Movements in the number of

At 31 December 2013, of the total number of awards outstanding, 7.2 million are exercisable at an average exercise price of 245.50 pence (2012: 
9.9 million at an average exercise price of 239.54 pence). The fair values of the awards made in the year were determined using the Black-Scholes 
option pricing model. The significant assumptions used in the model and the fair values determined were:

Expected volatility figures are based on volatility over the last five years measured using a statistical analysis of daily share prices. Awards may 
be exercised at any point between the vesting date and ten years after the date the award was made.
Cash-settled
Under the terms of the Meggitt Executive Share Option Scheme 2005, the Group may grant cash-settled SAR’s to certain overseas employees. 
The Group is required to pay the intrinsic value of the SAR’s to the employee at the date of exercise. Awards can only be exercised if the Group 
meets an earnings per share performance condition.
As referred to above, during the year 3.4 million awards (2012: Nil) were modified from cash-settled to equity-settled. These awards were 
remeasured to fair value immediately prior to the date of modification and a corresponding expense recorded in the income statement. The 
liability of £5.9 million was then reclassified to equity on the date the awards were modified. 
An expense of £3.1 million (2012: £2.5 million) was recorded in the year in respect of all cash-settled awards. The Group has recorded a liability at 
the balance sheet date of £0.7 million (2012: £4.9 million). The total intrinsic value at the balance sheet date was £0.9 million (2012: £5.5 million.

3.2 million at an average exercise price of 235.26 pence). The fair value of the awards made in the year were determined, at the grant date, using 
the Black-Scholes option pricing model and reflect the same assumptions used for equity-settled awards as disclosed above. As a cash-settled 
award, the fair value of outstanding awards is remeasured at each balance sheet date. 
Meggitt Equity Participation Plan 2005 
Under the Meggitt Equity Participation Plan 2005, an annual award of shares may be made to certain senior executives. For awards made in 2013 
and 2012, the number of shares, if any that an executive ultimately receives, depends on three performance conditions:
•  An earnings per share (EPS) measure (50% of the award); 
•  A cash flow measure (25% of the award); and
 • Total Shareholder Return (TSR) achieved by the Group as measured against a comparator group selected by the Remuneration Committee (25% 
of the award).
Each of the conditions is measured over a three year performance period. For awards made in 2009 and 2010, 50% of the award was based on an 
EPS measure and 50% on a TSR condition. An expense of £5.4 million (2012: £5.9 million) was recorded in the year. Movements in the number of 
outstanding shares that may potentially be released to employees are as follows:

36. Own shares
Own shares represents shares in the Company that are held by an independently managed Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust (‘the trust’)
formed to purchase shares to be used to meet certain of the Company’s future obligations in respect of employee share schemes as described in 
the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 47 to 67. At 31 December 2013, the trust held no ordinary shares (2012: 1,708 shares).
37. Contingent liabilities
The Company has given guarantees in respect of credit facilities for certain of its subsidiaries, some property leases, other leasing arrangements 
and the performance by some current and former subsidiaries of certain contracts. Also, there are similar guarantees given by certain other 
Group companies. The directors do not believe that the effect of giving these guarantees will have a material adverse effect upon the Group’s 
financial position. 
The Company and various of its subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of 
business. The directors do not anticipate that the outcome of these proceedings, actions and claims, either individually or in aggregate, will have a 
material adverse effect upon the Group’s financial position.

Other financial commitments
The Group enters into long-term arrangements with Aircraft and Original Equipment Manufacturers to design, develop and supply products to 
them for the life of the aircraft. This represents a significant long-term financial commitment for the Group and requires the consideration of a 
number of uncertainties including the feasibility of the product and the ultimate commercial viability over a period which can extend over 40 years. 
The directors are satisfied that, at this time, there are no significant contingent liabilities arising from these commitments.

technology for extreme temperature gas turbine sensors and its position in emerging energy and medical markets strengthen two strands of the 
Group’s sensing business. The assets and liabilities of Piezotech at the date of acquisition, including the goodwill arising on consolidation, were as 
follows: 
   
 Fair value 
 £’m
Goodwill (see note 18) 9.0
Other intangible assets (see note 20) 15.8
Property, plant and equipment (see note 21) 0.7
Inventories 1.0
Trade and other receivables - current 1.4
Trade and other payables - current (0.6)
Obligations under finance leases - current (0.1)
Provisions - current (see note 31) (0.4)
Obligations under finance leases - non-current (0.2)
Deferred tax liabilities (see note 32)  (0.1)
Net assets    26.5
Consideration satisfied in cash   26.5
Total consideration payable  26.5
Goodwill arising on consolidation is based on preliminary estimates of fair values which will be finalised in 2014. Goodwill is attributable to the 
profitability of the acquired business and expected future synergies arising following the acquisition. Costs related to the acquisition were £0.5 
million. These costs have been treated as an exceptional operating item (see note 11). The impact of the acquired business on the results of the 
Group for the period since acquisition is not significant and would not have been significant had it been acquired on 1 January 2013.

43. Business disposals
On 23 May 2013, the Group disposed of 100% of the ordinary shares of Meggitt (Addison), Inc. (‘Addison’) for a total consideration of £26.0 million. 
Addison was engaged in vapour cycle air conditioning systems providing cooling, heating and ventilation for fixed wing light aircraft. On 20 
December 2013, the Group disposed of 100% of the ordinary shares of the Sunbank Family of Companies LLC (’Sunbank’) for a total consideration 
of £28.3 million. Sunbank supplied connector accessories, backshells, and conduit systems for aerospace and industrial markets. These 
businesses were no longer considered core to the Group’s operations. The impact of the disposals on the Group’s results and cash flows for the 
year was not significant.
The net assets of the businesses at the dates of disposal were as follows:

44. Restatement of prior year comparatives
IAS 19 (Revised 2011), ‘Employee benefits’ makes changes to the recognition and measurement of certain items of defined benefit pension 
expense. Scheme administration expenses borne directly by defined benefit schemes are now recorded within net operating costs and not, as 
previously accounted for, as a reduction in the expected return on scheme assets. The expected return on scheme assets is now calculated using 
the same rate used to discount scheme liabilities and no longer includes any allowance for equity-like out-performance or deduction for scheme 
administration expenses. The adverse impact on net operating costs and net finance costs of these changes is offset by an equal reduction in 
remeasurement losses. As the Group has always recognised remeasurement gains and losses immediately there has been no impact on the 
value at which retirement benefit obligations are recorded in the balance sheet. As the revised net pension finance cost calculated under IAS 19 
(Revised 2011), ‘Employee benefits’ is a non-cash, non-trading item, the Board has in 2013, as previously announced, excluded it from the 
underlying profit measures (as defined in note 10) it uses to monitor and measure the underlying performance of the Group. The prior year 
comparatives have been restated accordingly.

Other matters on which we are required to report  
by exception
Adequacy of accounting records and information and  
explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion:
•  we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit; or
•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or 
returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
•  the Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by 
law have not been made. We have no exceptions to report arising from 
this responsibility.
Other information in the Annual Report
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our 
opinion, information in the Annual Report is:
•  materially inconsistent with the information in the audited Company 
financial statements; or
•  apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, our knowledge of the Company acquired in the course of 
performing our audit; or
• is otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors 
As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities 
(set out on page 70), the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the Company financial statements and for being satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Company 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared only for the 
Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 
of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in 
giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other 
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into 
whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior 
consent in writing.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of 
Meggitt PLC for the year ended 31 December 2013.

Report on the Company financial statements
Our opinion 
In our opinion the Company financial statements, defined below:
•  give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 
December 2013;
•  have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
•  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.
This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder 
of this report.
What we have audited
The Company financial statements, which are prepared by Meggitt 
PLC, comprise:
•  the Company balance sheet as at 31 December 2013; and
•  the notes to the Company financial statements, which include a 
summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory 
information.
The financial reporting framework applied in their preparation 
comprises applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
In applying the financial reporting framework, the directors have  
made a number of subjective judgements, for example on significant 
accounting estimates. In making such judgements, they have made 
assumptions and considered future events.
Certain disclosures required by the financial reporting framework have 
been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report, rather than in the 
notes to the financial statements. These are cross-referenced from the 
financial statements and are identified as audited.
What an audit of financial statements involves 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’). An audit obtains 
evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:
•  whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed;
•  the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We read all the financial and non-financial information in the ‘Annual 
Report and Accounts’ (the ‘Annual Report’) to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited Company financial statements and to 
identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based 
on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Opinions on matters prescribed by the  
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
•  the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors’ 
report for the financial year for which the Company financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the Company financial 
statements; and
•  the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of 
exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets 
and liabilities, denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet 
date, are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date. 
Exchange differences on retranslating monetary assets and liabilities 
are recognised in the profit and loss account except where they relate 
to qualifying cash flow hedges in which case the exchange differences 
are recognised in equity. 
Pension scheme arrangements
As the Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets 
and liabilities of the Meggitt Pension Plan on a consistent and 
reasonable basis, the Company accounts for the scheme as though it 
were a defined contribution scheme. Accordingly the amount charged 
to the profit and loss account is the contribution payable in the period. 
Differences between contributions payable in the period and 
contributions paid are shown as accruals or prepayments in the 
balance sheet. 
Share-based compensation
The fair value of services received from employees is recognised as  
an expense in the profit and loss account over the period for which 
services are received (‘the vesting period’). 
For equity-settled awards, the fair value of an award is measured at 
the date of grant and reflects any market-based vesting conditions. 
Non market-based vesting conditions are excluded from the fair value 
of the award. At the date of grant, the Company estimates the number 
of awards expected to vest as a result of non market-based vesting 
conditions and the fair value of this estimated number of awards is 
recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account on a straight- 
line basis over the vesting period. At each balance sheet date, the 
Company revises its estimate of the number of awards expected to vest 
as a result of non market-based vesting conditions and adjusts the 
amount recognised cumulatively in the profit and loss account to 
reflect the revised estimate. Proceeds received, net of directly 
attributable transaction costs, are credited to share capital (nominal 
value) and share premium.
For cash-settled awards, the total amount recognised is based on the 
fair value of the liability incurred. The fair value of the liability is 
remeasured at each balance sheet date with changes in fair value 
recognised in the profit and loss account for the period.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to 
employees of subsidiary undertakings, is treated as a capital 
contribution. The fair value of the awards made is recognised, over the 
vesting period, as an increase in investment in subsidiary 
undertakings, with a corresponding credit to the profit and loss 
reserve.
Shares in the Company are held by an independently managed 
Employee Share Ownership Trust (‘ESOP Trust’), to meet future 
obligations in respect of the Company’s employee share schemes. The 
cost of own shares held by the ESOP Trust is deducted from 
shareholders’ funds.
1. Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern 
basis under the historical cost accounting convention, as modified by 
the revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities (including 
derivative financial instruments) at fair value, in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. The Company continues to prepare its annual 
financial statements in accordance with UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (UK GAAP). 
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted by the Company in the 
preparation of the financial statements are set out below. These 
policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented unless 
stated otherwise.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provision for 
impairment in value except for investments acquired before 1 January 
1988 where Section 612 merger relief has been taken and investments 
are stated at the nominal value of the shares issued in consideration.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any 
provision for impairment. Cost includes the original purchase price of 
the asset and costs attributable to bringing the asset into use. 
Depreciation is not provided on freehold land. On other assets it is 
provided in equal annual instalments over the estimated useful lives  
of the assets as follows:
Land and buildings ...................................... over period of lease
Plant and equipment ................................... 3 to 10 years
Motor vehicles.............................................. 5 years
Operating leases
Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss 
account on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the 
payments are not made on this basis.
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the period and takes 
into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between 
the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred taxation is provided in full, without discounting, on timing 
differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay 
more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected  
to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law. 
Deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent it is regarded as 
more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred taxation is not provided on timing differences arising from  
the sale or revaluation of fixed assets unless, at the balance sheet date, 
a binding commitment to sell the asset has been entered into and it is 
unlikely that any gain will qualify for rollover relief.
Provision for liabilities and charges
In accordance with FRS 12, provision is made for onerous property 
leases. Provisions are discounted where appropriate to reflect the time 
value of money.
Notes to the financial statements of the Company 125
MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013
 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION GOVERNANCE REPORTS
Loans
Loans are initially stated at proceeds received less directly attributable 
transaction costs incurred. Transaction costs are amortised to the 
profit and loss account over the period of the loans. Loans are held at 
fair value where a hedge relationship is in place. Any related interest 
accruals are included within the value at which loans are recorded. 
Loans are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has an 
unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 
months after the balance sheet date. 
Capital instruments 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of new shares are deducted from the proceeds 
recorded in equity. Other instruments are classified as liabilities if they 
contain an obligation to transfer economic benefits, otherwise they are 
included in shareholders’ funds.
Dividends
Interim dividends are recognised when they are approved by the Board. 
Final dividends are recognised when they are approved by the 
Company’s shareholders.
Profit and recognised gains and losses of the Company
The Company has taken advantage of the legal dispensation contained 
in Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 allowing it not to publish a 
separate profit and loss account and related notes. The Company has 
also taken advantage of the legal dispensation contained in Section 408 
of the Companies Act 2006 allowing it not to publish a separate 
statement of recognised gains and losses.
Related party transactions
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in FRS 8 
from the requirement to disclose related party transactions within  
the Group.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value on the 
date the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at fair value at each balance sheet date. To the extent the 
maturity of the financial instrument is more than 12 months from the 
balance sheet date, the fair value is reported as a non-current asset or 
liability. Derivative financial instruments with maturities of less than 12 
months from the balance sheet are shown as current assets or 
liabilities. The method by which any gain or loss is recognised depends 
on the designation of the derivative financial instrument:
Fair value hedges
Fair value hedges are hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or 
liabilities or a firm commitment. Interest rate swaps that change fixed 
rate interest to variable rate interest are treated as fair value hedges 
provided they meet the hedge criteria. Changes in the fair value of 
derivative financial instruments, designated as fair value hedges, are 
recognised in the profit and loss account together with changes in the 
fair value of the hedged item. 
Cash flow hedges
Cash flow hedges are hedges of highly probable forecast transactions. 
Interest rate swaps that change variable rate interest to fixed rate 
interest are treated by the Company as cash flow hedges provided they 
meet the hedge criteria. Changes in fair value of the effective portion of 
derivative financial instruments, designated as cash flow hedges, are 
initially recorded within equity. To the extent changes in fair value are 
recorded in equity, they are recycled to the profit and loss account in 
the periods in which the hedged item affects the profit and loss 
account. However, when the transaction to which the hedge relates 
results in the recognition of a non-monetary asset or a liability then 
gains and losses previously recognised in equity are included in the 
initial measurement of the cost of the non-monetary asset or liability.
If the forecast transaction to which the cash flow hedge relates is no 
longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognised in equity is transferred to the profit and loss account 
immediately. If the hedging instrument is sold, expires or no longer 
meets the criteria for hedge accounting the cumulative gain or loss 
previously recognised in equity is transferred to the profit and loss 
account when the forecast transaction is recognised in the profit and 
loss account.
Derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting 
Where derivatives do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, 
changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the profit and loss 
account. The Company utilises a number of foreign currency forward 
contracts to mitigate against currency fluctuations. The Company has 
determined that the additional costs of meeting the extensive 
documentation requirements for the Company’s large number of 
foreign currency contracts are not merited. Accordingly gains and 
losses arising from measuring the contracts at fair value are recorded 
immediately in the profit and loss account. 126

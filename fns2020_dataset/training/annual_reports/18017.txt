CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Delivering strong performance
a year Of prOgress
The Board is committed to delivering 
market-leading total returns to shareholders. 
We aim to achieve this by combining value 
creation through capital value and income 
growth and adopting an innovative and 
entrepreneurial approach to managing 
the Group’s assets. The portfolio of high 
potential, central London estates and a 
prudent balance sheet provide the platform  
to deliver this commitment. 
covent garden
In 2011 we enhanced Covent Garden through 
a series of tenancy changes and acquisitions 
in the latest phase of its repositioning, which 
resulted in a strong increase in the valuation 
of the estate. This expansion was supported 
by the successful equity issue in May last year 
which raised £100 million, together with 
a £300 million refinancing in November.
earls court and Olympia
The exhibition business performed in line 
with expectations in 2011. The development 
of Olympia’s West Hall, already open for 
business, has increased the venue’s ability 
to host simultaneous shows.

Ian Durant, Chairman
Capco is well positioned to maintain its momentum 
following a year of progress and value creation in 2011. 
Strong total returns were generated by energetic and 
profitable activity in line with the strategy articulated at 
the time of establishing Capco as an independent company 
in 2010. Carefully targeted acquisitions and the drive 
towards creative regeneration have established a solid 
platform from which to continue to create value from 
Capco’ s assets.

The proposals for Earls Court reached several 
milestones, in particular the launch of Sir 
Terry Farrell’s Masterplan and the submission 
of planning applications for Seagrave Road 
and the wider scheme. These illustrate 
Capco’s vision for Earls Court which has been 
formally identified in the Mayor’s London 
Plan as an Opportunity Area with the capacity 
for large-scale development. 
In February 2012 a resolution to grant 
planning consent for Seagrave Road was 
received, which followed the agreement 
of a conditional joint venture in relation to 
the site with the Kwok Family Interests in 
December. These successes will allow the 
Group to pursue, in partnership, the 
development of more than 800 homes 
at Seagrave Road. 
the great capital partnership  
and china
The Great Capital Partnership and the 
Group’s investments in China have continued 
to perform well, allowing us to take the 
opportunity to realise capital to be recycled 
into the Group’s core activities.
results and dividends 
Capco delivered another year of strong 
performance in 2011, with a total return of 
12.7 per cent underpinned by a rise in EPRA 
adjusted, diluted NAV per share from 
148 pence to 166 pence. This was largely 
driven by the positive revaluation of the 
investment properties, which increased 
9.2 per cent on a like-for-like basis, 
outperforming IPD capital values which rose 
1.2 per cent. The share price increased 23 per 
cent in 2011 which compares favourably to the 
11 per cent fall in the FTSE Real Estate Index. 
The Directors are proposing a final dividend 
of 1.0 pence per share, bringing the total 
dividend paid and payable for 2011 to 
1.5 pence per share. 
future OppOrtunities
Following considerable progress in 2011,  
the Covent Garden team continues to 
implement asset management opportunities 
whilst considering ways in which to expand 
the estate’s footprint that will enhance 
long-term value. 
Our immediate priorities for the Earls Court 
Masterplan are to secure planning consents 
across the wider area and to conclude the 
commercial transactions with the London 
Borough of Hammersmith & Fulham (LBHF) 
and Transport for London (TfL). We look 
forward to working closely with the Kwok 
Family Interests to take forward the Seagrave 
Road project.
For more detail on our activities and future 
plans for our estates, please see pages 18 to 37 
in this report. 
cOmmitment tO cOrpOrate 
respOnsibility (cr)
Capco employs people with a diverse range of 
experience and expertise. Our entrepreneurial 
culture encourages a creative and holistic 
approach to place-making, which takes into 
consideration our impact on the environment 
and on the local communities where our 
estates are based. CR has become embedded 
into the fabric of our day-to-day work. For 
more about the specific initiatives that 
illustrate our strategy , please see our 
dedicated CR section on pages 44 to 49. 
gOvernance
The Board has taken particular care to 
establish an open culture in which debate and 
management accountability are emphasised. 
We encourage our people to be passionate 
about the estates in their stewardship but to 
maintain a high degree of objectivity about 
the use of, and the risk-adjusted returns 
available from, the Group’s capital. A strong 
corporate governance structure underpins 
this culture.
A full description of the activities of the Board 
and its Committees during the year is 
contained in the Corporate Governance report 
from pages 52 to 58. During the year the Board 
has increasingly focused on considering the 
Group’s options for evolving its strategy 
beyond the goals set out at the time of 
establishing Capco as an independent entity in 
2010; and reviewing planning and commercial 
decisions and critical timelines – all within the 
context of effective risk management. 
Following an external board effectiveness 
evaluation in 2010, an internal review was 
undertaken this year. The Board recognises 
the benefits that increased gender diversity 
would bring and accordingly a search for 
an additional Non-executive Director is 
underway and a description of the ongoing 
recruitment process is set out on page 58.
I am pleased to report that in December, 
Capco shares were classified as ‘domestic’ for 
trading purposes on the Johannesburg Stock 
Exchange, where the Company has a 
secondary listing. This means that investors 
in South Africa are now able to trade shares 
in Capco on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange 
without the previous restrictions on foreign 
holdings under South African exchange 
control limits.
Regarding shareholder engagement, I remain 
committed to meeting our shareholders and 
the Executive team has a comprehensive 
programme of investor briefings. 
OutlOOk
Capco’s success in 2011 is the result of our 
strategy of focusing on specific central 
London prime assets where the Group has 
a dominant position. This has allowed the 
Group to benefit from the distinct, strategic 
capital and economic characteristics of 
a specialist central London non-REIT 
property company . 
I am in no doubt that London will benefit 
enormously from the Queen’s Diamond 
Jubilee celebrations and as the host city for 
the Olympics this year, and am proud that 
Earls Court will be an integral part of the 
Olympics experience having been chosen 
as an official venue. 
I believe the future for Capco is positive, and 
look ahead to 2012 with optimism tempered 
by caution regarding the macroeconomic 
climate. We look forward to making further 
progress on realising London’s most 
significant urban place-making initiatives for 
many years at Earls Court and Seagrave Road. 
We are also confident of seeing further value 
creation at Covent Garden. 
Finally , I would like to thank the Executive 
Directors and all staff for their hard work 
and commitment during the past year. I am 
confident that they are committed to meeting 
the challenges of the year ahead.

Progressing the business  
at an ambitious pace
CHIEF Ex ECuTIVE ’S REVIEW
Ian Hawksworth, Chief Executive
The transformation of Covent Garden into one of the most 
vibrant retail and leisure destinations in London continues 
to create value and attract new brands, whilst the recent 
resolution to grant planning consent for our Seagrave Road 
development is an important milestone in our progress 
with the Earls Court Masterplan following the submission 
of our planning applications in June. I am confident that 
Capco’ s place-making vision, creative teams and central 
London-focused assets will provide considerable 
opportunities in both the retail and residential markets 
during 2012.  
Driven by our ambitions to be a creative 
place-maker, our focused strategy has allowed 
us to make great progress against our objectives 
both at Group level and in our estates.
Capco has had an active and successful 2011.  
We undertook a £100 million equity placing, 
raised £300 million of new debt facilities to 
extend the Group’s debt maturity profile, 
acquired £113 million of properties to expand 
Covent Garden, released £103 million from  
The Great Capital Partnership and China, 
submitted planning applications covering  
over 11 million square feet for the Earls Court 
Masterplan and Seagrave Road, and agreed a 
strategic joint venture for Seagrave Road with 
the shareholders of one of Hong Kong’s largest 
and most reputable real estate companies. Our 
activities have led to strong value creation for 
our shareholders, with net asset value per  
share rising 11.7 per cent and the share price 
increasing 23 per cent. 
This performance reflects the strategic 
positioning of Capco in dominant estates with 
particular exposure to the central London retail 
and residential markets. Central London 
continues to attract a deep pool of occupiers 
and investors from around the world, and our 
strategy is focused on transforming districts 
to meet this demand.
Operating and financial 
perfOrmance
The value of our properties increased strongly 
over 2011, with a rise of 9.2 per cent in capital 
values on a like-for-like basis, compared to  
the u K IPD capital value index which rose  
1.2 per cent.
covent garden
Capco has transformed Covent Garden into 
one of the most exciting retail, leisure and 
residential districts in London. The estate is 
now valued at £808 million, with an increase 
in like-for-like property values of 9.2 per cent 
during 2011 driven by like-for-like ERV 
growth of 8.8 per cent.
We delivered the 2012 ERV target of £40 
million 18 months ahead of schedule. On 
the back of this, we have set a challenging 
but achievable target of £50 million for 2013, 
as we aim to close the gap in rental values 
between Covent Garden and other parts of 
prime central London. 
In May we raised £100 million through an 
equity issue. The proceeds allowed the Group 
to extend its footprint in the estate from 
750,000 square feet to over 830,000 square 
feet, with several important new acquisitions.  our business performance How we govern our business our financial statements understanding our business

Alongside the continued focus on the retail

to return the estate to its roots as London’s 
original luxury address. The four high-
specification apartments at The Henrietta, 
located on the corner of Henrietta Street and 
the Piazza, were recently brought to market 
and are of a quality consistent with the best 
high-end residential developments in London.

earls court and Olympia
Earls Court and Olympia, excluding Empress 
State, increased in value by 10.9 per cent 
during 2011, reflecting the investment in all 
parts of the estate. 
The Group has made significant progress in 
the past 12 months in respect of its holdings 
in Earls Court. Sir Terry Farrell’s Masterplan, 
launched in March, based around his vision of 
‘Four urban Villages and a 21st Century High 
Street’ , provides a blueprint for a multi-
billion pound investment in both the local 
community and London as a whole. In June 
the Group submitted outline planning 
applications for the whole scheme, and a 
detailed application for a residential scheme 
at Seagrave Road – a total of 11 million square 
feet of new space across 77 acres. The Seagrave 
Road project received a resolution to grant 
consent in February 2012. 
The Group’s interests at Earls Court have been 
revalued from £138 million to £195 million, 
implying a valuation of £8.6 million per acre 
across the Group’s 23 acres at Earls Court. The 
independent valuer has changed the basis of 
valuation to a land valuation having regard  
for redevelopment potential in light of the 
progress through the planning process, and 
this marks a change from the previous existing 
use basis. Seagrave Road increased in value 
during 2011 by £11 million to £116 million and 
in December a 50:50 conditional joint venture 
for the site was agreed with the Kwok Family 
Interests at £131 million. Our events business  
at Earls Court and Olympia performed well  
in a challenging market, with EBITDA falling 
only 2 per cent to £18.5 million. We invested 
£20 million in the West Hall redevelopment  
at Olympia. Earls Court is an official Olympic 
venue, hosting the volleyball tournament  
this summer . 
For more details see pages 26 to 33.
the great capital partnership
The refocusing of The Great Capital 
Partnership (GCP) into a core of Regent Street 
and Piccadilly holdings has resulted in strong 
ERV and valuation growth. The disposal of 
properties in Kensington and midtown 
realised £48 million, which the Group has 
recycled into its core activities at Covent 
Garden and Earls Court. The sale of further 
properties this year will allow this capital 
recycling to continue in 2012.
china
The strong domestic economy and  
continued appreciation of Chinese RMB 
against the u S dollar benefited the Group’s 
investments in China. The fund manager, 
Harvest Capital Partners, has completed the 
sale of a number of the funds’ underlying 
investments. A total of £55 million has been 
realised for the Group from these disposals 
reflecting a substantial profit. 
For more details on GCP and China see  
pages 34 to 37 .
OppOrtunities and OutlOOk
The Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations 
and the Olympics will place a spotlight on 
London in 2012, allowing it to demonstrate 
its attractions to a global audience. This  
should benefit the Group which is focused  
on landmark locations across the capital, 
although the operational challenges of these 
events for a central London business should  
not be underestimated.
Covent Garden is now a destination of choice 
for flagship retail brands. The team is focused 
on capitalising upon this to deliver the £50 
million ERV target for the end of 2013. Further 
conversions of office space to high-quality 
apartments will unlock additional value.
The immediate focus for the Earls Court 
Masterplan remains on obtaining planning 
consents, together with concluding land 
transactions with TfL and LBHF . The 
relationship with the Kwok Family Interests 
will develop during the course of the year as 
Seagrave Road becomes a development project.
At EC&O Venues, there is likely to be some 
short-term impact at Earls Court, due to the 
uncertainty caused by the Masterplan. 
Following the successful disposal of properties 
from GCP and in China, further opportunities 
for reinvestment and capital recycling back into 
the core business will be pursued.
Capco is well positioned to maintain its 
momentum as the strong performance of 
London real estate is expected to continue. 
The macroeconomic headwinds demonstrate 
some of the more visible risks we face, and 
hence we remain focused on executing our 
strategy across the business as we believe this 
will best deliver market-leading total returns 
to our shareholders. I am confident that our 
place-making vision, creative teams and 
central London-focused assets will provide 
considerable opportunity in both the retail 
and residential markets during 2012.

KEy PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
Description
Total property return is calculated as capital 
growth including gains and losses on disposal 
plus rents received less associated costs, 
including ground rent. This metric ensures 
comparability to the IPD Total Return All 
Property Index.
Total return is the growth in the EPRA 
adjusted, diluted NAV per share plus 
dividends per share during the period.
Outperformance over a three year period, 
versus a comparator group of the eight largest 
constituents of the FTSE 350 Real Estate 
Index, is identified as a key measure of the 
success of Capco’s strategy .
Total shareholder return is the increase in 
the price of an ordinary share plus dividends 
during the period.
The Group’s total shareholder return is 
benchmarked against the total shareholder 
return of a comparator group of the eight 
largest constituents of the FTSE 350 Real  
Estate Index.
As a key metric for long-term equity-based 
compensation for the Group’s employees, 
total shareholder return aligns incentives 
with shareholder interest.
Target
1.5% pa outperformance since listing. 2.5% pa outperformance on a rolling three 
year basis.
4.0% pa outperformance on a rolling three 
year basis.
Performance
As shown, the Group has outperformed by 6.7 
per cent in 2011. Since demerger, the Group’s 
central London properties have outperformed 
its benchmark by 5.1 per cent annualised.
Capco’s calculated return for the year 
of 12.7 per cent was well ahead of the 
comparator group. 
The Group generated a total shareholder 
return of 23.6 per cent during the period 
significantly outperforming the 
comparator group. 
A number of other indicators of performance are considered by the Board either at a Group level (including underlying earnings per share) or 
specifically relevant to each estate, for example ERV at Covent Garden and EBITDA at Earls Court & Olympia. These are discussed further in the 
asset-specific operating reviews in the Financial Review .
All three key performance indicators are directly linked to Executive Directors’ remuneration. These three indicators are carefully aligned with 
the Group’s strategy of unlocking value and delivering market-leading total returns over the longer term. Total Property Return, underlying 
earnings per share and net asset value are linked to annual bonuses available to certain of the Group’s employees.

The Board has overall responsibility for 
Group risk management. It reviews principal 
risks and uncertainties regularly , together 
with the actions taken to mitigate them.  
The Board has delegated responsibility for 
assurance for the risk management process 
and the review of mitigating controls to the 
Audit Committee.
Executive Directors together with Senior 
Management from every division and 
corporate function of the business complete 
a Group risk register. Risks are considered 
in terms of their impact and likelihood from 
both a financial and reputational perspective. 
Risks are assessed both gross and net of 
mitigating controls. Review meetings are 
held to ensure consistency of response and 
adequacy of grading. Detailed risk registers 
are reviewed twice yearly and upon any 
material change in the business with a full 
risk review undertaken annually , at which 
point it is also reviewed in detail by the 
Audit Committee with new or emerging risks 
considered by the Committee as appropriate. 
This allows the Audit Committee to monitor 
the most important controls and prioritise 
risk management and internal audit 
activities accordingly .
On the following pages are the principal risks 
and uncertainties from across the business. 
These are not exhaustive, the Group monitors 
a number of additional risks and adjusts those 
considered ‘principal’ as the risk profile across 
the business changes.

The Covent Garden team
covent garden is being repositioned as 
a desirable place to live in central london 
with the launch of covent garden living. 
the high-end residential brand offers  
stylish spaces moments from the shops, 
restaurants, opera, theatres and buzz  
of covent garden. the Henrietta’s  
three lateral apartments and duplex 
penthouse offer a total of 8,000 sq ft of 
high-specification space for sale with a 
quality to match the standards found in 
Knightsbridge, chelsea and mayfair.  
w ork has progressed on the second 
scheme in russell chambers, the russell, 
and planning consent was recently granted 
for the conversion of 1a Henrietta street, 
the beecham. all three buildings offer 
enviable positions on the piazza. it is 
anticipated that covent garden l iving  
will provide over 50 apartments for sale 
and rent in the coming years.
Covent Garden is one of the most vibrant, 
well-loved and well-known districts of 
London. Located in the heart of the West End, 
it attracts over 44 million customer visits  
a year who come for a unique shopping 
experience, al fresco dining and a wide range of 
entertainment in a historic, traffic-free setting.
The Covent Garden estate represents 50 per 
cent of Capco’s gross assets and showcases 
its creative place-making strategy , which is 
realised through focused asset management, 
investment and development.
Since it acquired the Covent Garden estate 
in 2006, Capco has transformed the area by 
introducing 45 new , high-quality retailers 
and occupiers. 
The completion and marketing of four 
residential apartments at The Henrietta 
marks the launch of the Covent Garden 
Living brand and offers the estate the 
potential to reconnect with its 17th century 
residential roots.
The opening of Europe’s largest Apple 
store in August 2010 signalled a milestone 
in the transformation of Covent Garden into 
a more high-end retail, leisure and residential 
destination. 2011 has seen a series of 
acquisitions, a significant shift in consumer 
demographics and a raft of new innovative 
brands taking space in and around the 
Grade-II listed Market Building.
In the 17th century Covent Garden was London’s ultimate luxury 
residential address – in the 21st century it is again

Operating perfOrmance
In May , the Group raised £100 million 
through a capital raise which funded the 
acquisition of Kings Court, a 71,900 square 
feet portfolio which includes five properties 
bridging King Street and Floral Street. The 
estate was further expanded during 2011 
through the acquisitions of 35 King Street, 
11 James Street and, through an £18 million 
property swap, 1a Henrietta Street.
Overall, Capco now owns 52 buildings, 
comprising 334 lettable units and over 
830,000 square feet of lettable space in Covent 
Garden. The overall estate was valued at £808 
million as at 31 December 2011, an increase 
of 9.2 per cent on a like-for-like basis since 
31 December 2010.
In 2011, 78 rent reviews and lettings were 
negotiated which secured £8 million of 
passing rent, an 8.8 per cent increase above 
December 2010 ERV . This has driven an 
8.8 per cent like-for-like increase in ERV 
over the year to £45.8 million.
The estate is operating at near-full occupancy 
– the EPRA occupancy rate at 31 December 
2011 was 97 .5 per cent (up from 97 .1 per cent in 
December 2010) adjusted for units under offer 
and held for development. Tenant demand is 
strong despite a challenging year for retailers 
and consumers throughout the u K. The 
Group’s proactive, on-site team continues to 
secure vacant possession of high-profile and 
strategic units to further reposition Covent 
Garden as London’s most shoppable area. 
During 2011, 13 retailers opened new stores 
across the estate, including Rugby Ralph 
Lauren, Burberry Brit, Vilebrequin, Oliver 
Sweeney , Links of London and Brora.
The area’s food and beverage offering was 
enhanced by ‘restaurant in residence’ Canteen 
which introduced contemporary British 
cuisine and design during its temporary 
tenure from September 2011 until February 
2012. upmarket Parisian patisserie Ladurée 
transformed the high-profile corner unit on 
the North Piazza facing King Street into its 
first ever stand-alone tea salon in May . 
Footfall on a rolling 12 month basis as at 
December 2011 was 44 million. Capco’s active 
asset management and leasing strategy to 
establish a higher end mix of occupiers in  
the Market Building and surrounding  
streets has resulted in a shift in consumer 
demographics, attracting higher spending 
visitors. In 2011, 89 per cent of domestic 
visitors to Covent Garden were classified as 
ABC1, and internal measures of average spend 
are indicating increases for both domestic and 
international consumers. 
The Henrietta’s four residential apartments 
offer a total of 8,000 square feet of newly 
converted space for sale. Work has 
commenced on the second scheme, The 
Russell, which will create 14,300 square feet 
of residential space. Planning consent has 
been granted for a further six apartments, 
The Beecham, and a flagship unit on the 
south west corner of the Piazza. A planning 
application has been submitted for a further 
seven apartments at 30-32 Southampton 
Street. It is anticipated that the Covent 
Garden Living brand will provide over 50 
high-end and luxury apartments for sale 
and rent in the coming years.
Capco, through its Covent Garden team, has 
actively engaged with, and become part of, the 
local community since the initial acquisition 
in 2006. With offices now based in Floral 
Street, the team has built strong relationships 
with the Covent Garden Area Trust (CGAT), 
residents’ associations, Westminster City 
Council and the wider business community , 
supporting key district initiatives and garnering 
support for new innovative developments.
future priOrities
Capco’s priority for Covent Garden is to 
achieve its ERV target of £50m by December 
2013 through investment, development and 
proactive and creative asset management 
capturing as much of this as soon as possible 
within passing rent. This will be delivered 
through expansion of the contemporary 
luxury retail offer and a transformation of the 
food and dining mix. The team will focus on 
securing new lettings across the estate, 
especially on King Street. Russell Street is set 
to be transformed by the iconic Balthazar 
restaurant and bakery from Manhattan.
Looking ahead the aim is to extend the 
residential portfolio, grow the estate through 
tactical acquisitions and continue to enhance 
the Covent Garden environment by investing 
in improvements to its buildings and the 
public realm.

EC&O VENu ES
Operating perfOrmance
EC&O Venues is Capco’s world-class 
conference, exhibitions and events business 
now comprising Olympia and the two 
exhibition halls at Earls Court. Following  
the recent sale of The Brewery , this now 
represents 1.3 million square feet of prime 
conference and events space. 
The EC&O Venues business demonstrated 
resilience during 2011, particularly in light of 
the uncertainty caused by the planning process 
at Earls Court. EBITDA was £18.5 million, 
down 2 per cent from 2010. 37 new exhibitions 
were contracted to the venues in 2011 which 
helped to offset the loss of other shows, and 15 
new shows have already been confirmed for 
2012. New exhibitions contracted in 2011 
included Landscape, the London Pet Show  
and the Ideal Home Show At Christmas which 
welcomed more than 80,000 visitors – making 
it the biggest new u K exhibition in 20 years.
The valuation of Olympia increased 4 per cent 
during the year to £121 million. This partly 
reflects the completion of the West Hall in 
Olympia which provides 97 ,000 square feet  
of modern, flexible space to complement the 
existing Grand and National Halls and the 
Olympia Two Building. The closure of the 
weekday District Line service at Olympia has 
been managed through the retention of services 
supporting certain exhibitions as well as 
improvements to the West London Line, now 
running more frequently . The Brewery , which 
was operated by EC&O Venues, was sold on  
9 February 2012.
A number of shows across both venues have 
secured substantial increases in visitor figures 
year-on-year . At Olympia, Top Drawer, the 
biannual retail trade event, increased its retailer 
attendance at the autumn 2011 show by 12 per 
cent year-on-year . Similarly the Speciality & 
Fine Food Fair attracted over 8,000 visitors,  
The EC&O Venues team
the highest number in its 12-year history and  
42 per cent of exhibitors were showcasing their 
brands for the first time. At Earls Court, the 
Ideal Home Show continued to impress by 
attracting 270,000 visitors, more than its 
award-winning relaunch event in 2010. 
Particular highlights from the venues’ diverse 
live events calendar included BT’s British 
Olympic Ball which welcomed Olympians  
and sporting celebrities to a celebration of 
Team GB.
In 2011, Earls Court was highly commended  
at the Event Awards as Exhibition Venue of  
the year .
future priOrities
The priorities for 2012 are to target and attract 
more new shows, integrate the new West Hall 
to maximise Olympia’s potential, and to 
showcase the professionalism of the EC&O 
Venues team to a global audience as Earls Court 
hosts the Olympic volleyball competition.
In the short term we expect performance  
across the venues to continue to be impacted 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the future 
of the Earls Court venue. However, the Group’s 
investment into Olympia including a further 
£10 million in 2012, provides opportunities  
to develop the venues business over the 
medium term.

THE EARLS COu RT MASTERPLAN
Gary yardley , Investment Director
I am delighted with the progress we have made on the Earls 
Court Masterplan this year and the highlight was securing 
resolution to grant planning consent for Seagrave Road. This 
reflects the strength of the wider scheme, with all the benefits 
it brings to London and the local area. We are confident that 
we are making positive steps towards securing the broader 
consent and finalising the respective land transactions with 
LBHF and TfL.  
The ECOA team
Earls Court is a rare opportunity in London:  
the potential for significant regeneration in a 
central London location. The site is bordered  
by established, high-value residential addresses, 
including Chelsea, Kensington, Holland Park 
and Fulham. Established transport 
infrastructure including three Tube stations,  
a London Overground station and access to  
the A4 provide unrivalled connectivity . The 
residential developments that benefit most  
from the regeneration effect are those that create 
a strong sense of place by investing in areas  
such as community facilities and the quality  
of their public realm. Capco’s strong focus on 
place-making, in support of Sir Terry Farrell’s 
Masterplan, offers the potential for substantial 
long-term value creation in Earls Court.
The valuation of Capco’ s interests in Earls  
Court as at December 2011 reflects the progress 
made towards realising this potential, with the 
valuation basis now a land valuation having 
regard for redevelopment potential, a change 
from the previous basis of existing use as 
operational assets. As at December 2011, the 
valuation has increased to £195 million, a rise of 
39 per cent, reflecting a value of £8.6 million per 
acre versus £6.1 million per acre at December 2010 .
In June 2011, outline planning applications 
were submitted for the redevelopment of a 70 
acre site, the Earls Court and West Kensington 
Opportunity Area (ECOA), alongside a detailed 
application in respect of the 7 .5 acre Seagrave 
Road site. The applications set out the 
proposals for transforming this huge tract  
of land into a new London district based on  
Sir Terry Farrell’s Masterplan to create ‘Four

urban Villages and a 21st Century High Street’ . 
Changes to the applications were made earlier 
this year reflecting comments received from the 
public consultations and reviews by statutory 
bodies including the Greater London Authority 
(GLA). The amendments further embed the 
development into the existing area and increase 
sensitivity to the local environment, covering 
an area of 10.1 million square feet, a reduction of 
approximately 0.3 million square feet of space 
from the overall Masterplan.
As the ECOA straddles the boundary between 
two local authorities, planning applications 
were submitted to both the Royal Borough 
of Kensington & Chelsea (RBKC) and the 
London Borough of Hammersmith & Fulham 
(LBHF). These outline planning applications 
are typically used for large-scale, strategic 
sites, and seek consent for the amount of 
development, the uses of the development 
(for example residential, office space, cultural, 
retail) and guidelines for future architecture 
and landscaping.
In July , the ECOA was recognised by the 
Mayor of London’s Replacement London Plan 
as an Opportunity Area with great potential 
for large-scale urban regeneration, and in 
February 2012 the Seagrave Road scheme, 
which will deliver the major residential 
component of West Brompton Village, was 
given a resolution to grant consent by LBHF . 
Negotiations continue with Transport for 
London (TfL) in respect of the extension of 
Capco’s existing long leasehold interests at 
Earls Court, as well as commercial agreements 
covering TfL and LBHF’s land in the ECOA. 
Capco entered into an exclusivity agreement 
with LBHF in July , giving the parties 12 
months to agree the commercial transaction.  our business performance

A payment of £15 million was made to LBHF , 
£10 million of which is refundable should 
a transaction not be concluded.
As an interested party , Capco was notified that 
LBHF received an application for judicial 
review of the exclusivity agreement and the 
Court will hear this application in June. The 
request for judicial review has no bearing on 
the planning applications for the Earls Court 
Masterplan or for Seagrave Road, and should 
not delay the discussions with LBHF or TfL.
cOnsultatiOn
The proposals for the ECOA are a result of  
close collaboration with the other landowners, 
TfL and LBHF , informed by a collection of 
world-class architects led by Sir Terry Farrell.
As this is one of the largest and most 
important developments in London, the  
local community has been consulted about 
the proposals for two and a half years  
through a comprehensive community 
engagement programme. Over 1,000 people 
who live in the area attended seven public 
exhibitions at the Earls Court Exhibition 
Centre in March and June 2011. Comments 
and feedback from these exhibitions and  
from the forum on Capco’s innovative, 
award-winning community website  
www .myearlscourt.com have helped shape 
the evolution of Sir Terry Farrell’s Masterplan. 
The engagement programme and updates to 
myearlscourt.com will continue through the 
planning and development process and into 
the future during construction and through 
to eventual occupation. 
The extensive consultation exercise has  
led to the ECOA being established across 
planning policy at regional, local and 
site-specific levels. As well as the Mayor of 
London’s Replacement London Plan covering 
regional strategy , both RBKC and LBHF 
include the area within their Core Strategy 
plans for development within their boroughs. 
The Greater London Authority (GLA) and 
both councils have further considered 
proposals for comprehensive development 
within a joint document specific to the ECOA, 
the Supplementary Planning Document 
(SPD), for which second round consultation 
concluded in December. LBHF is undertaking 
a consultation regarding the inclusion of  
the estates, which is currently ongoing.
Among the positive reactions to the ECOA 
Masterplan proposals, there have been 
concerns voiced by some residents of the West 
Kensington and Gibbs Green estates. Capco is 
committed to working with all local residents 
and stakeholders, and with LBHF , making the 
area work for everybody . 
empress state
Capco has a 50 per cent stake in this landmark 
office which is adjacent to the ECOA. The 31 
storey tower is the highest building in LBHF . 
Fully renovated in 2003, the entire building is 
let to the Metropolitan Police Authority on  
a long lease which expires in June 2019. The 
lease is subject to annual RPI increases subject 
to a collar, with 5 per cent being applied at the 
2011 review . Capco’s share of NRI for 2011 was 
£7 .1 million.
In the medium-term, opportunities to extend 
or review the existing lease will be considered 
or alternatively the property may be suitable 
for a residential conversion in line with the 
plans for the ECOA.
future priOrities 
Although the EC&O estate has benefited from 
a year of great momentum, the Board remains 
mindful of the risks surrounding planning 
processes of this scale, including applications 
for judicial review . In mitigation, the planning 
process has been followed scrupulously and 
an extensive level of consultation with the 
local community , local authorities and the 
GLA has been undertaken throughout the 
process. In terms of Section 34A, no details 
have at present been brought forward by the 
Government, however these proposals will 
continue to be monitored.
During 2012 the key focus remains to secure 
planning consents for the Earls Court 
Masterplan. The Group will seek to conclude 
land transactions with LBHF and TfL 
consolidating future development rights and 
take forward the Seagrave Road project in 
partnership with the Kwok Family Interests.

whole, occupier demand for office and retail 
accommodation in central London remains 
robust. For this reason ERV growth has been 
maintained, increasing by 11.4 per cent 
like-for-like to £14.0 million. Values also rose, 
by 9.8 per cent on a like-for-like basis for the 
same period to £241 million. However, net 
rental income on a like-for-like basis was 
down 7 .3 per cent to £10.1 million following 
the disposals.
In line with Capco’s strategy to recycle capital 
from mature property assets back into the 
Group’s core businesses, GCP has continued 
to dispose of properties, a process that began 
in 2010. £48 million (Capco’s share) has been 
realised in 2011, with a further £27 million 
in 2012 to date. All are part of the Group’s 
successful programme of disciplined capital 
recycling that has taken advantage of 
continuing investor appetite for central 
London property assets.
Contracts have been exchanged to sell a 
portfolio of properties located on and around 
Regent Street to Great Portland Estates for 
a price of £150 million (Capco’s share £75 
million). This represented a premium of 
5.4 per cent to the December 2011 valuation. 
The sale is subject to consent from the 
freeholder (The Crown Estate) and the 
banking syndicate. It will trigger the 
prepayment of some of the outstanding debt 
so net proceeds to the Group are expected to 
be in the range of £30 – £35 million.
china
The Group’s investments in China, managed 
by Harvest Capital Partners, have been highly 
profitable returning capital to the Group of 
£55 million during the year. The balance is 
due to be returned over the next two years. 
The sale of the China II fund produced a 
return on capital in excess of 60 per cent. 
future priOrities 
Having realised over £100 million from these 
two portfolios in 2011, the focus will remain 
on continuing to realise capital profitably to 
recycle into the core business. The immediate 
focus will be on closing the GCP transactions.
£103 million of capital has been  
released from sales within gcp and 
china, capitalising on the demand for 
prime real estate assets.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
Valuation surplus continues  
to drive Total Return
The results for the year reflect the Group’s asset management strategy 
supported by the continued strength of the central London property 
market. As a result, the Group has generated strong returns with 
a pre-tax profit of £161.9 million, compared to £132.5 million for the 
previous year.
Like-for-like capital values increased 9.2 per cent. With little 
movement in yield across the year, this can be attributed to ERV 
growth and a step change in value achieved in the second half of the 
year on the Group’s investments at Earls Court.
Net rental income remained consistent with that of the prior year at 
£69 million, although this masks a number of significant acquisitions 
and disposals.
In May , the Group completed a placing of 62.1 million new ordinary 
shares at a price of 162 pence per share to fund acquisition opportunities 
at Covent Garden. This placing generated gross proceeds of £100.6 
million, and increased the number of ordinary shares in issue to 683.9 
million. As the capital raise was structured as a placing at market value, 
no adjustment to prior year comparatives has been made.
In November, the Group concluded a refinancing at Covent Garden, 
securing a £300 million debt facility to refinance an existing loan of 
£223 million due to mature in 2013. This extended maturity of the 
debt to October 2016, with a further two year extension available at 
the Group’s option subject to meeting certain financial covenants.
financial pOsitiOn
EPRA net assets (adjusted, diluted) increased by £220 million or 
18 pence per share since 31 December 2010, a rise of 11.7 per cent. 
The significant factors were the capital raising completed in May , 
generating £97 million net of expenses, and the continued revaluation 
gains recorded on the Group’s property portfolio in 2011, most notably 
at Earls Court which excluding the Empress State building (also 
reported within this segment) gave rise to a like-for-like return of 
10.9 per cent. Covent Garden’s like-for-like performance was also 
strong with property values up 9.2 per cent.

capital expenditure and divestment
2011 has been an active year. The Group has moved forward on a 
number of its strategic plans driving significant levels of capital 
expenditure. This has been funded by the capital raising in May as 
well as capital recycling from non-core assets.

Sales of non-core assets from within The Great Capital Partnership and 
the divestment of China funds have contributed £118 million towards 
supporting the Group to expand its footprint at Covent Garden, 
continue the redevelopment of the Olympia Exhibition Centre and 
further the planning process for the Earls Court regeneration area.
Of the £180 million invested, £130 million relates to investments 
at Covent Garden: £113 million on acquisitions and £17 million on 
redevelopments.
In December the Group entered into a conditional agreement with 
the Kwok Family Interests. The agreement, conditional on obtaining 
planning consent immune from challenge, is to acquire a 50 per cent 
stake in the Group’s interests at Seagrave Road for £66 million,  
a 13 per cent uplift on the December 2011 valuation. As the agreement 
remained conditional at the balance sheet date, the divestment is not 
reflected in the table above.
Future capital commitments at 31 December 2011 amount to 
£14 million (31 December 2010: £45 million).
china
The Group’s investments in China, through two Limited Partnerships 
managed by Harvest Capital Partners, were substantially realised in 
2011. Profits of £30.5 million were realised during the year releasing 
cash for use elsewhere in the Group of £55 million.
The divestment of Harvest China Real Estate Fund II has completed. 
Over the three year investment period the fund generated a return in 
excess of 60 per cent on capital employed, an exceptional performance 
during a period of economic uncertainty .
The remaining fund, Harvest China Real Estate Fund I, controls two 
residual assets of meaningful size. One, carried at £15 million, is 
currently contracted for sale, the proceeds from which are expected 
in 2012. The last remaining asset is being actively marketed for sale.
borrowings
Gross debt has reduced by £111 million during 2011. £73 million of this 
was the result of refinancing at Covent Garden, net of draw down and 
repayment, and £30 million related to prepayments against the Earls 
Court & Olympia facility . The associated swap termination costs 
totalled £14.5 million.
Since year end the Group has prepaid an additional £5 million (our 
share) on the facility secured over the Empress State Building, a 
building adjacent to the Group’s interest at Earls Court which is held 
through a joint venture with Land Securities Group PLC. The LTV 
covenant on this facility has been waived until maturity .
As part of the November refinancing at Covent Garden, the Group 
secured a £300 million debt facility to refinance an existing loan of 
£223 million due to mature in 2013. The Group took the opportunity 
to utilise its cash reserves more efficiently and reduce the cash drag 
on earnings, drawing the facility initially to £150 million. A further 
£90 million is immediately available for use around the Group with 
the residual £60 million available to finance existing Covent Garden 
assets not currently secured, or to finance new acquisitions in the 
Covent Garden area.
As a result there has been little movement in net debt during the 
period, a reduction of £12 million to £464 million at 31 December 2011. 
A reconciliation of net debt is included within note 25.
The Group’s debt continues to be arranged on an asset specific basis, 
with limited or no recourse to the Group.
Group debt ratios were as follows:
2011 2010
Loan-to-value 29% 35%

Weighted average debt maturity 3.6 years 3.0 years
Weighted average cost of debt 5.8% 5.9%

providing a reasonable degree of financial flexibility . our business performance

FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINuED
Recurring cash flow from operations has remained consistent 
year-on-year with the reduction in operating cash flow being offset  
by a fall in finance charges paid. Surrender premiums linked to the 
Group’s repositioning strategy at Covent Garden have principally 
driven the movement in working capital.
Significant non-recurring cash flows can be summarised as follows:

Proceeds generated from the sale of non-core properties within The 
Great Capital Partnership generated £48 million while the divestment 
of China funds returned £55 million to the Group during the year.
Cash applied to the development of property and investments during 
the period is due principally to the acquisition of investment properties 
at Covent Garden (£94 million); and development activity at both Earls 
Court and Olympia (£45 million). Smaller acquisitions and redevelopment 
activity across the Group’s other assets account for the balance.
In July the Group entered into an Exclusivity Agreement with LBHF , 
the consideration for which resulted in a cash payment of £15 million. 
The agreement gives both parties one year of exclusivity in relation to 
discussions around LBHF’s land and its inclusion within Sir Terry 
Farrell’s Masterplan.
The Group seeks to optimise its corporate structure to align with its strategy . 
Due to an internal reorganisation in November to segregate the operating 
business at Earls Court and Olympia from the development opportunity , 
an internal sale and purchase was determined to constitute a VAT supply 
between two internal VAT groups. At the year end input VAT of £22.2 
million had been received from HMRC but, due to the timing of returns, 
the equal and offsetting output VAT was not settled until January 2012.
As part of the reorganisation of the EC&O Venues business, the workforces 
of Earls Court Limited and Olympia Limited were amalgamated into 
Olympia Limited. As a result, Earls Court Limited ceased to be a 
participating employer of the EC&O final salary pension scheme which 
necessitated a payment of £3.6 million to the scheme. On 31 December 
2011 the final salary scheme was closed to future benefit accrual. The 
actuarial valuation of the scheme at 31 December 2011 reflected a surplus 
of £1 million. As the Group has an unconditional right to refund upon the 
scheme’ s closure, the asset has been carried on the Group’ s balance sheet.
As a result of refinancing, average debt maturity has been extended to 
3.6 years with the first significant maturity due in February 2013. The 
weighted average cost of debt was 5.8 per cent as at 31 December 2011, 
but has fallen to 5.2 per cent as at the date of this report. 
A detailed breakdown of the Group’s debt maturity is shown in note 25 
of the consolidated financial statements.
Financial covenants apply to £543 million of asset specific debt. The 
two main covenants are Loan-to-Value (“LTV”) and Interest Cover 
(“IC”). The actual requirements vary and are specific to each loan. 
Currently £169 million of non-recourse loans have no LTV requirement.
The Group has cash and available facilities of £245 million and is in 
compliance with all of its asset specific loan covenants. Full details  
of the loan financial covenants are shown on page 118.
derivatives
The Group’s policy is to substantially eliminate the short and 
medium-term risk arising from interest rate volatility . The Group’s 
banking facilities are arranged on a floating-rate basis, but swapped to 
fixed-rate or capped using derivative contracts coterminous with the 
relevant debt facility . At 31 December 2011 the proportion of gross debt 
with interest rate protection was 95 per cent.
During the year, to take advantage of the low interest rate 
environment, the Group entered into derivative contracts providing 
interest rate protection on debt with a nominal value of £150 million. 
The protection starts after the Group’s first significant debt maturity 
in 2013 and extends through until 2016.
The fair value provision for financial derivatives has fallen from 
£54 million to £36 million during the year, in part due to termination 
payments made during the year of £14.5 million.

acquisitions at Covent Garden, an increase of £1.4 million, and disposals 
within The Great Capital Partnership, a reduction of £1.8 million.
The annualised impact of acquisitions at Covent Garden in 2011 is 
expected to be £3 million. The annualised impact on net rental income 
attributable to disposals within The Great Capital Partnership in 2011 is 
expected be to £2.1 million. The properties contracted for sale from The 
Great Capital Partnership so far in 2012 represent a further £3.9 million.

At Covent Garden, net rental income increased by £2.1 million to 
£27 .8 million an increase of 5.3 per cent on a like-for-like basis. This 
increase was largely the result of acquisitions, £1.4 million, and new 
lettings which achieved an increase of £0.9 million. A property swap 
completed in February , which comprised the disposal of a property 
on the periphery of the estate for a strategic piazza facing freehold 
interest, had an adverse impact of £0.5 million.
The Great Capital Partnership generated net rental income of 
£11.0 million (our share), a decrease of £2.6 million, 7 .3 per cent on 
a like-for-like basis due to the continued strategy of disposing of 
non-core mature properties in support of the Group’s core 
investments. Void costs increased by £0.5 million during the year, the 
result of exercising break clauses to facilitate redevelopment and sale. 
Disposals achieved in 2010 and 2011 reduced recurring net rental 
income by £1.8 million.
Earls Court & Olympia, which includes the Group’s interest in the 
Empress State Building, increased by £1.1 million, 3.1 per cent on a 
like-for-like basis to £30.2 million. This increase is attributable to new 
shows and increased take-up at Olympia. The index-linked lease on the 
Empress State Building continues to deliver annual increases linked 
to RPI which, excluding a one-off adjustment of £0.3 million in 2011, 
resulted in an increase of five per cent for the year. Subsequent to the

FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINuED
Brewery , an operating business based in the City of London, which 
contributed £0.8 million to net rental income in 2011.
Historically the Venues business has controlled a number of properties 
that were reported within its EBITDA which contributed £1.2 million 
to net rental income in 2011. As a result of the internal reorganisation 
and the closure of the Earls Court & Olympia defined benefit pension 
scheme referred to above, £0.9 million was included within the EC&O 
segmental result but not the Venues EBITDA. Therefore EBITDA of 
the Venues business fell by £0.4 million to £18.5 million in the year to 
31 December 2011.
Lease incentives of £1.1 million were included within net rental income 
for the year.
property valuation
Property valuation gains of £123.3 million (2010: £134.6 million) include 
unrealised gains of £119.4 million and realised gains of £3.9 million.
With little movement in yields, valuation gains in 2011 have been 
predominantly income driven. Covent Garden experienced like-for-
like ERV growth of 8.8 per cent, while ERV within The Great Capital 
Partnership increased by 11.4 per cent on a like-for-like basis reflecting 
the positive sentiment in the central London property market.
Fees and other costs relating to acquisitions account for the majority 
of the revaluation losses of £7 .2 million recorded on acquisitions 
during the year.
A step change in the valuation basis of the Group’s interests at 
Earls Court was achieved in the second half of the year. under 
International Financial Reporting Standards the Group’s valuers 
are required to consider the highest and best use when valuing 
investment and development properties carried at fair value. The 
highest and best use valuation of the Earls Court exhibition halls 
at 31 December 2011 was considered to be a land value having regard 
for redevelopment potential. This contributed to a like-for-like 
revaluation surplus of 10.9 per cent recorded on investment 
properties held at Earls Court & Olympia which attributed a land 
value of £8.6 million per acre to the site. This reflects the Group’s 
efforts toward achieving planning consents on the ECOA which 
are discussed further in the Operating Review.
The Group’s trading properties were impaired by £0.1 million 
(2010: £0.1 million) where the fair value was determined to be less than 
original cost. In aggregate the Group’s trading properties have an 
unrealised valuation surplus of £1 million at 31 December 2011 which 
has not been recognised in the financial statements.
administration expenses
underlying administration expenses increased by £3.6 million to 
£22.2 million. This was in line with expectation and is attributed to 
increased head count and establishment costs, the result of becoming 
a standalone business in May 2010.
net finance costs
Excluding gains and losses on the change in fair value of derivatives 
and one-off costs incurred on the termination of interest rate swaps, 
underlying net finance costs for the year of £34.8 million have 
decreased by £4.1 million. This reduction reflects the full year impact 
of prepayments in 2010 together with prepayments of £30 million 
made during 2011. The November refinancing at Covent Garden 
further reduced average debt levels during the latter part of the year.
taxation
The net tax charge for the year ended 31 December 2011 was £8.2 million.
The tax charge on underlying profits is £2.4 million reflecting an 
underlying tax rate of 20 per cent. The underlying tax rate is lower 
than the standard rate of u K corporation tax of 26 per cent (28 per cent 
in 2010) due to capital allowances.
The tax rate on underlying profit is expected to trend toward the 
u K corporation tax rate in the medium term. The standard rate of 
corporation tax will be 23 per cent from 2014.
Contingent tax, the amount of tax that would become payable on 
a theoretical disposal of all investment properties held by the Group, 
is nil (2010: £10.4 million). The contingent tax position is arrived at 
after allowing for Group loss relief.
derivative valuation
Due to the macroeconomic factors during the year, longer term interest 
rates have fallen in excess of 1 per cent. Shorter term rates however 
remain reasonably stable year-on-year although LIBOR has risen. With 
an average debt maturity of 3.6 years the contraction in long-term rates 
has had little overall impact at a Group level.
The valuation movement of £14.1 million arose in part from the 
termination payments made during the year of £14.5 million.
exceptional items
In addition to revaluation surpluses on investment and development 
property and fair value movements on derivative financial 
instruments, exceptional items which have been removed from the 
calculation of underlying profit include:
 – Finance charges totalling £14.5 million which were recorded on 
the termination of interest rate swaps arising on debt repayments 
and prepayments of £252 million, £223 million in relation to the 
Group’s refinancing at Covent Garden in November and £30 million 
in relation to the facility secured over Earls Court & Olympia;
 – As part of the Group’s 2009 acquisition of the non-controlling 
interest’s share in Earls Court & Olympia, a deferred consideration 
payment becomes due based on a number of factors including a 
potential redevelopment of the site and the outcome of the planning 
process. With the Group having submitted its planning application 
in June relating to the full Earls Court regeneration area, the 
provision has been remeasured resulting in an exceptional charge  
of £4.2 million;
 – Following divestment of the Group’s interests in China, profits 
of £30.5 million have been realised. These have been treated as 
exceptional given their non-recurring nature;
 – Other income comprises exceptional credits of £0.8 million. 
These relate to a non-recurring VAT claim settled with HM Revenue 
& Customs and a non-refundable deposit received by the Group, 
taken to income as a result of an incompleted transaction.

a secured debt strategy as it believes this gives better access to 
borrowings and at lower overall costs.
The Group’s borrowings are secured against large pools of assets. 
Importantly , the recent refinancing at Covent Garden provides 
flexibility to fund expenditure elsewhere in the Group.
The Group’s financial structure is monitored with reference to 
guidelines approved by the Board.
Group Treasury operates a formal treasury policy covering all aspects 
of treasury activity including funding, counterparty exposure limits, 
management of interest rate risk, currency and liquidity risks. The 
Board receives regular reports on compliance with these policies, 
which are reviewed on an annual basis.
south african listing
The Group maintains a secondary listing on the JSE Limited which is 
classified as an “inward” listing.
Institutional investors who received Capco shares upon demerger 
were initially given a two year exemption to allow time to realign their 
portfolios. The exemption was due to expire in May 2012. During 2011 
the Group applied to the South African authorities for an extension 
which was granted for a further 12 month period. 
However, in a major new policy on exchange control introduced by the 
South African National Treasury , as of December 2011 all inward shares 
have been reclassified as “domestic” shares for trading purposes. This 
reclassification means that the previous limits on holding Capco shares 
under exchange control regulations have been removed for South African 
institutional investors in the Group, if those shares were acquired on 
the JSE. In addition Capco is now eligible for certain JSE indices.
At 31 December 2011, 21 per cent of the Group’s shares were held on

Headline earnings per share, a JSE measure, stood at 2 pence per share 
for the year to 31 December 2011.
going concern
Economic conditions remain challenging, however the Group has 
a prudent balance sheet and sufficient cash and available facilities 
to meet both its ongoing and foreseeable future commitments. The 
Group recently refinanced a significant amount of its debt secured over 
Covent Garden, extending its weighted average debt maturity . With 
sufficient headroom against financial covenants and a significant pool 
of unsecured assets there continues to be a reasonable expectation that 
the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly , the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the 2011 annual report and accounts.
dividends
The Company intends to grow its dividend as the success of its asset 
plans is reflected in underlying profit, whilst taking into account 
future commitments and providing for the financial flexibility 
required to maximise long-term shareholder value.
The Board has recommended a final dividend of 1.0 pence per share 
taking the total dividend for the year to 1.5 pence per share. Subject to 
approval at the Company’s Annual General Meeting the dividend will 
be paid on 21 June 2012 to shareholders on the register at 18 May 2012.
Subject to approval at the Company’s Annual General Meeting, the 
Board intends to offer an optional scrip dividend scheme which will 
apply to the 2011 final dividend. The scrip dividend scheme will give 
shareholders the right to elect to receive new ordinary shares in the 
Company instead of future cash dividends. At the Directors’ discretion, 
the scrip dividend scheme may also be offered in respect of any future 
final or interim dividends.

At the heart of Capco’s  
business activities
intrOductiOn
Corporate Responsibility is at the heart of 
Capco’s business activities, central to our role 
as a place-maker and to our working practices.
We are a young company and as we grow we 
aim to build a reputation for being responsible 
and ethical in all aspects of our business. Many 
of the goals we have set have been met and  
I am satisfied with the progress we have made 
in promoting sustainable place-making and 
with the benefits our education programme 
provides to young people.
Ian Henderson CBE
Chairman of the Corporate 
Responsibility Committee
29 February 2012
The two threads of Corporate Responsibility 
that run through our business are 
environment and community . These broad 
themes have a material impact on the areas 
where our assets are based. 
With regard to our environmental strategy , 
an example of our innovation is the recently 
launched Carbon Voyage Scheme at EC&O 
Venues. This provides solutions for freight 
and delegate travel aimed at reducing costs 
and carbon emissions.
Of particular note in our community strategy 
is the Covent Garden Business Enterprise 
challenge in which a total of 550 young people 
worked to design a product that could be sold 
in the Apple Market and developed their 
business skills in the process.
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITy
Ian Henderson, Chairman of the Corporate Responsibility Committee
We value the feedback received from our 
stakeholders on environmental and 
community issues and these views influence 
the design of our future strategy . The 
opinions of our employees are taken into 
consideration when determining the 
direction of our human resources strategy .

The CR Committee, which is chaired by Ian 
Henderson, ensures that CR initiatives are 
firmly aligned with corporate strategy . The 
implementation of strategy is driven by the 
CR Executive Committee, which is chaired by 
HR and CR Director, Jill Pett. Capco also has 
a Charity Committee, chaired by Ian Durant. 
Capco’s Business Code of Practice and 
company policies set out long-term 
commitments to high standards of social, 
ethical and environmental practices. They 
also frame the CR annual objectives which 
are set and reviewed every year. 
prOgress
In last year’s Annual Report we set out our 
CR objectives for 2011 and we are pleased that 
we have made progress against our goals.
We have set ourselves stretching aims 
for the year ahead that will take our CR 
strategy forward into the next phase of 
our development. 
In this section we report on progress made 
and future intentions.
I am satisfied with the progress we have made

At Covent Garden we appointed a new refuse contractor, 
and aim to achieve zero landfill waste from the Market 
Building. All non-recyclable waste will be taken to an 
Energy Recovery Plant or Material Recycling 
Facility (MRF).
Waste segregation from our Covent Garden construction 
sites is being logged using online programme ‘Smartwaste’ 
to minimise landfill. At The Henrietta development we 
implemented robust segregation of waste, allowing 85 per 
cent to be recycled. 
At our head office we have installed desk-side recycling 
boxes and recycling bins on each floor. Our recycling 
company uses an MRF site to maximise recycling 
opportunities. Any non-recyclable waste is used as fuel for 
energy recovery by incineration. 
Aim to increase waste recycling 
from our Covent Garden tenants, 
produce reliable statistical data for 
ongoing monitoring and 
investigate options for rolling this 
out across our estate.
Continue to work closely with our 
contractors to minimise waste sent 
to landfill.

Continue to focus 
development initiatives 
on the regeneration of 
brown-field sites and the 
sensitive and appropriate 
renovation of 
existing properties.
During our development work at The Henrietta in 
Covent Garden, we preserved as much of the existing 
building as possible, including most of the structure, 
wall tiles and windows. Fireplaces were retained for  
use on future projects. 
LED lighting was introduced in areas of The Flower 
Cellars development in Covent Garden to reduce 
electricity consumption. 
The new West Hall at Olympia has one of the most efficient 
heavily loaded suspended floor slabs in the country , 
providing a saving of 15 per cent on its carbon footprint

Good corporate governance 
underpins Capco
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Ian Durant, Chairman
cHairman’s intrOductiOn
In my Chairman’s Statement I noted that 
a strong corporate governance structure 
underpins Capco’s culture. I have a personal 
interest in corporate governance and am 
a member of the corporate governance 
committee of the ICAEW and the 30% Club 
which encourages increased gender diversity 
on Boards. I am therefore pleased to introduce 
Capco’s 2011 Corporate Governance Report. 
Good corporate governance underpins our 
organisation, providing a framework of 
controls and reporting on which the business 
operates. This report describes the operation 
of the Board and its Committees and explains 
how we applied the principles of good 
governance set out in the u K Governance 
Code last year.
The report provides information on the 
wide range of matters considered by the 
Board and Committees during the year. 
Of these, particular attention was given to 
Group strategy .
Board composition remains a key focus, and 
the report contains an update on our ongoing 
recruitment of a new Non-executive Director.
Our annual Board Evaluation has helped 
shape our agenda for 2012, and we set out 
some of the outcomes on page 55. 
Capco is committed to maintaining high 
standards of corporate governance. This is 
demonstrated by our early adoption of two 
key provisions of the new u K Corporate 
Governance Code last year: annual re-election 
of Directors, and periodic external Board 
valuations. The Board will continue to 
monitor corporate governance developments 
and ensure that we maintain the high 
standards we have set ourselves.
We are committed to maintaining the high corporate 
governance standards we have set ourselves, and Board 
diversity is a key focus.  
statement of compliance with the uk

u K Corporate Governance Code, except that 
from 1 January 2011 to 4 February 2011 less

Non-executive Directors. Following David

details of non-compliance
From 1 January 2011 to 4 February 2011 less 
than half the Board comprised independent 
Non-executive Directors.
explanation
The Board appointed on demerger from 
Liberty International PLC was felt to offer 
continuity to shareholders and to remove 
the risk of introducing a number of new 
Directors to the Company within a short 
period of time. Immediately following the 
demerger a search was initiated for an 
additional independent Non-executive 
Director who would be appointed as 
Chairman of the Audit Committee. 
Following the appointment of Henry 
Staunton, and the resignation of David 
Fischel, the Company is now compliant 
with this provision. our business performance How we govern our business our financial statements understanding our business

to be independent as they met the Combined Code’s 
independence criteria on their appointment as 
Non-executive Directors of the Company’s former

continued independence on appointment as Directors 
of the Company .
board skills
Information on the skills and experience  
of each Director can be found in their 
biographies on pages 50 and 51.
diversity
There is currently a lack of gender diversity 
on the Capco Board. The Board intends to 
make an appointment during 2012 that will 
strengthen Board Diversity . Following this 
appointment the percentage of female 
Directors is expected to be 10%. Additional 
information on Capco’s recruitment process 
for Non-executive Directors is set out on  
page 58.
Diversity is important to Capco across the 
Group. The Board recognises the benefits that 
diversity , including gender diversity , brings 
and has adopted a Board Diversity Policy . 
Additionally , the Chairman is a member of 
the 30% Club, committed to engaging on 
the topic to bring more women onto u K 
corporate boards. 
We recognise the business benefits of 
employing people with varied outlooks. 
We are keen to develop female talent and the 
ratio of women to men within our Senior 
Management team is 1:1. Further information 
on our people practices, including our 
learning and development strategies, is 
contained in the Corporate Responsibility 
report on pages 44 to 49.
The Davies Review on Women on Boards 
recommended that companies should set out 
the percentage of women they aim to have on 
their Boards in 2013 and 2015. The Board does 
not feel that it would be appropriate to set 
targets as all appointments must be made on 
merit, however gender and wider diversity 
issues will be taken into consideration when 
evaluating the skills, knowledge and 
experience desirable to fill each Board 
vacancy . We will report on Board Diversity 
each year from now on.
leadersHip structure
The Board is collectively responsible for the 
long-term success of the Company , and for its 
leadership, strategy , control and management. 
The roles of the Chairman and Chief 
Executive are distinct and formally 
documented, with the Chairman being 
responsible for the leadership of the Board, 
ensuring its effectiveness and setting its 
agenda, and the Chief Executive for 
developing the Company’s strategic direction, 
implementing policies and strategies decided 
by the Board and managing the business in 
the most effective way possible.
Day-to-day management of the Group is 
delegated to the Executive Directors, subject 
to formal delegated authority limits, however 
certain matters have been reserved for 
consideration by the Board. These matters, 
which are reviewed annually , include: 
decisions on the composition of the Board, its 
Committees, Company strategy , significant 
funding decisions and corporate transactions, 
delegated authority limits and dividend policy . 
The Board meets formally throughout the 
year with main meetings timed around the 
financial calendar, and additional meetings 
convened to consider specific matters as 
required. Attendance at meetings held during 
2011 is shown in the table on page 55. If 
matters require approval at short notice, 
written approval is sought from all Directors.
Board papers are circulated several days in 
advance of meetings to ensure that Directors 
have sufficient time to consider their content 
prior to the meeting.
The Chairman also meets regularly with 
the Non-executive Directors without the 
Executive Directors being present. How we govern our business

board effectiveness
board performance and evaluation 
The Board conducts an annual evaluation 
of its own performance and that of its 
Committees and Directors. Following the 
externally facilitated review undertaken by 
Independent Audit Limited in 2010, it was felt 
that an internal review led by the Chairman 
and Company Secretary was appropriate for 
2011. It is anticipated that an internal review 
will also be undertaken during 2012. Directors 
were asked to answer questions on a wide 
range of topics, and to highlight any areas 
they felt needed additional focus. The 
outcome of the review was positive, with 
the Board judged to be effective and open, 
however several areas have been identified 
for attention during 2012. 
In addition to the Board evaluation, during 
the year the Senior Independent Director 
and Non-executive Directors conducted their 
first annual appraisal of the Chairman’s 
performance, and the Chairman undertook an 
appraisal of the Chief Executive’s performance.

Our policy
The Board is keen to ensure that our 
shareholders and potential investors have a 
good understanding of Capco’s business and 
performance, and that Directors are aware of 
any issues and concerns which shareholders 
may have. The Company communicates with 
stakeholders in a variety of ways.
corporate w ebsite
Our corporate website  
www .capitalandcounties.com allows  
visitors to access Company information, 
annual reports and results presentations.  
The site also includes links to our business 
unit websites and contact details for 
shareholder queries. We are happy to 
answer queries by telephone or email 
(feedback@capitalandcounties.com).
annual general meeting 
The AGM allows the Chief Executive to 
update our shareholders on the progress of 
the business, and provides an opportunity 
for shareholders to pose questions to the 
Board, and meet senior executives. 
Shareholders are encouraged to vote on 
the resolutions put to the meeting, either 
in person at the meeting, online or by 
submitting a proxy card. We publish the 
results of the votes on all resolutions on 
our website following the meeting. 
Our 2012 AGM will be held on 20 April 2012. 
The notice of Annual General Meeting will be 
issued to shareholders at least 20 working 
days before the meeting. Separate resolutions 
will be proposed on each separate issue,  
and in accordance with the u K Corporate 
Governance Code, each of the Directors will 
offer themselves for re-election.
The Chairman and Chairmen of the Board 
Committees will be available at the AGM to 
meet shareholders and answer any questions. 
Should shareholders be unable to successfully 
resolve concerns following contact with the 
Chairman, Chief Executive or Finance 
Director, they may raise them through the 
Senior Independent Director. 
shareholders
Communication with the Company’s investors 
is a priority for the Board. The Company has 
an extensive investor relations programme, 
and during the year the Chief Executive and 
Finance Director held many meetings with the 
Company’s major shareholders to discuss the 
Group’s strategy and explain progress made 
across its estates. Numerous tours of the 
Group’s assets with investors and analysts were 
also held. The Chairman also writes to the 
Company’s major institutional shareholders 
each year and invites them to meet with him 
and the Senior Independent Director to discuss 
any matters they may wish to raise. 
The Company has undertaken to consult 
with its major shareholders before 
implementing any significant changes to 
its remuneration structure.
During 2011 Board Directors also met with 
members of the u K Shareholders’ Association.
The Directors receive regular updates on the 
Company’s major shareholders, and receive 
reports on shareholder feedback at each 
Board meeting. The Non-executive Directors 
are invited to attend the Company’s 
results presentations.
cOnflicts Of interest
The Chairman’s other business commitments 
are set out in his biography on page 51. 
During the year the Chairman was appointed 
as a Non-executive Director of Home Retail 
Group plc and Greggs plc. The Board remains 
satisfied that these commitments do not 
interfere with the performance of his duties 
as Chairman. 
It is intended that the Deputy Chairman 
will be appointed as a Director of the 
supervisory Board of Capco’s joint venture 
in respect of the Seagrave Road development. 
He will receive no remuneration for this 
appointment. The Board considered this 
appointment carefully before confirming 
its approval and is satisfied that there is 
no conflict of interest and that the 
appointment will not compromise 
Mr Henderson’s independence.
On appointment, and each subsequent year, 
Non-executive Directors are required to 
confirm in writing that they have sufficient 
time to devote to the Company’s affairs. 
In addition they are required to seek prior 
approval from the Chairman before taking 
on any additional external commitments 
which may affect their time available to 
devote to the Company .
The Company’s Articles of Association permit 
the Board to authorise potential conflicts of 
a Director’s interests that may arise. The 
Board has adopted a procedure under which 
Directors must notify the Chairman of any 
potential conflicts. The Chairman then 
decides whether a conflict exists and 
recommends its authorisation by the Board 
where appropriate. A Director who had 
a conflict of interest would not be counted 
in the quorum or entitled to vote when the 
Board considered the matter in which the 
Director had an interest.

The Board has established Audit, 
Remuneration, Nomination and Corporate 
Responsibility Committees. The terms of each 
Committee are available on the Company’s

The Audit Committee, reporting to the  
Board, has responsibility for overseeing the 
financial reporting process, monitoring the 
effectiveness of internal controls, internal 
audit, risk management, the statutory audit 
and monitoring the independence of the 
statutory auditors and the provision of 
non-audit services. 
In addition to regular reports from the 
Financial Controller, matters considered  
by the Audit Committee each year include:
 – Preliminary Results and Annual Report
 – Representation letters
 – Going Concern
 – Management Accounts
 – Corporate Governance Policies
 – Valuers’ reports and valuations
 – Internal Audit Plan and reports
 – Taxation
 – Risk management review
 – Controls update
 – External audit plan

Management Statements 
 – Regulatory developments
During 2011 the Audit Committee 
also considered:
 – The Bribery Act 2010
 – Earls Court Development
 – Disaster recovery and business 
continuity procedures
The Committee met privately during the year 
with both the external and internal auditors 
and Committee members attended a private 
meeting with the Company’s valuers. The 
Committee invites the Company’s Chairman, 
Chief Executive, Finance Director and 
Financial Controller to attend its meetings 
together with senior representatives of the 
external and internal auditors. Other senior 
management are invited to present such 
reports as are required for the Committee 
to discharge its responsibilities.
(a) external auditors
The Committee has oversight of the 
relationship with the external auditors, with 
responsibility for developing, implementing 
and monitoring the Company’s policy on 
external audit, and for monitoring the 
auditors’ independence, objectivity and 
compliance with ethical, professional and 
regulatory requirements. Following a tender 
process in 2010 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
(“PwC”) were appointed as Group auditors. 
The Committee monitored PwC’s performance 
during 2011 and is satisfied with the service 
received. The Committee has therefore 
recommended to the Board that PwC be 
reappointed in 2012.
(b) internal auditors
Following an assessment of the internal audit 
requirement from 2011 onwards, BDO LLP 
were appointed as internal auditor in place of 
CSC who had provided transitional services 
after the demerger in 2010. A five-year audit 
plan was developed which is aligned to areas 
highlighted in the Group risk register. 
Au DIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Henry Staunton, Chairman of the Audit Committee
I am pleased to introduce Capco’ s 2011 Audit  
Committee Report. The Audit Committee is confident  
that effective internal controls and risk management  
processes are in place. It was pleasing that the Board’ s 
confidence in the Committee was reflected in the 2011 
Board evaluation.   How we govern our business
60 
Au DIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINu ED
A particular focus for 2011 was a review of 
the systems and processes established during 
the year following the conclusion of the 
transitional services previously provided by 
CSC. The Committee also requested that 
a business unit review of The Brewery be 
undertaken. The work conducted by BDO 
since their appointment has included  
reviews of corporation tax compliance, VAT 
compliance, PAy E & NI, expenses, capital 
expenditure, health & safety , IT projects, the 
Bribery Act 2010, a business unit review of 
The Brewery , accounts payable and insurance. 
(c) non-audit services
The Company has adopted a policy to ensure 
that the provision of non-audit services by 
the external auditors does not compromise 
its independence or objectivity . The term 
“non-audit services” does not include 
reference to any advice on tax. under the 
policy , Executive Directors may commission 
non-audit work with a cost not exceeding the 
lower of £50,000 or 15 per cent of the 
estimated annual level of the auditors’ fees at 
that time. Costs exceeding this limit must be 
approved in advance by the Audit Committee 
Chairman. In addition, the Executive 
Directors must give consideration to the 
preservation of auditor independence; and 
the external auditors are required to confirm 
that they are acting independently and 
must not audit their own work; make 
management decisions for the Company; 
create a mutuality of interest; develop close 
personal relationships with the Company’s 
personnel; or find themselves in the role of 
advocate for the Company .
The total fees paid and payable to PwC in 2011 
were £370,000 of which £54,000 related to 
non-audit work. These fees primarily relate 
to corporate finance advisory services. The 
Committee is satisfied that the external 
auditors remain independent and objective.
(d) internal control and risk 
management
The Board has overall responsibility for the 
Group’s risk management framework and 
system of internal control and the ongoing 
review of their effectiveness. A summary of 
the risk management framework is set out 
on page 14. The framework is designed to 
manage rather than eliminate risk, and can 
only provide reasonable, and not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement or 
loss. The Audit Committee monitors and 
reviews the Group’s internal controls and  
risk, and reports to the Board on its work 
and conclusions.
Ongoing processes for identifying, evaluating 
and managing the significant risks faced by 
the Group were in place throughout the year. 
These controls accord with the Turnbull 
guidance “Internal Control – Guidance for 
Directors on the Combined Code” and 
remained in place up to the date of the 
approval of this Annual Report. The 
procedures are reviewed by the Board on 
an annual basis.
The key elements of the Group’s day-to-day 
procedures and internal control framework 
are:
 – Formal schedule of matters reserved for 
the Board
 – Formal delegated authority limits
 – Formal documentation of significant 
transactions
 – The Executive Directors are closely 
involved in the day-to-day operations of  
the business and hold regular meetings 
with senior management to review all 
aspects of the business
 – The Board received regular updates on 
strategy and project developments at the 
formal Board meetings and 
Directors’ updates
 – A formal whistleblowing procedure is in 
place under which staff may raise matters 
of concern (no calls were received during 
the year).
Specific controls relating to financial reporting 
and consolidation processes include:
 – Management structure with clear lines  
of responsibility and accountability ,  
staffed by appropriate personnel
 – A comprehensive system of budgeting 
and review . The Board and Audit 
Committee receive regular reports from 
the Finance Director which include 
forecasts and performance against  
budget and financial covenants
 – The internal audit programme undertaken 
by BDO LLP . The Committee is satisfied 
that the internal audit services provided 
by BDO were independent and effective.
 – Group Finance participates in the control 
self-assessment and policy compliance 
elements of the risk management 
framework and sets formal requirements 
with business unit finance functions which 
specify the reports and approvals required. 
Group Internal Audit regularly reviews  
the effectiveness of internal controls and 
reports its findings to the Audit Committee. 
An annual risk management review is 
undertaken to identify risks and review the 
effectiveness of mitigating controls. Reports 
on risks and controls are obtained from across 
the Group and used by a committee headed by 
the Finance Director to compile a Group risk 
register. The report is received by the Audit 
Committee, and the Committee Chairman 
makes a report to the Board.
The risk register is reviewed twice a year and 
upon any material change to the business. 
Any risks identified between these reviews 
will be logged. The Group’s principal risks 
and uncertainties are set out on pages 14 to 17 .
(e) bribery act 2010
In advance of the implementation of the 
Bribery Act 2010 on 1 July 2011, the Company 
undertook a review of its existing policies and 
potential risk areas. A new anti-corruption 
and bribery policy was adopted and issued  
to staff, and training was given to relevant 
employees. The anti-corruption and bribery 
policy can be viewed on the Company’s 
website www .capitalandcounties.com. The 
implementation of the new provisions was 
overseen by the Audit Committee, and two 
reviews of the arrangements were conducted 
by BDO with satisfactory outcomes.

2. remuneratiOn pOlicy
The key objectives of the Company’s 
Remuneration Policy are to:
 – Strongly align executive remuneration 
with shareholders’ interests including the 
encouragement of Executives to acquire 
a meaningful holding of Capco shares
 – underpin a pay-for-performance culture
 – Support the retention, motivation and 
recruitment of talented people who are 
commercially astute and creative
Accordingly , the Committee aims to achieve 
an appropriate balance between fixed and 
variable remuneration, and between 
remuneration based on short-term and 
long-term performance. Fixed remuneration 
includes base salary , benefits and pension. 
Variable remuneration includes an annual 
bonus, a proportion of which is deferred 
in shares which may be matched subject to 
long-term performance (via the Matching 
Share Plan (MSP)), and annual awards under 
a Performance Share Plan (PSP) which 
rewards long-term performance.

The Remuneration Policy is aligned to the 
strategy and nature of the Company , and 
reflects the importance of total return and 
the long-term nature of Capco’s business.
Since listing in May 2010 Capco has 
established itself through the delivery of 
consistently strong levels of performance 
for its shareholders. Two years on, the 
Remuneration Committee believes it is 
timely to carry out a review of the 
Remuneration Policy and remuneration 
arrangements to ensure they continue to 
be appropriately aligned with the strategy 
and shareholders’ interests. 
The Committee has considered whether any 
aspects of the Remuneration Policy could 
inadvertently encourage Executives to take 
inappropriate risks, and has concluded that 
the policy remains appropriate in this regard. 
The charts below highlight the relatively 
strong emphasis on variable pay within each 
Executive Director’s remuneration.
3. elements Of executive 
directOr remuneratiOn
Details of Executive Directors’ 2011 
emoluments and their interests in each 
incentive plan are provided in tables a) to d)  
on pages 66 to 68. A description of each key 
element of the remuneration package is 
provided below .
(1) base salary and benefits
The Committee reviews Executive Directors’ 
base salaries with reference to other property 
companies (including the constituents of the 
long-term incentive plans’ comparator group), 
companies of a similar size, and each 
Executive’s performance and contribution 
during the year. The Committee’s policy  
is to place appropriate emphasis on the 
performance-related elements of 
remuneration, while ensuring base salary 
remains appropriately competitive. Executive 
Director salary levels will be considered as part 
of the overall review of remuneration. When 
setting Executive Director pay , the Committee 
also considers the remuneration and overall 
conditions of all employees. 
The Company provides Executive Directors 
with benefits which include private healthcare, 
life insurance and a cash car allowance. 63 www.capitalandcounties.com 
our business performance How we govern our business our financial statements understanding our business
(2) pension
The Company operates a defined contribution 
pension scheme with a Company contribution 
of 24 per cent of base salary for Executive 
Directors. The Executive Directors may elect to 
be paid some or all of this entitlement in cash.
(3) annual bonus
Executive Directors may earn bonuses 
depending on the Company’s financial 
performance (50 per cent) and their own 
individual performance (50 per cent), 
as illustrated above.
The financial performance element for the 
year ended 31 December 2011 was based on 
absolute NAV growth per share, Total 
Property Return relative to the IPD Total 
Return All Property Index and adjusted EPS. 
The Committee has decided that these 
measures remain appropriate for 2012. In 
determining the annual targets for these 
measures in 2011, the Committee recognised 
the medium-term nature of the Company’s 
strategy , particularly with regard to its land 
holdings at Earls Court, and the extent to 
which this would be reflected in these 
measures on a 12-month horizon. In respect  
of the year ended 31 December 2011, the 
Committee noted the Company’s strong 
performance against each of the targets, 
and accordingly the maximum awards 
were made in respect of the financial 
performance element. 
The individual performance element for the 
year ended 31 December 2011 was based on the 
achievement of various corporate objectives. 
The individual targets for the Executive 
Directors encompassed all relevant aspects of 
the business including specific business 
objectives relating to Capco’s assets, financial 
goals and CR matters. The Executive Directors

were each considered to have delivered  
a very strong performance, particularly the 
establishment of the conditional Joint 
Venture in respect of Seagrave Road, the 
£100m share placing to fund the acquisition 
of new properties in Covent Garden, the 
£300m refinancing of the Covent Garden 
portfolio and the submission of planning 
applications for the Earls Court and West 
Kensington Opportunity Area and Seagrave 
Road. Accordingly the maximum award 
was made in respect of the individual 
performance element.
The maximum bonus opportunity for 
Executive Directors is 150 per cent of annual 
salary with a bonus of 75 per cent of salary 
payable for achieving target levels of 
performance. 50 per cent of any bonus  
earned is payable in cash and 50 per cent  
is deferred in Capco shares for three years, 
under the Matching Share Plan (MSP),  
subject to risk of forfeiture should an 
Executive leave the Company .
(4) matching share plan (msp)
There is an opportunity for Executives to earn 
up to one matching share for each deferred 
share awarded under the arrangements above, 
based on performance over three years. 
Details of the performance conditions are 
provided in the long-term incentive 
performance conditions section below . For 
2010 (the inception year of Capco), Executives 
were invited to invest up to 150 per cent of 
salary in the Company’s shares during the 
first 12 months of inception in return for the 
opportunity to receive up to two shares for 
each share purchased, subject to three year 
performance. At the discretion of the 
Committee the initial investment period 
could be extended to 24 months. Due to the 
extended restricted periods to which the 
Company was subject this discretion was 
exercised during the year. The initial higher 
matching level is intended to help ‘kick-start’ 
the plan by ensuring Executives are highly 
motivated to drive the long-term performance 
of Capco. Ian Hawksworth and Gary yardley 
have now reached the maximum investment 
under these arrangements.
(5) performance share plan (psp)
Executives are eligible to receive awards 
under the PSP at the discretion of the 
Committee. Each year participants may be 
granted market value share options of up to 
300 per cent of salary or up to 150 per cent of 
salary in shares or nil-cost options which vest 
subject to three year performance. Details of 
the performance conditions are provided in 
the next section. In exceptional circumstances 
the Committee can make awards of market 
value share options of up to 400 per cent of 
salary or up to 200 per cent of salary in nil-cost 
options. In 2011 the Committee made awards 
of 150 per cent of salary in nil-cost options to 
Executive Directors.

The Committee is exploring ways of 
structuring future awards under the 
long-term incentive arrangements in a 
potentially more tax efficient manner for 
participants. The Committee will ensure 
that any changes are cost neutral to Capco.

The performance conditions are the same 
for both the MSP and PSP and comprise 
two measures:
Three-year relative Total Return (TR, growth 
in Net Asset Value per share plus dividends) 
and three-year relative Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR, increase in price of an ordinary 
share plus dividends). Awards are weighted 
equally , i.e. 50 per cent on performance 
against each of these measures. For 2010 and 
2011 awards, the performance conditions are 
illustrated below . Performance is measured 
relative to a comparator group which 
comprises the eight largest FTSE 350 
property companies, also listed below .
tr and tsr comparator group
Great Portland Estates British Land
Shaftesbury Hammerson
Derwent London Land Securities
CSC Segro
The Committee believes long-term relative 
performance provides an appropriately 
objective and relevant measure of Capco’s 
success which is strongly aligned with 
shareholders’ interests.
The Committee will review the continued 
appropriateness of the comparator companies 
and performance target calibration at the 
beginning of each performance cycle and 
intends to use the same comparator group 
and targets for 2012 awards.
The vesting schedules for each of the 
TSR and TR performance conditions are 
illustrated below .
In order for any awards to vest, the Committee 
must satisfy itself that the TR and TSR figures 
are a genuine reflection of underlying 
financial performance. In assessing the extent 
to which the performance conditions have 
been met, the Committee will consult with 
its independent remuneration adviser. The 
calculation of the returns will be reviewed by 
the Company’s auditors as appropriate.

period. Any annual bonus payment in respect 
of the year of termination is subject to the 
discretion of the Committee. MSP and PSP 
vesting is also at the discretion of the 
Committee and accordingly any awards will

The Chairman has been appointed for an 
initial term which will expire at the 2013 
AGM. The Chairman’s annual base fee was 
£200,000 together with an annual car 
allowance of £18,000, although this has been 
varied such that a proportion is paid into a 
SIPP arrangement. During the first three 
years of acting as Chairman he will also 
receive a supplement of 15 per cent of his base 
fee in lieu of any pension contributions. Also, 
the Company made a matching award of 
deferred shares comprising 200 per cent of 
the number of invested shares in respect of 
each Capco share he purchased within the 
first 12 months of inception of Capco (up to 
150 per cent of his base fee.) This represented

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ remuneration report and the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared the 
Group and Parent Company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union. Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these 
financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
(a)  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
(b)  make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
(c)  state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union (EU) have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed  
and explained in the financial statements; and  
(d)  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue  
in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions  
and disclose, with reasonable accuracy at any time, the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that  
the financial statements and the Directors’ remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence  
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing  
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.  
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in the Governance section, confirm that, to the best of their knowledge: 
(a)  the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view  
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group; and 
(b)  the Directors’ report contained in the Governance section of the Annual Report includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties  
that it faces. 
Signed on behalf of the Board on 29 February 2012.

We have audited the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements (the “financial statements”) of Capital & Counties 
Properties PLC for the year ended 31 December 2011 which comprise 
the Group and Company balance sheets, the consolidated income 
statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the 
Group and Company cash flow statements, the statement of changes 
in equity and the related notes. The financial reporting framework 
that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union and, as regards the Parent Company financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006. 
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS  
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities set out on page 71, the Directors are responsible  
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only 
for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do 
not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown  
or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our 
prior consent in writing. 
SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent 
Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-
financial information in the Annual Report & Accounts 2011 to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies 
we consider the implications for our report. 
OPINION ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
In our opinion:  
– the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of  
the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 
2011 and of the Group’s profit and Group’s and Parent Company’s 
cash flows for the year then ended; 
– the Group financial statements have been properly prepared  
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;  
– the Parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006; and 
– the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.  
OPINION ON OTHER MATTERS PRESCRIBED BY THE 
COMPANIES ACT 2006  
In our opinion:  
– the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006; 
– the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial 
year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements; and 
– the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement 
set out on pages 52 to 58 with respect to internal control and  
risk management systems and about share capital structures  
is consistent with the financial statements. 
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT  
BY EXCEPTION  
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:  
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion:  
– adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or  
– the Parent Company financial statements and the part of  
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not  
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or  
– certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by  
law are not made; or  
– we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or 
– a corporate governance statement has not been prepared by the 
Parent Company.  
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:  
– the Directors’ statement, set out on page 70, in relation to  
going concern; 
– the parts of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to  
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code specified for our review; and

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 
 
 
1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
General information 
The Capital & Counties Properties PLC Group demerged from its 
former parent company, Liberty International PLC (subsequently 
renamed Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC), with effect from  
7 May 2010. Shares in Capital & Counties Properties PLC were 
admitted to dealings on the London and Johannesburg Stock 
Exchanges in May 2010. The Group’s assets principally comprise 
investment properties at Covent Garden; Earls Court & Olympia;  
a 50 per cent interest in the Empress State building; and a 50 per cent 
interest in The Great Capital Partnership, a joint venture focused 
predominantly on London’s West End. 
Capital & Counties Properties PLC was incorporated and registered 
in England and Wales on 3 February 2010 under the Companies Act 
as a public company limited by shares with registration number 
7145051. The registered office of the Company is 15 Grosvenor Street, 
London, W1K 4QZ, United Kingdom. The principal activity of the 
Company is to act as the ultimate parent company of Capital & 
Counties Properties PLC Group, whose principal activity is the 
development and management of investment property. 
Basis of preparation 
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”), as adopted by the European Union, International Financial 
Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations and 
with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS. The Company’s financial statements for the 
comparative period cover the period from incorporation, therefore 
references appearing in these financial statements to the year ended 
should, for the comparative period, be read as being for the period 
ended. The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption  
offered by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present  
a separate income statement or statement of changes in equity  
for the Parent Company. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under  
the historical cost convention as modified for the revaluation of 
properties, available for sale investments and financial assets  
held for trading.  
Standards and guidelines relevant to the Group that were in issue 
and endorsed at the date of approval of the consolidated financial 
statements but not yet effective and have not been adopted early: 
IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ (amendment) 
IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ (amendment) 
The assessment of amendments issued but not effective are not 
anticipated to have a material impact on the financial statements. 
During 2011, the following accounting standards and guidance were 
adopted by the Group:  
IAS 24 ‘Related Party Disclosures’ (revised)  
IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ (amendment) 
IFRS 1 ‘First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting 
Standards’ (amendment)  
IFRIC 14 ‘Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement’ 
(amendment) 
IFRIC 19 ‘Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity 
Instruments’ 
Collectively, together with the International Accounting Standards 
Board’s annual improvements, these pronouncements either had no 
impact on the consolidated financial statements or resulted in 
changes to presentation and disclosure only. 
2010 Group reconstruction 
All Capital & Counties Properties PLC Group companies which  
were owned and controlled by Liberty International PLC prior to  
the demerger were transferred under the new ultimate parent 
company, Capital & Counties Properties PLC, prior to 7 May 2010. 
The introduction of this new ultimate holding company constituted 
a group reconstruction. 
The transaction fell outside the scope of IFRS 3 ‘Business 
Combinations’. Accordingly, following the guidance regarding the 
selection of an appropriate accounting policy provided in IAS 8 
‘Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors’, 
the transaction has been accounted for in these financial statements 
using the principles of merger accounting with reference to UK 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP). This policy, 
which does not conflict with IFRS, reflects the economic substance  
of the transaction. 
Amounts due to former subsidiary undertakings of Liberty 
International PLC which were not demerged, were waived prior  
to demerger. In order to achieve uniformity, debt waivers received 
were treated as a capital contribution rather than an extinguishment 
of debt. 
Therefore, although the Group reconstruction did not become 
unconditional until 7 May 2010, the comparative financial 
statements have been presented as if the Group structure had always 
been in place. For further details on the demerger refer to page 117. 
Going concern basis 
The Directors are satisfied that the Group has the resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, for this 
reason the consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going 
concern basis. 
Basis of consolidation 
These accounts include the consolidation of the following limited 
partnerships: Capital & Counties CGP, Capital & Counties CGP 9, 
Capco CGP 2010 LP, EC Properties LP and Seagrave Road LP. The 
members of these qualifying partnerships have taken advantage of 
disclosure exemptions available in Statutory Instrument 2008/569 
and therefore will not produce consolidated accounts at the 
partnership level. 
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in British  
pounds sterling which is determined to be the functional currency  
of the Parent. 
Subsidiaries 
Subsidiary undertakings are fully consolidated from the date on 
which the Group is deemed to govern the financial and operating 
policies of an entity, whether through a majority of the voting rights 
or otherwise. They cease to be consolidated from the date this control 
is lost.  
All intragroup balances resulting from intragroup transactions are 
eliminated in full. 
Any proportion of a subsidiary’s income statement and net assets  
not held by the Group are presented separately as non-controlling 
interests within these consolidated financial statements. 
Joint ventures 
The Group’s interest in jointly controlled entities is accounted for 
using proportional consolidation. The Group’s share of the assets, 
liabilities, income and expenses is combined with the equivalent 
items in the consolidated financial statements on a line-by-line basis.  79 www.capitalandcounties.com

1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 
Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are reviewed at least 
annually for impairment. Where there exists an indication of 
impairment an assessment of the recoverable amount is performed. 
The recoverable amount is based on the higher of the investment’s 
continued value in use or its fair value less cost to sell; fair value is 
derived from the entities’ net asset value at the balance sheet date. 
Estimation and uncertainty 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity 
with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported 
amounts of revenues and expenses. Although these estimates are 
based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or 
actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. 
The most significant area of estimation and uncertainty in the 
consolidated set of financial statements is in respect of the valuation 
of the property portfolio and investments, where external valuations 
are obtained. Other areas of estimation and uncertainty are included 
within the accounting policies below, the more significant being: 
Revenue recognition 
Share-based payments 
Provisions 
Pensions 
Contingent liabilities and capital commitments 
Income tax 
Trade and other receivables 
Derivative financial instruments 
Operating segments 
Management has determined the operating segments with reference 
to reports on divisional financial performance and position which are 
regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive, who is deemed to be the 
chief operating decision maker. 
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in currencies other than the Company’s functional 
currency are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing at the 
transaction date. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from 
settlement of these transactions and from retranslation of monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
recognised in the income statement except for differences arising  
on the retranslation of available for sale investments which are 
recognised in other comprehensive income.  
Revenue recognition 
Property rental income and exhibition income consists of gross 
income calculated on an accruals basis, together with services  
where the Group acts as principal in the ordinary course of business, 
excluding sales of investment properties. Rental income receivable  
is spread evenly over the period from lease commencement to  
lease expiry.  
Lease incentive payments, including surrender premiums paid 
which can be directly linked to enhanced rental income, are 
amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Upon receipt  
of a surrender premium for the early termination of a lease, the profit 
and non-recoverable outgoings relating to the lease concerned are 
immediately reflected in income. 
Contingent rents, being those lease payments that are not fixed at  
the inception of a lease, for example increases arising on rent reviews, 
are recorded as income in the periods in which they are earned.  
Rent reviews are recognised as income, based on management’s 
estimates, when it is reasonable to assume they will be received. 
Estimates are derived from knowledge of market rents for 
comparable properties determined on an individual property  
basis and updated for progress of negotiations. 
Where revenue is obtained by the sale of properties, it is recognised 
when the significant risks and returns have been transferred to the 
buyer. This will normally take place on exchange of contracts unless 
there are conditions attached. For conditional exchanges, sales are 
recognised when these conditions are satisfied. 
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the 
principal outstanding and the effective interest rate. 
Dividend income is recognised when the relevant Group company’s 
right to receive payment has been established. 
Exceptional items 
Exceptional items are those items that in the Directors’ view are 
required to be separately disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence 
to enable a full understanding of the Group’s financial performance. 
These are excluded from the calculation of underlying earnings. 
Income taxes 
Current tax is the amount payable on the taxable income for the year 
and any adjustment in respect of prior years. It is calculated using 
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date.  
In accordance with IAS 12, deferred tax is provided using the balance 
sheet liability method on temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and 
the tax bases of those assets and liabilities. However temporary 
differences are not recognised to the extent that they arise from the 
initial recognition of assets and liabilities (other than on a business 
combination) that at the time of the transaction affect neither 
accounting nor taxable profit and loss. 
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to 
apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred 
tax liability is settled.  
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that 
management believes it is probable that future taxable profit will  
be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only when they relate to 
taxes levied by the same authority and the Group intends to settle 
them on a net basis. 
Tax is included in the income statement except when it relates to 
items recognised in other comprehensive income, or directly in 
equity, in which case the related tax is also recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity. 
Share-based payments 
The cost of granting share options and other share-based 
remuneration to employees and Directors is recognised through the 
income statement with reference to the fair value of the instrument 
at the date of grant. The income statement is charged over the vesting 
period of the options.  
An option pricing model is used applying assumptions around 
expected yields, forfeiture rates, exercise price and volatility.  
Own shares held in connection with employee share plans and other 
share-based payment arrangements are treated as treasury shares and 
deducted from equity.  
Impairment of financial assets 
An annual review is conducted for financial assets to determine 
whether there is any evidence of a loss event as described by IAS 39. 
Where there is objective evidence of impairment the amount of any 
loss is calculated by estimating future cash flows or by using fair 
value where this is available through observable market prices.  our financial statements

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 
 
 
1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 
Investment and development property 
Investment and development properties are owned or leased by the 
Group and held for long-term rental income and capital appreciation 
and exclude properties occupied by the Group. 
The Group has chosen to use the fair value model. Properties are 
initially recognised at cost and subsequently revalued at the balance 
sheet date to fair value as determined by professionally qualified 
external valuers on the basis of market value after allowing for  
future transaction costs. The valuation is based upon assumptions 
including market rent or business profitability, future growth, 
anticipated maintenance costs, development costs and an 
appropriate discount rate where possible applying yields based  
on known transactions for similar properties and likely incentives 
offered to tenants. These assumptions conform with Royal 
Institution of Chartered Surveyors (“RICS”) valuation standards.  
The fair value of properties is arrived at by adjusting the market 
value as above for directly attributable lease incentive assets and 
fixed head leases. 
Properties held under leases are stated gross of the recognised 
finance lease liability. 
The cost of development properties includes capitalised interest and 
other directly attributable outgoings, except in the case of properties 
and land where no development is imminent, in which case no 
interest is included. Interest is capitalised (before tax relief) on the 
basis of the average rate of interest paid on the relevant debt 
outstanding, until the date of practical completion. 
When the Group redevelops an existing investment property  
for continued future use as an investment property, the property 
remains an investment property measured at fair value. 
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment 
and development property are recognised in the income statement  
of the period in which they arise. Depreciation is not provided in 
respect of investment properties including plant and equipment 
integral to such investment properties. 
When the use of a property changes from that of trading property  
to investment property, such property is transferred at fair value, 
with any resulting gain being recognised as property trading profit.  
Investment properties cease recognition as investment property 
either when they have been disposed of or when they cease to be  
held for the purpose of generating rental income or for capital 
appreciation. Where the Group disposes of a property at fair value  
in an arm’s length transaction the carrying value immediately  
prior to the sale is adjusted to the transaction price, offset by any 
directly attributable costs, and the adjustment is recorded in the 
income statement.  
Leases 
Leases are classified according to the substance of the transaction.  
A lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee is classified as a finance lease. All other  
leases are normally classified as operating leases.  
Group as a lessee: 
In accordance with IAS 40, finance and operating leases of 
investment property are accounted for as finance leases and 
recognised as an asset and an obligation to pay future minimum  
lease payments. The investment property asset is included in the 
balance sheet at the lower of fair value and the present value of 
minimum lease payments, gross of the recognised finance lease 
liability. Lease payments are allocated between the liability and 
finance charges so as to achieve a constant financing rate. 
Other finance leased assets are capitalised at the lower of the fair 
value of the leased asset or the present value of the minimum lease 
payments and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the 
useful life of the asset.  
Rental expense under operating leases is charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Group as lessor: 
Assets leased out under finance leases are recognised as receivables at 
the amount of the Group’s net investment in the leases. Finance lease 
income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant 
rate of return on the net investment.  
Assets leased out under operating leases are included in investment 
property, with rental income recognised on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term.  
Trading property 
Trading property comprises those properties that in the Directors’ 
view are expected to be disposed of within one year of the balance 
sheet date. Such properties are transferred from investment property 
at fair value which forms its deemed cost. Subsequently it is carried  
at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Plant and equipment 
Plant and equipment consists of fixtures, fittings and other office 
equipment. Plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes 
the original purchase price of the asset plus any attributable cost in 
bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. 
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over an asset’s estimated useful life to a maximum of five years. 
Investment in Group companies 
Investment in Group companies, which is eliminated on 
consolidation, is stated in the Company’s separate financial 
statements at cost less impairment losses, if any. Impairment losses 
are determined with reference to the investment’s fair value less 
estimated selling costs. Fair value is derived from the subsidiary’s net 
assets at the balance sheet date. On disposal, the difference between 
the net disposal proceeds and its carrying amount is included in 
profit or loss. 
Investments 
Available for sale investments, being investments intended to be held 
for an indefinite period, are initially recognised and subsequently 
measured at fair value.  
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of available  
for sale investments are included in other comprehensive  
income, except to the extent that losses are determined to be 
attributable to impairment, in which case they are recognised  
in the income statement.  
Disposals are recorded upon distribution, at which time  
accumulated fair value adjustments are recycled from reserves  
to the income statement.  
Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value  
and subsequently measured at amortised cost. The Directors exercise 
judgement as to the collectability of the Group’s trade and other 
receivables and determine when it is appropriate to impair these 
assets. Factors such as days past due, credit status of the 
counterparty, historical evidence of collection and probability  
of deriving future economic benefit are considered.  
   81 www.capitalandcounties.com 
our business performance How we govern our business our financial statements understanding our business
 
 
1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents are recognised at fair value. Cash and cash 
equivalents comprise cash on hand, deposits with banks and other 
short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of 
three months or less. 
Derivative financial instruments 
The Group uses non-trading derivative financial instruments to 
manage exposure to interest rate risk. These instruments have not 
been designated as qualifying for hedge accounting. They are 
initially recognised on the trade date at fair value and subsequently 
remeasured at fair value based on market price. Changes in fair value 
are recognised directly in the income statement. 
Trade payables 
Trade payables are obligations for goods or services acquired in the 
ordinary course of business. Trade payables are recognised at fair 
value and subsequently measured at amortised cost until settled. 
Dividend distribution 
Dividend distributions to shareholders are recognised as a liability 
once approved by shareholders. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a current obligation 
arising from a past event and it is probable that the Group will be 
required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the 
Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle that 
obligation at the balance sheet date. 
Borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at their net proceeds on issue  
and subsequently carried at amortised cost. Any transaction costs, 
premiums or discounts are capitalised and recognised over the 
contractual life using the effective interest method. In the event of 
early repayment all unamortised transaction costs are recognised 
immediately in the income statement. 
Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a 
deduction from equity, net of any tax effects. 
Pensions 
The costs of the defined contribution scheme and the Group’s 
personal pension plans are charged against profits in the year in 
which they fall due.  
Past service costs, current service costs and curtailment gains of  
the defined benefit scheme are recognised immediately in income. 
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and 
changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity  
in other comprehensive income for the period in which they arise. 
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent 
actuaries using the projected unit credit method and applying 
assumptions which are agreed between the Group and its actuaries. 
Contingent liabilities and capital commitments 
Contingent liabilities are not recognised due to lack of certainty  
with respect to measurement of the potential future liability.  
A description of the nature and, where possible, an estimate of  
the financial effect of contingent liabilities is disclosed. 
Capital commitments are disclosed when the Group has a contractual 
future obligation which has not been provided for at the balance 
sheet date.  our financial statements

2 SEGMENTAL REPORTING 
Management has determined the operating segments based on reports reviewed by the Chief Executive, who is deemed to be the chief 
operating decision maker. The principal performance measures have been identified as net rental income and net asset value. 
For management and reporting purposes the Group is organised into five operating divisions being The Great Capital Partnership,  
Earls Court & Olympia, Covent Garden, China and Other. The Other segment primarily constitutes the business unit historically known  
as Opportunities and other head office companies. Due to actions taken by the fund manager who controls the divestment decisions 
pertaining to the Group’s interests in China, this segment has been presented separately as the segment’s results exceeds the quantitative 
threshold requiring separate disclosure. The Earls Court & Olympia segment also includes the Group’s interest in The Empress State  
Limited Partnership which holds the Empress State building adjacent to the Group’s property at Earls Court. 
The Group’s operating segments derive their revenue primarily from rental income from lessees, with the exception of Earls Court & Olympia 
whose revenue primarily represents exhibition income. 
Unallocated expenses are costs incurred centrally which are neither directly nor reasonably attributable to individual segments.

6 IMPAIRMENT OF OTHER RECEIVABLES 
Impairment of other receivables of £1.6 million arose in 2010 following an impairment review of loan notes receivable by the Group.  
The impairment charge was calculated with reference to the market value of certain property assets that the Group would have priority  
over in the event of default. There was no impairment in 2011. 
7 DEMERGER COSTS 
Demerger costs included within administration expenses in 2010 were those costs and fees that were directly related to the Group’s demerger 
from Liberty International. These included inter alia legal and professional fees, listing fees and costs associated with the establishment of the 
Company’s head office. These were treated as exceptional items and were not included in the calculation of underlying earnings.  85 www.capitalandcounties.com

11. TAXATION CONTINUED 
Factors affecting the tax charge for the year 
The tax assessed for the period is £8.2 million which is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the United Kingdom. 
The differences are explained below: 
 
2011
£m
2010
£m
Profit before tax 161.9 132.5
Profit on ordinary activities multiplied by the standard rate in the UK of 26.5% (2010 – 28%)  42.9 37.1
UK capital allowances not reversing on sale  (0.6) (1.5)
Revaluation surplus not recognised in deferred tax (15.8) (37.7)
Prior year corporation tax items – 0.1
Expenses disallowed, net of capitalised interest 0.5 1.5
REIT– corporation tax exemption on qualifying properties pre exit from REIT Regime – (0.5)
REIT– deferred tax movement in year post exit from REIT Regime – 19.4
REIT– entry charge – 0.1
Utilisation of losses (brought)/carried forward (11.0) 1.9
Non-taxable items (8.1) –
Deferred tax arising on exit from REIT Regime – (19.1)
Reduction in deferred tax following cut in corporate tax rate 0.3 (0.4)
Total tax expense reported in the income statement 8.2 0.9
As a result of exiting the UK REIT Regime, a deferred tax charge of £19.4 million was recognised in 2010 on investment properties and is 
disclosed in the tax reconciliation above as ‘REIT – deferred tax movement in year post exit from REIT Regime’. This charge was offset by  
a corresponding credit disclosed above under ‘Deferred tax arising on exit from REIT Regime’. 
Further amendments to the UK Corporation Tax system were announced in the March 2011 Budget which included changes to the main rates 
of UK Corporation Tax. The main rate of corporation tax decreased from 28 per cent to 26 per cent from 1 April 2011. The Budget will reduce 
the main rate of corporation tax from 26 per cent to 25 per cent from 1 April 2012. It proposes to make further reductions to the main rate of 
1 per cent per annum to 23 per cent by 1 April 2014. The decrease in tax rate to 25 per cent has been substantively enacted for the purposes of 
IAS 12 and therefore has been reflected in these financial statements. 
12 PROFIT/(LOSS) FOR THE PERIOD ATTRIBUTABLE TO SHAREHOLDERS OF CAPITAL & COUNTIES PROPERTIES PLC 
Profit of £2.8 million is dealt with in the accounts of the holding Company in respect of the year (2010 – losses of £1.6 million). No income 
statement or statement of changes in equity is presented for the Company as permitted by Section 408 Companies Act 2006.

Included within investment and development properties is £1.7 million (2010 – £0.8 million) of interest capitalised on developments and

The fair value of the Group’s investment and development properties as at 31 December 2011 was determined by independent external valuers 
Jones Lang LaSalle for Earls Court & Olympia (excluding Empress State), and CB Richard Ellis for the remainder of the Group’s investment 
and development property. The valuation conforms with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (“RICS”) Valuation Standards, and  
was arrived at by reference to market transactions for similar properties. Fees paid to valuers are based on fixed price contracts. 
The main assumptions underlying the valuations are in relation to market rent or business profitability, taking into account forecast growth 
rates and yields based on known transactions for similar properties and likely incentives offered to tenants. 
Valuations are based on what is determined to be the highest and best use. The Group’s investment at Earls Court, and Seagrave Road, a car 
park supporting Earls Court, have been valued as a site with development potential.  
There are certain restrictions on the realisability of investment property when a credit facility is in place. Also see disclosures in note 25.  our financial statements

Finance lease liabilities are in respect of leasehold investment property. Certain leases provide for payment of contingent rent, usually a 
proportion of net rental income, in addition to the rents above. 
Finance lease liabilities are effectively secured obligations, as the rights to the leased asset revert to the lessor in the event of default. 
27 OPERATING LEASES 
The Group earns rental income by leasing its investment properties to tenants under operating leases. 
In the United Kingdom standard commercial leases vary considerably between markets and locations but typically are for a term of five to  
15 years at market rent with provisions to review to market rent every five years.  
The future minimum lease amounts receivable under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows:

28 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
The Group is exposed to a variety of risks arising from the Group’s operations: market risk (including interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, 
and market price risk), liquidity risk and credit risk. 
The majority of the Group’s financial risk management is carried out by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board of Directors. 
The policies for managing each of these risks and the principal effects of these policies on the results for the year are summarised below. 
Market risk 
(a) Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk comprises both cash flow and fair value risks. 
Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates. 
Fair value risk is the risk that the fair value of financial instruments will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates. 
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rates that expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, whereas 
borrowings issued at fixed interest rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. 
Bank debt is typically at floating rates linked to LIBOR.  
It is Group policy, and often a requirement of our lenders, to eliminate substantially all short and medium-term exposure to interest rate 
fluctuations in order to establish certainty over medium-term cash flows by using floating to fixed interest rate swaps. Swaps have the 
economic effect of converting borrowings from floating to fixed rates. Interest rate collars protect the Group by capping the maximum 
interest rate paid at the collar’s ceiling but sacrifices the profitability of interest rate falls below a certain floor. Interest rate swaptions  
provide the Group with the right but not the obligation to enter into an interest rate swap on a specific future date at a set rate. 
As a consequence, the Group is exposed to market price risk in respect of the fair value of its fixed rate derivative financial instruments,  
as discussed in the financial review on pages 38 to 43. 
The table below shows the effects of derivative contracts that are linked to the borrowings profile of the Group: 
 
Fixed
2011
£m 
Floating 
2011 
£m  
Fixed
2010

Floating

£m 
Borrowings 8.9 544.4 6.8 657.8
Derivative impact (nominal value of derivative contracts) 515.1 (515.1) 624.7 (624.7)
Borrowings profile net of derivative impact 524.0 29.3 631.5 33.1
Interest rate protection 94.6% 95.0%
Group policy is to ensure that interest rate protection is within the range of 75 per cent to 100 per cent. 
The weighted average rate of interest rate swaps currently effective is 4.5 per cent (2010 – 4.8 per cent). 
The approximate impact of a 50 basis point shift upwards in the level of interest rates would have a positive impact on the movement in fair 
value of derivative financial instruments recognised in the income statement of £10.0 million (2010 – £9.8 million). The approximate impact 
of a 50 basis point shift downwards in the level of interest rates would have a negative impact on the movement in fair value of derivative 
financial instruments recognised in the income statement of £10.0 million (2010 – £9.8 million). In practice, a parallel shift in the yield curve  
is highly unlikely. However, the sensitivity analysis above is a reasonable illustration of the possible effect from the changes in slope and shifts 
in the yield curve that may actually occur and represents management’s assessment of possible changes in interest rates. Because the fixed rate 
derivative financial instruments are matched by short-term floating rate debt, the overall effect on Group cash flow of such a movement 
would be very small. 
(b) Foreign exchange risk 
The Group’s largest exposure to foreign exchange movements is in respect of its investments in the Chinese investment fund which is 
denominated in US dollars. The Group’s policy is generally not to hedge foreign currency exposures that are less than 15 per cent of its net 
assets. Foreign currency exposures in excess of this amount, as far as practicable, will be hedged by borrowing in foreign currencies and 
through entering into cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts. 
The approximate impact of a 10 per cent strengthening of sterling against the US dollar would have decreased the net gain taken directly  
to equity for the year ended 31 December 2011 by £1.8 million (2010 –£6.0 million). The approximate impact of a 10 per cent weakening of 
sterling against the US dollar would have increased the net gain taken directly to equity for the year ended 31 December 2011 by £2.0 million 
(2010 –£6.6 million). This represents management’s assessment of possible changes in exchange rates.  our financial statements

(c) Market price risk 
The financial results are subject to movements in the value of underlying investment properties, interest rates and economic sentiment. 
A one percent increase in the valuation of investment and development property would increase the valuation of investment and development 
property in the income statement by £16.2 million. A one per cent decrease in the valuation of investment and development property would 
decrease the gain on revaluation of investment and development property in the income statement by £16.2 million. For further information 
on covenant positions on investment and development property refer to page 118. 
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is managed to ensure that the Group is able to meet future payment obligations when financial liabilities fall due. Liquidity 
analysis is intended to provide sufficient headroom to meet the Group’s operational requirements and investment commitments. The 
Group’s treasury policy also includes maintaining adequate cash, as well as maintaining adequate committed facilities. 
A key factor in ensuring existing facilities remain available to the Group is the borrowing entities’ ability to meet the relevant facilities’ 
financial covenants. The Group has a process to monitor regularly both current and projected compliance with the financial covenants.  
A detailed analysis of the Group’s financial covenant position is set out on page 118. 
The Group’s policy is to seek to minimise its exposure to liquidity risk by managing its exposure to interest rate risk and to refinancing risk. 
The Group seeks to borrow for as long as possible at the lowest acceptable cost. 
The Group regularly reviews the maturity profile of its financial liabilities and will seek to avoid concentrations of maturities through  
the regular replacement of facilities and by staggering maturity dates. Refinancing risk may be reduced by reborrowing prior to the 
contracted maturity date, effectively switching liquidity risk for market risk. This is subject to credit facilities being available at the time  
of the desired refinancing. 
The tables below set out the maturity analysis of the Group’s financial liabilities based on the undiscounted contractual obligations to make 
payments of interest and to repay principal. Where interest payment obligations are based on a floating rate the rates used are those implied 
by the par yield curve.

Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a tenant or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract. Credit risk arises primarily from 
trade receivables relating to tenants but also from the Group’s undrawn commitments and holdings of assets such as cash deposits and loans 
with financial counterparties.  
Credit risk associated with trade receivables is actively managed; tenants are managed individually by asset managers, who continuously 
monitor and work with tenants, anticipating and wherever possible identifying and addressing risks prior to default. 
Prospective tenants are assessed through an internally conducted review process, including obtaining credit ratings and reviewing financial 
information. As a result deposits or guarantees may be obtained. The amount of deposits held as collateral at 31 December 2011 is £2.0 million 
(2010 – £1.7 million). 
In relation to the Group’s exhibition income, receivables greater than 90 days are fully provided against. Additionally, specific provisions are 
made for trade receivables less than 90 days where active credit control highlights recoverability issues. 
Due to the nature of tenants being managed individually by asset managers, it is the Group’s policy to calculate any impairment specifically 
on each contract. 
The amounts of trade receivables presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables. 
The ageing analysis of these trade receivables, past due but not impaired, is as follows: 
 
Group
2011
£m
Group
2010
£m
Up to three months 15.5 9.8
Over three months – 0.4
Trade receivables 15.5 10.2
Also included within receivables are £3.4 million (2010 – £6.3 million) of loan notes. All loan notes have been reviewed for potential 
impairment and are considered to be receivable as at the year end. 
In 2011 trade receivables impaired amounted to £0.3 million (2010 – £0.4 million), this is considered to be an immaterial amount and within 
budgeted levels given current economic conditions. 
The credit risk relating to cash, deposits and derivative financial instruments is actively managed by Group Treasury. Relationships are 
maintained with a number of Tier 1 institutional counterparties, ensuring compliance with Group policy relating to limits on the credit 
ratings of counterparties (between BBB+ and AAA).  
Excessive credit risk concentration is avoided through adhering to authorised limits for all counterparties.

Classification of financial assets and liabilities  
The tables below set out the Group’s accounting classification of each class of financial assets and liabilities, and their fair values at  
31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010. 
The fair values of quoted borrowings are based on the bid price. The fair values of derivative financial instruments are determined from 
observable market prices or estimated using appropriate yield curves at 31 December each year by discounting the future contractual cash 
flows to the net present values.

Capital structure 
The Group seeks to enhance shareholder value both by investing in the business so as to improve the return on investment and by managing 
the capital structure. The Group uses a mix of equity, debt and financial instruments and aims to access both debt and equity capital markets 
with maximum efficiency and flexibility.  
The key ratios used to monitor the capital structure of the Group are the debt to assets ratio and the interest coverage ratio. The Group aims 
not to exceed an underlying debt to asset ratio of more than 45 per cent and to maintain interest cover above 125 per cent. These are discussed 
in the financial review on pages 38 to 43.

Fair value estimation  
The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value by valuation method. The different levels are defined as follows: 
Level 1: valuation based on quoted market prices traded in active markets. 
Level 2: valuation based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that maximise the use of observable data either directly 
from market prices or indirectly derived from market prices. 
Level 3: where one or more inputs to valuation are not based on observable market data. Valuations at this level are more subjective and 
therefore more closely managed, including sensitivity analysis of inputs to valuation models. Such testing has not indicated that any material 
difference would arise due to a change in input variables.

29 DEFERRED TAX PROVISION 
Under IAS 12 “Income Taxes”, provision is made for the deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the revaluation of investment 
properties at the corporate tax rate expected to apply to the Group at the time of use. For United Kingdom properties the relevant tax rate  
will be 25 per cent (2010 – 27 per cent).  
The movements in the year in deferred tax (both recognised and unrecognised) mainly reflect the tax effect of property revaluation gains 
arising in the year as well as availability of Group losses previously not recognised. The recognised deferred tax liability on investment 
properties calculated under IAS 12 was £14.1 million at 31 December 2011 (2010 – nil). The IAS 12 calculation does not necessarily reflect the 
expected amount of tax that would be payable if the assets were sold. The Group estimates that calculated on a disposal basis, by reference  
to the properties’ original historic tax base costs, the tax liability on a sale at 31 December 2011 would be nil (2010 – £10.4 million). This is due 
to a number of factors including the availability of losses and indexation relief, the Group holding structure for certain properties and the 
application of the REIT provisions to disposals within 2 years of the demerger date (May 2010). 
The tax basis of properties formerly within the REIT regime will be revised in May 2012 (the second anniversary of the demerger) from  
their original historic tax base cost to the value at the time of exit. If this latter tax basis had applied at 31 December 2011, the tax liability  
on a disposal basis would again have been nil.

Deferred consideration is the amount payable on the 2009 acquisition of the non-controlling interests’ share in Earls Court & Olympia.  
The amount of deferred consideration payable is based on a number of factors including a potential redevelopment of the Earls Court & 
Olympia site, with the final details of such a redevelopment dependent on discussions with the owners of the adjacent land and the outcome 
of the planning permission process which is anticipated to conclude in 2012. The maximum potential payment is £20.0 million.

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED

Share Option Scheme 
Market value options to subscribe for ordinary shares may be awarded under the Capital & Counties Properties PLC Performance Share Plan. 
Exercise is subject to appropriately challenging performance conditions determined by the Remuneration Committee at the time of grant. 
For awards made in 2010 and 2011, awards are subject to performance conditions relating to: 
(a) the Company’s total return (“TR”) over three consecutive financial years (the “TR Performance Period”) relative to the median of the TRs 
over the equivalent period of Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC, Land Securities Group PLC, British Land Company plc, Hammerson 
plc, Segro plc, Derwent London plc, Great Portland Estates plc and Shaftesbury plc (the “Comparator Group”); and  
(b) the Company’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) over a period of three years (the “TSR Performance Period”) relative to the median of the 
TSRs over the same period of the Comparator Group. 
One half of each award will be subject to the TR performance condition and the other half to the TSR performance condition.  
TR is the growth in the adjusted, diluted net asset value per ordinary share plus dividends per ordinary share paid during the TR performance 
period. In calculating TR for a company which is not a REIT, any provision for contingent capital gains tax will be added back. For full vesting 
to be achieved, the target is median +2.5 per cent per annum. 
TSR is the increase in the price of an ordinary share plus the value of any dividends paid during the TSR performance period re-invested in 
ordinary shares. For full vesting to be achieved, the target is median +4 per cent per annum. 
For performance at median, 33 per cent of an award will vest. For intermediate performance above median, vesting will be on a straight-line 
basis from 33 per cent to 100 per cent. 
In order for any awards to vest, the Committee must satisfy itself that TR and TSR performance figures are a genuine reflection of underlying 
financial performance. 
Where events occur which cause the Committee to consider that the performance conditions have become inappropriate or impractical,  
the Committee may amend, relax or waive such conditions as it deems appropriate, provided that the conditions after the changes are not 
materially tougher or easier to achieve than was intended at the outset. 
During any performance period, the Committee may, at its discretion, remove from the Comparator Group a company which has ceased to  
be quoted or to exist or the relevance of which as a comparator has, in the opinion of the Committee, significantly diminished. The Committee 
may also, at its discretion, add to the Comparator Group (whether to replace a removed member or otherwise) if it believes that such addition 
will enhance the relevance of the Comparator Group. 
The options have a vesting period of three years and a maximum contractual life of ten years. In general options are forfeited if the employee 
leaves the Group before the options vest. 
A schedule to the PSP was approved by HMRC as a CSOP scheme on 15 March 2011, therefore the company now makes a proportion of awards 
as approved options. 
Share options outstanding at 31 December 2011 were exercisable between 103.87 pence and 176.33 pence and have a weighted average 
remaining contractual life of 9.2 years.  
The total expense recognised in the income statement in respect of share options for the year ended 31 December 2011 was £1.7 million  
(2010 – £0.5 million).

Matching Share Plan 
Under the Capital & Counties Properties PLC Matching Share Plan, deferred shares may be awarded as part of any bonus. Awards may also be 
made as nil cost options.  
The release of deferred share awards is not dependent on the achievement of any further performance conditions other than that participants 
remain employed by the Group for a specified time, typically three years, from the date of the award. Awards of nil cost options were made in 
2011. The fair value of share awards will be determined by the market price of the shares at the grant date. The weighted average share price 
during the year was 172p (2010 – 127.1p).

Under the Matching Share Plan, awards which may be awarded as nil cost options, may also be made in respect of certain shares purchased by 
Directors or in respect of awards of the deferred shares or nil cost options described above made under the Company’s annual bonus scheme. 
The matching share award comprises the same number of shares as are purchased or deferred except in certain circumstances where the 
matching awards may comprise or be increased to 200 per cent of the number of shares purchased or deferred. 
Vesting of matching shares and matching nil cost options is subject to appropriately challenging performance conditions. Vesting  
of matching shares will occur on the later of the third anniversary of grant and the date on which the performance outcome is finally 
determined. The matching nil cost options have a vesting period of three years and a maximum contractual life of ten years. The performance 
conditions that apply to the awards of matching shares made in 2011 are the same as those that apply to the awards of options made under the 
Performance Share Plan during 2010 and 2011. 
Matching shares and matching nil cost options generally lapse if the Director leaves the Company or sells any of the related purchased or 
deferred shares.

The Chairman does not participate in the Partnership Share Plan or Matching Share Plan, however for any shares purchased within 12 months 
of the demerger and with a value of 150 per cent of his base fee, the Company made a 1:1 matching award of deferred shares on a gross of tax 
basis. The Chairman’s matching share award carries no performance conditions and will vest on the third anniversary of the date of demerger 
subject to the Chairman remaining in office for three years and having retained ownership of his invested shares. The Chairman invested 
more than 150 per cent of his base fee in the Company’s shares during 2010, and accordingly an award of 529,536 deferred shares was made to 
him on 1 September 2010. 
39 PENSIONS 
(a) Current pension arrangements 
Earls Court & Olympia group (“EC&O”) has a hybrid pension scheme comprising an ongoing money purchase section and a final salary section 
which closed to new members in 2000, and closed to future benefit accrual on 31 December 2011. The final salary section is a funded defined 
benefit scheme which is contracted out of State Second Pension. 
The Group’s current policy is largely to provide future retirement benefits through defined contribution arrangements.

(2010 – £0.3 million) has been included in administration expenses.

Actual return on Scheme’s assets in the year 1.4 1.3
Mortality assumptions are based on standard tables provided by the Institute of Actuaries using insurance company data updated from time 
to time to reflect current trends. The standard tables used by the Scheme in both the current and comparative periods are the SI PXA (Year of 
Birth), CMI (1.25%). The table makes allowance for future improvements in longevity based on the year of birth of each member. 
 2011  2010
The mortality assumptions used in this valuation were:   
Life expectancy at age 65 (current age 45) –  Male 88.8 88.8
 Female 91.0 91.0
Life expectancy at age 65 (current age 65) – Male 86.9 86.9
 Female 89.0 89.0
To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the Scheme, the company considered the current level of expected 
returns on risk-free investments (primarily government bonds), the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes 
in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. The expected annual return for each asset class 
was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio. 
This resulted in the selection of the 4.7 per cent assumption as at 31 December 2011 (2010 – 5.4 per cent).

THE DEMERGER 
Introduction 
The Capital & Counties Properties PLC Group (“the Group”) 
demerged from its former parent company, Liberty International PLC 
(subsequently renamed Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC), with 
effect from 7 May 2010. Capital & Counties Properties PLC has a 
premium listing on the official list of the UKLA, and a secondary listing 
on the JSE Limited. Shares in Capital & Counties Properties PLC were 
admitted to dealings on the London and Johannesburg Stock Exchanges 
in May 2010.  
2010 historic financial information 
The demerger documents and pro forma information were prepared 
(as is required in such situations ) to illustrate the Group’s financial 
performance and its position as if the demerged Group and capital 
structure had existed at 1 January 2010. On such pro forma basis, taking 
into account a cash transfer from Liberty International of £244 million, 
the Group’s net assets as at 1 January 2010 were £731 million. This 
represented an adjusted pro forma net asset value per share of 127 pence. 
Capital structure 
On demerger the Group’s parent company Capital & Counties 
Properties PLC issued 621.8 million 80 pence ordinary shares to the 
former Liberty International shareholders, on a one-for-one basis,  
who were registered holders of ordinary shares at close on 7 May 2010.  
As consideration, stock transfer certificates pertaining to the Group’s 
now subsidiary undertakings were registered in the name of Capital & 
Counties Properties PLC. Shares issued in consideration for investments 
in subsidiary undertakings represent a share-for-share exchange under 
S612 of the Companies Act 2006. Qualifying for relief under S612 
sheltered the Group from recognising share premium on the difference 
between the nominal value of the shares issued and the fair value of the 
assets received with this premium instead being taken to a Merger 
Reserve. In addition, the Group assumed all intragroup debt owed by its 
now subsidiary undertakings to Liberty International. Shares attributed 
to these assets did not qualify for relief therefore the difference between 
the nominal value of shares issued and the fair value of the assets 
received was credited to the Company’s Share Premium Reserve. 
Upon demerger a number of reserves were realised and pro forma 
adjustments, which had been made for comparability as discussed 
above, were then reversed. 
Finally, on 18 May 2010 a capital reduction became effective.  
The reduction in capital was effected by reducing the nominal value  
of each ordinary share on issue from 80 pence per share to 25 pence per 
share, creating distributable reserves for the Company and reducing  
its capital account by £342 million. 
2010 demerger share values 
Base cost of post-demerger shares for UK capital gains tax 
purposes 
UK tax resident shareholders should read Part (A) of Part VI of the 
Liberty International PLC Circular dated 12 March 2010 (pages 55 to 56 
inclusive) in full. Shareholders who are in any doubt about their tax 
position or how to use the share values in this circular should consult 
their own professional tax advisers. 
Following the demerger, UK shareholders will need to apportion  
the base cost for UK capital gains tax purposes of their pre-demerger 
Liberty International PLC shares between their post-demerger Capital  
& Counties Properties PLC shares and their post-demerger Capital 
Shopping Centres Group PLC shares. The apportionment is made by 
reference to the value of Capital & Counties Properties PLC and Capital 
Shopping Centres Group PLC shares on 10 May 2010 (in accordance  
with the provisions of Section 272 of the Taxation and Chargeable Gains 
Act 1992), and so the base cost will be split Capital & Counties Properties 
PLC 25.7198% and Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC 74.2802%. 
The share prices on the London Stock Exchange on 10 May 2010 being 
the relevant date were: Capital & Counties Properties PLC 119.25 pence; 
and Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC 344.40 pence. 
South African capital gains tax on demerger 
South African tax resident shareholders should read Part (B) of Part VI  
of the Liberty International PLC Circular dated 12 March 2010 (pages 57 
to 58 inclusive) in fu ll. Shareholders who are in any doubt about their 
tax position or how to use the share values in this announcement should 
consult their own professional tax advisers. 
For shareholders who hold their shares on capital account, on 10 May 
2010, there will be a part disposal for South African capital gains tax 
purposes of the South African shareholders’ pre-demerger Liberty 
International PLC shares. 
A South African shareholder’s capital gain or loss on this part disposal  
is calculated as proceeds from the issue of shares by Capital & Counties 
Properties PLC, less a proportion of the capital gains tax base cost of the 
Liberty International PLC ordinary shares held by them. Proceeds for 
the part disposal will be calculated as the opening share price of Capital 
& Counties Properties PLC on 10 May 2010 multiplied by the number  
of shares issued (in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 76A of 
the Eighth Schedule to the Income Tax Act, Act 58 of 1962, as amended). 
The amount of the capital gains tax base cost of the Liberty International 
PLC shares which is apportioned to th e part disposal will be calculated 
by taking account of the opening share price of Capital & Counties 
Properties PLC on 10 May 2010 as a proportion of the value of the closing 
share price of Liberty International PLC shares on 7 May 2010. 
The relevant prices on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange were: Liberty 
International PLC Rand 51.50 on 7 May 2010; and Capital & Counties 
Properties PLC Rand 14.35 on 10 May 2010. 
The information contained above is correct to the best knowledge and belief of 
Capital & Counties Properties PLC but does not constitute tax advice. Capital & 
Counties Properties PLC does not accept any liability which may arise from use  
of the information contained above. Each shareholder is solely responsible for  
the information he or she provides to tax authorities and other official bodies.

Section 34A Housing Act 1985 
An amendment to the 1985 Act to enable tenants to take control  
of the management of their properties. The amendment establishes  
a procedure enabling an organised group of tenants to require a local 
authority to transfer their homes to a housing association or similar 
body registered with the Tenant Services Authority (the social housing 
regulator). Tenants may form such a body and seek the transfer of the 
property to that body. The legislation only applies to social rented 
tenants of local authorities. It does not apply to tenants of housing 
associations even where the ultimate owner may be a local authority. 
Section 34A requires implementation by regulations yet to come  
into effect. These regulations will be enacted by the Department  
of Communities and Local Government. No regulations have yet  
been made. 
Tenant (or lease) incentives 
Any incentives offered to occupiers to enter into a lease. Typically 
incentives are in the form of an initial rent-free period and/or a cash 
contribution to fit-out the premises. Under International Financial 
Reporting Standards the value of incentives granted to tenants is 
amortised through the income statement on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term. 
Total property return

received less associated costs, including ground rent.

Boiler room scams 
In recent years, many companies have become aware that their 
shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence 
concerning investment matters.  
These are typically from overseas based ‘brokers’ who target UK 
shareholders, offering to sell them what often turn out to be worthless 
or high risk shares in US or UK investments. These operations are 
commonly known as ‘boiler rooms’. These ‘brokers’ can be very 
persistent and extremely persuasive, and a 2006 survey by the Financial 
Services Authority (FSA) has reported that the average amount lost by 
investors is around £20,000.  
It is not just the novice investor that has been duped in this way;  
many of the victims had been successfully investing for several years. 
Shareholders are advised to be wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to 
buy shares at a discount or offers of free company reports. If you receive 
any unsolicited investment advice: 
– Make sure you get the correct name of the person and organisation 
– Check that they are properly authorised by the FSA before getting 
involved by visiting www.fsa.gov.uk/register/ 
– Do not provide any personal details to callers e.g. bank details or  
full address. 
– If they are not properly authorised, report the matter to the FSA 
either by calling 0300 500 5000 or visiting 
www.moneymadeclear.fsa.gov.uk 
– If the calls persist, hang up.  
The FSA advise that, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. 
If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you will not be eligible to  
receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.  
The FSA can be contacted by completing an online form at  
www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/doing/regulated/law/alerts/overseas.shtml 
Details of any share dealing facilities that the Company endorses will  
be included in Company mailings.

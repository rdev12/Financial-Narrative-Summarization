BUSINESS REVIEW
All of the Company's distribution channels, both in
the UK and Internationally, showed good year on
year sales growth across both the Hornby and
Scalextric ranges highlighting a well-balanced
business across our two brands. Growth in the
Hornby range has come primarily from the
independent retail sector in the United Kingdom and
a particularly strong performance in Scalextric was
achieved through International sales. It is also
pleasing to report that our in-store concessions
numbered 65 as at 31 March 2003, compared to 28
a year earlier.These outlets now account for an
important part of the Company's sales and profits.
The maintenance of a year round display presence in
these stores also helps to underpin the collectable
hobby nature of both Hornby and Scalextric brands.
The Harry Potter franchise makes a continuing
contribution to Hornby sales.The success we have
enjoyed with licensed merchandise encourages us to
establish other relationships and product licences for
the future. At the 2003 International Toy Fairs, held
in the first quarter of 2003, we launched a new
Micro Scalextric range based on "The Simpsons" TV
characters, which we expect to provide good
prospects for future growth.We have also secured a
licence to produce Scalextric sets and accessories
based on "The Italian Job" film release.This film has
recently been released in the USA and is due for
release in Europe this autumn, which will coincide
with the first deliveries of our Scalextric sets.
Further development of the already successful CD-Rom
based "Hornby Virtual Railway" has continued and an
all-new version will be released during the first half
of this financial year. Innovation in this fast-growing
area for technology-related products and improved
on-screen graphics have enabled us to deliver far
greater functionality and interactivity which bodes
well for further development of the hobby.
In the United States, despite a generally difficult
trading environment, it is pleasing to see Scalextric
USA back in profit. During the year the management
team has been re-structured in order to meet the
demands of this rapidly-expanding business. Our
strategy of producing products with an American
focus, including the Ford Mustang, Chevrolet Camaro
and Ford GT40 models, has improved significantly
It is pleasing, once again, to be able to report 12 months of sustained progress in your
Company. Sales, in generally challenging global trading conditions, have increased 20% to
£34.1million. Profit before tax at £5.4million is 45% above last year's result (£3.7million),
and earnings per share are up by 62% to 53.3p.
In March of this year the Company's progress was recognised at the UK PLC Awards 2002
when it won the "Company of the Year" award.This was a strong endorsement of the
strategies that we continue to implement and was a wonderful boost to morale for
everyone in the business. both our product appeal and sales performance. On
the back of this success we have been able to attract
new retailers to our brands; during the trading year
we have opened 134 active new accounts, taking the
total as at 31 March 2003 to 455.
PROPERTY
As outlined in last year's report we still hope to be in
a position to develop a new UK headquarters for
Hornby, including a "Hornby Heritage Centre" on a
site near our current Margate facility. Our application
to redevelop our existing site was referred to the
Secretary of State last year, and the planning inquiry
took place in January.We hope to learn the final
outcome of this inquiry by the autumn of 2003.
GLOBAL CONTEXT
Since the end of the financial year two major issues
have dominated global confidence; Iraq and the SARS
virus. Uncertainties surrounding the hostilities in Iraq
drew to a speedy conclusion and despite our
outsourced production facilities being located in the
People’s Republic of China, the SARS virus is having no
impact on production levels or our current or
projected trading. Our Chinese production facilities are
both modern and efficient and management there
have taken all reasonable steps to ensure that their
business and staff are protected.
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
The past year has seen further development in the
success and sophistication of our product offerings
across both Hornby and Scalextric ranges.Whilst
continuing to exploit the potential of the adult
collector's market in both sectors, we have continued
to develop new products for the younger age groups
who are likely to be the Hornby and Scalextric
collectors of the future. "Bash ‘n Crash" was the
biggest selling Scalextric set in the United Kingdom in
the run-up to Christmas 2002.This was a most
encouraging performance.
In the future it remains your Company's strategy to
develop further products targeted at both adult and
toy markets across both ranges.We will continue to
ensure that the adult enthusiast's market is satisfied with
high quality, authentic detail products whilst at the same
time developing new entry points to both the Hornby
and Scalextric ranges for the younger age groups.
This balance is fundamental to our business philosophy.
As part of the programme of re-enforcing Scalextric
as the "home motorsport" for enthusiasts, we have
announced recently a strategic relationship with
another household name in motorsport, Goodwood.
Both Hornby and particularly Scalextric products will
feature at this year's Festival of Speed to be held on
11 - 13 July, and later in the year on 5 - 7 September
when Scalextric will again feature prominently at the
Goodwood Revival Motorsport meeting. I am
confident that this will further raise the profile of our
motoring heritage.
OUTLOOK
Finally, I am pleased to be able to report that,
following a most successful performance in the year
to 31 March 2003 our sales growth momentum is
now well established in both the UK and our
international target markets. I am delighted to report
that the new financial year has started well.A strong
pipeline of new product developments should ensure
the continued organic growth of the Company during
the current financial year and beyond.
I should like to thank Frank Martin our chief
executive, our directors and all our staff working on
both Hornby and Scalextric ranges for their dedicated
support and hard work.Without them, none of this
would have been possible.

Chief Executive’s Report
Basic earnings per share rose to 53.32p.This result
includes the release of a prior year tax provision of
£189,000, following the satisfactory conclusion of
negotiations with the Inland Revenue. Basic
underlying earnings per share, after stripping out the
one-off tax provision release, rose by 54% to 50.73p
(2002 - 32.97p).
There was a net cash inflow during the year of £1.4
million. Cash at 31 March 2003 was £7.9 million
compared to £6.5 million for the previous year.The
Company continues to generate a strong cash flow,
whilst servicing a progressive dividend policy, and
maintaining a high level of expenditure on new
product development.
The Company now manufactures all of its products
in China, via third party contract manufacturers.
However some packing operations remain in the UK
where this strategy provides greater flexibility in
meeting market needs. All purchases from our
Chinese suppliers are made either in US or Hong
Kong Dollars. It is the Company’s policy to reduce
currency exposure by using forward foreign
exchange contracts of up to 12 months which will
normally match or exceed purchase order
commitments at any time.
The Company retains intellectual property rights in
its products and controls all sales of its products.
The year to 31 March 2003 marked a further step
towards the Company's goal of creating a
sustainable global hobby business capable of
generating consistently high levels of profit.The
achievement of a 16% return before tax on sales
(2002 - 13%) further demonstrates the benefits to
be derived from focused investment in creating
products with worldwide sales potential.
At Scalextric USA, a significant turnround has been
achieved. Sales in US Dollars grew by 26% to $4.9
million in the year to 31 March 2003. A profit before
tax of $101,000 was recorded, compared to a loss
before tax of $167,000 in the previous year.This
encouraging result confirms our commitment to
building a significant business in the USA.
OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
The Company’s principal business is in the development and supply of Hobby and Toy
products.The Company’s two principal brands, Hornby and Scalextric, are distributed through
a network of specialist and multiple retailers throughout the UK and overseas.
Consolidated turnover for the year to 31 March 2003 was £34.1 million, an increase of 20%
over the previous year's £28.5 million.This follows two successive years of sales growth of
16% and 15% in 2002 and 2001 respectively. Profit before tax of £5.4 million was 45% above
last year's result of £3.7 million. 5
Both of our major brands, Hornby and Scalextric,
once more achieved significant sales growth during
the year. Of the Company's overall sales increase of
£5.6 million, roughly 50% was contributed by each
of the brands.
Within the brands, both Hornby locomotives and
Scalextric cars and accessories showed particularly
strong sales growth.This confirms our strategy of
applying increasing levels of detail and authenticity to
both brands. In doing so we are clearly creating
additional demand in the hobby/collector market.
The sales growth established over the past two
years has largely been achieved within traditional
channels of distribution, both in the UK and in
International markets.The growing opportunity
represented by both our major brands is now being
recognised by further major retailers.This will result
in significantly wider distribution of our products in
the pre-Christmas period 2003, again both in the UK
and overseas.These new stockists will focus primarily
on sales of Hornby and Scalextric sets. Increased
sales of sets at Christmas will in turn lead to
additional sales of cars, locomotives and accessories
as new consumers add to their collections.
As I indicated in my report last year, we recognise
that new product development is the Company's
lifeblood.We have increased our investment in 
this area, both in terms of personnel and also in
obtaining external specialist technology skills.The
fruits of these investments will be revealed during
the course of the new financial year, in the form 
of unique new product launches in both of our
major brands.
Hornby has established a substantial momentum 
in sales and profits growth over the past two 
years.The new financial year has once again 
started strongly and we remain confident about
future prospects.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group’s financial instruments, other than
derivatives, comprise borrowings, some cash and
liquid resources, and various items, such as trade
debtors, trade creditors, etc. that arise directly from
its operations.The Group’s financial liabilities
comprise borrowings, trade creditors, other
creditors and finance leases, the main purpose of
which is to raise finance for the Group’s operations.
The Group also has financial assets comprising cash,
trade and other debtors.
The Group also enters into derivatives transactions
(principally forward foreign currency contracts).
The purpose of such transactions is to manage the
currency risks arising from the Group’s operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period under
review, the Group’s policy that no trading in financial
instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial
instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and
foreign currency risk.The Board reviews and agrees
policies for managing each of these risks and they
are summarised below.These policies, established 
1 April 2000, have been reviewed and remain
unchanged.
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture
of retained profits and bank borrowings.The Group
borrows, principally in sterling, at floating rates of
interest to meet short term funding requirements.
At the year end the Group had no borrowings
other than finance leases.
Liquidity risk
The Group only requires borrowings at certain
times of the year.The short term flexibility required
is achieved by overdraft facilities.
Foreign currency risk
The Group purchases a significant proportion of its
products from the Far East in HK and US dollars.
The Group’s policy is to reduce currency exposure
arising from its purchases and anticipated orders by
using forward foreign exchange contracts of up to
12 months. All sales and other purchases originating
in the UK are denominated in sterling.
The Company has a US subsidiary. At present the
Company does not consider the balance sheet
translation exposure significant enough to warrant
matching the net currency assets with currency
borrowings.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING - SPECIAL
BUSINESS RESOLUTIONS
The notice of Annual General Meeting set out on
pages 46 and 47 includes special resolutions to
renew the directors' authority to allot equity
securities and the Company's authority to purchase
its own shares.
HORNBY PLC | ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003
8 Resolution Number 7 is a special resolution
which would give the Board authority within the
meaning of Section 80 of the Companies Act 1985
to allot equity securities of the Company up to an
aggregate nominal value of £150,000. If approved,
the resolution will entitle the Board to allot equity
securities having an aggregate nominal value of
£18,000 for cash, equivalent to 360,000 ordinary
shares representing 4.9 per cent of the Company’s
issued share capital as at 31 March 2003, as if
Section 89(1) of the Act conferring pre-emption
rights on shareholders did not apply. Allotments for
cash in excess of this figure on a non pre-emptive
basis will require prior shareholder approval except
in the case of a rights issue to existing shareholders.
This Section 80 authority and Section 89
disapplication will last until the end of the next
Annual General Meeting of the Company.
Resolution Number 8 is a special resolution
which would give the Board authority under Section
166 of the Companies Act 1985 to make one or
more market purchases (within the meaning of
Section 163(3) of that Act) of its own shares
representing less than 15 per cent of the issued
ordinary share capital of the Company at the date
of this resolution.The directors will exercise this
power only if they believe that the effect of such
purchases will be to increase earnings per share and
that to do so is in the best interests of the Company
and shareholders generally.The minimum price
which may be paid for an ordinary share is the par
value of such share, from time to time, exclusive of
expenses.The maximum price which may be paid
for an ordinary share shall be an amount equal to 
5 per cent above the average of the middle-market
quotations for an ordinary share as derived from the
London Stock Exchange Daily Official List for the
five dealing days immediately preceding the day on
which the purchase is made, exclusive of expenses.
The authority to make market purchases will also
last until the end of the next Annual General
Meeting of the Company.
PERSONNEL POLICIES
It is the policy of the Group to follow equal
opportunity employment practices and these include
the full consideration of employment prospects for
the disabled.
Applications for employment by disabled persons
are always fully considered, bearing in mind the
aptitudes of the applicant concerned. It is the policy
of the Group that the training, career development
and promotion of disabled persons should, as far as
possible, be identical with that of other employees.
Arrangements are made, wherever possible, for
retraining employees who become disabled, to
enable them to perform work identified as
appropriate to their aptitudes.
The Group places importance on the contributions
to be made by all employees to the progress of the
Group and aims to keep them informed by the use
of formal and informal meetings.
CREDITOR PAYMENT POLICY
Hornby has agreed a variety of payment terms with
its suppliers. It is and will remain the general policy
of the Group and Company that payments to a
supplier are made in accordance with the general
conditions of purchase agreed with that supplier,
providing the supplier complies with all relevant
terms and conditions and also that the invoice is
presented in a timely fashion.
The average creditor payment period for the main
trading subsidiary at 31 March 2003 was 23 days
(2002 - 21 days).The Company itself does not trade
and therefore has no external trade creditors.
AUDITORS
Following the conversion of our auditors
PricewaterhouseCoopers to a Limited Liability
Partnership (LLP) from 1 January 2003, a resolution
to appoint its successor, PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP , as auditors to the Company will be proposed 
at the Annual General Meeting.

9 Corporate Governance
COMPLIANCE WITH THE COMBINED CODE 
The maintenance of effective corporate governance
remains a key priority for the Board and the
statement below describes how the directors have
applied the principles of corporate governance and
complied with Section 1 of the Combined Code
throughout the year subject to the exceptions
mentioned below.
The Board
The Board has ultimate responsibility and
accountability for the Group’s operations.
During the year the Board comprised the 
non-executive Chairman, Chief Executive, Finance
Director and a non-executive director.The Board
believes the current structure is appropriate for the
scale of the business and to enable the Group to be
managed efficiently.
The Board has adopted a formal schedule of
matters specifically reserved to it for decisions
including the determination of strategy, the approval
of business plans, budgets, acquisitions and disposals,
major capital purchases, Board appointments,
accounting policies and treasury arrangements.The
Board also delegates specific responsibilities to
committees as described below.The Board meets
monthly and monitors progress against plan at 
each meeting.
The directors have the authority of the Board to
obtain external legal or other independent
professional advice in the furtherance of their duties
at the Company’s expense. All directors have access
to the advice and services of the Company
Secretary, who is responsible for ensuring Board
procedures are followed and applicable rules and
regulations are complied with.The executive
directors have all received appropriate training for
their appointment to the Board of a listed company.
The non-executive directors bring a broad expertise
to the Board. N A Johnson and N J Cosh are both
experienced company directors. Biographical details
of each director are shown on page 7 .
Independent Non-Executive Directors
The Board considers all of the non-executive
directors who served during the year to be
independent of management and free from any
business or other relationship which could interfere
with the exercise of their independent judgement.
The Board believes that their interest in receiving
fees as directors and as being shareholders should
not prejudice their independence.
N J Cosh has been identified as the senior 
non-executive director through whom concerns 
can be conveyed to the Board.
Availability of Information
Executive management have a responsibility to
provide the Board with sufficient information in a
form and quality appropriate to enable it to
discharge its duties.The Board therefore expects to
receive timely information, circulated in advance, on
all issues scheduled to arise at Board meetings. On 
a regular basis these will include management
accounts indicating the performance of the business
against budget together with financial forecasts that
are updated on a monthly and quarterly basis.
Appointments to the Board
Appointments to the Board require the Board’s
authorisation.The Chief Executive and executive
directors approve a job specification, review
comparative terms of remuneration and may
appoint an external consultant to prepare a short
list of potential candidates.The directors do not
consider a separate Nominations Committee is
required for a Board of this size.
The potential candidates are interviewed by either
the Chairman or the Chief Executive.Their preferred
candidate is subsequently interviewed by the 
non-executive directors. An appointment requires
final approval by the Board prior to an offer being
forwarded.
The Company’s Articles of Association currently
require one third of the directors to retire by rotation.
HORNBY PLC | ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003
10 Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises the 
non-executive directors.The current members of
the committee are N A Johnson (Chairman) and 
N J Cosh.
The composition is in compliance with the
Combined Code provision B.2.2 which states that
the Committee should consist exclusively of 
non-executive directors, and provision B.1.7 which
requires setting notice or contract periods at, or
reducing them to, one year or less.
Details of directors’ contracts are provided in the
Remuneration Report.
The Committee is responsible for establishing formal
and transparent procedures for determining policy
on executive remuneration and advising the Board
on executive remuneration and in particular for
ensuring that executive remuneration packages are
sufficient to attract, retain and motivate executive
directors of the required quality whilst avoiding
paying more than necessary. It also endeavours to
establish performance related elements of
remuneration which align the interests of the
directors with those of the shareholders. No
director is involved in deciding his own
remuneration.
Relations with Shareholders
The Company communicates regularly with its
institutional shareholders and encourages
communication with private investors through the
Annual General Meeting.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises the non-executive
directors. The current members of the Committee
are N J Cosh (Chairman) and N A Johnson.
The Committee has written terms of reference,
which set out clearly its authority and duties.These
include the following:
• review of the interim and full year results and the
Annual Report and Accounts
• review the scope and results of the audit and its
cost effectiveness
• review the independence and objectivity of the
auditors 
• review the appropriateness and effectiveness of
the Group’s internal controls, policies and
procedures
The Committee meets at least twice a year and the
meetings are usually attended by the Chief Executive,
Finance Director and the Group’s auditors.

Corporate Governance

INTERNAL CONTROL
The directors have overall responsibility for the
Group's system of internal control. Although no
system of internal control can provide absolute
assurance against material misstatement or loss, the
system is designed to provide the directors with
reasonable assurance that problems are identified on
a timely basis and are dealt with appropriately.
The key elements of the Group's system of internal
control are as follows:
Control environment
The Board has put in place an organisational
structure with clearly defined and understood lines
of responsibility and delegation of authority. The
Board promotes a strong control environment with
a strong ethical climate.
Identification of business risks
The Board has the primary responsibility for
identifying the major business risks facing the Group
and developing appropriate policies to manage
those risks.The Board has completed a risk
assessment programme in order to identify the
major business risks and has reviewed and
determined the key control objectives.
Major corporate information systems
The Group operates a comprehensive annual
planning and budgeting system in conjunction with a
three year business plan which is regularly updated
to reflect changing circumstances.The annual plans
and budgets are approved by the Board.The Board
reviews the management accounts at its monthly
meetings and financial forecasts are updated monthly
and quarterly. Performance against budget is
monitored and where any significant deviations are
identified appropriate action is taken.
Main control procedures
Management establishes control procedures in
response to each of the key risks identified.
Standard control procedures operate to ensure the
integrity of the Group's financial statements.
Monitoring system used by the Board
The Board as a whole monitors the operation of
the system of internal control through management
reviews and has reviewed the effectiveness of the
system of internal control for the year.The Board
has adopted a schedule of matters which are
required to be brought to it for decision in order to
ensure that it maintains full and effective control
over appropriate strategic, financial, organisational
and compliance issues, including procedures for
seeking and obtaining approval for major
transactions and capital purchases.
Compliance with the provisions of the
Combined Code
The Company has complied throughout the year
with the Code provisions set out in Section 1 of the
Combined Code apart from Section D.3.1, which
requires the Board and the Audit Committee to
comprise at least three non-executive directors.
The Combined Code requires that the directors
review the effectiveness of the Group’s system of
internal control. In September 1999 the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales
(ICAEW) published guidance for directors on the
scope, extent, nature and review of internal control.
The Board confirms that an on-going process for
identifying, evaluating and managing the Group’s
significant risks has operated throughout the year,
and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report.
GOING CONCERN
After making appropriate enquiries, the directors
have a reasonable expectation that the Group and
the Company have adequate resources to continue
in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason they continue to adopt the going
concern basis in preparing the Group's financial
statements.
HORNBY PLC | ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003 13
Company law requires the directors to prepare
financial statements for each financial year that give a
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of
the Group for that year.The directors are required
to prepare the financial statements on the going
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume
that the Company will continue in business.
The directors confirm that suitable accounting
policies have been used and applied consistently.
They also confirm that reasonable and prudent
judgements and estimates have been made in
preparing the financial statements for the year ended
31 March 2003 and that applicable accounting
standards have been followed.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper
accounting records that disclose with reasonable
accuracy at any time the financial position of the
Company and the Group and to enable them to
ensure that the financial statements comply with the
Companies Act 1985.They are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the Company and the
Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other
irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance
and integrity of the Company’s website. Information
published on the internet is accessible in many
countries with different legal requirements.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the
preparation and dissemination of financial statements
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES Remuneration Report
for the Year Ended 31 March 2003
This part of the Remuneration Report is unaudited.
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by the
non-executive Chairman and comprises the 
non-executive directors.The current members of
the Committee are N A Johnson (Chairman) and 
N J Cosh.
REMUNERATION POLICY
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for
devising and implementing a remuneration policy for
executive directors which complies with the
principles set out in Section 1 of the Combined
Code.The Committee’s policy is to ensure that
executive remuneration packages are sufficient to
attract, retain and motivate executive directors of
the required quality whilst avoiding paying more than
is necessary. It also endeavours to establish
performance related elements of remuneration
which align the interest of the directors with those
of the shareholders.
The Committee achieves its objectives through
remuneration packages of executive directors and
senior management that comprise the following:
• Salary and benefits
Salaries are reviewed regularly and these salaries
are changed at the time of the Group’s annual
salary review. Policies concerning other benefits
together with the Group’s company car policy are
reviewed periodically.
• Share options
The Group currently has a part approved and
part unapproved executive share option scheme
and details of options held by directors are set
out on page 17.
The options are 100% exercisable subject to the
achievement of certain performance criteria. In
respect of awards made up to and including
January 1999 the target criteria were based on
earnings per share and thereafter the target
criteria were based on profit before interest and
tax. No award vests unless target criteria have
been met.
• Pensions
The executive directors and senior managers are
members of defined contribution pension
schemes and annual contributions are calculated
by reference to basic salaries with neither annual
bonuses nor awards under the share incentive
schemes taken into account in calculating the
amounts due.
• Performance-related bonus scheme
In addition to salaries executive directors and
senior management participate in a discretionary
performance-related bonus scheme. Performance
targets are designed to both stretch and
encourage individuals whilst aligning their interests 
with that of the Group.The bonuses available are
divided between a capped range of targets
established for Group profit before tax and
personal objectives. Bonuses relating to personal
objectives are only realised if Group profit
exceeds minimum targets.
• Short T erm Incentive Plan
The Company has introduced a Short Term
Incentive Plan (STIP) to reward the performance
of executive directors and senior management. A
participating employee is entitled to a conditional
award of shares (Basic Award) equal in value to
and in substitution for part of their cash bonus
which would otherwise have been payable.
Where a participant so elects the Company will
also provide an equivalent matching award
(Matching Award) of the same number of shares.
Both the Basic and Matching Awards will usually
only be vested in the participant in equal amounts
on the second, third and fourth anniversaries of
the award date subject to the participant
continuing to be employed within the Group.
Shares to satisfy both the Basic and Matching
Awards are purchased in the market by an
employee benefit trust established and funded 
by the Company.

Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of Hornby Plc
We have audited the financial statements which
comprise the consolidated profit and loss account,
the consolidated and Company balance sheets, the
consolidated cash flow statement, the statement of
Group total recognised gains and losses and the
related notes. We have also audited the disclosures
required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the
Companies Act 1985 contained in the directors’
remuneration report (“the auditable part”).
Respective responsibilities of directors 
and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual
report and the financial statements in accordance
with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting
standards are set out in the statement of directors'
responsibilities.The directors are also responsible for
preparing the directors’ remuneration report.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements
and the auditable part of the directors’ remuneration
report in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards
issued by the Auditing Practices Board. This report,
including the opinion, has been prepared for and only
for the Company’s members as a body in accordance
with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and
for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this
opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other
purpose or to any other person to whom this report
is shown or into whose hands it may come save where
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the
financial statements give a true and fair view and
whether the financial statements and the auditable
part of the directors’ remuneration report have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985.We also report to you if, in our opinion,
the directors' report is not consistent with the financial
statements, if the Company has not kept proper
accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit,
or if information specified by law regarding directors'
remuneration and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the
annual report and consider the implications for our
report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the
financial statements.The other information
comprises only the directors' report, the unaudited
part of the directors’ remuneration report, the
chairman's statement, the chief executives’ report
and the corporate governance statement.
We review whether the corporate governance
statement reflects the Company's compliance with the
seven provisions of the Combined Code specified
for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority, and we report if it does not.We
are not required to consider whether the board's
statements on internal control cover all risks and
controls, or to form an opinion on the effectiveness
of the Company's or Group's corporate governance
procedures or its risk and control procedures. HORNBY PLC | ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003

Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing
standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An
audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence
relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements and the auditable part of the directors’
remuneration report. It also includes an assessment of
the significant estimates and judgements made by the
directors in the preparation of the financial statements,
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate
to the Company's circumstances, consistently applied
and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to
obtain all the information and explanations which we
considered necessary in order to provide us with
sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that
the financial statements and the auditable part of the
directors’ remuneration report are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation
of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of
the state of affairs of the Company and the
Group at 31 March 2003 and of the profit and
cash flows of the Group for the year then ended;
• the financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act
1985; and
• those parts of the directors’ remuneration report 
required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the
Companies Act 1985 have been properly prepared
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Notes to the Financial Statements
1   ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable Accounting Standards in the 
United Kingdom. A summary of the more important accounting policies, which have been applied consistently, is 
set out below.
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation
of certain fixed assets.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries made
up to 31 March 2003. The results of subsidiaries acquired are included in the consolidated profit and loss account
from the date control passes. Intra group sales and profits are eliminated on consolidation. Any goodwill arising on
consolidation (representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the
separable net assets acquired) is capitalised and amortised over its expected useful economic life.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption provided by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 not to
present its own profit and loss account.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Expenditure on research and development is written off as incurred.
TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS
Land and buildings are shown at cost or valuation less accumulated depreciation. Assets revalued prior to the issue
of FRS15 are retained at their book amounts as though they were the historical cost amounts. Other fixed assets
are shown at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation, less any estimated residual value, of
each asset on a straight-line basis (with the exception of tools and moulds) over its expected useful life, as follows:
Freehold buildings - 30 to 50 years
Plant and equipment - 5 to 10 years
Motor vehicles - 4 years
Residual value is calculated on prices prevailing at the date of acquisition or revaluation where this has taken place.
Tools and moulds are depreciated at varying rates in line with the related estimated product sales on an 
item-by-item basis up to a maximum of 4 years.
FIXED ASSET INVESTMENTS
In the Company’s financial statements investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated using the equity method of
valuation. Accordingly, subsequent increases and reductions in the value of these investments are set against other
reserves in the financial statements of the Company.The directors consider that this policy more fairly represents
the Company’s investments than carrying them at cost. HORNBY PLC | ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003
29
STOCKS
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition is based on:
Raw materials and consumables - actual purchase cost on a first in first out basis including freight and duty
where applicable.
Work in progress and finished goods - cost of actual direct materials and labour plus a proportion of manufacturing
overheads based on the normal level of activity.
Net realisable value is based on anticipated selling price less further costs expected to be incurred to completion
and disposal. Provisions are made against those stocks considered to be obsolete or excess to requirements on 
an item-by-item basis.
There are no significant differences between balance sheet and replacement cost values. For these purposes
replacement cost is based upon latest invoice prices before the balance sheet date.
REVALUATION RESERVE
The surplus arising on the revaluation of freehold land and buildings is credited to the revaluation reserve, which is
not distributable. Where depreciation charges are increased following a revaluation, an amount equal to such
increase is transferred annually from this reserve to the profit and loss account.
TAXATION
Corporation tax, where payable, is provided on taxable profits at the current rate.
The taxation liabilities of certain group undertakings are reduced wholly or in part by the surrender of losses by
fellow group undertakings.The tax benefits arising from group relief are recognised in the financial statements of
the surrendering and recipient undertakings.
Full provision is made for the tax liability on all timing differences in accordance with FRS19. Deferred tax balances
have not been subject to discounting.
PROVISIONS
The Group provides for liabilities when it has a legal or constructive obligation due to a past event.
PENSION COSTS
During the year the Group operated a defined contribution money purchase pension scheme under which it pays
contributions based upon a percentage of the members’ basic salary. The scheme is administered by trustees 
either appointed by the Company or elected by the members (to constitute one third minimum).
The amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of the scheme is the contribution payable in the year.
Further information on pensions costs is provided in note 22.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge significant commitments or anticipated transactions.
Gains and losses arising from these contracts are recognised when the hedged transaction occurs. HORNBY PLC | ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003
30
Notes to the Financial Statements
continued
FOREIGN CURRENCY
Transactions and investments denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in sterling at the exchange rates
ruling at the date of the transaction. The assets, liabilities and results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into sterling
at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies at the year end are reported at the rate of exchange prevailing at that date. Any gain or loss arising from
a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is reported in the profit and loss account as
an exchange gain or loss, with the exception of gains and losses on the retranslation of opening net foreign currency
investments in subsidiaries which are taken to reserves and recognised in the statement of total recognised gains
and losses.
TURNOVER
Group turnover is recorded at the date of despatch and comprises the invoiced value of sales (excluding VAT, sales
between group companies and trade discounts) of goods and services in the normal course of business and
royalties receivable.
LEASES
The Group enters into operating and finance leases.
Assets held under finance leases are initially reported at the fair value of the asset with an equivalent liability
categorised as appropriate under creditors due within or after one year. The assets are depreciated over the 
shorter of the lease term and their useful economic lives. Finance charges are allocated to accounting periods over
the period of the lease to produce a constant rate of return on the outstanding balance. Rentals are apportioned
between finance charges and the reduction of the liability, and allocated to net interest.
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

The directors consider there to be one class of business, being the development, manufacture and distribution of
model products.

The net deficit carried forward on the Company's profit and loss account arises as a result of a provision for the
diminution in the value of the investment in Hornby Industries Limited. Relying on Section 275(1) of the Companies
Act 1985, the provision for diminution in value of the investment in Hornby Industries Limited is not treated 
for distribution purposes as a realised loss. In the directors' opinion therefore, at the end of the year £229,000 
(2002 - £274,000) may be considered to be distributable. HORNBY PLC | ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003

Sterling and cash deposits are placed in a liquidity fund with daily access. Currency cash deposits are placed on
the money market at floating bank deposit interest rates for periods of up to three months. Normally Hong
Kong and US dollars are placed on short term fixed rate deposits usually less than one month. Floating rate
financial assets attract interest at rates based on relevant national LIBOR equivalents.
(b) Financial liabilities
The Group had at 31 March 2003 fixed rate sterling finance leases, the maturity profile of which is set out in
note 15 to the financial statements.
(c) Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities

as follows:
Monetary liabilities

2003 2002

When utilised, the Group’s overdraft facilities attract interest at 1.125% above Barclays Bank base rate.
(f) Gains and losses on hedges
The Group enters into forward foreign currency contracts to eliminate the currency exposures that arise on
purchases denominated in foreign currencies immediately these purchases have been transacted. Changes in the
fair values of instruments used as hedges are not recognised in the financial statements  until the hedge position
matures. An analysis of these unrecognised gains and losses is as follows:

On 1 January 1992 the Group's defined benefit pension scheme was converted to a Group defined contribution
contracted-out money purchase scheme.With effect from 5 April 2003 the scheme ceased to be contracted-out.
The scheme is open to all permanent salaried employees aged twenty years or over employed by UK companies.
The assets of the previous final salary scheme were converted into cash and the total proceeds were allocated to
individual members by the scheme's actuaries on the basis of the value of the members' accrued benefits under the
previous scheme. The amounts allocated to the individual members were invested in either a managed fund
investment, an insured with profits insurance contract or in a building society deposit account, according to the
wishes of individual members.The level of contributions to the money purchase scheme for current members is
fixed by the Company.
The pension cost for the year was £196,000 (2002 - £173,000) representing the actual contributions payable in the
year and certain scheme administration costs.

the exemption available to parent companies under Financial Reporting Standard number 8 (“Related Party

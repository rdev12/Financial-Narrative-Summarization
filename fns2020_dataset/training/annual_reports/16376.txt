Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008 3  Chairman’s statement
Report of the Directors
2008 was a difficult and turbulent year generally for business  
all around the world. It was dominated by a banking crisis which 
started in the US sub-prime property market and which quickly 
spread to other asset classes and countries. These problems were 
exacerbated by the volatile price of mineral oil and, for companies 
like Unilever, record rises in the cost of vegetable oils like palm, 
soy and rapeseed.
Despite these unprecedented circumstances I am pleased to report 
that Unilever performed well in 2008 and emerged as a stronger, 
more competitive company. It delivered good results on both top 
and bottom line and its strong cash flows allowed it to produce 
substantial returns to shareholders in the form of both share 
buy-backs and dividends.
Part of this was due to the inherent strength and stability of the 
company. Partly it was the result of a robust strategy, effectively 
implemented. But partly, too, it was due to the leadership of 
Patrick Cescau who retired from the business on 31 December 
(see panel opposite).
As a Board team, one of our most important tasks in 2008 was to 
manage Patrick’s succession once he had signalled his intention 
to retire. The process, initiated and led by our Nomination 
Committee, was wide-ranging and thorough. It was as a result  
of this search that we were lucky enough to find Paul Polman.
We are delighted that Paul accepted our offer to become  
C h i e f 	 E x e c u t i v e 	 O f fi c e r . 	 H e 	 h a s 	 i m m e n s e 	 e x p e r i e n c e 	 o f 	 t h e 	 m a r k e t s	
in which we operate, having spent 26 years in our industry. Paul 
brings with him a deep understanding of brands, consumers and 
c u s t o m e r s . 	 H e 	 a l s o 	 h a s 	 a n 	 e n t h u s i a s m 	 f o r 	 c o n s u m e r 	 g o o d s 	 w h i c h	
is palpable and will bring new energy and ideas to Unilever.
Th e 	 o t h e r 	 c h a n g e 	 i n 	 p e r s o n n e l 	 s i n c e 	 o u r 	 2 0 0 8 	 A G M s 	 h a s 	 b e e n	
the transition of Geneviève Berger from Non-Executive Director  
to Chief R&D Officer on the Executive team. In this capacity  
she will be able to bring her great knowledge of science and 
technology to the service of the business. In an industry where 
innovation is such a critical success factor I believe that this is an 
important and far-sighted appointment.

of 12 members of whom two are Executives.

During that time he has served as our Vice Chairman, Senior 
Independent Director and Chairman of our Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees. On behalf of our Boards, I take this 
opportunity to thank him for his contribution, wise counsel and 
service since 2000. It is intended that David will be succeeded  
in those roles by Jeroen van der Veer, with effect from the  
2 0 0 9 	 A G M s.	
Our strategy, in an unpredictable 
economic environment, is to 
maintain our growth momentum 
and deliver competitive levels  
of profitability. Patrick Cescau
On behalf of the Directors and everyone 
at Unilever, I want to express our 
appreciation to Patrick Cescau for  
his services to Unilever over the last  
35 years. By any standards, Patrick’s 
career has been a remarkable one, 
culminating with his appointment  
in 2005 as Unilever’s first ever Chief 
Executive Officer.
Since that time he has helped to 
transform the company. Significant 
organisational change – particularly 
the implementation of ‘One Unilever’ 
– has been accompanied by a 
consistent improvement in business 
results and overall performance. 
Patrick leaves the business stronger 
than he found it, well placed to meet 
the challenges that lie ahead.
Throughout his time in the business, 
Patrick also came to embody the 
qualities and values that help to make 
Unilever a special business: respect, 
humanity, integrity. It is for these 
reasons that he is liked and respected 
in equal measure, both inside the 
company and outside.
We all wish Patrick a long and  
happy retirement.
As part of the time that the Boards spent with the business 
during the year, we visited our laboratories in Bangalore and 
our customer innovation centre in New Jersey. The Boards 
reviewed the strategy at a two-day meeting in October. 
One of the striking things to emerge from our strategy session 
was the consistency of Unilever’s approach. While the strategy 
has evolved to take account of the changing external environment, 
its essential elements remain unchanged. The Group is still 
committed to growing competitively and will do so by developing 
its core assets of brands, technology, geographic spread and 
marketing excellence. Just as importantly its principles remain 
unchanged. The Group will deliver its results in a sustainable 
fashion – seeking to manage its social and environmental 
impacts in a manner which meets the needs of all its stakeholders. 
We are proposing to change to a simpler and more transparent 
dividend practice for the Unilever group from 2010 onwards. 
These changes will result in more frequent dividend payments 
through the payment of quarterly dividends to shareholders. 
They will also better align dividend payouts with the cash flow 
generation of the business. Further details are included in the 
2 0 09 	 A GM 	 N o t i c es.
Looking forward, I remain confident. Unilever entered 2009  
with a realistic assessment of the challenges which it would 
have to face. Its plans were built on the assumption of a deep 
and prolonged global economic downturn. We are determined  
to emerge from this in good shape.
Finally, on behalf of the Boards, I would like to extend my 
sincere thanks to all of Unilever’s 174 000 employees. They  
have had to cope with, and manage, a huge amount of change. 
They have done this in an exemplary and responsible fashion.

Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008 5  Report of the Directors
Chief Executive Officer’s review
Taking this role is an honour and privilege, but equally a huge 
responsibility. These are tough times; and tough times demand 
the very best of all of us. That is the spirit in which I intend to 
take the business forward.
Despite the fact that I have joined the Group at a time of 
unprecedented economic turmoil, my first message to you is a 
positive and reassuring one: your company is in good shape. The 
scale and the extent of the changes over the last four years have 
been a positive surprise to me. They have made Unilever stronger 
and more confident, well placed to weather the storms currently 
blowing through all sectors of the economy.
I want first, therefore, to acknowledge the hard work and 
dedication of Unilever employees all around the world. Thanks 
to their efforts, Unilever is a leaner, more focused business with  
a strong portfolio of leading brands. All this is vital given the 
intense nature of the competitive and economic environment.
The transformation was led with a mixture of skill and 
determination by my predecessor, Patrick Cescau, and I want to  
take this opportunity to recognise Patrick’s accomplishments as 
C h i e f 	 E x e c u t i v e . 	 He 	 l e a v e s 	 a 	 r e m a r k a b l e 	 l e g a c y : 	 a 	 w i d e - r a n g i n g	
change programme combined with steadily improving results.  
In short, the engine was replaced while the car kept running. 
Quite an achievement and I am grateful to Patrick for what he 
hands over.
Last year saw an acceleration of Unilever’s transformation agenda.

across all regions. During the last year we closed or sold a 
further 14 sites, bringing the total to 30 over the last two 
years. We are now on course to exceed our target – set in 
2007 – of closing or streamlining 50 to 60 sites by 2010. All 
these projects are being handled with great sensitivity to the 
workforce. Together they are helping to provide Unilever with 
a modern, cost competitive supply chain, capable of meeting 
the demands of competing in the 21
st
 century. To further aid 
speed and efficiency, we have brought all our logistical and 
supply chain operations in Europe together in one regional 
structure based in Switzerland. And we are currently embarked 
on a similar move in Asia by centralising our supply chain 
management for the region in Singapore.

This included the sale of the North American laundry business. 
We also divested some smaller, non-strategic parts of our 
portfolio, including Boursin cheese, Lawry’s seasonings and 
the Bertolli olive oil businesses. These deals were all done at 
good prices, achieving significant value for the company. At 
the same time, the acquisition in 2008 of the leading Russian 
ice cream maker, Inmarko, filled an important gap in a critical 
market for us. And we are in the process of obtaining a vital 
entry into the fast-growing salon sector of the hair care market 
with our planned acquisition of the TIGI hair product business. 
We are also alive to similar value-creating opportunities that 
may present themselves during the year.
It is a great pleasure to report  
to you for the first time as 
Unilever’s Chief Executive  
Officer. I am delighted to be  
a part of the team and to have 
the opportunity of leading  
this great company. 
Paul Polman
Chief Executive Officer Underpinning these strengths, Unilever exhibits a set of deeply 
ingrained values – based on trust and integrity – which date 
back to the days of its founders and which are so well captured 
in the concept of ‘doing well by doing good’. These values will 
never be compromised, no matter how difficult the economic 
conditions become, and nor will the Group’s commitment to 
help tackle deep-seated global issues in such areas as nutrition 
and hygiene. In pursuit of these objectives we continue to work 
closely alongside agencies like the World Food Programme (WFP) 
and UNICEF. In 2008, our partnership with the WFP extended 
its scope to six countries and delivered 16 million meals to  
76 000 schoolchildren. 
Given the increasing problems of resource scarcity around  
the world, it is also vital that we take a lead on the issue of 
sustainable consumption. That is why we have made a clear 
commitment to move to sustainable palm oil sourcing by 2015 
and are working with Greenpeace and others to achieve this 
challenging objective.
It was heartening to see the Group’s commitment to these 
issues publicly recognised and rewarded in 2008. For the tenth 
year running Unilever was named foods sector leader in the 
Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes – the only company ever to 
achieve such an accolade. And the award of Platinum standard 
in the UK’s Business in the Community Corporate Responsibility 
Index was further recognition of the Group’s willingness to act 
as an agent for social and environmental improvement.
All these attributes, I believe, will not only help to sustain  
the Group during a period of economic difficulty, but are also  
the pillars of long-term competitive advantage and a high 
performing business.
H o w e v e r , 	 t h e r e 	 i s 	 n o 	 c a u se 	 f o r 	 c o m p l a c e n c y . 	 W e 	 m u s t 	 n o t	
underestimate the challenges ahead. If we are to prosper, we 
will need to continue the programme of organisational change, 
further increasing our ability to move quickly and decisively in 
response to shifting market dynamics. But internal change must 
be accompanied by greater external focus: we have to put the 
consumer and the customer at the heart of everything we do. 
This external focus, coupled with speed and discipline, will be 
the key to success.
These will be our guiding principles as we manage the business 
through a period of continuing turbulence and prepare for the 
future. We are also taking a number of additional steps:
• 	 	 W e 	 a r e 	 d r i v i n g 	 b r a n d 	 i n n o v a t i o n , 	 t h e 	 l i f e b l o o d 	 o f 	 o u r 	 b u s i n e s s ,	
to a new level. The move to a ‘One Unilever’ R&D structure 
under the Group’s Chief R&D Officer, Professor Geneviève Berger, 
will help us to win in the marketplace by focusing on fewer, 
bigger innovations – and rolling them out more swiftly around 
the world.

Through the appointment of a Global Supply Chain Officer, we 
are looking for even better ways to leverage our scale in global 
buying and thereby reduce the overall cost of raw materials.

greater than the previous year. To drive the process even 
further we have appointed our first Chief Procurement 
Officer. We expect a continued strong programme in  
2009 and beyond.

units are integrated into a single operating structure – became  
a reality across most of the Group’s key markets, bringing 
greater speed and simplicity to all our operations.
These changes contributed to a good set of business results  
in 2008. We achieved strong underlying sales growth of 7.4%, 
broadly based across all our major product categories. Growth 
was driven by increased pricing as the Group moved quickly and 
decisively to offset the unprecedented rise in commodity costs.

By any standards, this represents solid progress and a good

long-term earnings capacity. So we need to do better.

has been made but again there is still work to do. In order to 
invest behind our brands and win the battles for the hearts and 
minds of an increasingly value conscious consumer, we must 
eliminate all the costs that consumers are unwilling to pay for. 
Growing our volume base, while keeping closely focused on 
protecting our margins and cash flow, will be our priority in 2009. 
The economic environment is unprecedented and will require 
flexibility and fast action. But Unilever has long experience of 
operating in difficult markets and at times of great economic 
stress. It should be remembered that the Group was born in the 
era of the Great Depression of the 1930s. On each occasion 
since, it has learnt from the experience and emerged stronger 
and more resilient as a business. There are good reasons to  
believe we can do so again.
For one thing, we possess a highly relevant and inspiring mission. 
Vitality – with its emphasis on helping people to feel good, look 
good and get more out of life – resonates with the hopes and 
aspirations of consumers the world over. Vitality is even more valid 
today as consumers face increasingly tough economic challenges. 
That is why we have made it the theme of this year’s report and 
why we want to extend the concept of vitality right the way 
through our products, our organisation and our engagement 
with societies at large.
We have an excellent, balanced portfolio of strong brands

more and we are not overly exposed to the premium sector at  
a time when this segment of the market is under increasing 
pressure. We have strong, well-established businesses in many  
of the world’s fastest growing markets and our global presence  
is building all the time. Add to this the Group’s simplified 
organisation and a sound and healthy financial structure and 
you can see why, we believe, Unilever is so well placed to win.
Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008 7  Report of the Directors
Chief Executive Officer’s review continued
To re-ignite volume growth, we also need to concentrate on 
improving our capabilities in the marketplace – from leveraging 
the global scale of our supply chain to sharpening the focus  
we give to our more successful and fastest growing customers. 
And finally, we will continue to develop the organisation itself, 
building a strong performance culture around the principles  
of clear accountability, a bias for action, speed of delivery and 
external focus.
2009 will be a challenging year. The depth and uncertainty of 
the current recession means that we must be able to respond 
quickly to rapidly changing market conditions. I am confident 
that we have the tools and the organisation to do that. If we 
can, then we will emerge from the current difficulties stronger 
than ever, just as we have done many times before.

8 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Vitality through R&D
The year saw two important milestones. Firstly, Geneviève 
Berger was appointed Unilever’s first Chief R&D Officer. 
Secondly, our 6 000 plus R&D professionals came together  
in one unified organisation.
With an integrated global research, product development and 
implementation programme, the new R&D structure aims to  
give us competitive advantage in the market through greater 
efficiency and focus. This R&D organisation is designed to 
accelerate the delivery of ground-breaking advances, increase  
the focus on big innovations and optimise the balance between 
short- and long-term projects.
Unique products with proven benefits
Our R&D teams focus on creating distinctive new products with 
proven benefits that meet consumer needs and help add Vitality 
to Life.
Knorr Stockpot bouillon uses patented jelly technology. It looks 
natural, smells delicious, melts naturally into dishes and has a rich, 
authentic taste. Containing no preservatives or colourings, it was 
first launched in China and has recently been launched in Europe. 
Our anti-dandruff shampoo Clear delivered steady market  
share gains compared to the previous year in markets from  
Brazil to the Philippines. Thanks to our superior technology, 
Clear’s ability to destroy dandruff-causing microbes makes  
the scalp healthier and prevents dandruff from returning  
if the shampoo is used frequently.
And we put our nutritious Blue Band margarine within reach  
of low-income consumers in Africa by developing an affordable 
single-serve sachet that keeps the product fresh even at high 
ambient temperatures. 
Innovation also makes a vital contribution to our sustainability 
agenda. For example, in 2008 we made important strides in 
establishing verifiable environmental metrics and reducing the 
weight of our packaging, helping to decrease the overall impact  
of our portfolio.
Unilever is a global leader in research and development, believing 
that powerful vitality-based innovations are crucial to delivering 
sustainable growth.

White teeth, White Now
Our scientists share best practice and 
knowledge across product categories. 
The ground-breaking White Now 
toothpaste, launched under the Signal 
brand in seven European countries,  
is the first whitening toothpaste with 
an instant effect. 
It transfers optical-effect technology 
developed by our laundry team to  
the field of oral care, using a blue 
pigment to make yellow teeth 
appear whiter. Signal White Now 
exceeded its sales targets and  
will be rolled out in a number  
of additional countries in 2009.

Every Child has the Right 
Unilever’s laundry brands are making a 
positive social impact while continuing 
to grow sales. Dirt is Good, the 
unifying campaign for leading brands 
such as Omo and Persil, promotes 
getting dirty as a natural and positive 
part of growing up – essential to  
a child’s learning experience. Under  
the Omo brand, the campaign was 
taken in a fresh direction when it 
commissioned a unique study into 
child development. 1 500 mothers 
shared their hopes and concerns for 
their children, with 63% revealing 
they feared their youngsters were 
being deprived of their childhood. 
This insight inspired the Every Child 
has the Right campaign, focusing  
on giving children the freedom to 
experience, learn and develop. It has 
been launched in Latin America, 
Europe and Asia.

goal the brand aims to achieve by 2015. In 2008, eight independent 
tea estates in South India became the latest of Unilever’s suppliers 
to achieve Rainforest Alliance Certified™ status by reducing waste 
and pesticide use, conserving soil quality, protecting wildlife, and 
paying employees a fair wage. The benefits are being felt by 
thousands of employees and their families, to whom the estates 
provide free healthcare, housing, childcare and education.
And our Blue Band/Rama brand continued to raise funds as part 
of our three-year partnership with the World Food Programme 
(WFP). This partnership helped the WFP school feeding scheme 
provide 76 000 children in Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines, 
Colombia, Kenya and Ghana with a nutritious daily school meal 
throughout the year. 
Less environmental impact
We aim to grow our business in a sustainable and environmentally 
responsible way through focusing on cutting water consumption 
and waste, reducing our carbon footprint and obtaining more 
raw materials from sustainable sources.

friendly 50ml roll-on deodorants available. This was due to new 
manufacturing and packaging processes that underscore how 
our R&D expertise in responsible packaging can lead to both 
environmental and business benefits (see page 17).
Our Vitality mission reaches across our whole organisation and 
provides the basis for our category, regional and functional 
strategies. Central to the way we manage our brand portfolio  
is identifying how each brand can best bring Vitality to Life.
 
We do this through focusing on three areas: personal vitality,  
social value and environmental impact.
More personal vitality
Our nutrition, hygiene and wellness brands deliver personal 
benefits, both functional and emotional, to the millions of 
consumers who choose them.
For example, the new Flora/Becel pro.activ Blood Pressure range 
enriched with potassium offers a simple way to help manage 
blood pressure. Potassium helps maintain a healthy blood 
pressure eliminating excess sodium in the body. A healthy blood 
pressure is important for maintaining a healthy heart.

mayonnaise, which is rapidly becoming a consumer favourite 
around the world. In 2008, the brand launched its new Light 
and Extra Light formulations which incorporate Unilever’s 
patented citrus fibre technology. This technology gives

taste almost indistinguishable from the full fat variant, but with 
60% to 90% less oil. 
One of our key challenges is to ensure we make a positive impact 
on the world while continuing to grow sales. Our oral care team 
launched the next phase of Unilever’s Night Brushing Campaign. 
This aims to reinforce the day and night brushing habit among 
four- to eight-year-old children and their parents. Brushing teeth 
twice daily leads to dramatic oral health improvements as well 
as increased toothpaste consumption.
More social value
We believe our brands can be a powerful means of improving the 
lives of large numbers of people, by championing social causes or 
prompting widespread changes in behaviour and attitudes.
For example, by the end of 2008, the Dove Self-Esteem Fund 
campaign had reached over 3.5 million young women around the 
globe, helping to improve their self-confidence by challenging 
conventional definitions of beauty. Such activities help build  
a strong connection with our consumers while underpinning  
the brand’s successful advertising campaigns.
Vitality is at the heart of everything we do. It defines the many  
ways our brands help people get more out of life and is core  
to our growth agenda.

Closer collaboration with suppliers
Unilever’s vitality commitment requires us constantly to make 
our food products healthier – for example by reducing salt, 
sugar and fat – without compromising on taste. 
To speed up and improve flavour development for our food 
innovations, we created the Flavour Operating Framework (FLOF). 
This initiative provides a globally consistent way for our supply 
chain and R&D specialists to collaborate with three external 
s u p p l i e r s 	 – 	 ‘ F l a v o u r 	 H o u s e s ’ 	 – 	 w h i c h 	 c om p e t e 	 t o 	 d e l i v e r 	 n e w	
ingredients and technologies.
FLOF has already supplied us with a number of solutions, for 
example to maintain the taste of Lipton ready-to-drink tea while 
reducing sugar content, and helping Knorr products keep 
flavours the same while cutting salt levels.
Winning with customers
We are always looking for new ways to work with customers  
to bring Vitality to Life in their stores. We do this through 
activities that help consumers better understand our brands’ 
health, environmental and ethical benefits.

results of which will contribute to a sustainability scorecard

competitive marketplace.

Continued focus on gender 
Our Global Diversity Board, led by the Chief Executive Officer, 
made steady progress in driving the diversity agenda throughout 
the business. Key milestones have been reached with critical 
appointments in senior roles including Geneviève Berger becoming 
Chief R&D Officer and joining the Unilever Executive (UEx) in  
July 2008. Enabling mechanisms include an expanded mentoring 
programme, new ways of working that promote life balance and 
fostering grassroots involvement through the Unilever Women’s 
International Network (U WIN). Initiatives such as the ‘One

opportunity to increase diversity in gender and/or nationality  
in every appointment they make.
Talent powerhouse in Argentina 
Unilever Argentina cemented its reputation as employer of choice 
with a hat-trick of industry awards. For the fourth consecutive  
year, it was voted Best Employer by leading business magazine 
Apertura, which also ranked it first as the ‘company of dreams’ 
for students. The business also received the Carlos Pellegrini 
Award for best employer, presented by the National Industrial 
Association and the Argentine government. Unilever Argentina’s 
reputation is largely thanks to a strategy which includes building 
long-term relationships with universities to share information 
about promising candidates and developing innovative 
recruitment processes to differentiate it from other trainee 
programmes. This strong position has helped Argentina become 
an important talent source for Unilever globally; currently over 80 
employees from Argentina are on assignment overseas and 
many others occupy regional or global roles.
Unilever is shaped and led by its people who operate within a 
framework of shared values and business goals. To attract and 
retain the best people, we aim to create an environment in 
which all employees can fulfil their potential. 
Personal vitality is integral to our vitality agenda. It is brought to 
life through many wide-ranging initiatives that promote the 
wellbeing of our employees.
Putting safety first
We regard safety as an essential element of a successful and 
sustainable business and are committed to providing a safe 
workplace. We aim to improve continuously the health,  
safety and wellbeing of everyone working for or on behalf of 
Unilever. A key measure of our progress in this area is our total 
recordable accident frequency rate, which counts all workplace 
accidents except those requiring only simple first aid treatment. 
In 2008 the rate was 0.21 accidents per 100 000 hours worked,  
a decrease of 19% since 2007* .

Report of the Directors
Nutrition – helping make the healthy choice
Increasingly it is recognised that diet along with regular physical 
activity plays a major role in maintaining good health. 
By developing brands that help consumers to enjoy a healthy  
diet we can sustain our business growth and help address the 
challenge of obesity and diet-related diseases. Our marketing  
can also encourage consumers to adopt healthier lifestyles. 
We are improving the nutritional quality of our existing  
product portfolio. 
In 2005 we began to assess our entire brand portfolio via our 
Nutrition Enhancement Programme. By the end of 2008 this 
showed that 43% of our products are in line with internationally 
accepted guidelines for saturated and trans fat, sugar and salt.  
We continue to keep more than 22 000 products under  
regular review.
Innovation is bringing new products that offer specific health and 
nutritional benefits. 
In our R&D pipeline, around three quarters of food products  
have what we call ‘vitality’ benefits – specific nutritional or

recommended daily intake of calcium, and Flora/Becel pro.activ 
Blood Pressure spreads and fruity shots developed to help 
manage blood pressure.
To increase consumer choice, we provide variants of many 
brands, with full and low fat, sweetened and unsweetened 
options, and different portion sizes. 
Through on-pack labelling, we help consumers to make the right 
choices. We provide consumers with essential information, 
showing levels of key nutrients and guideline daily amounts. In 
addition, the Choices stamp helps consumers identify healthier

In countries where there is malnutrition, Unilever brands can 
make an important contribution to people’s diets. Our Blue Band/
Rama spreads are a good source of vitamins A, D and E.  
Amaze snacks have been developed to contain a third of the  
key nutrients children need daily for their mental development. 
Annapurna iodised salt helps prevent diseases caused by  
iodine deficiency. 
Improving nutrition and hygiene lies  
at the heart of our vitality agenda. 
Spreading the word 
We believe Unilever can play an 
important role in promoting healthy 
food choices. For example, eating 
margarine and mayonnaise is a 
simple, tasty way to consume 
essential fats and fat-soluble vitamins 
– yet many consumers see these 
products as unhealthy. During the 
year, we continued to roll out our 
G o o d n e s s 	 o f 	 M a r g a r i n e 	 c a m p a i g n 	 t o	
12 countries to give consumers a 
more informed view of our products’ 
contribution to public health. For 
mayonnaise, we continued our global

14 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008 In India, the Lifebuoy hygiene education programme, Swasthya 
Chetna, has reached nearly 51 000 villages and made a difference 
to the lives of 120 million people in rural areas since 2002. Similar 
programmes in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, South Africa, 
Vietnam and Indonesia reached a further 13 million.
Another common affliction is oral disease. Around the world, 
over 1 billion people do not brush their teeth with a fluoridated 
toothpaste at all, while over 2 billion do not brush twice a day.

Our Signal, Pepsodent and Close Up brands are making a real 
difference. In 2008 we extended our long-standing partnership 
with the FDI World Dental Federation. It now covers 40 countries. 
The partnership is focusing on encouraging children and their 
families to brush day and night with fluoride toothpaste as  
this has the greatest impact on improving oral health around  
the world.
Hygiene – changing habits, helping save lives
Globally, a lack of basic hygiene causes a wide range of illnesses. 
Incorporating simple habits into everyday routines such as washing 
hands with soap prevents life-threatening diseases, particularly 
diarrhoea and respiratory infections. And brushing teeth day 
and night can significantly contribute to the prevention of gum 
disease and infection.

affordable and widely available to consumers is a crucial starting 
point, but products alone are often not enough if people do 
not change their habits.
So Unilever’s health and hygiene programmes harness the 
power of our marketing to change behaviour. By working with 
partners in government and non-government organisations  
we can extend our impact further.

Environment and Vitality – Working towards sustainability
Unilever depends on the natural 
environment for supplies of raw  
materials and water. Sustainability  
is a business issue.

Over two thirds of our raw materials come from agriculture. 
Changing weather patterns, water scarcity and unsustainable 
farming practices threaten the long-term viability of agricultural 
production. Packaging depends on supplies of paper and other 
materials. Water is essential for consumers when using many of 
our brands. 
For more than a decade we have been working to reduce the 
environmental impact of our own operations. Now we are going 
further to look at indirect impacts, encompassing suppliers and 
consumers where possible. In 2008 we piloted a way to measure 
our product categories against four indicators covering water, 
waste, sustainable sourcing and greenhouse gas emissions.  
This data will inform future development and innovation across 
our categories.
Sourcing sustainably
Unilever buys approximately 12% of the world’s black tea, 7% of 
the world’s tomatoes and 4% of its palm oil. We have developed 
detailed guidelines on what sustainable agriculture means for key 
crops, covering issues such as reducing pesticide use, conserving 
water and using less energy. 
In 2007 we announced our commitment to source all our tea 
from certified sustainable sources. About half the Lipton Yellow 
Label and PG tips we sell in Western Europe is now grown on 
Rainforest Alliance Certified™ farms. This commitment was

clearance and burning of forests contributes to global warming. 
Worldwide, deforestation releases nearly 20% of the world’s 
greenhouse gases. Working with Greenpeace, we have built a 
global coalition of companies, banks and NGOs to break the 
link between deforestation and the cultivation of oil palm. 
In 2008, we announced our intention to have all our palm oil 
certified as sustainable by 2015. 
 
Addressing climate change
Changes in climatic conditions threaten the stability of the 
markets where we operate, as well as our agricultural supply 
chain. Developing countries, where we are growing strongly, 
are especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change. 
We are committed to reducing carbon dioxide emissions from 
energy in our manufacturing operations by 25% by 2012 
(measured by tonne of production against a baseline of 2004). 
Since 1995 we have achieved a 39% reduction in CO
2 from  
energy per tonne of production. In 2008 we reduced our CO 2 
emissions by 1.6% per tonne of production compared to 2007*.
In fact most CO
2 emissions associated with our brands occur 
during consumer use since many of our products require energy 
to heat water for cooking and washing. Through the design and 
formulation of our products, we can make a difference. For 
example, by developing concentrated detergents that use fewer 
raw materials and less packaging, that are less energy intensive to 
manufacture, and that are effective at lower wash temperatures. 
Conserving water
Our brands rely on water at each stage of their life cycle – 
upstream in the supply chain, in our own manufacturing 
operations and in the hands of consumers. 
Since 1995 we have reduced the amount of water we use per 
tonne of production by 63% by minimising water use and 
maximising water recycling. During 2008 we achieved a  
3% reduction in water use compared to 2007 from 3.05m
3
  
to 2.96m
3
 per tonne of production* . 
The most direct impact we can have on water conservation  
is by designing products that use less. Surf Excel Quick Wash 
laundry detergent, for example, saves two buckets of water  
per wash for consumers in India – a real benefit when water is 
scarce and costly. In 2008 sales increased by 20%. One Rinse 
Comfort fabric conditioner eliminates the need to rinse clothes 
before applying the conditioner.

Unilever experts apply their skills  
to reducing our brands’ impact on the 
environment, as well as making them 
perform better. Our Rexona 50ml 
roll-on deodorant is one of the most 
environmentally friendly on the 
market, thanks to a radical rethink  
of its design and manufacture. The 
moulding, assembly and packaging 
processes were streamlined and 
energy efficiency improved, with the 
resulting roll-on weighing on average 
8% less and using 1 000 tonnes less 
plastic per year than previously. The 
time needed to make the cap was cut 
by 34% and the time to make the 
bottle was reduced by 8%, leading to 
significant energy savings. Rexona 
deodorants continued to do well, as 
sales grew rapidly in 2008.
Reducing packaging and waste
Packaging is essential to protect our brands, maintain hygiene 
and present them attractively to consumers. The more we reduce 
the impacts of our packaging, the greater the potential saving 
in materials, energy, transport and disposal costs for customers 
and consumers.
We have also been minimising waste from manufacturing as 
part of our eco-efficiency programme for more than a decade. 
Since 1995 we have cut total waste sent for disposal by 68% 
per tonne of production. During 2008 we saw an increase of 
4.3% in total waste compared to 2007. This increase from 
7.56kg/tonne to 7.89 kg/tonne has been driven by three factors: 
legislative changes which require different methods of disposal 
for non-hazardous waste; under-capacity in effluent treatment; 
and the planned disposal of accumulated and inherited 
hazardous waste*.

Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008 19  About Unilever
20 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Report of the Directors
Our business and our strategy
Unilever is one of the world’s leading suppliers of fast moving
consumer goods. We aim to add Vitality to Life through meeting
everyday consumer needs for nutrition, hygiene and personal care
with products that help people to feel good, look good and get
more out of life. Unilever is a global business which achieves close
to half of its turnover in developing and emerging markets in
Asia, Africa, Central & Eastern Europe and Latin America.
Unilever’s portfolio includes such well-known brands as Knorr,
Lipton, Hellmann’s, Magnum, Omo, Dove, Lux and Axe/Lynx.
In 2008 we continued to focus on investing resources in markets
that are attractive and where we have competitive advantage,
notably Vitality (which we discuss in more detail on pages 9 to
17), Developing and Emerging (D&E) markets and personal care.
These higher growth areas have offered excellent opportunities
for us to develop our business performance and deliver more
shareholder value. At the same time, we continue to seek to
enhance our proﬁtability and productivity through our
transformation agenda, the key features of which are the
simpliﬁcation of our structure under the ‘One Unilever’
programme, the strengthening of our brand portfolio through
acquisitions and disposals, and the rationalisation of our supply
chain.
Our long-term ambition is to be in the top third of a group of
21 fast moving consumer goods companies in terms of total
shareholder return on a three-year basis. A list of companies
included in our peer group is set out on page 43.
Key indicators – performance and portfolio
We have deﬁned the following ﬁve key ﬁnancial performance
indicators for our business:
2008 2007 2006
Underlying sales growth (%) 7.4 5.5 3.8
Operating margin (%) 17.7 13.1 13.6
Ungeared free cash ﬂow (€ billion) 3.2 3.8 4.2
Return on invested capital (%) 15.7 12.7 14.6
Total shareholder return (ranking) 9 813
Underlying sales growth (USG) is deﬁned as the percentage
increase in turnover, adjusted for the impact of acquisitions and
disposals and exchange rate ﬂuctuations. In 2008, underlying
sales growth increased from 5.5% to 7.4%, driven by pricing
action in response to unprecedented increases in commodity
costs.
Operating margin for 2008 improved from 13.1% to 17.7%,
boosted by the net impact of proﬁts on disposals, restructuring
charges and other one-off items. Before these items the
underlying improvement in operating margin in 2008 was 0.1
percentage points.
Ungeared free cash ﬂow (UFCF) is deﬁned as the cash ﬂow from
operating activities less net capital expenditure, pension charges,
share-based compensation costs and tax. A more comprehensive
deﬁnition is given on page 41. In 2008, UFCF was €3.2 billion,
which was €0.6 billion lower than a year earlier, with the
underlying growth in operating proﬁt being offset by business
disposals and adverse currency movements. It also reﬂected
higher restructuring costs, additional investment in capital
expenditure and higher tax rates. It included a working capital
increase of only €0.2 billion, which we see as a good achievement
in the light of the unprecedented commodity cost increases and
related pricing actions.
Return on invested capital (ROIC) is deﬁned as proﬁt after tax
(excluding ﬁnance and net impairment charges) divided by the
average invested capital. A more comprehensive deﬁnition is
given on page 42. In 2008, ROIC was 15.7%, boosted from
12.7% in 2007 by proﬁts on business disposals. Excluding proﬁts
on disposals, ROIC was 11.2%, broadly in line with 2007 on a
comparable basis.
Within our peer group of 21 companies, our relative Total
Shareholder Return over a three-year period was 9th in 2008. This
measure forms part of the basis for the long-term remuneration
of top management.
Underlying sales growth, ungeared free cash ﬂow and return on
invested capital are not recognised measures under IFRS. The IFRS
measure most comparable with USG is turnover. In our Financial
Review on page 43 we reconcile USG with changes in turnover.
There is no IFRS measure directly comparable with either UFCF or
ROIC. In our Financial Review on pages 41 and 42 we reconcile
ROIC to net proﬁt, and UFCF to both net proﬁt and cash ﬂow
from operations. The values of turnover, net proﬁt and cash ﬂow
from operating activities for the last three reporting years are as
follows:
€ million € million € million
2008 2007 2006
Turnover 40 523 40 187 39 642
Net proﬁt 5 285 4 136 5 015
Cash ﬂow from operating activities 5 326 5 188 5 574
Further information about these measures, including deﬁnitions
and, where appropriate, reconciliation to GAAP measures, can be
found in our Financial Review starting on page 40.
In addition to these ﬁnancial indicators, we track other measures
in support of our strategic goals. We believe that the share of our
business that is generated in Developing and Emerging (D&E)
markets, and the proportion of our turnover that is generated by
our top 25 brands are particularly relevant. For the latter measure
we group together brands that have common consumer proﬁles
and are supported by common innovation programmes, although
in some cases the brand names may vary between countries.
The results for these measures for the last three reporting years
are as follows:
2008 2007 2006
Share of turnover in D&E markets (%) 47 44 42
Share of turnover in top 25 brands (%) 73 73 73 About Unilever continued
Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008 21
Report of the Directors
Our deﬁnition of D&E markets includes all countries in Latin
America, Central & Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia, except Japan,
Korea, Australia and New Zealand. In 2008, the turnover in these
markets represented 47% of the turnover of the Group.
Our D&E strategy aims to increase the penetration and
consumption of our categories with D&E consumers at all income
levels and to trade consumers up to higher added value products
as needs change with rising incomes. We have an outstanding
geographic footprint in D&E markets. Our focus is to maintain
and develop our leading category and brand positions in our D&E
strongholds, such as Brazil, India, South Africa and Indonesia,
whilst simultaneously investing aggressively for growth to build up
new brand and category positions in countries that present
important new growth opportunities, notably China and Russia.
In the last decade we have strengthened our brand portfolio, with
the top 25 brands now collectively contributing 73% of our
global turnover. We now have 13 brands with a turnover of
€1 billion or more, as the Axe/Lynx men’s care brand surpassed
this milestone in 2008.
We also monitor the development of our brands through
independent market information that gives us insights into our
leading positions versus our direct competitors. In our section on
Operating environment on page 22 we indicate the product areas
in which we have leading or key strategic positions.
Key indicators – people and sustainability
Unilever has for many years recognised the signiﬁcance of social
and environmental issues as a critical dimension of its operations,
and has established many indicators to track its performance in
these areas.
We regard safety as an essential element of a successful and
sustainable business and take seriously our responsibility to
provide a safe workplace. We aim to improve continuously the
health, safety and well-being of everyone working for or on
behalf of Unilever. A key measure of our progress in this area is
our total recordable accident frequency rate, which counts all
workplace accidents except those requiring only simple ﬁrst aid
treatment. For details please refer to page 13.
We are committed to meeting the needs of customers and
consumers in an environmentally sound and sustainable manner,
through continuous improvement in environmental performance
in all our activities. We exercise the same concern for the
environment wherever we operate and aim to reduce the
environmental footprint of our business and brands.
The environmental measures that we regard as the most
signiﬁcant in relation to our business are those relating to the
amounts of CO
2
from energy that we produce, the water that we
consume as part of our production processes, and the amount of
waste that we generate. For further details please refer to
page 16.
The table below shows the results for the last three years.

Data for 2008 is preliminary. It will be independently assured and
reported in our online Sustainable Development Report 2008 at
www.unilever.com/sustainability For previous years, the data has
been assured. The type of assurance undertaken has been limited
to enquiries of company personnel and analytical procedures
together with review on a sample basis of the operation of
processes relating to performance data noted in the table above.
Assurance of this nature is substantially less in scope than a
ﬁnancial audit and does not include detailed sample testing of
source data, processes or internal controls. None of the assurance
services in this area is provided by Unilever’s external ﬁnancial
auditors.
On pages 9 to 11 of this report we give examples of the ways in
which our brands are addressing consumers’ social and
environmental concerns. A comprehensive review of Unilever’s
social and environmental performance can be found in our annual
Sustainable Development Report, available online at
www.unilever.com/sustainability Our online Report will contain
updated and independently assured results for 2008 for the
measures above, as well as trend information that demonstrates
our performance over the longer term.
Ten-year trends in many of the measures described above,
together with a range of other indicators, are included in the
document entitled ‘Unilever Charts’ which can be found on our
website at
www.unilever.com/investorrelations/annual_reports
Organisation
Unilever’s organisation comprises regions, categories and
functions.
During 2008, we reorganised the management of our regions so
that our operations in Central & Eastern Europe were managed
together with those in Asia and Africa, whereas they had
previously been managed with those in Western Europe. This
change reﬂects our strategic focus on the developing world and
the fact that these markets share many common characteristics.
Our regions have proﬁt responsibility for the local go-to-market
operations in their geographic territory. The focus is primarily to
build and develop relationships with customers, to develop the
regional supply chain to deliver customer service and asset
productivity, and to deploy brands and innovations effectively,
focused on excellent execution in the market place. The
performance of the regions is measured in terms of in-year
ﬁnancial results, customer service levels and market positions. About Unilever continued
22 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Report of the Directors
In 2008, we combined all global categories and brands across
nutrition, hygiene and personal care into one global category
organisation. The global category team aims to develop winning
category and brand strategies, to create exciting new brand
communication, product innovation and renovation, and to
provide strategic direction for the supply chain. The category team
is responsible for medium-term value creation, considering items
such as market share, category growth, brand health and
innovation.
Our functional teams, notably Finance and Human Resources, are
responsible for providing business partnering, strategic support
and competitive services across the global business. These
functions are organised around the same principles of business
partners, shared services and expertise teams.
The top management team, called the Unilever Executive (UEx),
consists of the CEO with seven direct reports, including three
regional Presidents for Western Europe, the Americas and Asia
Africa CEE, one global President for the global categories, and
three functional heads namely the CFO, Chief HR Ofﬁcer and
Chief R&D Ofﬁcer.
During 2008, Paul Polman was appointed CEO, replacing Patrick
Cescau with effect from 1 January 2009, and Geneviève Berger
joined the UEx team as Chief R&D Ofﬁcer, having previously been a
Non-Executive Director.
Operating environment
In our markets, we are competing with a diverse set of
competitors. Some of these competitors operate on an
international scale like ourselves, while others have a more
regional or local focus.
We aim to focus on providing consumers with added-value
products that bring Vitality to Life, in several important ways:
• creating and nurturing attractive brands that are trusted and
preferred by consumers and which seek to address consumer
needs and aspirations better than other brands;
• developing and rolling out new and better products and
concepts across our regions and product categories, supported
by innovative communication campaigns; and
• optimising and improving the productivity and efﬁciency of our
cost and asset base whilst ensuring a consistent high quality of
our products.
Around 70% of our turnover is in countries and categories where
we have a leadership position, as measured by the value of
turnover. We hold the global number 1 position in savoury,
spreads, dressings, tea, ice cream, deodorants and mass skin care.
We hold the global number 2 position in laundry detergents and
daily hair care. We have strong local positions in household care
and oral care.
Unilever’s products are generally sold through our own sales force
as well as through independent brokers, agents and distributors
to chain, wholesale, co-operative and independent grocery
accounts, food service distributors and institutions. Products are
physically distributed through a network of distribution centres,
satellite warehouses, company-operated and public storage
facilities, depots and other facilities.
Our products are sold in over 150 countries around the world. In
many countries we manufacture the products that we sell, while
we also export products to countries where we do not have
manufacturing operations. The manufacturing network is
generally determined by an optimised regional sourcing strategy
which takes account of requirements for innovation, quality,
service, cost and ﬂexibility. Certain of our businesses, such as ice
cream, are subject to signiﬁcant seasonal ﬂuctuations in sales.
However, Unilever operates globally in many different markets
and product categories, and no individual element of seasonality
is likely to be material to the results of the Group as a whole.
Our products use a wide variety of raw and packaging materials
which we source internationally, and which may be subject to
price volatility. In 2008 we saw unprecedented price increases in
many of our materials, notably in edible oils, which are used in
many food products as well as some personal care products, and
of crude oil, which is relevant to our transport costs but also used
as an input for certain petrochemicals and packaging materials.
Transactions with related parties are conducted in accordance
with agreed transfer pricing policies and include sales to joint
ventures and associates. Other than those disclosed in this report,
there were no related party transactions that were material to the
Group or to the related parties concerned that are required to be
reported in 2008 or the two preceding years.
For more information about related party transactions please refer
also to note 30 on page 135.
Resources
Our brands
We have a strong and well differentiated portfolio of global and
local brands, which are positioned to meet the needs and
aspirations of our consumers across a variety of price points,
segments and channels, allowing us to compete effectively in our
key categories and countries.
In 2008 thirteen of our brands had global turnover of €1 billion
or more. These were Knorr, Hellmann’s, Lipton, Becel/Flora
(Healthy Heart), Rama/Blue Band (Family Goodness), Wall’s/Algida
(Heartbrand), Omo, Surf, Dove, Lux, Rexona (including Sure and
Degree), Axe/Lynx and Sunsilk (including Seda and Sedal).
We manage our brands under the following four category
headings: savoury, dressings and spreads; ice cream and
beverages; personal care; and home care. About Unilever continued
Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008 23
Report of the Directors
Savoury, dressings and spreads includes soups, bouillons, sauces,
snacks, mayonnaise, salad dressings, margarines, spreads and

In personal care, six global brands are the core of our business in
the mass skin care, daily hair care and deodorants product areas –
Dove, Lux, Rexona (including Sure and Degree), Sunsilk (including
Seda/Sedal), Axe/Lynx and Pond’s. Other important brands include
Suave, Clear, Lifebuoy and Vaseline, together with Signal and
Close Up in oral care.
Our home care ranges include laundry products, such as tablets,
traditional powders and liquids for washing clothing by hand or
machine. Tailored products including soap bars are available for
lower-income consumers. Our brands include Omo (‘Dirt is Good’
platform), Surf, Comfort, Radiant and Skip. Our household care
products include surface cleaners and bleach, sold under the Cif,
Domestos and Sun/Sunlight brands.
Please refer also to pages 9 to 11 where we give many examples
of the ways in which our brand portfolio is being actively
managed in support of our Vitality agenda.
Our employees
We believe in providing an environment where individuals can
achieve their goals, both professionally and personally. In order to
attract and retain the best people, we recognise the need to offer
them ways to take advantage of opportunities, room to succeed
and grow, and more directions in which to pursue their careers.
Our success depends on innovation, so we do everything we can
to ensure that the enterprising people we employ have the
freedom to act. We give them all the support and encouragement
they need. At the same time, we empower them to make tough
decisions, implement new ideas and use their initiative. As a result
our people have a passion for achievement, strive for outstanding
results and are determined to get things done.
We believe in everyone’s ability to develop and grow and that life
at work should be a continuous learning journey and that we all
have an equal right to take advantage of the opportunity to
develop ourselves. In our view seizing the opportunity to make a
difference is more important than simply progressing up the
ladder.
Personal vitality is also something we feel strongly about and we
have programmes and activities in place which are designed to
help everyone in the business take care of themselves and
encourage a better quality of life. By creating a vitalising work
experience and environment for our people we help them feel
energised and able to perform to the very best of their ability.
We have created an inclusive environment where people can
bring their whole self to work; they do not have to change to ﬁt
in. We want people to be themselves. This drives a higher level of
engagement and, as a direct result, improves all-round
performance.
The fact that everyone is unique and has different interests
outside of the ofﬁce has a positive impact on the way we work
and on our culture. Understanding other people's perspectives
and learning from them adds variety and enriches what we do.
On page 13 we have given some examples of the ways in which
we promote vitality in our people and in our ways of working.
Our total employee numbers over the last ﬁve years were as
follows:
Year end in thousands 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004
Western Europe 30 34 36 41 44
The Americas 42 43 45 47 47
Asia Africa CEE 102 97 98 118 132
Total 174 174 179 206 223
Numbers for prior years have been restated following the change
in our regional organisation during 2008.
Diversity
Diversity in Unilever is about inclusion, embracing differences,
creating possibilities and growing together for better business
performance. We embrace diversity in our workforce: this means
giving full and fair consideration to all applicants and continuing
development to all employees regardless of gender, nationality,
race, creed, disability, style or sexuality. Diversity plays a vital role
in ensuring we understand consumers’ needs.
The commitment to diversity is set right at the top of our
business. It is driven by the Global Diversity Board, chaired
throughout 2008 by former Group Chief Executive Patrick
Cescau, who has emphasised that ‘diversity is critical to our
business competitiveness and long-term sustainability’. About Unilever continued
24 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Report of the Directors
Unilever is a very culturally diverse business, with 20 different
nationalities represented among our top-level group of 100
managers worldwide.
We have worked to embed diversity ﬁrmly into our day-to-day
business decisions, via our talent management and people
processes, from appointments to development. As part of the
Human Resources planning process our business units are
required to develop speciﬁc diversity plans that are aligned to the
priorities and needs of their regions and categories. Progress on
implementation of these plans is monitored closely.
We continue to carry out quarterly measurement and tracking of
diversity against our objectives, using the HR Strategy in Action
tool. Gender diversity remains an important priority.
Information Technology
Unilever IT is a global function headed by a Chief Information
Ofﬁcer, reporting to the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, with a strategy
to deliver simple and competitive IT solutions in a cost-effective
way to support the business agenda.
A common technology framework and common standards for
architecture, key technologies, process, information and service
allow Unilever to simplify its IT operations to better exploit
global scale in IT. For example, this common approach facilitates
the move towards regional supply chain organisations and
the development of regional shared service centres, notably
in Finance and Human Resources, which in some cases
are outsourced.
The IT function is a key enabler for the One Unilever
transformation towards a globally aligned business through:
• strategic alliances and partnerships with global suppliers;
• improving IT infrastructure and service levels, whilst
reducing costs;
• building consistent IT capabilities, processes and databases; and
• strategic outsourcing in selected key areas
The implementation of an integrated enterprise-wide information
system in each region in support of the One Unilever
transformation is ﬁrmly on track. The Western Europe region
completed its phased implementation, with the last group of
countries going live at the end of 2008. The Asia Africa CEE
region made good progress as a number of countries were added
in a phased implementation towards 2010. The Americas is
already fully operational across the region.
Unilever partners with a selected group of leading suppliers to
develop and maintain a limited number of complementary IT
systems that collectively cover our business needs. This promotes
radical simpliﬁcation, increased ﬂexibility and agility, faster
implementation and reduced costs.
Intellectual property
We have a large portfolio of patents and trademarks, and we
conduct some of our operations under licences that are based on
patents or trademarks owned or controlled by others. We are not
dependent on any one patent or group of patents. We use all
appropriate efforts to protect our brands and technology.
Property, plant and equipment
We have interests in properties in most of the countries where
there are Unilever operations. However, none is material in the
context of the Group as a whole. The properties are used
predominantly to house production and distribution activities
and as ofﬁces. There is a mixture of leased and owned property
throughout the Group. There are no environmental issues
affecting the properties which would have a material impact
upon the Group, and there are no material encumbrances on our
properties. Any difference between the market value of properties
held by the Group and the amount at which they are included in
the balance sheet is not signiﬁcant. Please refer also to the
schedule of principal group companies and non-current
investments on page 140 and to details of property, plant and
equipment in note 10 on page 99. We believe our existing
facilities are satisfactory for our current business and we currently
have no plans to construct new facilities or expand or improve our
current facilities in a manner that is material to the Group.
Laws and regulation
Unilever businesses are governed by laws and regulations
designed to ensure that products may be safely used for their
intended purpose and that labelling and advertising are truthful
and not misleading. Unilever businesses are further regulated by
data protection and anti-trust legislation. Important regulatory
bodies in respect of our businesses include the European
Commission and the US Food and Drug Administration.
We have processes in place to ensure that products, ingredients,
manufacturing processes, marketing materials and activities
comply with the above-mentioned laws and regulations.
Legal proceedings
We are involved from time to time in legal and arbitration
proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. However,
although the outcome of legal proceedings are inherently difﬁcult
to predict, we are not currently involved in any legal or arbitration
proceedings which may be expected to lead to material loss or
expenditure in the context of the Group results. Similarly we do
not have any material obligations under environmental legislation.
None of our Directors or Ofﬁcers is involved in any legal
proceedings which are material as aforesaid. For further
information on certain legal proceedings please refer to ‘legal
proceedings’ within note 25 on page 126. Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008 25
Report of the Directors
Outlook and risks
The following discussion about outlook and risk management
activities includes ‘forward-looking’ statements that involve risk
and uncertainties. The actual results could differ materially from
those projected. See the ‘Cautionary statement’ on the inside
back cover.
Outlook
The progress Unilever has made in recent years is clear and
encouraging. We have great brands, an enviable geographic
reach and around 70% of our turnover comes from categories in
which we have leadership positions. We have an organisation
which is able to act more decisively and with greater speed. We
are also beneﬁting from cost reduction programmes which we
established well ahead of the onset of the recession and which
have much further to run.
The fact remains however that the global economic climate is
more difﬁcult than many of us have ever seen. The extent of the
downturn, how deep and how prolonged, is difﬁcult to predict.
As 2008 progressed we saw recessionary conditions in most
developed markets and a slowdown in D&E markets. Consumer
and customer de-stocking exacerbated already weakening
demand, and volumes suffered as a result.
In these circumstances it is important to focus on the things we
can do in the short term to further strengthen our competitive
position. So the priority for 2009 will be to re-ignite volume
growth whilst protecting margins and the strong cash generating
capacity of the business.
We have already announced a series of measures in support of
these priorities; and have shortened the time horizon of our
variable pay scheme to six months. This will ensure that we
quickly align the organisation behind the new priorities.
We no longer wish to target the business to deliver an operating
margin in excess of 15% in 2010. This target was set at a very
different time and in very different circumstances. We need to
ensure that we focus on creating long-term value for our
shareholders in today’s climate. Hence, the focus will be on
volume growth and strengthening the competitive position of our
brands.
We believe that the actions we are taking will further strengthen
Unilever’s competitive position. In time, we have no doubt we will
be able to lift the growth proﬁle of the business whilst steadily
improving margins each year.
Principal Risk Factors
Unilever’s system of risk management is outlined on page 28.
Responsibility for establishing a coherent framework for the
Group to manage risk resides with the Boards. The remit of the
Boards is outlined on page 44.
Risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to vary from
those described in forward-looking statements made within this
document, or could impact on our ability to meet our targets or
be detrimental to our proﬁtability or reputation. The risks that we
regard as the most relevant to our business are identiﬁed below.
We have also commented on certain mitigating actions that we
believe help us manage such risks; however, we may not be
successful in deploying some or all of these mitigating actions.
Global economic slowdown and changing consumer
demand
The unprecedented economic slowdown and turmoil in the global
economy has adversely impacted consumer markets, including
those in which Unilever operates. Unilever’s business is dependent
on continued consumer demand for our products, and reduced
consumer wealth may result in our consumers becoming unwilling
or unable to purchase our products, with clear implications for
turnover and proﬁtability.
Unilever’s strategy is aimed at delivering superior value products
to consumers, through strong brands, supported by differentiated
innovation and continued product improvement, and driven to
market through excellent execution. We seek to build mutually
rewarding relationships with customers in order to make our
products available across all relevant channels.
We have a signiﬁcant number of global brands and any adverse
event affecting consumer conﬁdence or continuity of supply of
such a brand could have an adverse impact in many of our
markets, or in some cases affect intangible asset values. We
support our brands and their growth through compelling and
competitive levels of investment in advertising and promotions.
The breadth of both our portfolio and our geographic reach also
help us mitigate general economic risks. We aim to protect the
value of our brands through a rigorous approach to R&D and
product quality, and by operating in accordance with relevant
laws and regulations.
These measures are aimed at extending our consumer offerings,
reducing the impact of falling consumer demand or of consumers
switching to alternative products, and thus allowing us to
compete effectively in our key categories and countries.
Competitive markets and consolidation of customers
We operate in competitive markets, and the actions of
multinational, regional, and local customers or competitors may
place our market shares or margins at risk.
Our strategy continues to focus on investing resources in markets
and segments that are attractive, where we have competitive
advantage, and where we can grow sales and margins
competitively. Three priorities have been communicated: to invest
in Vitality (expressed as offering consumers products that enable
them to look good, feel good, and get more out of life); to grow
the proportion of our total business that comes from Developing
and Emerging (D&E) markets (currently nearly 50%); and to
increase our presence in personal care markets. Outlook and risks continued
By concentrating our resources on areas where we have leading
category and brand positions we seek to strengthen our overall
competitive position. We also seek in-ﬁll acquisitions to support
our category and geographical ambitions.
In the current climate, we also face counterparty risk with
customers. The Group establishes limits for key customers, reviews
these regularly and takes necessary action to manage this risk.
In respect of our route to market, further consolidation among
retailers and the continued growth of discounters could adversely
impact our rate of sales growth and our proﬁt margins. Our
success depends on our ability to manage successfully our trading
relationships with our key customers. We tackle this by
developing and adapting our customer-facing strategies and
plans, by optimising the return on the investment we make in
customers, and by continually improving our customer
development capabilities. A speciﬁc focus for us at the moment is
to improve our level of customer service.
Financial risks – liquidity, currency, interest,
pensions, taxation
Turbulence in the ﬁnancial markets and the downturn in the
economic environment have heightened ﬁnancial risks. As
Unilever operates on a global basis it is affected in a variety of
ways by such instability.
Several factors could affect liquidity management. A material and
signiﬁcant shortfall in cash ﬂow could undermine our credit
rating, impair investor conﬁdence and hinder our ability to raise
funds, whether through access to credit markets, commercial
paper programmes, long-term bond issuances or otherwise.
During 2008, Unilever beneﬁted from its strong single-A Balance
sheet ‘active ﬁnancial management’, and the coming year will see
the continuation of the same policy. Maintaining our strong
single-A rating will remain a key priority.
To manage ﬁnancial risks, the Group aims to concentrate cash in
the parent and ﬁnance companies in order to ensure maximum
ﬂexibility in meeting changing economic needs. We ﬁnance our
operating subsidiaries through a mixture of retained earnings,
third-party borrowing and loans from parent and group
companies, with the mix determined by what is most appropriate
to the country concerned. We seek to manage our liquidity
requirements by maintaining access to global debt markets
through an infrastructure of short-term and long-term debt
programmes. In addition to this, Unilever has committed credit
facilities in place to support its commercial paper programmes
and for general corporate purpose. We plan on increasing
liquidity by reducing the outstanding commercial paper through
the issuance of long-term bonds, extending the maturity proﬁle of
the remaining commercial paper and through continued active
management of our working capital positions.
Because of the breadth of our international operations, we are
subject to risks from changes in the relative value of currencies.
We intend to continue our policy whereby operating companies
manage trading and ﬁnancial foreign exchange exposures within
prescribed exposure limits and the use of forward foreign
exchange contracts. On a case-by-case basis, companies may
decide whether or not to apply cash ﬂow hedge accounting.
Regional groups monitor compliance with this foreign
exchange policy.
In addition, as Unilever conducts business in many foreign
currencies but publishes its ﬁnancial statements and measures its
performance in euros, it is subject to exchange risks associated
with the translation of the underlying net assets of its foreign
subsidiaries. We aim to minimise our foreign exchange exposure
in operating companies by borrowing in local currencies, except
where inhibited by local regulations, lack of local liquidity or local
market conditions. For those countries that in the view of
management have a substantial retranslation risk, we may decide
to hedge such net investment through the use of foreign currency
borrowing or forward exchange contracts on which hedge
accounting is applied.
Increases in benchmark interest rates could increase the interest
cost of our debt and increase the cost of future borrowings.
These rates are susceptible to market ﬂuctuations and volatility,
and any inability to manage this effectively could impact our cash
ﬂows and proﬁts. Our interest rate management policy aims to
achieve an optimal balance between ﬁxed and ﬂoating rate
interest exposures on expected net debt levels for the next ﬁve
calendar years. The objective of the policy is to minimise annual
interest costs and to reduce volatility. We achieve this through a
combination of issuing ﬁxed rate long-term debt and by
modifying the interest rate exposure of debt and cash positions
through the use of interest rate swaps.
In the current climate, we also face signiﬁcant counterparty risk
from banks. The Group regularly reviews these and where
necessary tightens counterparty limits and reduces the maturity
proﬁle of deposits to provide for maximum ﬂexibility. The Group
actively manages its banking exposures on a daily basis.
Certain Unilever businesses have deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans.
Falling interest rates and market values of investments coupled
with increasing life expectancy could result in the cost of funding
these schemes increasing substantially.
Our pension investment policies are such that investments are
well diversiﬁed, and the failure of any single investment would
not have a material impact on the overall level of assets. The
plans seek to invest the largest proportion of the assets in
equities, which the Group believes offer the best returns over the
long term commensurate with an acceptable level of risk. The
pension funds also have a proportion of assets invested in
property, bonds, hedge funds and cash. The majority of assets are
managed by a number of external fund managers, with a small
proportion managed in-house. Unilever has a pooled investment
vehicle (Univest) which it believes offers its pension plans around
the world a simpliﬁed, externally managed investment vehicle to
implement their strategic asset allocation models currently for
equities and hedge funds.
In view of the current economic climate and deteriorating
government deﬁcit positions, tax legislation in the regions in
which we operate may be subject to change, which may have an
adverse effect on our proﬁts and on our ability to remit dividends
or service fees. We intend to continue with high quality tax
compliance and documentation, to execute prudent tax planning
strategies and to make proper provision for current and deferred
taxation. Deferred tax assets are reviewed regularly for
recoverability.

Report of the Directors
Outlook and risks continued
Further information about these, including sensitivity analysis to
changes in certain of the key measures, is given in note 17 on
pages 108 and 110 and note 20 on page 115.
Exposure to Developing and Emerging (D&E) markets
Unilever has signiﬁcant international operations, with close to half
its business in D&E markets, and whilst its diverse geographical
spread helps ensure it is not reliant on a single region or country,
it is continually exposed to changing economic, political and social
developments outside its control. D&E markets are typically more
volatile than those in the developed world, and any broad-based
downturn in these markets could reduce our sales and adversely
affect our cash ﬂow and proﬁts. In mitigation, Unilever has long
experience and understanding of D&E markets and how to
manage effectively at times of economic turbulence.
Input costs, supplier and supply chain reliance
Manufacturing our products is dependent on obtaining adequate
supplies of production materials in a timely and cost effective
manner. The prices of these, which are signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by
global economic conditions, can ﬂuctuate and could have an
impact on our margins and cash ﬂows. Our management of these
ﬂuctuations is important in terms of our overall cost
competitiveness and management of margins and cash ﬂows.
We are also dependent on suppliers and global supply chains as a
means of producing and supplying our products. As a result of
our reliance on these global supply chains, we are exposed to
business interruption from natural disasters or catastrophes and
through additional risks of changes in local legal and regulatory
schemes, labour shortages and disruptions from environmental
and industrial incidents.
In the current climate we also face a counterparty risk from our
suppliers. Active monitoring of our suppliers and supply chain is in
place, and regular supplier counterparty risk analysis is carried out
to assess exposure limits. We plan to continue to work closely
with our key suppliers in mitigating the impact of the lack of
liquidity in the market. We intend to continue to purchase
forward contracts for raw materials and commodities as
appropriate.
Unilever actively monitors its external environment, reviews and
revisits its business continuity and disaster recovery plans, and
continues to adapt its internal cost structures to deliver products
at competitive costs. We continue to actively manage ﬂuctuations
in input costs and are accelerating our cost reduction
programmes.
Safety, sustainability and environment
Unilever has created a strong corporate reputation over many
years for its focus on social and environmental issues, including
sustainable development and utilisation of renewable sources. The
Unilever brand on our products increases our exposure, and
should we fail to meet high product safety, social, environmental
and ethical standards in all our operations and activities it could
impact our reputation.
We seek to demonstrate our commitment to our people and the
communities that we operate in through compliance with our
Code of Business Principles and other operational and business
policies.
We continue to recognise the importance of social and
environmental issues in our operations, and have established
indicators to track performance in these areas. We regard safety
as an essential element of a successful and sustainable business
and take seriously our responsibility to provide a safe workplace.
We aim to improve continuously the health, safety and well-being
of everyone working for, or on behalf of, Unilever.
We continue to be committed to meeting the needs of consumers
in an environmentally sound and sustainable manner. The
environmental measures that we regard as the most signiﬁcant in
relation to our business are those relating to the amounts of CO
2
emissions from energy that we consume for manufacturing, the
water that we consume in our production processes, and the
amount of waste that we generate.
The Corporate Responsibility and Reputation Committee oversees
Unilever’s conduct as a responsible corporate citizen. For the
report of the committee please see page 75.
Restructuring and changes to the way we operate
Restructuring is an integral part of remaining competitive, and this
can involve changes to internal structures, the rationalisation of
the asset base, and the use of third parties to deliver business
services.
Restructuring and outsourcing programmes have been particularly
intense over the last few years, and the continuing
implementation of these will require signiﬁcant effort and
attention in order to deliver the expected beneﬁts on time and in
full. Delays, ineffective management of third-party suppliers, or
employee disruption of restructuring programmes could all lead to
increased cost, a delay in realising beneﬁts, and damage to
corporate reputation. We continue to mitigate these risks through
strong project management, clear governance mechanisms, an
agreed approach to change management, and by ensuring we
treat employees in line with our internal standards and in
accordance with all legal and regulatory requirements.
People and talent
Attracting and retaining talented employees is essential to the
successful delivery of our strategy and success in the marketplace.
Shortfalls in recruitment or retention could adversely affect our
ability to operate successfully, grow our business and win against
competition.
To counter the risk, we believe in providing an environment where
individuals can achieve their goals, both professionally and
personally, and by seeking to ensure that Unilever has the right
resources and capabilities to compete effectively. We have fully
integrated processes of appraisal against skill proﬁles, capabilities,
and achievement of business objectives, and we also make
investments in training and development which are aimed at
equipping our people for the challenges in their roles. We
constantly review external candidates to ensure we enrich and
augment our home-grown talent.
Other risks
In common with other businesses, the Group is exposed to a
number of other risks, some of which may have a material impact
on its turnover, operating proﬁt, net assets and liquidity. It is not
possible to identify or anticipate every risk that may affect the
Group, some of which may currently not be known or may have
been assessed as not material. Outlook and risks continued

Report of the Directors
Risk Management, Internal Controls and Disclosure
Controls and Procedures
The identiﬁcation and management of risk is integral to Unilever’s
strategy and to achieving its long-term goals. The Boards have
overall responsibility for the risk management process, which
incorporates risk management, internal control procedures and
disclosure controls and procedures (including the operation of the
Audit Committee – see page 48 – and Disclosure Committee –
see page 49).
Unilever’s procedures, which are documented and regularly
reviewed throughout the organisation, are designed to provide
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that our assets are
safeguarded, the risks facing the business are being addressed,
and all information required to be disclosed is reported to the
Group’s senior management, including where appropriate the
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, within the
required timeframe.
The Boards have established a clear organisational structure which
includes a delegation of authorities. The day-to-day responsibility
for implementation of our procedures (ﬁnancial, operational,
social, strategic and environmental risks and regulatory matters)
and ongoing monitoring of risk and the effectiveness of controls
rests with the Group’s senior management at individual operating
company and regional level. Regions review, on an ongoing basis,
the risks faced by their group and the related internal control
arrangements, and provide written reports to the Chief Executive
Ofﬁcer.
The Group’s risk, control and disclosure procedures are supported
through:
Business Risk Assessment (BRA)
The Audit Committee reviews the key risks affecting the business
four times a year and the Boards review the risks as a part of the
forecast and annual ﬁnancial plan. The regions, category and
functions provide inputs to this process and actions are put into
place to mitigate the identiﬁed risks. Risk reporting covers the
perceived risk, assessed impact and the effectiveness of controls
to mitigate these risks.
The Code of Business Principles (CoBP)
The Code of Business Principles, which sets standards of
professionalism and integrity for its operations worldwide, is
Unilever’s statement of values and represents the standard of
conduct we require from all of our employees. Our Code of Ethics
applies to the senior executive, ﬁnancial and accounting ofﬁcers,
and comprises the standards prescribed by the US Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC). The CoBP Hotline is a conﬁdential
way for employees to submit concerns regarding accounting and
auditing issues anonymously and handles all alleged violations of
the CoBP . Copies of the CoBP , the Code of Ethics and the Share
Dealing Code are posted on our website at
www.unilever.com/investorrelations/corp_governance
Policy compliance
The implementation of and compliance with our governance
structure is facilitated through a business-orientated policy
framework. Unilever policies are universally applicable within the
Unilever Group. They are mandatory and have been developed to
ensure consistency in all material respects amongst worldwide
operations in key areas. They cover operational and functional
matters, and govern how we run our business, to help ensure we
comply with applicable laws and regulations. Key Unilever policies
include the Compliance Manual for the Listing Rules and
Disclosure and Transparency Rules (including the Unilever Share
Dealing Code), the Risk Management Policy, the Corporate
Pensions Policy and the Accounting and Reporting Policy.
Operational Controls Assessment (OCA)
Operational Controls Assessment requires the senior management
in each business unit to assess the effectiveness of ﬁnancial
controls. At our major units, ﬁnancial controls are subject to a
comprehensive risk-based assessment annually, with controls in
the remaining units being reviewed over a one-to three-year cycle.
Annual Positive Assurance
Senior management provides an annual Positive Assurance letter
addressed to the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer conﬁrming compliance of
their business unit with BRA, CoBP , Policy compliance and OCA.
Exceptions, if any, together with remedial actions, form part of
these written communications. A consolidated version is
presented to the Disclosure Committee and the Board for their
review.
Internal audit
The Corporate Audit function plays a key role in providing to both
operating management and the Boards an objective view and
reassurance of the effectiveness of the risk management and
related control systems throughout Unilever.
It is Unilever’s practice to bring acquired companies within the
Group’s governance procedures as soon as is practicable and in
any event by the end of the ﬁrst full year of operation.
The Boards, through the Audit Committee (see page 74 for report
of the Audit Committee), have reviewed the assessment of risks,
internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures that
operate in the Group and have considered the effectiveness and
remedial actions where applicable for the year covered by this
report and up to the date of its approval by the Board of
Directors.
Boards’ assessment of compliance with the Risk
Management frameworks

Performance Review
Basis of reporting
Certain discussions within this Performance Review and in the
Financial Review starting on page 35 include measures that are
not deﬁned by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
such as IFRS. These include Ungeared Free Cash Flow (UFCF),
Return on Invested Capital (ROIC), Underlying Sales Growth
(USG), and Net Debt. For further information please refer to
page 40.
The accounting policies that are most signiﬁcant in connection
with our ﬁnancial reporting are set out on pages 38 and 39.
Foreign currency amounts for results and cash ﬂows are translated
from underlying local currencies into euros using annual average
exchange rates. Balance sheet amounts are translated at year-end
rates, except for the ordinary capital of the two parent
companies. These are translated at the rate referred to in the
Equalisation Agreement of 3
1
⁄9p = €0.16 (see Corporate
governance on page 51).
During 2008 we have implemented changes in the regional
organisation of our business reﬂecting our strategic focus on the
developing world. Our revised structure for management and
reporting of ﬁnancial performance is across the following three
regions:
• Western Europe
• The Americas
• Asia, Africa and Central & Eastern Europe (AACEE)
Our segmental reporting information for prior years has therefore
been restated so that the results for countries in Central & Eastern
Europe are now reported under AACEE.
In this Performance Review we comment on changes in revenue
on the basis of underlying sales growth (USG). This measure
reﬂects the change in revenue at constant rates of exchange,
(average exchange rates for the preceding year) excluding the
effects of acquisitions and disposals. We believe it is a measure
that provides valuable additional information on the underlying
performance of the business. In particular, it presents the organic
growth of our business year on year, and is used internally as a
core measure of sales performance.
USG is not a measure which is deﬁned under IFRS. It should not
be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, ﬁnancial
information presented in compliance with IFRS. This measure as
reported by us may not be comparable with similarly titled
measures reported by other companies.
The reconciliation of USG to changes in turnover for each of our
reporting regions is given in the following sections, and for the
Group in total on page 43.
We also make reference in our commentary to restructuring costs,
proﬁts and losses on business disposals, impairments and certain
other one-off items, which we collectively term RDIs, and the
impact of these on our operating margin. We give further
information about these on the face of our income statement and
in note 3 on page 93.
The reporting in this section is based on results for continuing
operations. Information about discontinued operations is given in
note 27 on page 130.
Group results and earnings per share
The following discussion summarises the results of the Group
during the years 2008, 2007 and 2006. The ﬁgures quoted are in
euros, at current rates of exchange, being the average or year-end
rates of each period as applicable, unless otherwise stated.
Information about exchange rates between the euro, pound
sterling and US dollar is given on page 139.
In 2008 and 2007, no disposals qualiﬁed to be disclosed as
discontinued operations for purposes of reporting. During 2006,
we successfully completed the sale of the majority of our
European frozen foods businesses. The results of the businesses
disposed of have been presented as discontinued operations for
2006 for the period up to the date of sale. There was also some
impact on 2007 as a result of the outcome of agreements made
in connection with the sale.

Group results for 2008 compared with 2007
Underlying sales growth of 7.4% was broad-based across
categories and in line with our markets overall. Growth was
primarily driven by increased prices, with volumes essentially ﬂat.
Underlying sales growth was offset by movements of (4.8)% in
exchange rates and a net impact of (1.4)% from disposals and
acquisitions. Including these effects, turnover was €40 523 million
for the full year, increasing by 0.8%.
During the year we continued to progress our One Unilever
transformation agenda, contributing to an underlying
improvement in operating margin. We integrated multiple
countries into single multi-country operations in many of our key
markets. We further shaped our portfolio through a number of
disposals, including our North American laundry business, Boursin,
Lawry’s and the Bertolli olive oil business, as well as through the
acquisition of Inmarko, the market leader in ice cream in Russia.
We also made further progress in the simpliﬁcation of our supply
chain network in Europe with the establishment of a regional
European supply chain company in Switzerland, and we initiated a
move to a similar regional structure for Asia based in Singapore.
Operating proﬁt increased by €1 922 million to €7 167 million,
including a higher level of proﬁts on business disposals. These
generated a pre-tax proﬁt of €2 190 million in 2008, compared
with €297 million in 2007. Before the impact of RDIs
(restructuring, disposals, impairments and other one-off items),
operating proﬁt grew by 1% at current exchange rates, or 6% at
constant exchange rates, and there was an underlying
improvement in operating margin of 0.1 percentage points.
Report of the Directors Performance Review continued
30 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Report of the Directors
Costs of ﬁnancing net borrowings were 1% lower than last year.
The average interest rate was lower at 4.5%, offsetting the
impact of a higher average level of net debt.
Share of net proﬁt from joint ventures and associates and other
income from non-current investments contributed €219 million.
This included a gain of €61 million in non-current investments
resulting from the disposal of our interests in plantations in Côte
d’Ivoire.
The effective tax rate was 26.4% and the underlying tax rate,
before RDIs, was 26.6% for the full year. This compared with an
underlying rate of 24.5% in 2007, which included substantial
beneﬁts from the favourable settlement of prior year tax audits.
Net proﬁt was 28% higher than in 2007, boosted by the proﬁts
on disposals. Earnings per share were €1.79, including a net gain
of €0.36 from RDIs. This compared with €1.35 last year, which
included a net loss of €0.07 from RDIs.
Return on invested capital was 15.7%, boosted by proﬁts on
business disposals. Excluding proﬁts on disposals, ROIC was
11.2%, broadly in line with 2007 on a comparable basis.
Group results for 2007 compared with 2006
Turnover for the period increased by 1.4% to €40 187 million.
The increase was a consequence of USG of 5.5% in the year,
offset by unfavourable currency movements of (3.1)% and the
impact of disposals of (0.9)%. The USG was a result of both price
and volume increases, respectively contributing 1.8% and 3.7%.
Operating proﬁt for the year was 3% lower and the operating
margin at 13.1% was 0.5 percentage points lower than the prior
year. The lower operating proﬁt and margin were due to a higher
net charge for restructuring, disposals and one-off items. Before
the impact of these items, the operating margin showed an
underlying increase of 0.2 percentage points. Savings and price
increases more than offset signiﬁcant increases in product input
costs. Advertising and promotions as a percentage of sales was in
line with the previous year.
The net charge for restructuring, disposals and one-off items in
2007 was €569 million. This was made up of restructuring
charges of €875 million, partly offset by disposal proﬁts of
€297 million and other items of €9 million. The disposal proﬁts
included €214 million arising from the reorganisation of our
interests in South Africa and Israel, which was a fair value
economic swap that resulted in an accounting proﬁt. In
comparison, the net charge for restructuring, disposals and
one-off items in 2006 was €242 million.
Costs of ﬁnancing net borrowings were 13% lower in the year,
with the impact of movements in the US dollar exchange rate
more than offsetting higher rates. The credit on pensions
ﬁnancing increased to €158 million, reﬂecting an improved
funding position of our schemes in 2007 compared with 2006.
The tax rate was 22% for the year, compared with 24% in 2006,
and beneﬁted from the favourable settlement of prior year tax
audits. We also beneﬁted from a lower tax charge on disposals
during 2007.
Our share in net proﬁt from joint ventures increased by 31% in
the year, mainly driven by continuing strong growth in the
partnerships between Lipton and PepsiCo for ready-to-drink tea.
For the full year, net proﬁt from continuing operations grew by
10%, while EPS on the same basis grew by 12%.
Net proﬁt, including discontinued operations, was 18% lower
than in the prior year, which included the proﬁt on disposal of
European frozen foods businesses.
ROIC was 12.7% in 2007. This represented an improvement from
11.5% in 2006 when adjusted for business disposals.

Performance Review continued
Western Europe (continued)
We made good progress in simplifying the business including the
integration of the separate units in each country and the
formation of ‘multi-country organisations’. This has enabled faster
decision making and more efﬁcient operations. The European
supply chain transformation is progressing well; so far, we have
announced restructuring plans at twenty factories together with
additional capital investments to increase efﬁciency. The
implementation of a harmonised IT system across the region is
now complete. The portfolio has been further focused with the
sale of the Boursin cheese and Bertolli olive oil businesses.
The UK and the Netherlands, where the change programme is
most advanced, performed well during 2008. In France, Spain and
Germany markets were difﬁcult, with branded products losing
ground to private label. Across the region there was strong
innovation-led growth in deodorants and oral care and price-
driven growth in spreads and dressings.
The operating margin beneﬁted from proﬁts on disposals. On an
underlying basis there was an improvement of 0.7 percentage
points. Gross margins were lower as a result of the
unprecedented increases in commodity costs, but this was more
than offset by lower overhead costs and the beneﬁts of spending
efﬁciency programmes.

current rates of exchange fell by 12.5%, after including an
adverse currency movement of 0.3%. The underlying
performance of the business after eliminating these exchange
translation effects and the impact of acquisitions and disposals is
discussed below at constant exchange rates.
The region sustained its improving trend in 2007 with underlying
sales growth of 1.8% for the year. The improvement was driven
by relentless focus on better in-market execution, rejuvenation of
the quality and value of our core products, and an introduction of
new innovations. Consumer demand in our categories was steady
throughout the year.
Overall we saw improving trends almost everywhere. All major
countries grew in the year, including the UK, Germany, Italy
and the Netherlands. In France sales were slightly up in a
challenging market.
The operating margin, at 11.7%, reﬂected a higher net charge for
restructuring, disposals and one-off items compared with 2006.
Before these items, the operating margin showed an underlying
improvement of 1.3 percentage points, driven by lower overheads
as a result of the One Unilever programme and reduced
advertising and promotions costs.
We made substantial progress with portfolio development
and restructuring.
We formed four new multi-country organisations and announced
the streamlining or closure of ten factories.
We continued to target innovations mainly at Vitality
opportunities. In ice cream, we introduced Frusì frozen yoghurt
with wholegrain cereals and real fruit pieces and low calorie Solero
smoothies. Lipton Linea slimming teas were launched in France,
Switzerland and Portugal. Growth in Hellmann’s was boosted by
new extra light mayonnaise with citrus ﬁbre technology.
The new Dove pro

Report of the Directors
The Americas (continued)
Underlying sales grew by 6.5% for the year driven by pricing
actions taken to recover commodity cost increases. Trading
conditions deteriorated towards the end of the year, with a drop
in consumer conﬁdence and purchasing power and a reduction of
trade inventories. Despite this more difﬁcult environment
consumers continued to spend on our brands and underlying
sales growth was sustained, although volumes were lower.
Underlying sales growth in the US was 3.8% for the year. Our
sales were very much in line with the markets. While there was
some down-trading from branded products to private label
brands our own market shares held up well. Growth in Latin
America was around 12% for the year. All key countries
contributed well to this growth as we beneﬁted from our
established brands and the breadth of our portfolio.
The move to a single head ofﬁce for the US in Englewood Cliffs
was completed and the ice cream business was integrated. We
set up a new multi-country organisation made up of the US,
Canada, and the Caribbean. We believe this will enable us to
build scale, drive efﬁciencies and enhance our capabilities across
these countries during 2009. The reshaping of the portfolio
continued with the disposals of Lawry’s seasonings and spices and
the North American laundry business. We signed agreements with
Starbucks to include Tazo ready-to-drink tea in the Pepsi-Lipton
joint venture and for the manufacture, marketing and distribution
of Starbucks ice cream in the US and Canada.
The operating margin was boosted by proﬁts on disposals. On an
underlying basis the operating margin was in line with last year as
overheads savings fully offset a lower gross margin from the sharp
input cost increases.

after eliminating these exchange translation effects and the

constant exchange rates.
Underlying sales grew by 4.1% in the year, with an increasing
contribution from pricing which was up 2.6% for the year.
In the US, overall consumer demand held up well in our
categories. Market growth in home care and personal care slowed
somewhat in the second half of the year, but this was
compensated for by robust demand in foods. Our own sales in
the US grew solidly, up 3.2% for the year, despite lower sales of
ice cream.
Our business in Mexico made good progress in the second half of
the year and Brazil showed an improved performance in the
fourth quarter. Argentina, Andina and Central America performed
well throughout.
The operating margin, at 14.7% for the year, was 1.1 percentage
points lower than the previous year. Before the impact of
restructuring, disposals and one-off items, the margin was 0.4
percentage points lower than last year. This was due to an
increase in advertising and promotions and the impact of
substantial cost increases, which were not fully offset by price
increases and savings programmes.
The One Unilever programme simpliﬁed operations throughout
the region. Argentina, Mexico and Brazil all moved to single head
ofﬁces. Sales force integration took place in a number of
countries. A single SAP system was implemented in the US, with
Latin America already on one system.
We set up a joint venture with Perdigão to develop our heart-
health margarine Becel in Brazil and disposed of our local Brazilian
margarine brands.
New varieties of Knorr bouillons and soups in Latin America
further advanced the brand’s Vitality credentials. Hellmann’s
mayonnaise ‘real’ campaign highlighted its simple ingredients
which are naturally rich in omega-3, in both the US and Latin
America. In the US, we introduced Promise Activ SuperShots, a
Vitality shot with added natural plant sterols, ingredients that are
clinically proven to help actively remove cholesterol as part of a
diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol.
Innovation in personal care reﬂected the more global approach.
Clear anti-dandruff shampoo was successfully launched in Brazil,
while the Dove pro
•
age range of skin care, deodorants and
shampoos was introduced in the US at the same time as in
Europe. In laundry, the Dirt is Good platform continued to build

Underlying sales growth of 14.2% in 2008 was broad-based
across countries and categories. Our top ﬁve Developing and
Emerging market countries in the region grew by around 20%,
from a combination of increased prices and higher volumes.
Towards the end of the year underlying sales growth remained
strong but volumes were ﬂat with some countries seeing signs of
a slow-down in consumption and a reduction in inventories by
retailers.
Throughout the year we saw continued strong growth in India
and Indonesia, both countries where we have tremendous scale.
In these countries we are beneﬁting from portfolios which span
higher and lower price tiers and from extensive micro-marketing
tailored to faster growing areas and channels. Our business in
China also grew well throughout the year.
The One Unilever organisation is in place throughout the region
and the move to a single SAP system is progressing to plan.
Supply chain management is being centralised in Singapore.
In April we acquired Inmarko, the leading ice cream company in
Russia, and it has performed strongly with both sales and proﬁts
ahead of plan. We reshaped our portfolio in Côte d’Ivoire with
the completion of the disposal of our palm oil business and the
acquisition of soap brands in the same country.
On an underlying basis the operating margin was 0.2 percentage
points below last year reﬂecting increased investment in building
capabilities to drive growth and the sharp increases in input costs
partly offset by the beneﬁts of savings programmes.

both the vibrancy of these markets and the high priority we place
on building our business in the region. It included a healthy
balance of volume and price, up by over 7% and 3% respectively.
Growth was consistent throughout the year and was broad-based
across categories and countries, including established markets
such as India, Indonesia, the Philippines, South Africa and Turkey,
which all grew in double digits; signiﬁcant product areas such as
laundry and personal wash; and emerging product areas like ice
cream and deodorants. China grew strongly for the third

We drove growth across all income levels, from highly affordable
packs to premium positions. This was supported by new brands
and products and excellent in-market execution.
The operating margin, at 12.8%, was 1.3 percentage points
higher than last year. This included the €214 million accounting
proﬁt resulting from the reorganisation of our shareholdings in
South Africa. Before the effects of this transaction, disposals and

The Moo range of ice creams was extended throughout the
region. Knorr seasonings were rejuvenated with premium
ingredients, and in China we launched a new form of Knorr

Financial Review
Finance and liquidity
Unilever aims to be in the top third of a reference group including
20 other international consumer goods companies for Total
Shareholder Return, as explained on page 43. The Group’s
ﬁnancial strategy supports this objective and provides the ﬁnancial
ﬂexibility to meet its strategic and day-to-day needs. The key
elements of the ﬁnancial strategy are:
• appropriate access to equity and debt capital;
• sufﬁcient ﬂexibility for acquisitions that we fund out of current
cash ﬂows;
• A+/A1 long-term credit rating;
• A1/P1 short-term credit rating;
• sufﬁcient resilience against economic and ﬁnancial turmoil; and
• optimal weighted average cost of capital, given the constraints
above.
Unilever aims to concentrate cash in the parent and ﬁnance
companies in order to ensure maximum ﬂexibility in meeting
changing business needs. Operating subsidiaries are ﬁnanced
through a mixture of retained earnings, third-party borrowings
and loans from parent and group ﬁnancing companies that is
most appropriate to the particular country and business
concerned. Unilever maintains access to global debt markets
through an infrastructure of short-term debt programmes
(principally US domestic and euro commercial paper programmes)
and long-term debt programmes (principally a US Shelf
registration and euromarket Debt Issuance Programme). Debt in
the international markets is, in general, issued in the name of NV,
PLC, Unilever Finance International BV or Unilever Capital
Corporation. NV and PLC will normally guarantee such debt
where they are not the issuer.
Thanks to an active ﬁnancial management, Unilever’s ﬁnancing
position has not been materially affected by the unprecedented
economic turmoil. We have tightened our counterparty limits and
monitored closely all our exposures. During 2008 we did not
suffer any material counterparty exposure loss. We have managed
our commercial paper maturity in such a way as to reduce
reﬁnancing risks and to avoid potential liquidity issues. We have
been able to raise debt at competitive rates.
Unilever has committed credit facilities in place to support
its commercial paper programmes and for general corporate
purposes. The undrawn committed credit facilities in place on 31
December 2008 were US $6.205 billion, out of which bilateral
committed credit facilities totalled US $4.230 billion, bilateral
money market commitments totalled US $1.775 billion and
bilateral notes commitments totalled US $0.200 billion. Further
details regarding these facilities are given in note 17 on page 109.
On 21 February 2008 we issued Swiss franc notes to the value of
CHF 600 million (€360 million) in two tranches: CHF 250 million
with an interest rate of 3.125% and maturing in January 2012,
and CHF 350 million at 3.5% maturing in March 2015. On
21 May 2008 we issued €750 million ﬁxed-rate notes with a
coupon rate of 4.875%, repayable in 2013. On 11 November
2008 we issued Swiss franc notes to the value of CHF 400 million
with an interest rate of 3.625%, maturing in December 2011.
We made partial repayments of the US $ Floating Rate extendible
Notes due in 2009 amounting to US $215 million (on 11 August
2008) and US $105 million (on 11 September 2008). On 12
September 2008 we repaid South African 10.2% bonds of ZAR 1
billion. During the fourth quarter, we made a partial repayment of
the US $ Floating Rate extendible Notes due in 2009 amounting to
US $20 million (on 11 December 2008).
The main source of liquidity continues to be cash generated from
operations. Unilever is satisﬁed that its ﬁnancing arrangements are
adequate to meet its working capital needs for the foreseeable
future.
The currency distribution of total ﬁnancial liabilities before the
currency leg of currency derivatives relating to intra-group loans
was as follows: 46% in US dollars (2007: 45%), and 27% in euros
(2007: 27%), with the remainder spread across a number of
countries.
Unilever manages interest rate and currency exposures based on the
net debt position. Taking into account the various cross-currency
swaps and other derivatives, 91% of Unilever’s net debt was in US
dollars (2007: 61%) and 18% in sterling (2007: (18)%) offset by
(33)% of ﬁnancial assets in euros (2007: 32%), with the remainder
spread over a large number of other currencies.
Treasury
Unilever Treasury’s role is to ensure that appropriate ﬁnancing is
available for all value-creating investments. Additionally, Treasury
delivers ﬁnancial services to allow operating companies to manage
their ﬁnancial transactions and exposures in an efﬁcient, timely and
low-cost manner.
Unilever Treasury operates as a service centre and is governed by
policies and plans approved by the Boards. In addition to policies,
guidelines and exposure limits, a system of authorities and extensive
independent reporting covers all major areas of activity.
Performance is monitored closely. Reviews are undertaken by the
corporate internal audit function.
The key ﬁnancial instruments used by Unilever are short- and long-
term borrowings, cash and cash equivalents, and certain
straightforward derivative instruments, principally comprising
interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts. The accounting
for derivative instruments is discussed in note 17 on page 110. The
use of leveraged instruments is not permitted.
Other relevant disclosures are given in notes 15, 16 and 17 on
pages 103, 105 and 108.
Unilever Treasury manages a variety of market risks, including the
effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and
liquidity. Further details of the management of these risks are given
in note 17 on page 108 to 110. Financial Review continued

Goodwill and intangibles at 31 December 2008 were €0.7 billion
lower than in 2007, as a result of currency movements and
acquisition and disposal activity. Property, plant and equipment
was slightly lower than last year at €6.0 billion. The decrease in
other non-current assets is mainly due to a reduction in funded
pension schemes in surplus.
The overall net liability for all pension arrangements was €3.4
billion at the end of 2008, up from €1.1 billion at the end of
2007. Funded schemes showed an aggregate deﬁcit of €1.4
billion and unfunded arrangements a liability of €2.0 billion. The
increase in the overall balance sheet liability was largely due to
falls in asset values on world markets, partly offset by higher
discount rates for liabilities.
Inventories were at a similar level to the end of 2007, and trade
receivables were lower by around €0.4 billion. Cash and cash
equivalents were €1.5 billion higher than the prior year, reﬂecting
the decision to maintain strong liquidity and the proceeds of the
sale of the Bertolli olive oil business.
Current liabilities rose slightly to €13.8 billion as a result of
€0.6 billion higher ﬁnancial liabilities partially offset by a decrease
of €0.2 billion in trade payables and other current liabilities and
€0.2 billion lower provisions.
Non-current liabilities rose by €1.0 billion compared with 2007.
The increase in pension liabilities was partly offset by a reduction
in deferred tax liabilities of €0.4 billion, while ﬁnancial liabilities
rose by €0.9 billion.
The increase in ﬁnancial liabilities resulted from bonds issued
during the year, partially offset by debt repayments, as detailed on
page 35.
Total shareholders’ equity fell by €2.4 billion in the year. Net
proﬁt added €5.3 billion, but was partly offset by currency and
fair value/actuarial losses of €4.2 billion. Dividends paid in the
year totalled €2.1 billion and there was a €1.4 billion movement
in treasury stock, largely explained by the share buy-back
programme of €1.5 billion.
Unilever’s contractual obligations at the end of 2008 included
capital expenditure commitments, borrowings, lease commitments
and other commitments. A summary of certain contractual
obligations at 31 December 2008 is provided in the table below.

Off-balance sheet arrangements
SIC interpretation 12 ‘Consolidation-Special Purpose Entities’
(SIC 12) requires that entities with which we have relationships
are considered for consolidation in the consolidated accounts
based on relative sharing of economic risks and rewards rather
than based solely on share ownership and voting rights. We
periodically review our contractual arrangements with potential
special purpose entities (SPEs) as deﬁned by SIC 12. The most
recent review has concluded that that there are no signiﬁcant SPE
relationships which are not already appropriately reﬂected in the
accounts. Information concerning guarantees given by the Group
is stated in note 25 on page 125.

Cash and cash equivalents increased by €2.2 billion when
translated at average 2008 exchange rates. After recognising
the changes in exchange rates, amounts in the balance sheet
at 31 December 2008 were €1.5 billion higher than at
31 December 2007. Net cash ﬂow from operating activities, at
€3.9 billion, was at a similar level to 2007. Lower cash cost of
pensions more than offset higher restructuring charges and a
€0.2 billion increase in working capital. Tax paid was also €0.1
billion higher, resulting from additional one-off tax payments in
2008.
The increase of €2.0 billion in net cash ﬂow from investing
activities when compared with 2007 is explained by the signiﬁcant
level of completed disposal activity in the year.
Cash ﬂows associated with ﬁnancing activities included payment
of dividends of €2.1 billion in 2008 and €2.2 billion in 2007. In
addition, €1.5 billion was returned to shareholders in both 2007
and 2008 in the form of share buy-backs.
At 31 December 2008, the net debt position was €8.0 billion, a
decrease of €0.3 billion compared with 2007. Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008 37

no provision for the amount of this dividend, estimated as
€1.3 billion, has been recognised in the ﬁnancial statements for
the year ended 31 December 2008. Share buy-back programmes
of €1.5 billion were completed in both 2007 and 2008.
Unilever’s combined market capitalisation fell signiﬁcantly from
€72.5 billion at the end of 2007 to €46.9 billion at 31 December
2008, reﬂecting wider trends in stock market values arising from
the economic turbulence that existed through much of 2008.
Pensions investment strategy
The Group’s investment strategy in respect of its funded
pension plans is implemented within the framework of the
various statutory requirements of the territories where the
plans are based. The Group has developed policy guidelines for
the allocation of assets to different classes with the objective of
controlling risk and maintaining the right balance between risk
and long-term returns in order to limit the cost to the Group of
the beneﬁts provided. To achieve this, investments are well
diversiﬁed, such that the failure of any single investment would
not have a material impact on the overall level of assets. The
plans invest the largest proportion of the assets in equities, which
the Group believes offer the best returns over the long term
commensurate with an acceptable level of risk. The pension funds
also have a proportion of assets invested in property, bonds,
hedge funds and cash. The majority of the assets are managed by
a number of external fund managers with a small proportion
managed in-house. Unilever has a pooled investment vehicle
(Univest) which it believes offers its pension plans around the
world a simpliﬁed externally managed investment vehicle to
implement their strategic asset allocation models currently for
equities and hedge funds. The aim is to provide a high quality,
well diversiﬁed risk controlled vehicle.
Total cash costs of pensions are expected to be around
€1.0 billion in 2009 (2008 actual: €0.8 billion). In 2009 the
net ﬁnancing costs for pensions and similar obligations is
expected to be a charge of between €150 million and
€200 million. This compares with a credit of €143 million
in 2008.
Acquisitions and disposals
2008
With effect from 1 January 2008, we entered into an expanded
international partnership with PepsiCo for the marketing and
distribution of ready-to-drink tea products under the Lipton
brand.
On 3 January 2008 we completed the sale of the Boursin brand
to Le Groupe Bel for €400 million. The turnover of this brand in
2007 was approximately €100 million.
On 2 April 2008 we completed the acquisition of Inmarko,
the leading Russian ice cream company. The company had a
turnover in 2007 of approximately €115 million.
On 31 July 2008 we completed the sale of our Lawry’s and
Adolph’s branded seasoning blends and marinades business in
the US and Canada to McCormick & Company, Incorporated for
€410 million. The combined annual turnover of the business in
2007 was approximately €100 million.
On 9 September 2008 we completed the sale of our North
American laundry business in the US, Canada and Puerto Rico
to Vestar Capital Partners, a leading global private equity ﬁrm, for
consideration of approximately US $1.45 billion, consisting mainly
of cash along with preferred shares and warrants. These
businesses had a combined turnover in 2007 of approximately US
$1.0 billion.
On 5 November 2008 we completed the sale of Komili, our olive
oil brand in Turkey, to Ana Gida, part of the Anadolu Group.
On 4 December 2008 we completed the sale of our edible oil
business in Côte d’Ivoire, together with our interests in local oil
palm plantations Palmci and PHCI, to SIFCA, the parent company
of an Ivorian agro-industry group, and to a 50:50 joint venture
between two Singapore-based companies, Wilmar International
Limited and Olam International Limited. At the same time we
acquired the soap business of Cosmivoire, a subsidiary of SIFCA.
On 23 December 2008 we completed the disposal of our Bertolli
olive oil and vinegar business to Grupo SOS for a consideration of
€630 million. The transaction was structured as a worldwide
perpetual licence by Unilever of the Bertolli brand in respect of
olive oil and premium vinegar. The transaction included the sale of
the Italian Maya, Dante and San Giorgio olive oil and seed oil
businesses, as well as the factory at Inveruno, Italy.
2007
During 2007 we reached agreement with our partners in South
Africa and Israel to exchange respective shareholdings such that
Unilever now owns 74.25% of a newly combined South African
entity and 100% of Unilever Israel. The share swaps were effected
as at 1 October 2007 and as a result we recognised a gain on
disposal of €214 million. Financial Review continued
38 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Report of the Directors
On 1 January 2007 Unilever completed the restructuring of its
Portuguese businesses. The result of the reorganisation is that
Unilever now has a 55% share of the combined Portuguese
entity, called Unilever Jerónimo Martins. The combined business
includes the foods and home and personal care businesses. The
remaining 45% is held by Jerónimo Martins Group. The structure
of the agreement is such that there is joint control of the newly
formed entity and therefore it is accounted for by Unilever as a
joint venture.
Other business disposals in 2007 involved the sale of local
Brazilian margarine brands. To further develop our heart health
brand margarine Becel in Brazil we established a joint venture
with Perdigão.
In 2007 we purchased minority interests in several countries,
including Greece and India.
2006
On 4 September 2006 Unilever announced a public offer to
purchase all ordinary shares of Elais-Unilever S.A. held by third
party shareholders. Elais-Unilever S.A. was reported as a subsidiary
and is Unilever’s main foods business in Greece. The offer price
was €24.50 per share, with the public offer closing on 25 October
2006. A total of 2 234 692 shares were purchased by the end of
2006, increasing Unilever’s ownership of Elais-Unilever S.A.
to 83.52%. This shareholding was increased to 99.2% as at
31 December 2007.
On 3 November 2006 we announced the completion of the sale
of the majority of our frozen foods businesses in Europe to the
Permira Funds. Unilever received proceeds of €1.7 billion, and
recorded a proﬁt on disposal of €1.2 billion. The businesses sold
included operations in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland,
the Netherlands, Portugal and the United Kingdom.
In 2006 we disposed of various other businesses and brands with
a combined turnover of around €280 million, including Mora in
the Netherlands and Belgium, Finesse in North America and Nihar
in India.
Signiﬁcant events after the balance sheet date
On 26 January 2009 we announced that we had signed an
agreement to acquire the global TIGI professional hair product
business and its supporting advanced education academies for a
cash consideration of US $411.5 million. The deal is subject to
regulatory approval and is expected to be completed by the end
of March 2009.
On 12 February 2009 Unilever issued a bond composed of two
senior notes: US $750 million 3.65% ﬁxed-rate note which will
mature in ﬁve years and US $750 million 4.80% ﬁxed-rate note
which will mature in ten years.
Critical accounting policies
The accounts presented comply in all material respects with IFRS
as adopted by the EU and with UK and Dutch law. They are also
in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board. To prepare these accounts, we are required to
make estimates and assumptions, using judgement based on
available information, including historical experience. We believe
these estimates and assumptions are reasonable and we re-
evaluate them on an ongoing basis. However, actual amounts and
results could differ. Critical accounting policies are those which
are most important to the portrayal of Unilever’s ﬁnancial position
and results of operations. Some of these policies require difﬁcult,
subjective or complex judgements from management, the most
important being:
Goodwill and intangible assets
Impairment reviews in respect of goodwill and indeﬁnite-lived
intangible assets are performed at least annually. More regular
reviews, and impairment reviews in respect of other assets, are
performed if events indicate that this is necessary. Impairment
reviews are performed by comparing the carrying value of the
asset concerned to that asset’s recoverable amount (being the
higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell). Value in use
is a valuation derived from discounted future cash ﬂows. The
most important assumptions when preparing these forecast cash
ﬂows are long-term growth rates and discount rates. These are
challenged at least annually and although these are believed to be
appropriate, changes in these assumptions could change the
outcomes of the impairment reviews.
The most signiﬁcant balances of goodwill and intangible assets
relate to the global savoury and dressings sub-product group.
We have reviewed the carrying value of this cash generating unit
by considering expected future cash ﬂows based on historical
experience and planned growth rates and margins for this
product group.
Please refer also to note 9 on page 97.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are classiﬁed according to the purpose for
which the instruments were acquired. This gives rise to the
following classes: held-to-maturity investments, loans and
receivables, available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets, and ﬁnancial assets
at fair value through proﬁt or loss. Please refer to note 1 on pages
85 and 86 for a description of each of these categories.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments are reported at fair value, with
changes in fair values booked through proﬁt or loss unless the
derivatives are designated and effective as hedges of future cash
ﬂows, in which case the changes are recognised directly in equity.
At the time the hedged cash ﬂow results in the recognition of an
asset or a liability, the associated gains or losses on the derivative
that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the
initial measurement of the asset or liability. For hedged items that
do not result in the recognition of an asset or liability, amounts
deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the
same period in which the hedged item affects net proﬁt or loss.
Changes in fair value of net investment hedges in relation to
foreign subsidiaries are recognised directly in equity. Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008 39
Report of the Directors

Pensions and similar obligations
The assets and liabilities of pension plans are recognised at fair
values in the balance sheet.
Pension accounting requires certain assumptions to be made in
order to value our obligations and to determine the charges to
be made to the income statement. These ﬁgures are particularly
sensitive to assumptions for discount rates, inﬂation rates,
mortality rates and expected long-term rates of return on assets.
Information about sensitivity to certain of these assumptions is
given in note 20 on page 115 and 116.
The following table sets out these assumptions (except for
mortality rates), as at 31 December 2008, in respect of the four
largest Unilever pension plans. Further details of assumptions
(including mortality rates) made are given in note 20 on
page 117.

These assumptions are set by reference to market conditions at
the valuation date. Actual experience may differ from the
assumptions made. The effects of such differences are recognised
through the statement of recognised income and expense.
Demographic assumptions, such as mortality rates, are set having
regard to the latest trends in life expectancy, plan experience and
other relevant data. The assumptions are reviewed and updated
as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of the
pension plans. Mortality assumptions for the four largest plans
are given in more detail in note 20 on page 117.
Provisions
Provision is made, amongst other reasons, for legal matters,
disputed indirect taxes, employee termination costs and
restructuring where a legal or constructive obligation exists at the
balance sheet date and a reliable estimate can be made of the
likely outcome.
Taxation
Full provision is made for deferred and current taxation at the
rates of tax prevailing at the year end unless future rates have
been substantively enacted, as detailed in note 12 on page 102.
Deferred tax assets are regularly reviewed for recoverability, and a
valuation allowance is established to the extent that recoverability
is not considered likely. Financial Review continued

Report of the Directors
Non-GAAP measures
Certain discussions and analyses set out in this Annual Report
and Accounts include measures which are not deﬁned by
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) such as IFRS.
We believe this information, along with comparable GAAP
measurements, is useful to investors because it provides a
basis for measuring our operating performance, ability to retire
debt and invest in new business opportunities. Our management
uses these ﬁnancial measures, along with the most directly
comparable GAAP ﬁnancial measures, in evaluating our operating
performance and value creation. Non-GAAP ﬁnancial measures
should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for,
ﬁnancial information presented in compliance with GAAP .
Non-GAAP ﬁnancial measures as reported by us may not be
comparable with similarly titled amounts reported by other
companies.
In the following sections we set out our deﬁnitions of the
following non-GAAP measures and provide reconciliations to
relevant GAAP measures:
• Ungeared free cash ﬂow;
• Return on invested capital;
• Underlying sales growth; and
• Net debt.
We set out ‘Measures of long-term value creation’ as an
introduction to the following section, in order to explain the
relevance of the above measures. At the end of this section we
summarise the impact on Total Shareholder Return (TSR) which is
a key metric.
Measures of long-term value creation
Unilever’s ambition for the creation of value for shareholders is
measured by Total Shareholder Return over a rolling three-year
period compared with a peer group of 20 other international
consumer goods companies.
Unilever believes that the contribution of the business to this
objective can best be measured and communicated to investors
through the following measures:
• The delivery, over time, of Ungeared Free Cash Flow (UFCF),
which expresses the translation of proﬁt into cash, and thus
longer-term economic value; and
• The development, over time, of Return on Invested Capital
(ROIC), which expresses the returns generated on capital
invested in the Group.
Unilever communicates progress against these measures
annually, and management remuneration is aligned with these
objectives. The UFCF over a three-year period is incorporated as a
performance element of Unilever’s management incentive
scheme.
UFCF and ROIC are non-GAAP measures. We comment on these
in detail here since they are the way in which we communicate
our ambition and monitor progress towards our longer-term value
creation goals and in order to:
• improve transparency for investors;
• assist investors in their assessment of the long-term value
of Unilever;
• ensure that the measures are fully understood in the light of
how Unilever reviews long-term value creation for shareholders;
• properly deﬁne the metrics used and conﬁrm their calculation;
• share the metrics with all investors at the same time; and
• disclose UFCF as it is one of the drivers of management
remuneration and therefore management behaviour.
As investor measures, we believe that there are no GAAP
measures directly comparable with UFCF and ROIC. However,
in the tables on pages 41 and 42, we reconcile each as follows:
UFCF to cash ﬂow from operating activities and also to net proﬁt;
ROIC to net proﬁt.
Caution
Unilever cautions that, while UFCF and ROIC are widely used as
tools for investment analysis, they are not deﬁned terms under
IFRS or other GAAP and therefore their deﬁnitions should be
carefully reviewed and understood by investors. Investors should
be aware that their application may vary in practice and therefore
these measures may not be fully comparable between companies.
In particular:
• We recognise that the usefulness of UFCF and ROIC as
indicators of investment value is limited, as such measures
are based on historical information;
• UFCF and ROIC measures are not intended to be a substitute
for, or superior to, GAAP measures in the ﬁnancial statements;
• The fact that ROIC is a ratio inherently limits its use, and
management uses ROIC only for the purposes discussed above.
The relevance and use of net proﬁt for the year (being the
most relevant comparable GAAP measure) is clearly more
pervasive; and
• UFCF is not the residual cash available to pay dividends but
represents cash generated by the business and broadly available
to the providers of ﬁnance, both debt and equity. Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008 41
Report of the Directors
Financial Review continued
Ungeared free cash ﬂow (UFCF)
UFCF expresses the generation of proﬁt by the business and how this is translated into cash, and thus economic value. It is therefore
not used as a liquidity measure within Unilever. The movement in UFCF is used by Unilever to measure progress against our longer-term
value creation goals as outlined to investors.
UFCF is cash ﬂow from group operating activities, less net capital expenditure, less charges to operating proﬁt for share-based
compensation and pensions, and less tax (adjusted to reﬂect an ungeared position) and for the impact on proﬁt of material business
disposals, but before the ﬁnancing of pensions.
In 2008, UFCF was €3.2 billion (2007: €3.8 billion; 2006: €4.2 billion). The reconciliation of UFCF to the GAAP measures of net proﬁt
and cash ﬂow from operating activities is shown below.
The tax charge used in determining UFCF can be either the income statement tax charge or the actual cash taxes paid. Our consistently
applied deﬁnition uses the income statement tax charge in order to eliminate the impact of volatility due to the variable timing of
payments around the year end. For 2006 the income statement tax charge on this basis was materially impacted by the tax effect of
non-cash charges for the provision for preference shares and certain other non-cash items. UFCF for 2008 based on actual cash tax
paid would have been €3.6 billion (2007: €3.6 billion; 2006: €4.5 billion).

Return on invested capital (ROIC)
ROIC expresses the returns generated on capital invested in the Group. The progression of ROIC is used by Unilever to measure
progress against our longer-term value creation goals outlined to investors.
ROIC is proﬁt after tax but excluding net interest on net debt and impairment of goodwill and indeﬁnite-lived intangible assets both net
of tax, divided by average invested capital for the year. Invested capital is the sum of property, plant and equipment and other non-
current investments, software and ﬁnite-lived intangible assets, working capital, goodwill and indeﬁnite-lived intangible assets at gross
book value and cumulative goodwill written off directly to reserves under an earlier accounting policy.
In 2008, ROIC was 15.7% (2007: 12.7%; 2006: 14.6%). The reconciliation of ROIC to the GAAP measure net proﬁt is shown below.
ROIC is based on total business proﬁt, including proﬁt on business disposals. The impact of such disposals in 2008, 2007 and
2006 was €1.6 billion, €0.3 billion and €1.2 billion respectively. ROIC excluding this impact in 2008 was 11.2% (2007: 11.3%;
2006: 11.5%).

Underlying sales growth (USG)
USG reﬂects the change in revenue from continuing operations at
constant rates of exchange, excluding the effects of acquisitions
and disposals. It is a measure that provides valuable additional
information on the underlying performance of the business.
In particular, it presents the organic growth of our business year
on year and is used internally as a core measure of sales
performance.
The reconciliation of USG to changes in the GAAP measure
turnover is as follows:
2008 2007

Net debt is deﬁned as the excess of total ﬁnancial liabilities,
excluding trade and other payables, over cash, cash equivalents

Total Shareholder Return (TSR)
TSR measures the returns received by a shareholder, capturing
both the increase in share price and the value of dividend income
(assuming dividends are re-invested). Unilever’s TSR performance
is compared with a peer group of competitors over a three-year
rolling performance period. This period is sensitive enough to
reﬂect changes but long enough to smooth out short-term
volatility. The return is expressed in US dollars, based on the
equivalent US dollar share price for NV and PLC. US dollars were
chosen to facilitate comparison with companies in Unilever’s
chosen reference group. The choice of currency affects the
absolute TSR but not the relative ranking.
Unilever’s TSR target is to be in the top third of a reference group
including 20 other international consumer goods companies on a
three-year rolling basis. At the end of 2007 we were positioned
8th, and at the end of 2008 the ranking was 9th. In 2008,
the following companies formed the peer group of comparator
companies:
Avon Kraft

44 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Report of the Directors
Introduction
Unilever aspires to high standards of corporate governance.
We keep our corporate governance arrangements under constant
review. NV and PLC are subject to various corporate governance
requirements and best practice codes, the most relevant being
those in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United
States. It is Unilever’s practice to comply, where practicable, with
the highest level of these codes and respond to developments
appropriately.
The Unilever Group
Unilever N.V. and Unilever PLC are the two parent companies
of the Unilever Group. Together with their respective group
companies, NV and PLC operate effectively as a single economic
entity. This is achieved by a series of agreements between NV and
PLC (the Foundation Agreements, see page 51), together with
special provisions in the Articles of Association of NV and PLC. NV
and PLC have the same Directors and adopt the same accounting
principles. Shareholders of both companies receive dividends on
an equalised basis. NV and PLC and their group companies
constitute a single reporting entity for the purposes of presenting
consolidated accounts. Accordingly, the accounts of the Unilever
Group are presented by both NV and PLC as their respective
consolidated accounts.
NV and PLC have agreed to co-operate in all areas and ensure
that all group companies act accordingly. NV and PLC are holding
and service companies, and the business activity of Unilever is
carried out by their subsidiaries around the world. Shares in group
companies may ultimately be held wholly by either NV or PLC or
by the two companies in varying proportions.
NV was incorporated under the name Naamlooze Vennootschap
Margarine Unie in the Netherlands in 1927. Its objects and
purposes are set out in Article 2 of its Articles of Association.
PLC was incorporated under the name Lever Brothers Limited in
England and Wales in 1894. Its objects and purposes can be
found in Clause 3 of its Memorandum of Association.
Unilever PLC’s Memorandum of Association and Unilever N.V.’s
Articles of Association contain, among other things, the objects
clause which sets out the scope of the activities that PLC and NV
are authorised to undertake. The Memorandum of Association
and Articles of Association are drafted to give a wide scope and
provide that the primary objectives are: to carry on business as a
holding company, to manage any companies in which it has an
interest and to operate and carry into effect the Equalisation
Agreement (see page 51).
The two companies have different shareholder constituencies and
shareholders cannot convert or exchange the shares of one
company for shares of the other. NV is listed in Amsterdam and
New York. PLC is listed in London and New York.
Unilever policies
The implementation of and compliance with our governance
structure is facilitated through a business-orientated policy
framework. Unilever policies are universally applicable within the
Unilever Group. They are mandatory and have been developed to
ensure consistency in all material respects amongst worldwide
operations in key areas. They cover operational and functional
matters, and govern how we run our business, in order to comply
with applicable laws and regulations.
Our internal risk management and control systems are described on
page 28.
Developments in corporate governance
Patrick Cescau retired from Unilever at the end of 2008 and,
following his appointment as a Director in October 2008, Paul
Polman succeeded Patrick Cescau as Chief Executive Ofﬁcer in
January 2009. Paul Polman is the ﬁrst Chief Executive Ofﬁcer
appointed from outside the Unilever Group.
The text that follows describes the corporate governance
arrangements operating within Unilever and the changes anticipated
in 2009. More information on our corporate governance
arrangements is set out in the document entitled ‘The Governance
of Unilever’, the Boards’ statement of their internal arrangements,
which can be found at
www.unilever.com/investorrelations/corp_governance
The Boards
The Boards of NV and PLC comprise the same Directors and have
the same Chairman. This ensures unity of governance and
management by ensuring that all matters are considered by the
Boards as a single intellect, reaching the same conclusions on the
same set of facts, save where speciﬁc local factors apply.
The Boards are one-tier boards, comprising Executive Directors and,
in a majority, Non-Executive Directors. The Boards have ultimate
responsibility for the management, general affairs, direction and
performance of our business as a whole. The responsibility of the
Directors is collective, taking into account their respective roles as
Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors. The Executive
Directors have additional responsibilities for the operation of our
business as determined by the Boards and the Chief Executive
Ofﬁcer.
Our Directors have set out a number of areas of responsibility which
are reserved to the Boards and other areas for which matters are
delegated to the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and committees whose
actions are regularly reported to and monitored by the Boards.
These are described on pages 48 and 49. Further details of how our
Boards effectively operate as one board, govern themselves and
delegate their authorities are set out in the document entitled ‘The
Governance of Unilever’, which can be found at
www.unilever.com/investorrelations/corp_governance Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008 45
Report of the Directors
Corporate governance continued
Appointment of Directors
Directors are normally appointed by shareholders at the AGMs.
In order to facilitate the transition from Patrick Cescau to Paul
Polman, Paul was appointed as an Executive Director at separately
convened shareholder meetings of PLC and NV held on 28 and
29 October 2008 respectively. All existing Directors, unless they
are retiring, submit themselves for re-election every year and
shareholders can remove any of them by a simple majority vote.
For a list of our current Directors and the periods during which
they have served as such, please see pages 18 and 19.
In order to seek to ensure that NV and PLC have the same
Directors, the Articles of Association of NV and PLC contain
provisions which are designed to ensure that both NV and PLC
shareholders are presented with the same candidates for election
as Directors. This is achieved through a nomination procedure
operated by the Boards of NV and PLC through Unilever’s
Nomination Committee.
Based on the evaluation of the Boards, its Committees and its
individual members, the Nomination Committee recommends to
the Boards a list of candidates for nomination at the AGMs of
both NV and PLC. In addition, since 2006 shareholders of the
companies have been able to nominate Directors and to do so
they must put a resolution to both meetings in line with local
requirements. In order to ensure that the Boards remain identical,
anyone being elected as a Director of NV must also be elected as
a Director of PLC and vice versa. If an individual fails to be elected
to both companies then he or she will be unable to take their
place on the Boards.
The provisions in the Articles of Association for appointing
Directors cannot be changed without the permission, in the case
of NV, of the holders of the special ordinary shares numbered
1 - 2400 inclusive and, in the case of PLC, of the holders of
PLC's deferred stock. The NV special ordinary shares may only be
transferred to one or more other holders of such shares. The
joint holders of both the NV special ordinary shares and the
PLC deferred stock are N.V. Elma and United Holdings Limited,
which are joint subsidiaries of NV and PLC. The boards of N.V.
Elma and United Holdings Limited comprise the members of the
Nomination Committee. The Nomination Committee comprises
Non-Executive Directors of Unilever only.
Board meetings
Our Boards meet at least seven times a year to consider important
corporate events and actions, such as:
• approval of corporate strategy;
• approval of the corporate Annual Plan;
• oversight of the performance of the business;
• review of risks and controls;
• authorisation of major transactions;
• preparation of the Annual Report and Accounts;
• declaration of dividends;
• agreement of quarterly results announcements;
• convening of shareholders’ meetings;
• nominations for Board appointments;
• approval of Board remuneration policy; and
• review of the functioning of the Boards and their Committees.
The following table shows the attendance of Directors at Board
meetings for the year ended 31 December 2008. If Directors are
unable to attend a meeting, they have the opportunity before the
meeting to discuss with the Chairman any agenda items or Board
papers:

*Executive Director
Board meetings are normally held either in London or Rotterdam,
with one or two off site Board meetings a year. The Chairman is
assisted by the Group Secretary, who ensures that the Boards are
supplied with all the information necessary for their deliberations.
The Chairman and the Group Secretary involve the Senior
Independent Director (see page 47) in the arrangements for Board
meetings.
Board induction and training
Upon election, Directors receive a comprehensive Directors’
Manual and are briefed thoroughly on their responsibilities and
our business. Updates on corporate governance developments
and investor relations matters are frequent agenda items at Board
meetings. Ongoing training is provided for Directors by way of
site visits, presentations, circulated updates, teach-ins at Board or
Board committee meetings on, among other things, Unilever’s
business, environmental, social and corporate governance,
regulatory developments and investor relations matters. In 2008,
Board meetings were held at the ofﬁces of Hindustan Unilever in
Mumbai which included a visit to local retail outlets and the
Bangalore Research and Development Centre and in Unilever’s
operations in New York which included trade visits and a visit to
the New Jersey Customer Insight and Innovation Centre.
Board evaluation
The evaluation process of our Boards consists of an internal three-
year cycle with an independent third-party evaluation carried out
if the Boards consider appropriate. The last time an independent
third-party evaluation was carried out was in 2006. In 2007 and Corporate governance continued
46 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Report of the Directors
2008 the Chairman, in conjunction with the Senior Independent
Director, conducted the internal evaluation process. An extensive
questionnaire for all Board members formed part of the
evaluation process. In addition, the Chairman conducted a
process of evaluating the performance of each individual Board
member, including an interview with each. The evaluation of the
performance of the Chairman was led by the Senior Independent
Director.
Committees of the Boards evaluate themselves under supervision
of their respective chairmen taking into account the views of
respective committee members and the Boards.
The results of the various evaluations were discussed by the
Boards and changes were made in respect of Board practices and
processes where considered necessary.
Board support
The Group Secretary is available to advise all Directors and ensure
that Board procedures are complied with. The Boards have the
power to appoint and remove the Group Secretary.
A procedure is in place to enable Directors, if they so wish, to
seek independent professional advice at Unilever’s expense.
Board changes
The current Directors, with their biographies, are shown on
pages 18 and 19.
Geneviève Berger, Leon Brittan, Wim Dik, Charles Golden, Byron
Grote, Narayana Murthy, Hixonia Nyasulu, David Simon, Kees
Storm, Michael Treschow and Jeroen van der Veer were re-elected
as Non-Executive Directors of NV and PLC at the 2008 AGMs.
On 1 July 2008 Geneviève Berger stepped down from the Boards
as a Non-Executive Director to join the Unilever Executive team as
Chief Research and Development Ofﬁcer. Paul Polman became an
Executive Director on 29 October 2008 and, following an orderly
transition, took over from Patrick Cescau on 1 January 2009 as
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer.
At the 2008 AGMs, Kees van der Graaf and Ralph Kugler stepped
down from the Boards, and Jim Lawrence was appointed an
Executive Director to those Boards following his appointment as
Chief Financial Ofﬁcer in September 2007.
At the 2009 AGMs all current Executive and Non-Executive
Directors will be nominated for re-election, except David Simon
who will be retiring as a Non-Executive Director at the end of our
2009 AGMs after three terms of three years. During that time he
has served as our Vice Chairman, Senior Independent Director
and Chairman of our Nomination and Remuneration Committees.
It is intended that David will be succeeded in those roles by
Jeroen van der Veer, with effect from the conclusion of the 2009
AGMs.
Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer
Unilever has a separate independent Non-Executive Chairman and
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer. There is a clear division of responsibilities
between their roles. The Chairman is primarily responsible for
leadership of the Boards, ensuring their effectiveness and setting
their agendas. He is also responsible for ensuring that the Boards
receive accurate, timely and clear information.
The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer has been entrusted, within the
parameters set out in the Articles of Association of NV and PLC
and in the document entitled ‘The Governance of Unilever’, with
all the Boards’ powers, authorities and discretions in relation to
the operational management of Unilever. The Chief Executive
Ofﬁcer has the authority to determine which duties regarding the
operational management of the companies and their business
enterprises will be carried out under his responsibility by one or
more Executive Directors or by one or more other persons. This
provides a basis for the Unilever Executive team (UEx) that is
chaired by and reports to the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer. For UEx
members’ biographies see page 58. For our business structure,
please refer to ‘About Unilever’ on pages 21 and 22.
Executive Directors
All Executive Directors are members of the UEx.
The Executive Directors are full-time employees of Unilever.
Information about their remuneration can be found in the report
of the Remuneration Committee on pages 60 to 73 and on our
website at www.unilever.com/investorrelations/corp_governance
The Remuneration Committee takes the view that the entitlement
of the Executive Directors to the security of twelve months’ notice
of termination of employment is in line with both the practice of
many comparable companies and the entitlement of other senior
executives within Unilever. It is our policy to set the level of
severance payments for Executive Directors at no more than one
year’s salary, unless the Boards, at the proposal of the
Remuneration Committee, ﬁnd this unreasonable given the
circumstances or unless dictated by applicable law.
The Executive Directors submit themselves for re-election at the
AGMs each year. The Nomination Committee carefully considers
each nomination for reappointment.
Executive Directors stop holding executive ofﬁce on ceasing to be
Directors. Executive Directors retire between the ages of 60 and
65, as decided by either them or Unilever.
We do not grant our Executive Directors any personal loans or
guarantees.
There are no family relationships between any of our Executive
Directors, other key management personnel or Non-Executive
Directors. None of our Executive Directors or other key
management personnel are elected or appointed under any
arrangement or understanding, either with any major shareholder,
customer, supplier or otherwise. Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008 47
Report of the Directors
Corporate governance continued
Outside Appointments
Unilever recognises the beneﬁt to the individual and to the Group
of involvement by Unilever Executives acting as directors of other
companies outside the Unilever Group, broadening their
experience and knowledge. The number of outside directorships
of listed companies is generally limited to one per individual. In
the case of publicly listed companies approval is required from the
Chairman. Outside directorships must not involve an excessive
commitment or conﬂict of interest. Unilever Executives must at all
times ensure that their time commitment to Unilever takes
precedence over any outside directorship. Fees paid in connection
with an outside directorship may be retained by the individual,
reﬂecting that any outside directorship is for the responsibility of
the individual and that Unilever takes no responsibility in this
regard.
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors share responsibility for the execution
of the Boards’ duties, taking into account their speciﬁc
responsibilities, which are essentially supervisory. In particular,
they comprise the principal external presence in the governance
of Unilever, and provide a strong independent element. See
pages 18 and 19 for their biographies.
Role and Responsibility
The key elements of the role and responsibilities of our Non-
Executive Directors are:
• supervision of and advice to the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer;
• developing strategy with the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer;
• scrutiny of performance of the business and Chief Executive
Ofﬁcer;
• oversight of risks and controls;
• reporting of performance;
• remuneration of and succession planning for Executive
Directors; and
• governance and compliance.
Our Non-Executive Directors are chosen for their broad and
relevant experience and international outlook, as well as their
independence. They form the Audit Committee, the Nomination
Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the Corporate
Responsibility and Reputation Committee. The roles and
membership of these key Board committees are described
on pages 48 and 49. The proﬁle set by the Boards for the
Non-Executive Directors and the schedule used for orderly
succession planning can be found on our website at
www.unilever.com/investorrelations/corp_governance
Meetings
The Non-Executive Directors meet as a group, without the
Executive Directors present, under the leadership of the
Chairman. In 2008 they met ﬁve times. In addition, the Non-
Executive Directors (including the Chairman) usually meet before
each Board meeting with the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, the Chief
Financial Ofﬁcer, other senior executives and the Group Secretary.
Senior Independent Director
Our Non-Executive Directors have appointed David Simon as
Senior Independent Director. He acts as their spokesman. The
Senior Independent Director is consulted by the Chairman on
the agenda and arrangements for Board meetings. He is also,
in appropriate cases, a point of contact for shareholders and
other stakeholders. Upon David’s retirement, it is intended that he
will be succeeded by Jeroen van der Veer, with effect from the
conclusion of the 2009 AGMs.
Tenure
Our Non-Executive Directors submit themselves for re-election
each year at the AGMs. Their nomination for re-election is subject
to continued good performance which is evaluated by the Boards,
based on the recommendations of the Nomination Committee.
The Nomination Committee carefully considers each nomination
for reappointment. The Non-Executive Directors normally serve for
a maximum of nine years.
Remuneration
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by
the Boards, within the overall limit set by the shareholders at the
AGMs in 2007, and it is reported on page 72. We do not grant
our Non-Executive Directors any personal loans or guarantees nor
are they entitled to any severance payments. Details of the
engagement of our Non-Executive Directors can be seen on the
Unilever website at
www.unilever.com/investorrelations/corp_governance
Other appointments
Non-Executive Directors may serve on boards of other companies,
provided such service does not involve a conﬂict of interest or
restrict their ability to discharge their duties to Unilever.
Independence
Taking into account the role of Non-Executive Directors, which is
essentially supervisory, and the fact that they make up the key
Committees of the Boards, it is important that our Non-Executive
Directors can be considered to be independent.
Our deﬁnition of independence for Directors is set out in the
document entitled ‘The Governance of Unilever’. It is derived from
the applicable deﬁnitions in use in the Netherlands, the UK and
the US. All our current Non-Executive Directors are considered to
be independent of Unilever. Our Boards reached this conclusion
after conducting a thorough review of all relevant relationships of
the Non-Executive Directors, and their related or connected
persons. Leon Brittan has served on the Boards since 2000. The
length of tenure under the Dutch Corporate Governance Code is
set at a maximum of twelve years for non-executive directors.
However, the UK Combined Code on Corporate Governance
suggests that length of tenure is a factor to consider when
determining independence of a non-executive director. The UK
Combined Code also provides that a non-executive director who
serves more than nine years should be subject to annual re-
election and subject to particularly rigorous review. It is our
standard practice for all Directors to seek re-election annually.
Moreover, our annual performance review has concluded that Corporate governance continued
48 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Report of the Directors
Leon Brittan continues to demonstrate the essential characteristics
of independence expected by the Boards. His length of service,
and his resulting experience and knowledge of Unilever, is viewed
by the Boards as being especially valuable, particularly given the
extent of the changes to the Boards in recent years.
A number of relationships, such as non-executive directorships,
exist between various of our Non-Executive Directors and
companies that provide banking, insurance or ﬁnancial advisory
services to Unilever. Our Boards considered in each case the
number of other companies that also provide or could readily
provide such services to Unilever, the signiﬁcance to those
companies of the services they provide to Unilever, the roles
of the Non-Executive Directors within those companies and
the signiﬁcance of those roles to our Non-Executive Directors.
It concluded that none of these relationships impact the
independence of the Non-Executive Directors concerned. The
Boards have formed the view that the fact that David Simon is a
senior adviser of Morgan Stanley International is not material. The
Boards have satisﬁed themselves that the services provided by
Paton Tupper Associates (Pty) Limited and Barloworld Limited, of
which Hixonia Nyasulu is a director and shareholder and director
respectively, to Unilever South Africa is not material. The Boards
further concluded that Narayana Murthy’s directorship of HSBC
Holdings plc, one of Unilever’s preferred banks, is not impacted by
the banking relationship and therefore that he should be
considered independent. The Boards have also satisﬁed
themselves that Leon Brittan’s position at UBS Investment Bank
and UBS Securities Company Limited does not involve him in any
way in its broking relationship with Unilever.
None of our Non-Executive Directors are elected or appointed
under any arrangement or understanding, either with any major
shareholder, customer, supplier or otherwise.
Committees
Board Committees
The Boards have established the committees described below, all
formally set up by Board resolutions with carefully deﬁned remits.
They are made up solely of Non-Executive Directors and report
regularly to the Boards. For all committees, if Directors are unable
to attend a meeting, they are given the opportunity before the
meeting to discuss with the Chairman of the committee any
agenda items or committee papers. All committees are provided
with sufﬁcient resources to undertake their duties. The terms of
reference for each committee can be found on our website at
www.unilever.com/investorrelations/corp_governance
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is comprised only of independent Non-
Executive Directors with a minimum requirement of three such
members. It is chaired by Kees Storm, and its other members are
Wim Dik, Charles Golden and Byron Grote. The Boards have
satisﬁed themselves that all the current members of the Audit
Committee are competent in ﬁnancial matters and have recent
and relevant experience and that, for the purposes of the US
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Kees Storm is the Audit Committee’s
ﬁnancial expert. The Audit Committee’s meetings are attended, by
invitation, by the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, the Chief Legal Ofﬁcer,
the Group Controller, the Chief Auditor and our external auditors.
The Audit Committee assists the Boards in fulﬁlling their oversight
responsibilities in respect of the integrity of Unilever’s ﬁnancial
statements; risk management and internal control arrangements;
compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; the
performance, qualiﬁcations and independence of the external
auditors; and the performance of the internal audit function. The
Audit Committee is directly responsible, subject to local laws
regarding shareholder approval, for the nomination,
compensation and oversight of the external auditors.
The Audit Committee is compliant with the rules regarding audit
committees applicable in the Netherlands, the UK and the US. The
Audit Committee is supplied with all information necessary for
the performance of its duties by the Chief Auditor, Chief Financial
Ofﬁcer and Group Controller. Both the Chief Auditor and the
external auditors have direct access to the Audit Committee
separately from management.

Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee reviews Directors’ remuneration
and is responsible for the executive share-based incentive plans.
It determines, within the parameters set by our shareholders,
speciﬁc remuneration arrangements for each of the Executive
Directors, the remuneration scales and arrangements for Non-
Executive Directors and the policy for the remuneration of the tier
of management directly below the Boards. The Committee is
advised by the Group Secretary on matters of corporate
governance.
The document entitled ‘The Governance of Unilever’ sets out that
the Committee comprises a minimum of three independent Non-
Executive Directors. The Remuneration Committee is chaired by
David Simon and its other members are Jeroen van der Veer and

Routine business committees
Committees are also set up to conduct routine business as and
when they are necessary. They comprise any two of the Directors
and certain senior executives and ofﬁcers. They administer or
implement certain matters previously agreed by our Boards or the
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer. The Group Secretary is responsible for the
operation of these committees.
Disclosure Committee
The Boards have set up a Disclosure Committee which is
responsible for helping the Boards ensure that ﬁnancial and
other information required to be disclosed publicly is disclosed in a
timely manner and that the information that is disclosed
is complete and accurate in all material aspects. The Committee
comprises the Group Controller, the Group Secretary, the Chief
Legal Ofﬁcer and the Group Treasurer.
Director matters
Conﬂicts of interest
We attach special importance to avoiding conﬂicts of interest
between NV and PLC and their Directors. The Boards are
responsible for ensuring that there are rules in place to avoid
conﬂicts of interest by Board members. Conﬂicts of interest are
understood not to include transactions and other activities
between companies in the Unilever Group.
At the 2008 AGM shareholders approved amendments to Unilever
PLC’s Articles of Association to reﬂect certain provisions of the UK
Companies Act 2006 relating to conﬂicts of interest that came into
force on 1 October 2008, enabling the Board to authorise conﬂicts
or potential conﬂicts of interest. Following the change of law, the
interests of Directors and their connected persons were reviewed
by the Boards. Authorisation of situational conﬂicts was given by
the Boards to the relevant Director in accordance with the Articles
of Association of PLC. The authorisation included conditions
relating to keeping Unilever information conﬁdential and to the
exclusion from receiving and discussing relevant information at
Board meetings. Situational conﬂicts will be reviewed annually by
the Boards as part of the determination of Director independence.
In between those reviews Directors have a duty to inform the
Boards of any relevant changes to the situation. The procedures
that Unilever has put in place to deal with conﬂicts of interest
have operated effectively.
Various formal matters
The borrowing powers of NV Directors on behalf of NV are not
limited by the Articles of Association of NV. PLC Directors have the
power to borrow on behalf of PLC up to three times the adjusted
capital and reserves of PLC, as deﬁned in its Articles of
Association, without the approval of shareholders (any exceptions
requiring an ordinary resolution).
The Articles of Association of NV and PLC do not require Directors
of NV or Directors of PLC to hold shares in NV or PLC. However,
the remuneration arrangements applicable to our Executive
Directors require them to build and retain a personal shareholding
in Unilever equal to at least 150% of their annual base pay. Corporate governance continued

Report of the Directors
Indemniﬁcation
Directors’ indemniﬁcation, including the terms thereof, is provided
for in Article 19 of NV’s Articles of Association. The power to
indemnify Directors is provided for in PLC’s Articles of Association
and deeds of indemnity have been issued to all PLC Directors.
Appropriate Directors’ and Ofﬁcers’ liability insurance is in place
for all Unilever Directors.
Shareholder matters
Relations with shareholders and other investors
We believe it is important both to explain our business
developments and ﬁnancial results to investors and to understand
their objectives.
The Chief Financial Ofﬁcer has lead responsibility for investor
relations, with the active involvement of the Chief Executive
Ofﬁcer. They are supported by our Investor Relations department
which organises presentations for analysts and investors. Such
presentations are generally made available on our website.
Brieﬁngs on quarterly results are given via teleconference and are
accessible by telephone or via our website. For further
information visit our website at
www.unilever.com/investorrelations
The Boards are briefed on reactions to quarterly results
announcements. They, or the relevant Board Committee, are
briefed on any issues raised by shareholders that are relevant to
their responsibilities.
Our shareholders can, and do, raise issues directly with the
relevant Executive Director or the Chairman and, if appropriate,
a relevant Non-Executive Director or the Senior Independent
Director.
Both NV and PLC communicate with their respective shareholders
at the AGMs as well as responding to their questions and
enquiries during the course of the year. We take the views of our
shareholders into account and, in accordance with all applicable
legislation and regulations, may consult them in an appropriate
way before putting proposals to our AGMs.
General Meetings of shareholders
The business to be conducted at the AGMs of NV and PLC is set
out in the separate Notices of AGM for NV and PLC. It typically
includes approval/consideration of the Annual Report and
Accounts, appointment of Directors, remuneration framework,
appointment of external auditors, approval of changes to the
Articles of Association, and authorisation for the Boards to allot
and repurchase shares, and to restrict pre-emptive rights of
shareholders.
At the AGMs, a review is given of the progress of the business
over the last year and there is a discussion of current issues.
Shareholders are encouraged to attend the meetings and ask
questions, and the question-and-answer sessions form an
important part of the meetings.
General Meetings of shareholders of NV and PLC are held at
times and places decided by our Boards. NV meetings are
normally held in Rotterdam and PLC meetings are normally held
in London, on consecutive days. The notices calling the meetings
normally go out more than 30 days prior to the meetings and
include further information on how to gain access to the AGMs
and how to vote by proxy.
We welcome our external auditors to the AGMs and they are
entitled to address the meetings.
Electronic communication
We are committed to efforts to continue more effective ways
of communication with our shareholders around the AGMs.
Electronic communication is already an important and established
medium for shareholders, providing ready access to shareholder
information and reports, and for voting purposes.
NV was one of the founders of the Dutch Shareholders’
Communication Channel. NV shareholders participating in the
Channel are able to appoint electronically a proxy to vote on their
behalf at the NV AGM and NV shareholders who wish to
participate should contact their bank or broker.
Shareholders of PLC can choose to receive electronic notiﬁcation
that the Annual Review, Annual Report and Accounts and Notice
of AGMs have been published on our website, instead of
receiving printed copies, and can also electronically appoint a
proxy to vote on their behalf at the AGM.
Registration for electronic communication by shareholders of PLC
can be made at www.unilever.com/shareholderservices The UK
Companies Act 2006 contains provisions facilitating
communications between companies and their shareholders
electronically and PLC has established such a facility after
consulting with its shareholders in 2007 to offer them the
opportunity to review their method of receiving shareholder
communications in the future.
Voting rights
To be entitled to attend and vote at NV General Meetings
shareholders must hold their NV shares on the record date, which
is set by the Board of NV at a date not more than 30 days before
the meeting. Shareholders do not need to block their shares. NV
shareholders can cast one vote for each €0.16 nominal capital
that they hold. This means that they can cast one vote for each
NV ordinary share, or NV New York Registry Share. Shareholders
can vote in person or by proxy. Similar arrangements apply to
holders of depositary receipts issued for NV shares and the
holders of NV preference shares (see page 54).
PLC shareholders can cast one vote for each 3
1
⁄ 9p nominal capital
that they hold. This means shareholders can cast one vote for
each PLC ordinary share, or PLC American Depositary Receipt of
shares. Shareholders can vote in person at the meeting or by
proxy. Proxies should be submitted at least 48 hours before the
General Meeting to the Registrars, whose details can be found on
page 159. Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008 51

Right to hold shares
Unilever places no limitations on the right to hold NV and PLC
shares.
Foundation Agreements
Equalisation Agreement
The Equalisation Agreement makes the economic position of the
shareholders of NV and PLC, as far as possible, the same as if they
held shares in a single company. The Equalisation Agreement
regulates the mutual rights of the shareholders of NV and PLC.
Under the Equalisation Agreement, NV and PLC must adopt the
same ﬁnancial periods and accounting policies. Dividends are paid
in accordance with a formula relating to the nominal values of
NV’s and PLC’s issued share capital.
Each NV ordinary share represents the same underlying economic
interest in the Unilever Group as each PLC ordinary share.
We pay ordinary dividends for NV and PLC on the same day.
NV and PLC allocate funds for the dividend from their parts of
our current proﬁts and free reserves. We pay the same amount
on each NV share as on one PLC share calculated at the relevant
exchange rate. For interim dividends this exchange rate is the
average rate for the quarter before we declare the dividend. For
ﬁnal dividends it is the average rate for the year. In arriving at the
equalised amount we include any tax payable by the Company in
respect of the dividend, but calculate it before any tax deductible
by the Company from the dividend.
The Equalisation Agreement provides that if one company had
losses, or was unable to pay its preference dividends, the loss or
shortfall would be made up out of:
• the current proﬁts of the other company (after it has paid its
own preference shareholders);
• then its own free reserves; and
• then the free reserves of the other company.
If either company could not pay its ordinary dividends, we would
follow the same procedure, except that the current proﬁts of the
other company would only be used after it had paid its own
ordinary shareholders and if the Directors thought this more
appropriate than, for example, using its own free reserves.
So far, NV and PLC have always been able to pay their own
dividends, so we have never had to follow this procedure. If we
did, the payment from one company to the other would be
subject to any United Kingdom and Dutch tax and exchange
control laws applicable at that time.
More information on the exercise of voting rights can be found
in NV’s and PLC’s Articles of Association and in the respective
Notices of Meetings.
Holders of NV New York Registry Shares or PLC American
Depositary Receipts of shares will receive a proxy form enabling
them to authorise and instruct a notary public or Citibank, N.A.
respectively to vote on their behalf at the General Meeting of NV
or PLC.
N.V. Elma and United Holdings Limited (the holders of NV’s special
shares), other group companies of NV which hold ordinary or
preference shares, and United Holdings Limited, which owns half
of PLC’s deferred stock, are not permitted to vote at General
Meetings.
Voting on each of the resolutions contained in the Notice of
AGMs is conducted by poll. The ﬁnal vote is published at the
meetings and the outcome of the votes, including the proxy
votes, is put on Unilever’s website.
Shareholder proposed resolutions
Shareholders of NV may propose resolutions if they individually or
together hold 1% of NV’s issued capital in the form of shares or
depositary receipts for shares, or if they individually or together
hold shares or depositary receipts worth or representing the
market value in shares as set in respect thereto by or pursuant to
the law (currently €50 million). They must submit these requests
at least 60 days before the date of the General Meeting, and the
request will be honoured unless, in the opinion of the Boards, it is
against a substantive interest of the Company. Shareholders who
together represent at least 10% of the issued capital of NV can
also requisition Extraordinary General Meetings to deal with
speciﬁc resolutions.
Shareholders who together hold shares representing at least 5%
of the total voting rights of PLC, or 100 shareholders who hold
on average £100 each in nominal value of PLC capital, can
require PLC to propose a resolution at a general meeting.
PLC shareholders holding in aggregate 10% of the issued PLC
ordinary shares are able to convene a general meeting of PLC.
Required majorities
Resolutions are usually adopted at NV and PLC shareholder
meetings by an absolute majority of votes cast, unless there are
other requirements under the applicable laws or NV’s or PLC’s
Articles of Association. For example, there are special
requirements for resolutions relating to the alteration of the
Articles of Association, the liquidation of NV or PLC and the
alteration of the Equalisation Agreement (see below).
A proposal to alter the Articles of Association of NV can only
be made by the Board of NV. A proposal to alter the
Memorandum and Articles of Association of PLC can be made
either by the Board of PLC or by shareholders in the manner
permitted under the UK Companies Acts. Unless expressly
speciﬁed to the contrary in the Articles of Association of PLC,
PLC’s Articles of Association may be amended by a special Corporate governance continued
52 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Report of the Directors
Under the Equalisation Agreement, the two companies are
permitted to pay different dividends in the following exceptional
circumstances:
• If the average annual sterling/euro exchange rate changed
so substantially from one year to the next that to pay equal
dividends at the current exchange rates, either NV or PLC
would have to pay a dividend that was unreasonable (that is to
say, substantially larger or smaller in its own currency than the
dividend it paid in the previous year); or
• The governments of the Netherlands or the United Kingdom
could in some circumstances place restrictions on the
proportion of a company’s proﬁts which can be paid out as
dividends. This could mean that in order to pay equal dividends
one company would have to pay out an amount which would
breach the limitations in place at the time, or that the other
company would have to pay a smaller dividend.
In either of these rare cases, NV and PLC could pay different
amounts of dividend if the Boards thought it appropriate. The
company paying less than the equalised dividend would put the
difference between the dividends into a reserve: an equalisation
reserve in the case of exchange rate ﬂuctuations, or a dividend
reserve in the case of a government restriction. The reserves
would be paid out to its shareholders when it became possible or
reasonable to do so, which would ensure that the shareholders of
both companies would ultimately be treated the same.
If both companies were to go into liquidation, NV and PLC would
each use any funds legally available to pay the prior claims of
their own preference shareholders. Then they would use any
surplus to pay each other’s preference shareholders, if necessary.
After these claims had been met, they would pay out any
equalisation or dividend reserve to their own shareholders before
pooling the remaining surplus. This would be distributed to the
ordinary shareholders of both companies on an equal basis.
If one company were to go into liquidation, we would apply the
same principles as if both had gone into liquidation
simultaneously.
In principle, issues of bonus shares and rights offerings can only
be made in ordinary shares. Again, we would ensure that
shareholders of NV and PLC received shares in equal proportions.
The subscription price for one new NV share would have to be
the same, at the prevailing exchange rate, as the price for one
new PLC share. Neither company can issue or reduce capital
without the consent of the other.
The Articles of Association of NV establish that any payment
under the Equalisation Agreement will be credited or debited to
the income statement for the ﬁnancial year in question.
Under Article 2 of the Articles of Association of NV and Clause 3
of the Memorandum of Association of PLC, each company is
required to carry out the Equalisation Agreement with the other.
Both documents state that the Agreement cannot be changed or
terminated without the approval of shareholders. For NV, the
General Meeting can decide to alter or terminate the Equalisation
Agreement at the proposal of the Board. The necessary approval
of the General Meeting is then that at least one half of the total
issued ordinary capital must be represented at an ordinary
shareholders’ meeting, where the majority must vote in favour;
and (if they would be disadvantaged or the agreement is to be
terminated), at least two-thirds of the total issued preference
share capital must be represented at a preference shareholders’
meeting, where at least three-quarters of them must vote in
favour. For PLC, the necessary approval must be given by the
holders of a majority of all issued shares voting at a General
Meeting and the holders of the ordinary shares, by a simple
majority voting at a General Meeting where the majority of the
ordinary shares in issue are represented.
In addition, Article 3 of the PLC Articles of Association states that
PLC’s Board must carry out the Equalisation Agreement and that
the other provisions of the Articles of Association are subject to it.
We are advised by counsel that these provisions oblige our Boards
to carry out the Equalisation Agreement, unless it is amended or
terminated with the required approval of the shareholders of both
companies. If the Boards fail to enforce the Agreement,
shareholders can compel them to do so under Dutch and UK law.
As announced on 5 February 2009, at the 2009 AGMs and at
separate Meetings of Ordinary Shareholders we will be proposing
resolutions to authorise the Directors to modify the Equalisation
Agreement to facilitate the payment of quarterly dividends from
2010 onwards. This will allow us to change to a simpler and more
transparent dividend practice for the Unilever group. These
changes will result in more frequent payments to shareholders,
and better align with the cash ﬂow generation of the business.
The Equalisation Agreement can be found on our website at
www.unilever.com/investorrelations/corp_governance
The Deed of Mutual Covenants
The Deed of Mutual Covenants provides that NV and PLC and
their respective subsidiary companies shall co-operate in every
way for the purpose of maintaining a common operating policy.
They shall exchange all relevant information about their respective
businesses – the intention being to create and maintain a
common operating platform for the Unilever Group throughout
the world. The Deed illustrates some of the information which
makes up this common platform, such as the mutual exchange
and free use of know-how, patents, trade marks and all other
commercially valuable information.
The Deed contains provisions which allow the Directors of NV and
PLC to take any actions to ensure that the dividend-generating
capacity of each of NV and PLC is aligned with the economic
interests of their respective shareholders. These provisions also
allow assets to be transferred between NV and PLC and their
associated companies (as deﬁned in the Deed) to ensure that
assets are allocated in the most efﬁcient manner. These
arrangements are designed to create a balance between
the two parent companies and the funds generated by them,
for the beneﬁt of their respective sets of shareholders. Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008 53

The Agreement for Mutual Guarantees of Borrowing
Under the Agreement for Mutual Guarantees of Borrowing
between NV and PLC, each company will, if asked by the other,
guarantee the borrowings of the other. The two companies also
jointly guarantee the borrowings of their subsidiaries. These
arrangements are used, as a matter of ﬁnancial policy, for certain
signiﬁcant public borrowings. They enable lenders to rely on our
combined ﬁnancial strength.
Share capital matters
Combined earnings per share
We calculate earnings per share on a combined basis. In our
combined earnings per share calculation, we assume that both
companies will be able to pay their dividends out of their part of
our proﬁts. This has always been the case in the past, but if we
did have to make a payment from one to the other it could result
in additional taxes, and reduce our combined earnings per share.
Further information about the calculation of earnings per share,
including the calculation on a diluted basis, can be found in note
7 on page 96.
Share capital
NV’s issued share capital on 31 December 2008 was made up of:
• €274 356 432 split into 1 714 727 700 ordinary shares of
€0.16 each;
• €1 028 568 split into 2 400 ordinary shares numbered 1 to
2 400, known as special shares; and
• €113 599 014 split into several classes (4%, 6% and 7%) of
cumulative preference shares (‘ﬁnancing preference shares’).
The voting rights attached to NV's outstanding shares are split as
follows:

NV may issue shares not yet issued and grant rights to subscribe
for shares only pursuant to a resolution of the General Meeting
of Shareholders or of another corporate body designated for such
purpose by a resolution of the General Meeting. At the AGM held
on 15 May 2008 the Board was designated, in accordance with
Articles 96 and 96a of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code, as
the corporate body authorised until 15 November 2009 to resolve
on the issue of – or on the granting of rights to subscribe for –
shares not yet issued and to restrict or exclude the statutory pre-
emption rights that accrue to shareholders upon issue of shares,
on the understanding that this authority is limited to 10% of the
issued share capital of the Company, plus an additional 10% of
the issued share capital of the Company in connection with or on
the occasion of mergers and acquisitions.
At the 2008 AGM the Board of NV was authorised, in accordance
with Article 98 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code, until
15 November 2009 to cause the Company to buy back its own
shares and depositary receipts thereof, within the limits set by
law, either through purchase on a stock exchange or otherwise,
at a price, excluding expenses, not lower than the nominal value
of the shares and not higher than 10% above the average of the
closing price of the shares on Eurolist by Euronext Amsterdam for
the ﬁve business days before the day on which the purchase is
made. The Board agreed at the AGM that it would use the
authority to purchase more than 10% of the Company’s issued
share capital.
The above mentioned authorities are renewed annually.
PLC’s issued share capital on 31 December 2008 was made up of:
• £40 760 420 split into 1 310 156 361 ordinary shares of 3

voted on.
The Board of PLC under sections 80 and 89 of the UK Companies
Act 1985 may, subject to the passing of the appropriate
resolutions at a meeting of shareholders, issue shares within the
limits prescribed within the resolutions. At the 2008 AGM the
Directors were authorised to issue new shares pursuant to section
80 of that Act, limited to a maximum of £13 450 000 nominal
value, which at the time represented approximately 33% of the
Company’s issued Ordinary share capital and pursuant to section
89 of that Act, to disapply pre-emption rights up to approximately
5% of PLC’s issued ordinary share capital. These authorities are
renewed annually.
At the 2008 AGM the Board of PLC was authorised in accordance
with its Articles of Association to make market purchases of its
ordinary shares representing just under 10% of the Company’s
issued capital and within the limits prescribed within the
resolution until the earlier of the 15-month anniversary after the
passing of the resolution or the conclusion of the 2009 AGM. Corporate governance continued

Margarine Union (1930) Limited: Conversion Rights
The ﬁrst Viscount Leverhulme was the founder of the company
which became PLC. When he died in 1925, he left in his will a
large number of PLC shares in various trusts.
When the will trusts were varied in 1983, the interests of the
beneﬁciaries of his will were also preserved. Four classes of special
shares were created in Margarine Union (1930) Limited, a
subsidiary of PLC. One of these classes can be converted at the
end of the year 2038 into 70 875 000 PLC ordinary shares of
3
1
⁄9p each. This currently represents 5.4% of PLC’s issued ordinary
capital. These convertible shares replicate the rights which the
descendants of the ﬁrst Viscount would have had under his will.
This class of the special shares only has a right to dividends in
speciﬁed circumstances, and no dividends have yet been paid.
PLC guarantees the dividend and conversion rights of the
special shares.
Foundation Unilever NV Trust Ofﬁce
As at 27 February 2009, around 73% of NV’s ordinary shares and
around 34% of NV’s 7% cumulative preference shares were held
by the Foundation Unilever NV Trust Ofﬁce (Stichting
Administratiekantoor Unilever N.V.), a trust ofﬁce with a board
independent of Unilever. As part of its corporate objects, the
Foundation issues depositary receipts in exchange for these
shares. These depositary receipts are listed on Euronext
Amsterdam, as are the NV ordinary and 7% preference shares
themselves.
Holders of depositary receipts can under all circumstances
exchange their depositary receipts for the underlying shares
(and vice versa).
Holders of depositary receipts are entitled to dividends and all
economic beneﬁts on the underlying shares held by the
Foundation.
The members of the board at the foundation are Mr J H Schraven

The Foundation reports periodically on its activities.
Voting by holders of depositary receipts
Although the depositary receipts themselves do not formally have
voting rights, holders of depositary receipts are in practice
equated with shareholders. They can attend all NV’s General
Meetings, either personally or by proxy, and also have right of
speech. The holders of the depositary receipts will then
automatically, without limitation and under all circumstances,
receive a voting proxy on behalf of the Foundation to vote on the
underlying shares.
The Foundation is obliged to follow voting instructions of holders
of depositary receipts. The same applies to the voting instructions
of holders of depositary receipts not attending a shareholders’
meeting and who issue voting instructions to the Foundation via
the Dutch Shareholders’ Communication Channel.
Voting by the Foundation Unilever NV Trust Ofﬁce
Shares for which the Foundation has not granted voting proxies
or for which it has not received voting instructions are voted
on by the Foundation in such a way as it deems to be in the
interests of the holders of the depositary receipts. This voting
policy is laid down in the Conditions of Administration that
apply to the depositary receipts.
Speciﬁc provisions apply in the event that a meeting of holders of
NV 7% cumulative preference shares is convened.
If a change to shareholders’ rights is proposed, the Foundation
will let shareholders know if it intends to vote, at least 14 days
in advance if possible.
Hitherto the majority of votes cast by ordinary shareholders at
NV meetings have been cast by the Foundation. Unilever and
the Foundation have a policy of actively encouraging holders
of depositary receipts to exercise their voting rights in
NV meetings.
Unilever considers the arrangements of the Foundation
appropriate and in the interest of NV and its shareholders given
the size of the voting rights attached to the ﬁnancing preference
shares and the relatively low attendance of holders of ordinary
shares in its AGMs.
Foundation Unilever NV Trust Ofﬁce’s shareholding
Foundation NV Trust Ofﬁce’s shareholding ﬂuctuates daily – its
holdings on 27 February 2009 were:
• NV ordinary shares of €0.16: 1 247 992 862 (72.78%); and
• NV 7% cumulative preference shares of €428.57: 9 776
(33.71%);

Requirements and compliance – general
Unilever is subject to corporate governance requirements in the
Netherlands, the UK and as a foreign private issuer in the US.
In this section we report on our compliance with the corporate
governance regulations and best practice codes applicable in the
Netherlands and the UK and we also describe compliance with
corporate governance standards in the US.
Under the UK Companies Act 2006 and rules of the US Securities
and Exchange Commission, we are required to provide
information on contracts and other arrangements essential or
material to the business of the Group. We believe we do not have
any such contracts or arrangements. Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008 55
Report of the Directors
Corporate governance continued
Our governance arrangements are designed and structured to
promote and further the interests of our companies and their
shareholders. The Boards reserve the right, in cases where they
decide such to be conducive to the interests of the companies
and the enterprise connected therewith or our shareholders, to
depart from that which is set out in the present and previous
sections in relation to our corporate governance. Further changes
will be reported in future Annual Reports and Accounts and,
when necessary, through changes to the relevant documents
published on our website. As appropriate, proposals for change
will be put to our shareholders for approval.
Further information can be found on our website and in the
document entitled ‘The Governance of Unilever’. This describes
the terms of reference of our Board Committees, including their
full responsibilities. It will be kept up to date with changes in our
internal constitutional arrangements that our Boards may make
from time to time and it is available on our website at
www.unilever.com/Investorrelations/corp_governance
Requirements – European Union
Following implementation of the EU Takeover Directive, certain
information is required to be disclosed in relation to control and
share structures and interests of NV and PLC. Such disclosures,
which are not covered elsewhere in this Annual Report, include
the following:
• there are no requirements to obtain the approval of NV or PLC,
or of other holders of securities in NV or PLC, for a transfer of
such securities;
• there are no arrangements by which, with NV or PLC's co-
operation, ﬁnancial rights carried by securities are held by a
person other than the holder of such securities;
• NV and PLC are not aware of any agreements between holders
of securities which may result in restrictions on the transfer of
such securities or on voting rights;
• neither NV or PLC are parties to any signiﬁcant agreement
which include provisions that take effect, alter or terminate
such agreement upon a change of control following a takeover
bid;
• NV and PLC do not have any agreements with any Director or
employee that would provide compensation for loss of ofﬁce or
employment resulting from a takeover except that most of
Unilever's share schemes contain provisions which operate in
the event of a takeover of Unilever, which provisions may for
instance cause options or awards granted to employees under
such schemes to vest after a takeover or be exchanged into
new awards for shares in another entity; and
• the Trustees of the PLC employee share trusts may vote or
abstain in any way they think ﬁt and in doing so may take into
account both ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial interests of the
beneﬁciaries of the employee share trusts or their dependents.
Historically the Trustees tend not to exercise this right.
Requirements – the Netherlands
General
NV is required to state in its Annual Report and Accounts whether
it complies or will comply with the Principles (‘P’) and best
practice provisions (‘bpp’) of the Dutch Corporate Governance
Code (the Dutch Code) and, if it does not comply, to explain the
reasons for this. As will be clear from the description of our
governance arrangements, NV complies with almost all of the
principles and best practice provisions of the Dutch Code, a copy
of which is available at www.commissiecorporategovernance.nl
The text that follows sets out certain statements that the Dutch
Code invites us to make to our shareholders that are not included
elsewhere in this Annual Report and Accounts as well as areas of
non-compliance.
On 10 December 2008 the Dutch Corporate Governance Code
Compliance Committee published a revised version of the Code,
which is intended to become applicable to our annual reporting
over 2009 and we therefore intend to report compliance under
the revised Code in our Annual Report and Accounts 2009.
Board and Committee structures
NV has a one-tier board, consisting of both Executive and, as a
majority, Non-Executive Directors. We achieve compliance of our
board arrangements with the Dutch Code, which is for the most
part based on the customary two-tier structure in the
Netherlands, by, as far as is possible and practicable, applying the
provisions of the Dutch Code relating to members of a
management board to our Executive Directors and by applying
the provisions relating to members of a supervisory board to our
Non-Executive Directors. Management tasks not capable of
delegation are performed by the Board as a whole. Reference is
made to Ps II and III and corresponding bpps. Reference is also
made to the UK Combined Code on Corporate Governance,
which is fully tailored to the one-tier board model (see page 44).
Risk management and control
Reference is made to the description of Unilever’s principal risks
on pages 25 to 27 and risk management, internal controls and
disclosure controls and procedures on page 28.
The Board considers that the internal risk management and
control systems are appropriate for our business and in
compliance with best practice provision II.1.3.
In best practice provision II.1.4 the Dutch Code invites our Board
to make a statement on our internal risk management and
control systems. In its reports published in 2005 and 2007 the
Dutch Corporate Governance Code Monitoring Committee has
made recommendations concerning the application of this best
practice provision. In accordance with its recommendations and in
light of the above, the Board believes that as regards ﬁnancial
reporting risks:
• the risk management and control systems provide reasonable
assurance that the ﬁnancial statements do not contain any
material inaccuracies;
• the risk management and control systems have worked
properly in 2008;
• there are no indications that the risk management and control
systems will not work properly in 2009; Corporate governance continued
56 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Report of the Directors
• no material failings in the risk management and control systems
were discovered in the year under review or the current year up
to the date of signing these accounts;
and, as regards operational, strategic, legislative, ﬁnancial and
regulatory risks, no material failings in the risk management and
control systems were discovered in the year under review.
The aforesaid statements are not statements in accordance with
the requirements of Section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act
2002.
Retention period of shares
The Dutch Code recommends that shares granted to executive
directors must be retained for a period of at least ﬁve years (bpp
II.2.3). Our shareholder approved remuneration policy requires
Executive Directors to build and retain a personal shareholding in
Unilever equal to at least 150% of their annual base pay. The
Board believes that this is in line with the spirit of the Dutch
Code.
Severance pay
It is our policy to set the level of severance payments for Directors
at no more than one year’s salary, unless the Board, at the
proposal of the Remuneration Committee, ﬁnds this manifestly
unreasonable given circumstances or unless otherwise dictated by
applicable law (bpp II.2.7).
Regulations for transactions in securities in other
companies
The Dutch Code recommends that a director shall give periodic
notice of any changes in his holding of securities in other Dutch
listed companies (bpp II.2.6 and bpp III.7.3). We are a
multinational company operating all over the world and our
Directors come from a wide variety of countries. We therefore
have a broader and more general requirement for our Directors,
requiring them, upon request, to disclose to the Group Secretary
their holdings and transactions in securities in any listed company.
Conﬂicts of interest
In the event of a (potential) conﬂict of interest, the provisions of
the Dutch Code (P II.3 and III.6) are applied. Conﬂicts of interest
are not understood to include transactions and other activities
between companies in the Unilever Group.
Financing preference shares
NV issued 4%, 6% and 7% cumulative preference shares
between 1927 and 1970. Their voting rights are based on their
nominal value, as prescribed by Dutch law. The Dutch Code
recommends that the voting rights on such shares should, in any
event when they are newly issued, be based on their economic
value rather than on their nominal value (bpp IV.1.2). NV agrees
with this principle but cannot unilaterally reduce voting rights of
its outstanding preference shares.
Anti-takeover constructions and control over the company
With reference to bpp IV .3.9, NV conﬁrms that it has no anti-
takeover constructions, in the sense of constructions that are
intended solely, or primarily, to block future hostile public offers for
its shares. Nor does NV have any constructions whose speciﬁc
purpose is to prevent a bidder, after acquiring 75% of the capital,
from appointing or dismissing members of the Board and
subsequently altering the Articles of Association. The acquisition
through a public offer of a majority of the shares in a company
does not under Dutch law preclude in all circumstances the
continued right of the Board of the company to exercise its powers.
Provision of information
We consider it important to comply with all applicable statutory
regulations on the equal treatment of shareholders and provision
of information and communication with shareholders and other
parties (P IV.2 and P IV.3).
Meetings of analysts and presentations to investors
We have extensive procedures for handling relations with and
communicating with shareholders, investors, analysts and the
media (also see page 50). The important presentations and
meetings are conducted as far as practicable in accordance with
bpp IV.3.1. Due to their large number and overlap in information,
however, some of the less important ones are not announced in
advance, made accessible to everyone or put on our website.
Requirements – the United Kingdom
PLC is required, as a company that is incorporated in the UK and
listed on the London Stock Exchange, to state how it has applied
the principles and how far it has complied with the provisions set
out in Section 1 of the 2006 UK Combined Code on Corporate
Governance (‘the Combined Code’), a copy of which is available
at www.frc.org.uk
In the preceding pages we have described how we have applied
the principles and the provisions in the Combined Code. In 2008,
Unilever complied with the Combined Code except in the
following areas:
• The Remuneration Committee currently has two independent
Non-Executive Directors on its membership. Michael Treschow
was appointed a member of the Remuneration Committee in
February 2008. The Committee and the Board are working to
seek a new Non-Executive Director appointment for that
Committee, and the membership of the Committee will be
reviewed again in light of David Simon’s forthcoming
retirement.
• Due to the requirement for Unilever to hold two AGMs for its
respective companies on consecutive days, it may not always be
possible for all Directors, and possibly the Chairmen of the
Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees, to be
present at both meetings. The Chairman ensures that a majority
of Directors attend both meetings and that at least one
member of each Committee attends each AGM.
Risk management and control
Reference is made to the description of Unilever’s principal risks
on pages 25 to 27 and risk management, internal controls and
disclosure controls and procedures on page 28.
Our procedures cover ﬁnancial, operational, social, strategic and
environmental risks and regulatory matters. They are in line with
the recommendations of ’Internal Control – Revised Guidance for
Directors on the UK Combined Code’, published by the Internal
Control Working Party of the Institute of Chartered Accountants
in England & Wales in October 2005 (‘The Turnbull Guidance’). Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008 57
Report of the Directors
Corporate governance continued
Requirements – the United States
Both NV and PLC are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and
must therefore comply with such of the requirements of US
legislation, such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, regulations
enacted under US securities laws and the Listing Standards of the
New York Stock Exchange as are applicable to foreign private
issuers. In some cases the requirements are mandatory and in
other cases the obligation is to ’comply or explain’.
We have complied with the requirements concerning corporate
governance that were in force during 2008. Attention is drawn
in particular to the remit of the Audit Committee on page 48
and the Report of the Audit Committee on page 74.
Actions already taken to ensure compliance that are not
speciﬁcally disclosed elsewhere or otherwise clear from reading
this document include:
• the issuance of a Code of Ethics for senior ﬁnancial ofﬁcers;
• the issuance of instructions restricting the employment of
former employees of the audit ﬁrm; and
• the establishment of a policy on reporting requirements under
SEC rules relating to standards of professional conduct for US
attorneys.
In each of these cases, existing practices were revised and/or
documented in such a way as to conform to the new
requirements.
The Code of Ethics applies to the senior executive, ﬁnancial and
accounting ofﬁcers and comprises the standards prescribed by the
SEC, and a copy has been posted on our website at
www.unilever.com/investorrelations/corp_governance The Code of
Ethics comprises an extract of the relevant provisions of Unilever’s
Code of Business Principles and the more detailed rules of
conduct that implement it. The only amendment to these pre-
existing provisions and rules that was made in preparing the Code
of Ethics was made at the request of the Audit Committee and
consisted of a strengthening of the explicit requirement to keep
proper accounting records. No waiver from any provision of the
Code of Ethics was granted to any of the persons falling within
the scope of the SEC requirement in 2008.
We are required by US securities laws and the Listing Standards
of the New York Stock Exchange to have an Audit Committee
that satisﬁes Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act and the Listing
Standards of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). We are
compliant with these requirements. We are also required to
disclose any signiﬁcant ways in which our corporate governance
practices differ from those typically followed by US companies
listed on the NYSE. In addition to the information we have
given you in this document about our corporate governance
arrangements, further details are provided in the document
entitled ‘The Governance of Unilever’, which is on our website at
www.unilever.com/investorrelations/corp_governance
We are compliant with the Listing Standards of the New York
Stock Exchange applicable to foreign private issuers. Our
corporate governance practices do not signiﬁcantly differ from
those required of US companies listed on the New York Stock
Exchange.
We also conﬁrm that our shareholders have the opportunity to
vote on equity compensation plans.
Risk management and control
Reference is made to the description of Unilever’s risks on pages
25 to 27 and risk management, internal controls and disclosure
controls and procedures on page 28.
Based on an evaluation by the Boards, the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer
and the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer concluded that the design and
operation of the Group’s disclosure controls and procedures,
including those deﬁned in United States Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 - Rule 13a – 15(e), as at 31 December 2008 were
effective, and that subsequently until the date of the approval of
the Annual Report by the Board, there have been no signiﬁcant
changes in the Group’s internal controls, or in other factors that
could signiﬁcantly affect those controls.
Unilever is required by Section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002 to report on the effectiveness of internal control over
ﬁnancial reporting. This requirement will be reported on
separately and will form part of Unilever’s Annual Report on Form
20-F. Corporate governance Biographical details

Report of the Directors
Report of the Nomination Committee
Terms of Reference
The Nomination Committee comprises two Independent Non-
Executive Directors and the Chairman. It is chaired by David
Simon, Vice Chairman and Senior Independent Director. Its other
members are Michael Treschow and Jeroen van der Veer. The
Group Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.
The Nomination Committee is responsible for drawing up
selection criteria and appointment procedures for Directors.
Under Unilever’s corporate governance arrangements Executive
and Non-Executive Directors offer themselves for election each
year at the Annual General Meetings. The Nomination Committee
is responsible for recommending candidates for nomination as
Executive Directors, including Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, and Non-
Executive Directors each year based on the process of evaluations
referred to below. After Directors have been appointed by
shareholders the Committee recommends to the Board candidates
for election as Chairman and Vice-Chairman. The Committee also
has responsibility for supervising the policy of the Chief Executive
Ofﬁcer on the selection criteria and appointment procedures for
senior management and it keeps oversight of all matters relating
to corporate governance, bringing any issues to the attention of
the Boards. The Committee’s Terms of Reference are available on
our website www.unilever.com/investorrelations/corp_governance
Process for the appointment of Directors
Unilever has formal procedures for evaluation of the Boards, the
Board Committees and the individual Directors. The results of the
evaluations are provided to the Committee when it discusses the
nominations for re-election as Directors.
Where a vacancy arises on the Boards, the Committee seeks the
services of specialist recruitment ﬁrms and other external experts
to assist in ﬁnding individuals with the appropriate skills and
expertise.
In nominating Directors, the Committee follows the agreed Board
Proﬁle of potential Non-Executive Directors, which takes into
account the roles of Non-Executive Directors set out in the Dutch
Corporate Governance Code and the UK Combined Code on
Corporate Governance. Under the terms of the Governance of
Unilever the Boards should comprise a majority of Non-Executive
Directors and the proﬁle provides that three of these have strong
ﬁnancial experience, and staff the Audit Committee. To represent
Unilever’s areas of interest, the proﬁle also indicates there should
be a strong representation from Developing and Emerging
markets as well as from Europe and North America. Non-
Executive Directors should be independent of Unilever and free
from any conﬂicts of interest. The proﬁle looks at diversity in
terms of nationality, race, gender and relevant expertise and
directs that, wherever possible, the Boards should reﬂect
Unilever’s consumer base.
Activities of the Committee during the year
The Committee met six times in 2008. The meetings were fully
attended by David Simon and Michael Treschow. Jeroen van der
Veer attended four meetings. The members also regularly met
outside of formal Committee meetings to discuss succession
issues.
The Committee proposed the nomination of all Directors offering
themselves for re-election at the 2008 AGMs. During 2008, the
Committee also proposed the nominations of two new Executive
Directors.
Jim Lawrence was appointed as an Executive Director at the
AGMs in May 2008, following his appointment as Chief Financial
Ofﬁcer in September 2007.
During 2008 the Committee conducted an extensive search for a
new Chief Executive Ofﬁcer to succeed Patrick Cescau who retired
on 31 December 2008. The Committee was supported by an
outside executive search ﬁrm engaged to identify suitable
candidates for the role. The process resulted in the Committee’s
recommendation to the Boards to nominate Paul Polman as
Patrick Cescau’s successor. The Committee is pleased to have
identiﬁed an excellent candidate, whose competencies match the
proﬁle of role and task required. Paul Polman was nominated by
the Committee for election as an Executive Director at
shareholders’ meetings held in October 2008. He became Chief
Executive Ofﬁcer with effect from 1 January 2009.
The Committee reviewed and agreed the terms of appointment of
the new Executive Directors in line with best practice.
At the AGMs in May 2008, Kees van der Graaf and Ralph Kugler
retired as Executive Directors.
In June 2008 Professor Geneviève Berger resigned as a Non-
Executive Director, to take up the position of Chief Research &
Development Ofﬁcer as a member of the Unilever Executive
reporting to the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer.
The Committee, along with the Boards, reviewed the diversity
within the Group and agreed with management that gender
diversity is an opportunity, especially at the higher levels where
female representation is relatively small.
Following the appointment of an outside consultant to support
the 2006 evaluation process, internal reviews were undertaken
during 2007 and 2008 in relation to the evaluation of the Boards,
the Chairman, the individual Directors and the Board Committees
based on the completion of a questionnaire and interviews. The
Committee has also carried out a self-assessment of its
performance.

Report of the Directors
During 2008, the Committee’s activities were greatly inﬂuenced
by the Board and Executive Committee changes that the
succession plan required.
In October 2008 Paul Polman was elected to the Board, becoming
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer on Patrick Cescau’s retirement at the end
of December. Jim Lawrence was elected to the Board at the 2008
AGMs following his appointment as Chief Financial Ofﬁcer in the
latter half of 2007. The 2008 AGMs also marked the retirement
from the Board of Kees van der Graaf, President, Europe, and
Ralph Kugler, President, Home & Personal Care, each with over 28
years of service.
Given our agreed policy framework, the Committee’s aim has
been to ensure that the remuneration arrangements for Paul
Polman and Jim Lawrence, as Executive Directors, are fully in line
with the ﬁve strategic principles that serve as the platform for
Unilever's approach to remuneration for the Unilever Executive.
These principles not only apply for our Executive Directors but to
all Unilever's leadership levels. They provide the basis for our
remuneration structure as explained in greater detail in the
following pages, and direct that pay should be:
• aligned with shareholders' interests;
• robustly linked to performance;
• aligned with strategic priorities;
• market competitive; and
• easy to understand and communicate.
The overriding objective is to ensure that Unilever recruits and
retains the best performers, and effectively incentivises them to
achieve superior results. It is also our aim to manage the differing
elements of total remuneration in a fully integrated manner.
Shareholders were provided with summaries of the full
remuneration arrangements for both Paul Polman and Jim
Lawrence prior to their elections to the Board. In addition, at the
2008 AGMs shareholders separately approved increased bonus
and Global Share Incentive Plan award limits for Jim Lawrence,
who joined us from the USA.
Reﬂecting the transformation that Patrick Cescau has led over the
last four years, Unilever’s performance continued to improve
through 2008 despite the challenging environment. The focus on
growth priorities coupled with timely pricing actions and savings
from cost efﬁciency programmes meant that we were able to
deliver underlying sales growth well above target levels and
improved underlying operating margins.
The annual incentive awards paid to the Executive team in respect
of 2008 (on average 120% of base salary) reﬂect Unilever’s strong
underlying sales growth, improved margin performance as well
delivery on individual business objectives. Long-term incentive
awards will vest in 2009 in respect of the performance period
2006 to 2008. 122% of awards made in 2006 under the Global
Performance Share Plan (GPSP) will vest, reﬂecting strong annual
average underlying sales growth (USG) over the three-year period
to the end of 2008 and continued progress towards longer-term
ungeared free cash ﬂow (UFCF) targets. (The performance ranges
for these awards set in 2006 were 3.2% - 5.2% per annum for
USG and €12.5 - €13.7 billion for cumulative UFCF. Awards made
in 2006 under the TSR long-term incentive plan will also vest in
2009. As Unilever’s relative total shareholder return performance
over the period 2006 to 2008 ranks 9th against a comparator
group of peer companies (see page 62) 50% of the awards are
due to vest.
Looking forward to 2009, we believe that Unilever remains well
placed and we expect the new Group leadership team to pursue
the opportunities present even in challenging times and that, as a
result, our shareholders and our executives will be duly rewarded.

Report of the Directors
Report of the Remuneration Committee continued
Role and responsibilities
The Committee is responsible for making proposals to the Boards on the reward policy for Executive Directors and other Unilever
Executive Team members, to ensure that the right incentives are provided to encourage managers to enhance the performance of the
Group. The Committee is also responsible for setting individual reward packages for the Executive Directors and for monitoring and
approving all share-based incentive arrangements. The Committee meets at least three times a year and during 2008 met on ﬁve
occasions.
Structure and role
During 2008 David Simon served as Chairman of the Committee with Jeroen van der Veer and Michael Treschow being members
of the Committee. The Board evaluated the performance of the Committee and the Committee carried out a self-assessment of its
performance.
Advice and assistance
The Committee does not formally retain remuneration consultants. It seeks professional advice from external advisers as and when
required. During 2008, the Committee sought advice from Towers Perrin (an independent ﬁrm of human resources specialists) on
market data, reward trends and performance-related pay. Towers Perrin also provides general consultancy advice to Unilever group
companies on employee rewards, pension, communications and other human resource matters.
The Group Secretary attends all Committee meetings and advises on matters of corporate governance.
The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer is invited to attend Committee meetings to provide his own insights to the Committee on business
objectives and the individual performance of his direct reports. Also, the Chief Human Resource Ofﬁcer can be invited to provide his
expertise to the Committee. Naturally, neither attends when their own remuneration is being discussed.

62 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Report of the Directors
The total remuneration package for Executive Directors is
intended to be competitive in a global market, with a strong
emphasis on performance related pay. Internal and external
comparisons are made with the reward arrangements for other
senior executives within Unilever to support consistent application
of Unilever’s executive reward policies.
A signiﬁcant proportion of the Executive Directors’ total reward
is linked to a number of key measures of Group performance
to create alignment with strategy, business priorities, and
shareholder value. Approximately 70% of the total reward
package is linked to performance.
In setting targets for the performance measures, the Committee
is guided by what would be required to deliver top-third
shareholder value. This is reﬂected in both the short-term and
long-term performance targets.
Base salary
The Remuneration Committee reviews base salary levels annually,
taking into account external benchmarks within the context of
Group and individual performance.
Annual incentive
The annual incentive plan rewards Executive Directors for the
delivery of trading contribution (Unilever’s primary internal
measure of economic value added) and top-line growth targets,
as well as for their individual contribution to Unilever’s business
strategy.
The maximum opportunity for the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer is
200% of salary, with two-thirds based on Unilever’s business
results and a third on individual business targets. The maximum
opportunity for the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer is 160% of salary, with
up to 130% based on business results, the rest on individual
business targets. Target annual incentive levels for both executives
are around 60% of maximum. Aggressive business targets mean
that maximum levels are only payable for exceptional
performance.
The performance criteria for the annual incentive are:
• Trading contribution: Unilever’s primary internal measure of
economic value added. It is calculated from trading result after
a deduction for tax and a charge for asset use. (Trading result
is the internal management measure of proﬁt that is the most
consistent with operating proﬁt). Increases in trading
contribution reﬂect the combined impact of top-line growth,
margin improvement and capital efﬁciency gains. It is well
aligned with our objective of a progressive improvement in
return on invested capital and with shareholder value creation;
• Underlying sales growth: focus on the organic growth of
Unilever’s turnover; and
• Individual business and leadership targets: tailored to each
individual’s responsibilities to deliver certain business objectives
supporting the strategy. Individual contribution is assessed
against robustly set measures and targets to ensure both
objectivity and ‘stretch’.
25% of the annual incentive is delivered to the Executive
Directors in the form of shares in NV and PLC, which are matched
by a conditional award of ‘matching shares’, as further described
under the section on long-term incentives below.
Long-term incentives
The long-term incentive for Executive Directors consists of two
elements, both of which are delivered in shares:
• Global Share Incentive Plan; and
• Share Matching Plan (linked to annual incentive).
Executive Directors are required to demonstrate a signiﬁcant
personal shareholding commitment to Unilever. Within ﬁve years
of appointment, they are expected to hold shares worth at least
150% of their annual base salary. This reinforces the link between
the executives and other shareholders.
Global Share Incentive Plan (GSIP)
Under the GSIP , annual awards of shares in NV and PLC are
granted to Executive Directors along with other senior employees.
The actual number of shares received at vesting after three years
depends on the satisfaction of performance conditions linked to
improvements in Unilever’s performance.
The vesting of shares will be conditional on the achievement of
three distinct performance conditions over the performance
period. The performance period is a 3-year calendar period.
The vesting of 40% of the shares in the award is based on a
condition measuring Unilever’s relative total shareholder return
(TSR) against a comparator group of 20 other companies over
that three-year period. TSR measures the return received by a
shareholder, capturing both the increase in share price and the
value of dividend income (assuming dividends are reinvested).
The TSR results are compared on a single reference currency basis.
No shares (in the portion of the award subject to TSR) will vest if
Unilever is ranked below position 11 of the TSR ranking table over
the three-year period. 50% of the shares will vest if Unilever is
ranked 11th among the peer group, 100% if ranked 7th, and
200% will vest if Unilever is ranked 3rd or above in the table.
Straight-line vesting will occur between these points.
The TSR peer group is as follows:
Avon Kraft
Beiersdorf Lion
Cadbury Schweppes L’Oréal
Clorox Nestlé
Coca-Cola Orkla
Colgate PepsiCo
Danone Procter & Gamble
Heinz Reckitt Benckiser
Kao Sara Lee
Kimberly-Clark Shiseido
The vesting of a further 30% of the shares in the award is
conditional on average underlying sales growth performance
over the three-year period. Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008 63
Report of the Directors
Report of the Remuneration Committee continued
The vesting of the ﬁnal 30% of the shares in the award is
conditional on cumulative ungeared free cash ﬂow performance
which is the basic driver of the returns that Unilever is able to
generate for shareholders.
For the business performance-focused parts of an award there will
be no vesting if performance is below the minimum of the range,
25% vesting for achieving minimum, and 200% vesting only at or
substantially above the top end of the range.
Performance for each condition will be assessed independently
from the other conditions over the performance period. Shares
will only vest if and to the extent that the respective performance
conditions are satisﬁed. There will be no re-testing.
The grant level as a percentage of salary agreed by the
shareholders for the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer is a maximum of
200%, for the current Chief Financial Ofﬁcer a maximum of
340% and for any other Executive Director a maximum of just
below 180%. The vesting will range between 0% and 200% of
grant level.
Share Matching Plan (linked to the annual incentive)
The Share Matching Plan enhances the alignment with
shareholders’ interests and supports the retention of key
executives. In addition, the necessity to hold the shares for
a minimum period of three years supports the shareholding
requirements.
The Executive Directors receive 25% of their annual incentive
in the form of NV and PLC shares. These are matched with an
equivalent number of matching shares. The matching shares will
vest after three years provided that the underlying shares have
been retained during this period and the Executive Director has
not resigned or been dismissed.
The Remuneration Committee considers that there is no need for
further performance conditions on the vesting of the matching
shares because the number of shares is directly linked to
the annual incentive (which is itself subject to demanding
performance conditions). In addition, during the three-year
vesting period the share price of NV and PLC will be inﬂuenced
by the performance of Unilever. This, in turn, will affect the
ultimate value of the matching shares on vesting.
Executive Directors’ pensions
The policy is that Executive Directors will be members of the
all-employee pension arrangement in their home country (or an
alternative of similar value) and will pay employee contributions
at the same rate as other employees in that arrangement.
Other beneﬁts and allowances
Executive Directors enjoy similar beneﬁts to those enjoyed by
many other employees of Unilever.
Serving as non-executive on the Board of another company
It is recognised that Executive Directors may be invited to become
Non-Executive Directors of other companies and that these
appointments, subject to the approval of the Chairman and
the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, may broaden their knowledge and
experience to the beneﬁt of the Group (see page 18 for details in
the biographies). From 2008, if Executive Directors are serving on
the Board of other companies they have been permitted to retain
all remuneration and fees earned from outside directorships
subject to a maximum of one outside directorship. (see Other
appointments on page 47 for further details). Patrick Cescau, who
retired from Unilever on 31 December 2008, received an annual
fee of £70 000 from Pearson plc as a non-executive director. Of
that, 25% of the basic fee (totalling £15 000) was paid in Pearson
plc shares. Jim Lawrence was a non-executive director of Avnet
Inc up to 15 July 2008 in respect of which he received a fee of
$53 750 and a stock award in that company to the value of
$120 000. He is also a non-executive director of British Airways
Plc and received an annual fee of £40 000.
Future developments
The Remuneration Committee continues to monitor trends and
changes in the market. It keeps a watching brief on the
continuing alignment between Unilever’s strategic objectives and
the reward policy for Executive Directors. Due to the
unprecedented economic turmoil and the impact of the economic
downturn the salaries for 2009 will be frozen at the 2008 level. Report of the Remuneration Committee continued

Comments on base salary 2008
For 2008, base salary levels were benchmarked against those paid in other major global companies based in Europe, excluding
companies in the ﬁnancial sector. The increases for 2008 reﬂect changes in market levels as well as individual and Group performance.
Comments on base salary 2009
Due to the unprecedented economic turmoil and the impact of the economic downturn the salaries for 2009 will be frozen at the
2008 level.
Comments on annual incentive 2008
The annual incentive awards for 2008 were subject to achievement of underlying sales growth and trading contribution targets in
combination with individual strategic business targets. The Committee measured the results against the targets set and determined the
annual incentive amounts for 2008. The award levels reﬂect Unilever’s strong underlying sales growth and improved margin
performance as well as delivery on individual business targets. Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008 65

Comments on long-term incentive arrangements 2008
• Global Share Incentive Plan
Awards have been made under this plan since 2007. Vesting will start as from 2010 (three years after the ﬁrst award). The
performance period for the annual award that was made in 2008 is 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2010.
• Share Matching Plan
In 2008 the matching shares originally granted in 2005 on a conditional basis vested, subject to fulﬁlment of the retention conditions.
No shares or options have been awarded since 2007 under the following Plans. Awards made before 2007 will vest at the normal
(previously agreed) dates. Since 2007 share awards are only made under the Global Share Incentive Plan that was agreed by
shareholders in 2007.
• Global Performance Share Plan
Awards under this plan were made in 2005 and 2006. Vesting of the award made in 2005 was in May 2008 (performance period
1 January 2005 – 31 December 2007) and the 2006 award will vest in 2009 (performance period 1 January 2006 – 31 December
2008). Vesting of the 2005 award in 2008 was based on average annual underlying sales growth (50% of the award) and
cumulative ungeared free cash ﬂow (50% of the award) over the three-year period to 31 December 2007. The performance ranges,
set in 2005, were 2-4% per annum average underlying sales growth (USG) and for ungeared free cash ﬂow (UFCF) €12.2 billion –
€13.2 billion. The targets were set before the disposals of the European frozen foods businesses and Unilever Cosmetics
International. The targets have been adjusted by the impacts of these disposals. The vesting level for threshold performance was
25% of the relevant portion of the award and 200% for performance at or above the top of the range. The strong improvements in
Unilever’s performance over this period led to 121% of awards vesting. Report of the Remuneration Committee continued
66 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Report of the Directors
• TSR Plan
In 2008 the conditional shares awarded in 2005 vested for 50%. Vesting was based on the TSR performance of Unilever (when
ranked against its deﬁned peer group with competitors) over the three-year performance period which ended 31 December 2007. For
this period, Unilever ranked 8th in its peer group and therefore 50% vesting occurred for this award in March 2008.
• Executive Share Options
The grants of executive share options made in 2005 became exercisable as from 2008. The 2005 award was a premium grant and
therefore at vesting no further conditions applied.
Executive Directors’ Global Share Incentive Plan
The Global Share Incentive Plan was approved by shareholders at the 2007 AGMs.

Comments on pensions
Jim Lawrence is a member of the Unilever International Pension Plan (IPP), a deﬁned contribution arrangement. In line with current
policy, the contribution structure is equivalent in value to the all-employee plan in the USA, his home country. The current rate of
company contributions is 9% of base salary and he makes a personal contribution of 5% of base salary (by individual salary sacriﬁce).
The company contributions paid in 2008 cover the period from September 2007, his date of hire.
Paul Polman will be offered membership of a deﬁned contribution pension plan. In line with current policy, the contribution structure
will be broadly equivalent in value to the all-employee plan in the Netherlands, his home country. The company will contribute 15% of
his base salary and he will make a personal contribution similar to other managers in the Netherlands. To compensate for the forfeiture
of pension from his previous employer, additional company contributions of 12% of base salary with investment returns in line with his
deﬁned contribution pension account will vest at age 60 or later at actual retirement.
Three Executive Directors retired from Unilever during 2008. Patrick Cescau stepped down from the Boards and retired at year end aged
60 and 3 months. His pension is payable from 31 December 2008. Kees van der Graaf stepped down from the Boards at the AGMs in
May 2008 and retired on 31 May 2008. His pension is payable from 1 March 2009. His retirement terms were in line with Unilever’s
normal practice for long-serving senior executives in the Netherlands. Ralph Kugler stepped down from the Boards at the AGMs and
left the company on 31 May 2008. His pension is payable from 1 March 2009. His retirement terms were in line with Unilever’s normal
practice for long-serving senior executives in the UK.

(a) Figures have been translated into euros where necessary using the following exchange rates: 31 December 2007 €1.00 = £0.7342, $1.471
31 December 2008 €1.00 = £0.9773, $1,471; average for the year ended 31 December 2008 €1.00 = £0.7880, $1.468.
(b) Includes the effect of inﬂation on the accrued pension at 31 December 2007 and the impact on the accrued pension of changes to the
payment dates of the pensions during the year. In the case of Patrick Cescau no pension accrued after age 60 and in the case of Kees van
der Graaf and Ralph Kugler the pensions were recalculated for early retirement. See note (c) for details.
(c) Based on the Executive Directors’ pension beneﬁts that have now crystallised and become payable from 31 December 2008 in the case of
Patrick Cescau and 1 March 2009 in the cases of Kees van der Graaf and Ralph Kugler (rather than the normal retirement date). It includes
all pensions provided from Unilever pension plans.
(d) The Netherlands-based Executive Director’s arrangement is calculated on the basis used by the Unilever Netherlands pension plan
(Progress), as prescribed by the Netherlands Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment. This basis changed for accounting periods ending
after 1 January 2008. Calculated on the old basis the transfer value at 31 December 2007 was €8 975 000. The UK-based Executive
Directors’ arrangement is calculated on the market-related basis used by the Unilever United Kingdom Pension Fund (UUKPF). This basis has
changed during 2008. Calculated on the old basis, the transfer values at 31 December 2007 for Patrick Cescau and Ralph Kugler were
€20 617 000 and €6 502 000. The transfer values at 31 December 2008 were calculated using market conditions at December 2008 for
Patrick Cescau and May 2008 for Ralph Kugler.
(e) The movement in transfer values during 2008 includes market changes, together with additional service, the Executive Directors being one
year closer to retirement and exchange rate movements (for pensions denominated in currencies other than euros). For Patrick Cescau also
includes the impact of his salary increase effective from 1 January 2008. For Kees van der Graaf and Ralph Kugler includes the
enhancement for early retirement of €542 000 and €2 515 000 respectively.
(f) Consistent with employees in the current Unilever Netherlands pension plan, the rate of individual contributions paid by Kees van der Graaf
is 0.5% of pensionable salary between €12 209 and €58 993 and 1% on the balance. Consistent with employees in the Unilever United
Kingdom pension plan, Ralph Kugler’s contributions are paid through salary sacriﬁce at 7% of pensionable salary (5% of pensionable salary
from January to March) above the UK Lower Earnings Limit, and as such no individual contributions are shown above. Patrick Cescau’s
contributions on the part of his salary paid in the Netherlands are paid on the basis of the old Unilever Netherlands pension plan, at 1%
above €58 993. His contribution on the part of his salary paid in the UK are consistent with employees in the Unilever United Kingdom
pension plan, paid through salary sacriﬁce at 7% of pensionable salary (5% of pensionable salary from January to March) above the UK
Lower Earnings Limit.
(g) Stepped down from the Boards and retired on 31 December 2008. Attained age 60 on 27 September 2008, accrued no additional pension
for service thereafter.
(h) Stepped down from the Boards at the AGMs in May 2008 with pension payable from 1 March 2009. The values shown in the table are at
31 May 2008, or the period ending on that date, as appropriate, and include the enhancement for early retirement. Life cover beneﬁts
continued to be payable as if still in employment up to 1 March 2009. Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008 71

Non-Executive Directors
The following section contains detailed information and commentary on the Non-Executive Directors’ annual fees and share interests.
The Non-Executive Directors receive fees from both NV and PLC. No other remuneration is given in respect of their non-executive duties
from either NV or PLC, such as annual incentives, share-based incentives or pension beneﬁts.
The fee levels are benchmarked against those paid in other global companies based in Europe, excluding companies in the ﬁnancial
sector. The level of their fees reﬂects their commitment and contribution to Unilever.
In 2007 the shareholders agreed to a total maximum limit of £2 000 000 (€3 000 000).

Unilever’s share performance relative to broad-based equity indices
The UK Companies Act 1985 (schedule 7A) requires us to show Unilever’s relative share performance, based on Total Shareholder
Return, against a holding of shares in a broad-based equity index for the last ﬁve years. The Remuneration Committee has decided to
show Unilever’s performance against two indices, namely the FTSE 100 Index, London, and the Euronext, Amsterdam, as these are the
most generally used indices in the UK and the Netherlands, where we have our principal listings.
The Report has been approved by the Boards. Signed on behalf of the Boards by Sven Dumoulin (Group Secretary).

Report of the Directors Report of the Audit Committee
The role of the Audit Committee is to assist the Unilever Boards in
fulﬁlling their oversight responsibilities regarding the integrity of
Unilever’s ﬁnancial statements, risk management and internal
control, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the
external auditors’ performance, qualiﬁcations and independence,
and the performance of the internal audit function. During the
year ended 31 December 2008 the principal activities of the
Committee were as follows:
Financial statements
The Committee considered reports from the Chief Financial
Ofﬁcer on the quarterly and annual ﬁnancial statements, including
other ﬁnancial statements and disclosures prior to their
publication and issues reviewed by the Disclosure Committee.
They also reviewed the Annual Report and Accounts and Annual
Report on Form 20-F prior to publication.
Audit of the Annual Accounts
PricewaterhouseCoopers, Unilever’s external auditors, reported in
depth to the Committee on the scope and outcome of the annual
audit, including their audit of internal control over ﬁnancial
reporting as required by Section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002. Their reports included accounting matters,
governance and control, and accounting developments.
Risk management and internal control arrangements
The Committee reviewed Unilever's overall approach to risk
management and control, and its processes, outcomes and
disclosure, including speciﬁcally:
• review of level of disclosure in quarterly ﬁnancial results
announcements;
• review of accounting principles and judgements with respect
to ﬁnancial statements, including the annual impairment review
of goodwill and intangibles;
• review of the analysis supporting the going concern judgement
of the 2008 Annual Report and Accounts;
• Corporate Audit’s interim and year-end reports on the Status of
Risk Management and Control, and management’s response;
• annual report from the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer on business risks
and positive assurance on operating controls and corporate
policies; and a quarterly review of business risks and safeguards;
• the interim and year-end reports from the Code of Business
Principles Compliance Committee;
• monitoring the resolution of complaints received through the
global Ethics hotline including procedures for handling
complaints and concerns relating to accounting, internal control
and auditing matters;
• quarterly review of progress of the application of the
requirements under Section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002 with respect to internal controls over ﬁnancial
reporting;
• review of the application of information and communication
technology;
• a review of the annual pension report and the impact of
ﬁnancial volatility on pensions;
• annual review of anti-fraud arrangements;
• a review of tax planning policy;
• review of treasury policies, including debt issuance and
hedging;
• review of the annual ﬁnancial plan; and
• review of the revised dividend policy
External auditors
The Audit Committee conducted a formal evaluation of the
effectiveness of the external audit process. The Committee has
approved the extension of the current external audit contract by
one year, and recommended to the Boards the reappointment of
the external auditors. On the recommendation of the Audit
Committee, the Directors will be proposing the reappointment of
PricewaterhouseCoopers at the AGMs in May 2009 (see pages
146 and 151).
Both Unilever and the auditors have for many years had safeguards
in place to avoid the possibility that the auditors’ objectivity
and independence could be compromised. The Committee
reviewed the report from PricewaterhouseCoopers on the actions
they take to comply with the professional and regulatory
requirements and best practice designed to ensure their
independence from Unilever.
The Committee also reviewed the statutory audit, other audit,
tax and other services provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers, and
compliance with Unilever’s policy, which prescribes in detail the
types of engagements for which the external auditors can and
cannot be used:
• statutory audit services – as detailed above, including audit of
subsidiaries;
• other audit services – work which regulations or agreements
with third parties require the auditors to undertake e.g. in
connection with borrowings and shareholder services;
• other services – statutory auditors may carry out work that they
are best placed to undertake, including internal control reviews;
• acquisition and disposal services – where the auditors are best
placed to do this work;
• tax services – all signiﬁcant tax consulting work is put to tender,
except where the auditors are best placed to do this; and
• general consulting – external auditors may not tender for
general consulting work.
All engagements over €100 000 require speciﬁc advance approval
of the Audit Committee Chairman. The overall policy is regularly
reviewed and, where necessary, updated in the light of internal
developments, external developments and best practice.
The Committee held independent meetings with the external
auditors during the year.
Internal audit function
The Committee reviewed the Corporate Audit department’s audit
plan for the year, and agreed its budget and resource
requirements. The Committee carried out a formal evaluation of
the performance of the internal audit function which included a
review of a report by an external assessor and conﬁrmed that they
were satisﬁed with the effectiveness of the function. The
Committee held independent meetings with the Chief Auditor
during the year.
Audit Committee terms of reference
The Audit Committee’s terms of reference are reviewed annually
by the Committee taking into account relevant legislation and
recommended good practice. The terms of reference can be
viewed on Unilever’s website at
www.unilever.com/investorrelations/corp_governance or supplied
on request.
Board Assessment of the Audit Committee
The Board evaluated the performance of the Committee and the
Committee carried out a self-assessment of its performance.

Report of the Directors
Report of the Corporate Responsibility and Reputation Committee
Terms of reference
The Corporate Responsibility and Reputation Committee oversees
Unilever's conduct as a responsible multinational business. It is
also charged with ensuring that Unilever’s reputation is protected
and enhanced. Inherent in this is the need to identify any external
developments which are likely to have an inﬂuence upon
Unilever’s standing in society and to bring these to the attention
of the UEx.
The Committee comprises three independent Non-Executive
Directors: Leon Brittan (Chairman), Hixonia Nyasulu and Narayana
Murthy. In 2008 two members of the Committee stood down:
Executive Director Ralph Kugler, who retired from Unilever in May,
and Geneviève Berger, who stepped down as a Non-Executive
Director to join the Unilever Executive in July.
To ensure it maintains a strategic overview of current and
emerging sustainability issues, the Committee beneﬁts from the
insights of the Unilever Sustainable Development Group (USDG) –
a body of ﬁve experts who advise on Unilever’s sustainability
strategy. A multi-functional group of senior leaders from across
the business (the Corporate Responsibility, Issues, Sustainability

Committee’s discussions. Both groups are chaired by the President
Foods, Home and Personal Care and member of the Unilever
Executive, Vindi Banga.

Group are available on our website at

Meetings
As part of its watching brief on current issues of concern to
society, the Committee reviewed a range of topics in 2008.
Amongst these were: Unilever’s approach to animal testing; the
emerging science of nanotechnology; sustainable farming;
melamine contamination in products containing Chinese milk; the
Group’s operations in Zimbabwe and the Occupied Territories; and
competition-related issues. Subjects that received particular
scrutiny are listed below.
Business risk
Committee members reviewed Unilever’s process for assessing
business risk, focusing on how current and future risks are
identiﬁed and fed into management and business planning.
Code of Business Principles
Unilever’s Code of Business Principles sets out the standards of
conduct to which we expect our employees to adhere. In 2008
Unilever strengthened its management of the Code by appointing
a new full-time Global Code Ofﬁcer. Priorities for the new role
include building a network of country code ofﬁcers, improving
training and developing and sharing best practice. A new online
training module on the Code was piloted in 2008. The
Committee endorsed these actions as they are key in ensuring
that Unilever’s standards of conduct are well understood and
enforced effectively. The new Global Code Ofﬁcer attended a
meeting of the Committee shortly after taking up his
appointment and reported on his plans and initial impressions.
Business Partner Code
Unilever’s Business Partner Code sets the standards that we expect
of suppliers in areas such as health and safety at work, business
integrity, respect for labour standards, consumer safety and
safeguarding the environment. Unilever’s supply management
function is responsible for the roll-out of the Business Partner
Code and for gaining supplier assurance.
As this is an important area of risk and reputation management,
the Committee emphasised the need for detailed standards and
strong governance. In 2008, a programme of audits was piloted
to assess compliance with the Code. These pilots were used to
inform the development of a new supplier assurance policy
setting out operational practices and standards to deliver the
Code’s commitments. Governance is via the Corporate Code
Committee which oversees the operation of both the Business
Partner Code and the Code of Business Principles.
See www.unilever.com/investorrelations/corp_governance for the
full text of the Code of Business Principles and Business Partner
Code.
Labour standards
Between 2006 and 2008, four complaints have been brought to
Unilever’s attention by the International Union of Food Workers
(IUF) and the transport union TUMTIS. These concern site closure,
freedom of association, collective bargaining and the use of
temporary and contracted labour at our factories in India and
Pakistan and a supplier’s factory in Turkey. Under the terms of the
OECD’s Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the unions have
referred their complaints to the OECD’s national contact points in
the UK and Turkey for investigation. Unilever is seeking local
resolution to these issues as well as co-operating fully with the
OECD process.
Committee members stressed the need for active management of
these matters. The UEx has agreed a set of procedures and the
appointment of a senior manager to address these complaints
more rapidly. Unilever is also reviewing its policies and practices to
ensure that it continues to act within the law, as well as
upholding the UN Global Compact’s principles on human and
labour rights and following the OECD Guidelines for Multinational
Enterprises. The Committee decided to give high priority to the
monitoring of these developments. 76 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Report of the Directors
Report of the Corporate Responsibility and Reputation Committee continued
Sustainable sourcing of palm oil
Unilever buys around 4% of world palm oil production for use
across its portfolio, from soaps to spreads. In May 2008 Unilever
announced its intention to source all its palm oil from certiﬁed
sustainable sources by 2015. This is a major step that reﬂects our
concern that the palm oil industry in Indonesia and Malaysia
contributes to the destruction of the world’s rainforests.
Unilever has taken the lead in setting up a coalition of like-
minded companies, banks and NGOs. This seeks to break the link
between the cultivation of oil palm and deforestation by
accelerating the move towards certiﬁed sustainable palm oil.
Unilever is working with Greenpeace to promote this aim.
The Committee emphasised the need for robust sustainability
certiﬁcation standards as the credibility of the initiative depends
heavily on such third-party certiﬁcation. Unilever continues to
work via the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil to reﬁne these
sustainability criteria and standards.

Annual accounts
The Directors are required by Title 9, Book 2 of the Civil Code in
the Netherlands and the United Kingdom Companies Act 1985
to prepare accounts for each ﬁnancial year which give a true and
fair view of the state of affairs of the Unilever Group, and the NV
and PLC entities as at the end of the ﬁnancial year and of the
proﬁt or loss and cash ﬂows for that year.
The Directors consider that, in preparing the accounts, the Group
and the NV and PLC entities have used the most appropriate
accounting policies, consistently applied and supported by
reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates, and that all
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU
and as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (in
the case of the consolidated accounts) and United Kingdom
accounting standards (in the case of the parent company accounts)
which they consider to be applicable have been followed.
The Directors have responsibility for ensuring that NV and PLC
keep accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy
their ﬁnancial position and which enable the Directors to ensure
that the accounts comply with the relevant legislation. They also
have a general responsibility for taking such steps as are
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group,
and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
This statement, which should be read in conjunction with the
Auditors’ report, is made with a view to distinguishing for
shareholders the respective responsibilities of the Directors
and of the auditors in relation to the accounts.
A copy of the ﬁnancial statements of the Unilever Group is
placed on our website at www.unilever.com/investorrelations The
maintenance and integrity of the website are the responsibility of
the Directors, and the work carried out by the auditors does not
involve consideration of these matters. Accordingly, the auditors
accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred
to the ﬁnancial statements since they were initially placed on the
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands
governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
UK law sets out additional responsibilities for the Directors of
PLC regarding disclosure of information to auditors. Disclosure
in respect of these responsibilities is made on page 151.
Directors’ responsibility statement
Each of the Directors conﬁrms that, to the best of his or her
knowledge:
• the ﬁnancial statements which have been prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as
adopted by the EU and as issued by the International
Accounting Standards Board (in the case of the consolidated
accounts) and United Kingdom accounting standards (in the
case of the PLC parent company accounts) and United Kingdom
accounting standards and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil
Code (in the case of the NV parent company accounts), give a
true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position and
proﬁt or loss of the Group and the NV and PLC entities taken
as a whole; and
• the Report of the Directors includes a fair review of the
development and performance of the business and the position
of the Group and the NV and the PLC entities taken as a
whole, together with a description of the principal risks and
uncertainties they face.
The Directors and their functions are listed on pages 18 and 19.
Going concern
The activities of the Group, together with the factors likely to
affect its future development, performance and position are set
out on pages 1 to 17 and 20 to 34. The ﬁnancial position of the
Group, its cash ﬂows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities
are described in the Financial Review on pages 35 to 43. In
addition, we describe in note 17 on pages 108 to 113 the
Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital;
its ﬁnancial risk management objectives; details of its ﬁnancial
instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit and
liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable ﬁnancial resources together with
established business relationships with many customers and
suppliers in countries throughout the world. As a consequence,
the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its
business risks successfully despite the current uncertain outlook.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the
Annual Report and Accounts.
Internal and disclosure controls and procedures
Please refer to pages 25 to 27 for a discussion of Unilever’s
principal risk factors and to page 28 for commentary on the
Group’s approach to risk management and control.

Independent auditor’s report to the shareholders
of Unilever N.V.
Report on the consolidated accounts
We have audited the consolidated accounts which are part of
the Annual Report 2008 of the Unilever Group for the year ended
31 December 2008 which comprise the consolidated income
statement, consolidated balance sheet, consolidated cash ﬂow
statement, consolidated statement of recognised income and
expense and a summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies and
other explanatory notes on pages 81 to 136 and 140 to 141.
We have reported separately on the company accounts of
Unilever N.V. for the year ended 31 December 2008.
Directors’ responsibility
The Directors are responsible for the preparation and fair
presentation of the consolidated accounts in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the
European Union and as issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Netherlands
Civil Code, and for the preparation of the Report of the Directors
in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil
Code. This responsibility includes: designing, implementing and
maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair
presentation of the consolidated accounts that are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; selecting
and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making
accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
Auditor’s responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated
accounts based on our audit. We conducted our audit in
accordance with Dutch law. This law requires that we comply
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance whether the consolidated accounts
are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence
about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated accounts.
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement,
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement
of the consolidated accounts, whether due to fraud or error. In
making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal
control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation
of the consolidated accounts in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s
internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the
reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Directors,
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated
accounts.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufﬁcient
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the consolidated accounts give a true and
fair view of the ﬁnancial position of the Unilever Group as at
31 December 2008, and of its result and its cash ﬂows for the
year then ended in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and as
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and
with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
Pursuant to the legal requirement under 2:393 sub 5 part f
of the Netherlands Civil Code, we report, to the extent of our
competence, that the Report of the Directors is consistent with
the consolidated accounts as required by 2:391 sub 4 of the
Netherlands Civil Code.

Independent auditors’ report to the shareholders of
Unilever PLC on the consolidated accounts
We have audited the consolidated accounts of the Unilever
Group for the year ended 31 December 2008 which comprise
the consolidated income statement, consolidated balance sheet,
consolidated cash ﬂow statement, consolidated statement of
recognised income and expense, the related notes on pages 81 to
136, and principal group companies and non-current investments
on pages 140 and 141. These consolidated accounts have been
prepared under the accounting policies set out in note 1 on pages
84 to 88.
We have reported separately on the parent company accounts of
Unilever PLC for the year ended 31 December 2008 and on the
information in the Report of the Remuneration Committee that
is described as having been audited.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and
consolidated accounts in accordance with applicable law and
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by
the European Union and as issued by the International
Accounting Standards Board are set out in the Statement of
Directors’ Responsibilities on page 78, and on page 152.
Our responsibility is to audit the consolidated accounts in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report,
including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the
shareholders of Unilever PLC as a body in accordance with
Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other
purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the consolidated
accounts give a true and fair view and whether the consolidated
accounts have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also
report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the
Report of the Directors (excluding the audited part of the Report
of the Remuneration Committee) is consistent with the
consolidated accounts.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for
our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law regarding Directors’
remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement
reﬂects the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the
Combined Code (2006) speciﬁed for our review by the Listing
Rules of the United Kingdom Financial Services Authority, and
we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether
the Directors’ statements on internal control cover all risks and
controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s
corporate governance procedures or its risk and control
procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and
consider whether it is consistent with the audited consolidated
accounts. The other information comprises only the Report of
the Directors (excluding the audited part of the Report of the
Remuneration Committee), the Shareholder information, the
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities and the Financial record.
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware
of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with
the consolidated accounts. Our responsibilities do not extend to
any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis,
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated accounts. It also includes an assessment of the
signiﬁcant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in
the preparation of the consolidated accounts, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the consolidated accounts are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or
error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the consolidated
accounts.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the consolidated accounts give a true and fair view, in
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union,
of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2008
and of its proﬁt and cash ﬂows for the year then ended;
• the consolidated accounts have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the
IAS Regulation; and
• the information given in the Report of the Directors is
consistent with the consolidated accounts.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRS
As explained in note 1 to the consolidated accounts, the Group in
addition to complying with its legal obligation to comply with IFRS
as adopted by the European Union has also complied with IFRS as
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
In our opinion the consolidated accounts give a true and fair
view, in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International
Accounting Standards Board, of the state of the Group’s affairs as
at 31 December 2008 and of its proﬁt and cash ﬂows for the year
then ended.

1 Accounting information and policies
The accounting policies adopted are the same as those which applied
for the previous ﬁnancial year, except as set out below under the
heading of ‘Companies legislation and accounting standards’.
Unilever
The two parent companies, NV and PLC, together with their group
companies, operate as a single economic entity (the Unilever Group,
also referred to as Unilever or the Group). NV and PLC have the same
Directors and are linked by a series of agreements, including an
Equalisation Agreement, which are designed so that the position of
the shareholders of both companies is as nearly as possible the same
as if they held shares in a single company.
The Equalisation Agreement provides that both companies adopt
the same accounting principles and requires as a general rule

nominal of ordinary share capital of PLC, as if each such unit of
capital formed part of the ordinary capital of one and the same
company. For additional information please refer to ‘Corporate
governance’ on page 51.
Basis of consolidation
Due to the operational and contractual arrangements referred to
above, NV and PLC form a single reporting entity for the purposes
of presenting consolidated accounts. Accordingly, the accounts of
Unilever are presented by both NV and PLC as their respective
consolidated accounts. Group companies included in the consolidation
are those companies controlled by NV or PLC. Control exists when the
Group has the power to govern the ﬁnancial and operating policies of
an entity so as to obtain beneﬁts from its activities.
The net assets and results of acquired businesses are included in the
consolidated accounts from their respective dates of acquisition, being
the date on which the Group obtains control. The results of disposed
businesses are included in the consolidated accounts up to their date
of disposal, being the date control ceases.
Companies legislation and accounting standards
The consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by
the European Union (EU) and in accordance with Book 2 of the Civil
Code in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom Companies Acts
1985 and 2006. They are also in compliance with IFRS as issued by
the International Accounting Standards Board.
The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention unless
otherwise indicated.
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the
previous ﬁnancial year except that the Group has adopted the
amendments to IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and
Measurement’ and IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ with
effect from 1 July 2008, with no effect, and IFRIC Interpretation 14
‘IAS 19 - The Limit on a Deﬁned Beneﬁt Asset, Minimum Funding
Requirements and their Interaction’ with effect from 1 January 2008,
with no material effect on the ﬁnancial statements of the Group.
Foreign currencies
Items included in the ﬁnancial statements of group companies are
measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in
which each entity operates (its functional currency). The consolidated
ﬁnancial statements are presented in euros. The functional currencies
of NV and PLC are euros and sterling respectively.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional
currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the
settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end
exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except
when deferred in equity as qualifying hedges. Those arising on trading
transactions are taken to operating proﬁt; those arising on cash,
ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are classiﬁed as ﬁnance income
or cost.
In preparing the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, the income
statement, the cash ﬂow statement and all other movements in assets
and liabilities are translated at annual average rates of exchange.
The balance sheet, other than the ordinary share capital of NV and
PLC, is translated at year-end rates of exchange. In the case of hyper-
inﬂationary economies, which are those in which inﬂation exceeds
100% cumulatively over a three-year period, the accounts are
adjusted to reﬂect current price levels and remove the inﬂuences
of inﬂation before being translated.
The ordinary share capital of NV and PLC is translated in accordance
with the Equalisation Agreement. The difference between the
resulting value for PLC and the value derived by applying the year-end
rate of exchange is taken to other reserves (see note 23 on page 123).
The effects of exchange rate changes during the year on net
assets at the beginning of the year are recorded as a movement in
shareholders’ equity, as is the difference between proﬁt of the year
retained at average rates of exchange and at year-end rates of
exchange. For these purposes net assets include loans between group
companies and related foreign exchange contracts, if any, for which
settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable
future. Exchange gains/losses on hedges of net assets are also
recorded as a movement in equity.
Cumulative exchange differences arising since the date of transition to
IFRS of 1 January 2004 are reported as a separate component of
other reserves (see note 23 on page 123). In the event of disposal or
part disposal of an interest in a group company either through sale or
as a result of a repayment of capital, the cumulative exchange
difference is recognised in the income statement as part of the proﬁt
or loss on disposal of group companies.
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition
accounting method. This involves recognising identiﬁable assets
and liabilities of the acquired business at fair value as at the date of
acquisition.
Acquisitions of minority interests are accounted for using the parent
entity method, whereby the difference between the consideration
and the book value of the share of the net assets acquired is recognised
as goodwill.
Goodwill
Goodwill (being the difference between the fair value of consideration
paid for new interests in group companies and the fair value of the
Group’s share of their net identiﬁable assets and contingent liabilities
at the date of acquisition) is capitalised. Goodwill is not amortised,
but is subject to an annual review for impairment (or more frequently
if necessary). Any impairment is charged to the income statement as it
arises.

Financial statements Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group
Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008 85
Financial statements
1 Accounting information and policies (continued)
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a
business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each
of the Group’s cash generating units, or groups of cash generating
units, that are expected to beneﬁt from the synergies of the
combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the
acquired business are assigned to those units or group of units. Each
unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents
the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored
for internal management purposes, and is not larger than a segment
based on either the Group’s primary or the Group’s secondary
reporting format.
Intangible assets
On acquisition of group companies, Unilever recognises any
speciﬁcally identiﬁable intangible assets separately from goodwill,
initially measuring the intangible assets at fair value as at the date of
acquisition. Separately purchased intangible assets are initially
measured at cost. Finite-lived intangible assets mainly comprise
patented and non-patented technology, know-how and software.
These assets are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis in
the income statement over the period of their expected useful lives, or
the period of legal rights if shorter, none of which exceeds ten years.
Periods in excess of ﬁve years are used only where the Directors are
satisﬁed that the life of these assets will clearly exceed that period.
Indeﬁnite-lived intangibles are not amortised, but are subject to an
annual review for impairment (or more frequently if necessary). Any
impairment is charged to the income statement as it arises.
Unilever monitors the level of product development costs against
all the criteria set out in IAS 38. These include the requirement to
establish that a ﬂow of economic beneﬁts is probable before costs are
capitalised. For Unilever this is evident only shortly before a product is
launched into the market. The level of costs incurred after these
criteria have been met is currently insigniﬁcant.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less depreciation
and impairment. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis at
percentages of cost based on the expected average useful lives of the
assets and their residual values which are reviewed periodically.
Estimated useful lives by major class of assets are as follows:
Freehold buildings 40 years
(no depreciation on freehold land)
Leasehold buildings 40 years*
Plant and equipment 2–20 years
*or life of lease if less than 40 years
Property, plant and equipment is subject to review for impairment
if triggering events or circumstances indicate that this is necessary.
Any impairment is charged to the income statement as it arises.
Other non-current assets
Joint ventures are undertakings in which the Group has an interest
and which are jointly controlled by the Group and one or more other
parties. Associates are undertakings in which the Group has an
investment and can exercise signiﬁcant inﬂuence.
Interests in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the
equity method and are stated in the consolidated balance sheet at
cost, adjusted for the movement in the Group’s share of their net
assets and liabilities. The Group’s share of the proﬁt or loss after tax
of joint ventures and associates is included in the Group’s
consolidated proﬁt before taxation.
Biological assets are stated at fair value less estimated point-of-sale
costs.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are recognised when the Group becomes party
to the contract. They are initially measured at fair value (the transaction
price) adjusted, in the case of instruments not classiﬁed as fair value
through proﬁt or loss, by directly attributable transaction costs.
Financial assets
Market purchases and sales of ﬁnancial assets are recognised using
value date accounting. Financial assets, other than those which are
ﬁnancial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss, are initially
recognised at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs. Any
impairment of a ﬁnancial asset is charged to the income statement as
it arises.
Financial assets are classiﬁed according to the purpose for which
they were acquired. This gives rise to the following categories: held-
to-maturity investments, loans and receivables, available-for-sale
ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss.
Unilever determines the classiﬁcation of its investments at initial
recognition.
Held-to-maturity investments
Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with
ﬁxed or determinable payments and ﬁxed maturities that management
has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. They are
included in non-current investments at amortised cost using the effective
interest method, less any amounts written off to reﬂect impairment.
Any impairment is charged to the income statement as it arises.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed
or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They arise when the Group provides money, goods or services directly
to a counterparty with no intention of trading the receivable. Loans
and receivables are included in trade and other receivables in the
balance sheet at amortised cost.
Short-term loans and receivables are initially measured at original
invoice amount and subsequently measured after deducting any
provision for impairment. Any impairment is charged to the income
statement as it arises.
Available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets
Available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets
that are either designated in this category or not classiﬁed in any of
the other categories. They are included in non-current assets unless
management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months
of the balance sheet date. When securities classiﬁed as available-for-
sale are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments
recognised in equity are included in the income statement. Interest on
available-for-sale securities calculated using the effective interest rate
method is recognised in the income statement within other income.
Dividends on available-for-sale equity instruments are recognised in
the income statement within other income when the Group’s right to
receive payment is established.
Financial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss
A ﬁnancial asset is classiﬁed in this category if acquired principally for
the purpose of selling in the short term or if so designated. Derivatives
are also classiﬁed in this category unless they are designated as
hedges. Assets in this category are classiﬁed as current assets if they
are either held-for-trading or are expected to be realised within 12
months of the balance sheet date. Directly attributable transaction
costs related to the purchase of the assets are expensed as incurred.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in the
income statement. Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group
86 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Financial statements
1 Accounting information and policies (continued)
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value, net of
transaction costs incurred. Financial liabilities are subsequently stated
at amortised cost unless they are part of a fair value hedge
accounting relationship; any difference between the amount on initial
recognition and the redemption value is recognised in the income
statement over the period of the ﬁnancial liabilities using the effective
interest method. Those ﬁnancial liabilities that are part of a fair value
hedge accounting relationship are also recorded on an amortised cost
basis, plus or minus the fair value attributable to the risk being
hedged with a corresponding entry in the income statement.
Short-term ﬁnancial liabilities are measured at original invoice
amount. Borrowing costs are not capitalised as part of property,
plant and equipment.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
Derivatives are measured on the balance sheet at fair value as at the
balance sheet date. The activities of the Group expose it primarily to
the ﬁnancial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and
interest rates. The Group uses foreign exchange forward contracts,
interest rate swap contracts and forward rate agreements to hedge
these exposures. The Group also uses commodity contracts to hedge
future requirements for certain raw materials, almost always for
physical delivery. Those contracts that can also be settled in cash are
treated as a ﬁnancial instrument. The Group does not use derivative
ﬁnancial instruments for speculative purposes. The use of leveraged
instruments is not permitted.
Changes in the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments that
do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income
statement as they arise.
Derivatives embedded in other ﬁnancial instruments or other host
contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and
characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and
the host contracts are carried at fair value with unrealised gains
or losses reported in the income statement.
Cash ﬂow hedges
Changes in the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments that
are designated and effective as hedges of future cash ﬂows are
recognised directly in equity, and any ineffective portion is recognised
immediately in the income statement. If the cash ﬂow hedge of a ﬁrm
commitment or forecasted transaction subsequently results in the
recognition of a non-ﬁnancial asset or a liability, then, at the time the
non-ﬁnancial asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or
losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity
are included in the initial measurement of the non-ﬁnancial asset or
liability. For hedged items that do not result in the recognition of a
non-ﬁnancial asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are
recognised in the income statement in the same period in which
the hedged item affects proﬁt or loss.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument no
longer qualiﬁes for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative
gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is
retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs. If a hedged
transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain
or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement.
Fair value hedges
For an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in the fair value
of recognised assets and liabilities, the hedged item is adjusted for
changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged with
the corresponding entry in the income statement. Gains or losses
from re-measuring the derivative, or for non-derivatives the foreign
currency component of its carrying amount, are recognised in the
income statement.
Net investment hedges
Changes in fair value of net investment hedges in relation to foreign
subsidiaries are recognised directly in equity. Gains and losses
accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when
the foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold.
Valuation principles
The fair values of quoted investments are based on current bid prices.
For unlisted and for listed securities where the market for a ﬁnancial
asset is not active the Group establishes fair value using valuation
techniques. These include the use of recent arm’s length transactions,
reference to other instruments that are substantially the same and
discounted cash ﬂow analysis.
Impairment of ﬁnancial instruments
At each balance sheet date the Group assesses whether there is
objective evidence that a ﬁnancial asset or a group of ﬁnancial assets
is impaired. In the case of equity securities classiﬁed as available-for-
sale, a signiﬁcant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security
below its cost is considered in determining whether the securities are
impaired. If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale ﬁnancial
assets, the cumulative loss – measured as the difference between the
acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on
that ﬁnancial asset previously recognised in proﬁt or loss – is removed
from equity and recognised in the income statement. Impairment
losses recognised in the income statement on equity instruments are
not subsequently reversed through the income statement.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of weighted average cost and net
realisable value. Cost comprises direct costs and, where appropriate,
a proportion of attributable production overheads.
Cash and cash equivalents
For the purpose of preparation of the cash ﬂow statement, cash and
cash equivalents includes cash at bank and in hand, highly liquid
interest bearing securities with original maturities of three months
or less, and bank overdrafts.
Pensions and similar obligations
The operating and ﬁnancing costs of deﬁned beneﬁt plans are
recognised separately in the income statement. Service costs are
systematically allocated over the service lives of employees, and
ﬁnancing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise. The
costs of individual events such as past service beneﬁt enhancements,
settlements and curtailments are recognised immediately in the
income statement. Variations from expected costs, arising from the
experience of the plans or changes in actuarial assumptions, are
recognised immediately in the statement of recognised income
and expense. The assets and liabilities of deﬁned beneﬁt plans
are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value as at the balance
sheet date.
The charges to the income statement for deﬁned contribution plans
are the company contributions payable, and the assets and liabilities
of such plans are not included in the balance sheet of the Group.
All deﬁned beneﬁt plans are subject to regular actuarial review using
the projected unit method, either by external consultants or by
actuaries employed by Unilever. Group policy is that the most
important plans, representing approximately 80% of the deﬁned
beneﬁt liabilities, are formally valued every year; other principal plans,
accounting for approximately a further 15% of liabilities, have their
liabilities updated each year. Group policy for the remaining plans
requires a full actuarial valuation at least every three years. Asset
values for all plans are updated every year. Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group
Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008 87
Financial statements
1 Accounting information and policies (continued)
Taxation
Income tax on the proﬁt or loss for the year comprises current and
deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except
to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for
the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the
balance sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect
of previous years.
Deferred taxation is recognised using the liability method on taxable
temporary differences between the tax base and the accounting base
of items included in the balance sheet of the Group. The following
temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible
for tax purposes, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that
affect neither accounting nor taxable proﬁt, and differences relating
to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not
reverse in the forseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided
is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the
carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates prevailing at the
year end unless future rates have been enacted or substantively enacted.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable
that future taxable proﬁts will be available against which the asset can
be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no
longer probable that the related tax beneﬁt will be realised.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when either a legal or constructive
obligation, as a result of a past event, exists at the balance sheet date
and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.
Segment information
Segment information is provided on the basis of geographical regions
and product categories. The primary format, geographical regions, is
based on the management structure of the Group, which operates in
three geographical regions.
Revenue recognition
Turnover comprises sales of goods and services after deduction of
discounts and sales taxes. It does not include sales between group
companies. Discounts given by Unilever include rebates, price
reductions and incentives given to customers, promotional couponing
and trade communication costs.
Turnover is recognised when the risks and rewards of the underlying
products and services have been substantially transferred to the
customer. Revenue from services is recognised as the services
are performed. Interest income is recognised as interest accrues
using the effective interest method.
Research and market support costs
Expenditure on research and market support, such as advertising,
is charged to the income statement when incurred.
Leases
Leases are classiﬁed as ﬁnance leases whenever the terms of the lease
transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the
lessee. All other leases are classiﬁed as operating leases.
Assets held under ﬁnance leases are recognised as non-current assets
of the Group at their fair value at the date of commencement of
the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease
payments. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in
the balance sheet as a ﬁnance lease obligation. Lease payments are
apportioned between ﬁnance charges and reduction of the lease
obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the
remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged
directly against income.
A proﬁt or loss is recognised on a sale and leaseback transaction
based on the difference between sales proceeds and the carrying
amount of the asset. Where the transaction results in a ﬁnance lease,
the proﬁt or loss is deferred and amortised over the lease term.
Where the transaction results in an operating lease, any proﬁt or
loss is recognised immediately with reference to the proceeds of
sale and the fair value of the asset.
Lease payments relating to operating leases are charged to the
income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Share-based payments
The economic cost of awarding shares and share options to
employees is reﬂected by recording a charge in the income statement
equivalent to the fair value of the beneﬁt awarded over the vesting
period. The fair value is determined with reference to option pricing
models, principally adjusted Black-Scholes models or a multinomial
pricing model.
Shares held by employee share trusts
The assets and liabilities of certain PLC trusts, NV and group
companies which purchase and hold NV and PLC shares to satisfy
options granted are included in the consolidated accounts. The book
value of shares held is deducted from other reserves, and trusts’
borrowings are included in the Group’s liabilities. The costs of the
trusts are included in the results of the Group. These shares are
excluded from the calculation of earnings per share.
Assets held for sale
Assets and groups of assets and liabilities which comprise disposal
groups are classiﬁed as ‘held for sale’ when all of the following criteria
are met: a decision has been made to sell, the assets are available for
sale immediately, the assets are being actively marketed, and a sale
has been or is expected to be concluded within twelve months of
the balance sheet date. Assets and disposal groups held for sale
are valued at the lower of book value or fair value less disposal
costs. Assets held for sale are not depreciated.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based
on historical experience and other factors, including expectations
of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances.
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements requires management to make
estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting
accounting estimates will, by deﬁnition, seldom equal the related
actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a signiﬁcant
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities within the next ﬁnancial year are discussed below.
Income statement presentation
On the face of the income statement, costs and revenues relating
to restructuring, business disposals and impairments are disclosed.
In addition, individual items judged to be signiﬁcant are disclosed
separately. These are material in terms of nature and amount. These
disclosures are given in order to provide additional information to help
users better understand ﬁnancial performance.
Impairment of goodwill and indeﬁnite-lived intangible assets
Impairment reviews in respect of goodwill and intangible assets are
performed at least annually. More regular reviews are performed if
events indicate that this is necessary. Examples of such triggering
events would include a signiﬁcant planned restructuring, a major
change in market conditions or technology, expectations of future
operating losses, or negative cash ﬂows.
The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units are determined
based on the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use
calculations. These calculations require the use of estimates. Details
of key assumptions made are set out in note 9 on page 98. Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group
88 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Financial statements
1 Accounting information and policies (continued)
Retirement beneﬁts
Pension accounting requires certain assumptions to be made in order
to value our obligations and to determine the charges to be made
to the income statement. These ﬁgures are particularly sensitive to
assumptions for discount rates, mortality, inﬂation rates and expected
long-term rates of return on assets. Details of assumptions made are
given in note 20 on pages 115 to 117.
Taxation
The Group is subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Signiﬁcant
judgement is required in determining worldwide provision for taxes.
There are many transactions and calculations during the ordinary
course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is
uncertain. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit
issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due.
Where the ﬁnal tax outcome of these matters is different from the
amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the
income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such
determination is made.
Provisions
Provision is made, among other reasons, for legal matters, disputed
indirect taxes, employee termination costs and restructuring where
a legal or constructive obligation exists at the balance sheet date and
a reliable estimate can be made of the likely outcome. The nature of
these costs is such that judgement has to be applied to estimate the
timing and amount of cash outﬂows.
Recent accounting developments
We are currently assessing the impact of the following revised
standard or interpretation. These changes are not expected to have a
material impact on the Group’s results of operations, ﬁnancial position
or disclosures.
• Amendments in IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’
(effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009)
requiring information in ﬁnancial statements to be aggregated on
the basis of shared characteristics and introducing a statement of
comprehensive income.
• Amendments in IAS 23 ‘Borrowing Costs’ (effective for annual
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009) removing the option
for expensing borrowing costs and requiring mandatory
capitalisation of qualifying borrowing costs.
• IFRS 8 'Operating Segments' (effective for annual periods beginning
on or after 1 January 2009) introduces a management reporting
approach to segment reporting. The information reported would be
that which management uses internally for evaluating the
performance of operating segments and allocating resources to
those segments. It replaces disclosure requirements in IAS 14
'Segment Reporting'.
• Amendments in IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ and IAS 27
‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’ (effective for
annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009) changing and
updating the existing requirements or practice on accounting for
partial acquisitions, step acquisitions, acquisition-related costs,
contingent consideration and transactions with non-controlling
interests.
• Amendment to IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’ (effective for annual
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009) clariﬁes the
accounting for advertising expenditure.
• IFRIC 16 ‘Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation’
(effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 October 2009).
• IFRIC 17 ‘Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners’ (effective for
annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009).
• IFRIC 18 ‘Transfers of Assets from Customers’ (effective for annual
periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009). Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group

2 Segment information
Our primary reporting segments are geographic. During 2008 we reorganised the management of our regions so that our operations in
Central & Eastern Europe were managed together with those in Asia and Africa, whereas they had previously been managed together with
those in Western Europe. This change reﬂects our strategic focus on the developing world and the fact that these markets share many common
characteristics. As at the end of 2008 our revised structure comprises the three operating regions of Western Europe, The Americas, and Asia,
Africa and Central & Eastern Europe (AACEE). We are therefore now reporting segmentally on this revised basis and have restated prior year
amounts accordingly. The home countries of the Unilever Group are the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Turnover for these two countries
combined in 2008 was €3 543 million (2007: €3 768 million; 2006: €3 710 million). The combined operating proﬁt in 2008 was €754 million
(2007: €444 million; 2006: €555 million). Turnover for the United States for 2008 was €6 606 million (2007: €7 120 million; 2006: €7 627
million). No other country had turnover of more than 10% of the Group total.
The analysis of turnover by geographical area is stated on the basis of origin. Turnover on a destination basis would not be materially different.
Inter-segment sales between geographical areas and between product areas as on page 91 are not material. Total assets and capital expenditure
are based on the location of the assets. Segment results are presented on the basis of operating proﬁt. Segment assets consist primarily of
property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, inventories and receivables. Corporate assets consist of current and
deferred tax and pension assets, cash and cash equivalents, and other current or non-current ﬁnancial assets. Segment liabilities consist primarily
of trade payables and other liabilities. Corporate liabilities include ﬁnancial liabilities, tax balances payable, provisions and pension and deferred
tax liabilities. Capital expenditure comprises additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, including additions resulting from
acquisitions. Other non-cash charges include charges to the income statement during the year in respect of share-based compensation,
restructuring and other provisions.

Analysis by product area
Although the Group’s operations are managed on a geographical basis, our category team manages brands which we group into four principal
product areas; these are secondary reporting segments and are listed below.
Savoury, dressings and spreads – including sales of soups, bouillons, sauces, snacks, mayonnaise, salad dressings, margarines and spreads,
and cooking products such as liquid margarines.
Ice cream and beverages – including sales of ice cream, tea-based beverages, weight management products, and nutritionally enhanced
staples sold in developing markets.
Personal care – including sales of skin care and hair care products, deodorants and anti-perspirants, and oral care products.
Home care and other operations – including sales of home care products, such as laundry tablets, powders and liquids, soap bars and a wide
range of cleaning products. To support our consumer brands, we own tea plantations, the results of which are reported within this segment.

Restructuring costs are incurred as Unilever continues to simplify the organisation, reorganise operations and support functions and redevelop
the portfolio. They primarily relate to redundancy and retirement costs. Business disposals generate both costs and revenues which are not
reﬂective of underlying performance. Impairment charges are primarily recognised for goodwill other than where included in restructuring or as
part of business disposals.
The gains on US healthcare arose from the introduction of an annual cap on the beneﬁts which each participant can claim. The gain in the UK
resulted from reducing deferred pensions where they are taken early.

From total operations
Basic earnings per share 1.79 1.35 1.65
Diluted earnings per share 1.73 1.31 1.60
Basis of calculation
The calculations of combined earnings per share are based on the net proﬁt attributable to ordinary capital divided by the average number of
share units representing the combined ordinary share capital of NV and PLC in issue during the year, after deducting shares held as treasury
stock. Earnings per share are calculated on the basis of the revised nominal share values which have been applied since 22 May 2006 and which
resulted in a one-to-one equivalence of ordinary shares of NV and PLC as regards their economic interest in the Group. For further information
please refer to note 22 on page 122.
The calculations of diluted earnings per share are based on: (i) conversion into PLC ordinary shares of the shares in a group company which are
convertible in the year 2038, as described in Corporate governance on page 54; and (ii) the effect of share-based compensation plans, details of
which are set out in note 29 on pages 133 to 134.

9 Goodwill and intangible assets
Indeﬁnite-lived intangible assets principally comprise those trademarks for which there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which they are
expected to generate net cash inﬂows. These are considered to have an indeﬁnite life, given the strength and durability of our brands and the
level of marketing support. Brands that are classiﬁed as indeﬁnite have been in the market for many years, and the nature of the industry we
operate in is such that brand obsolescence is not common, if appropriately supported by advertising and marketing spend. Finite-lived intangible
assets, which primarily comprise patented and non-patented technology, know-how, and software, are capitalised and amortised in operating
proﬁt on a straight-line basis over the period of their expected useful lives, none of which exceeds ten years. The level of amortisation for ﬁnite-
lived intangible assets is not expected to change materially over the next ﬁve years.

There are no signiﬁcant carrying amounts of goodwill and intangible assets that are allocated across multiple cash generating units (CGUs).
Impairments charge in the year
The impairments charged in 2008 principally related to a non-core savoury business in the Americas which was subsequently classiﬁed as held
for sale. There were no impairments in 2007.
Signiﬁcant CGUs
The goodwill and indeﬁnite-lived intangible assets (predominantly Knorr and Hellmann’s) held in the global savoury and dressings CGU,
comprising €10.6 billion (2007: €11.1 billion) and €3.1 billion (2007: €3.2 billion) respectively, are considered signiﬁcant in comparison to
the total carrying amounts of goodwill and indeﬁnite-lived intangible assets at 31 December 2008. No other CGUs are considered signiﬁcant
in this respect.
During 2008, we conducted an impairment review of the carrying value of these assets. Value in use of the global savoury and dressings CGU
has been calculated as the present value of projected future cash ﬂows. A pre-tax discount rate of 10% was used.
The following key assumptions were used in the discounted cash ﬂow projections for the savoury and dressings CGU:
• a longer-term sustainable growth rate of 4%, adjusted for market fade, used to determine an appropriate terminal value multiple;
• average near-term nominal growth for the major product groups within the CGU of 6%; and
• average operating margins for the major product groups within the CGU ranging from 15% to 19%.
The growth rates and margins used to estimate future performance are based on past performance and our experience of growth rates and
margins achievable in our key markets as a guide. We believe that the assumptions used in estimating the future performance of the savoury
and dressings CGU are consistent with past performance.
The projections covered a period of ten years as we believe this to be a suitable timescale over which to review and consider annual
performance before applying a ﬁxed terminal value multiple to the ﬁnal year cash ﬂows of the detailed projection. Stopping the detailed
projections after ﬁve years and applying a terminal value multiple thereafter would not result in a value in use that would cause impairment.
The growth rates used to estimate future performance beyond the periods covered by our annual planning and strategic planning processes do
not exceed the long-term average rates of growth for similar products.
We have performed sensitivity analysis around the base case assumptions and have concluded that no reasonably possible changes in key
assumptions would cause the recoverable amount of the global savoury and dressings CGU to be less than the carrying amount. Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group

(e) In January 2007, the reorganisation of our Portuguese businesses was completed, whereby Unilever now has a 55% share of the combined
Portuguese entity, called Unilever Jerónimo Martins. The structure of the newly formed entity is such that there is joint control and it is
therefore accounted for by Unilever as a joint venture. In December 2007 a capital contribution of €103 million was made to Pepsi/Lipton
International.
(f) In relation to the extension of the Pepsi/Lipton joint venture for ready-to-drink tea in January 2008, a reduction of €110 million in carrying
value of Pepsi/Lipton International was recorded.
(g) Associates primarily comprise our investments in JohnsonDiversey Holdings Inc., Langholm Capital Partners and Physic Ventures. Other
Unilever Ventures assets (excluding Langholm) are included under ‘Other non-current ﬁnancial assets’ above.

(a) Of the total movement in equity of €762 million, €87 million arises as a result of currency retranslation and €8 million as a result of
acquisitions and disposals.
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of €1 369 million and tax credits amounting to €307 million available for offset
against future taxable proﬁts. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of unused tax losses of €1 019 million and tax credits
of €307 million, as it is not probable that there will be future taxable proﬁts within the entities against which the losses can be utilised. The
majority of these tax losses and credits arise in tax jurisdictions where they do not expire with the exception of €457 million of state and
federal tax losses in the US which expire between now and 2028.
Other deductible temporary differences of €133 million have not been recognised as a deferred tax asset. There is no expiry date for these
differences.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which
deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was €967 million (2007: €1 059 million). No liability has been recognised in respect of these
differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences, and it is probable that such
differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax
liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same ﬁscal authority. The following amounts, determined after appropriate
offsetting, are shown in the consolidated balance sheet:

€246 million (2007: €177 million) was charged to the income statement for damaged, obsolete and lost inventories. In 2008, €23 million
(2007: €25 million) was utilised or released to the income statement from inventory provisions taken in earlier years.
In 2008, inventories with a carrying amount of €34 million were pledged as security for certain of the Group’s borrowings (2007: €4 million). Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group

Credit terms for customers are determined in individual territories. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited, due
to the Group’s customer base being large and diverse. Our historical experience of collecting receivables, supported by the level of default, is
that credit risk is low across territories and so trade receivables are considered to be a single class of ﬁnancial assets. Other receivables comprise
loans and receivables of €258 million (2007: €362 million) and other non-ﬁnancial assets of €397 million (2007: €400 million). We do not
consider the fair values of trade and other receivables to be signiﬁcantly different from their carrying values. Balances are considered for
impairment on an individual basis rather than by reference to the extent that they become overdue.

(a) The 6% cumulative preference shares are traded in the market in units of one tenth of their nominal value.
The 4%, 6% and 7% cumulative preference shares of NV are entitled to dividends at the rates indicated. The 4% preference capital of NV is
redeemable at par at the company‘s option either wholly or in part. The other classes of preferential share capital of NV are not unilaterally redeemable
by the company.
At the Annual General Meeting of NV held on 8 May 2006 it was agreed to convert the nominal value of all classes of shares from guilders into euros.
The 7% and 6% preference shares with a nominal value of Fl.1 000 each, were converted into shares with a nominal value of €428.57 each, and the
4% preference shares with a nominal value of Fl.100 each, were converted into shares with a nominal value of €42.86 each. The effect of this
conversion was to adjust their reported value, with the difference being held as a statutory reserve. In order to maintain the same economic rights for
the preference shares as before the euro conversion, it was decided that their entitlement to dividend and liquidation proceeds remains linked, using the
ofﬁcial euro conversion rate, to the amount in Dutch guilders originally paid up on these shares. The euro conversion did not alter the dividend
entitlements of the cumulative preference shares. Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group

Turmoil in ﬁnancial markets: impact on Treasury
We believe our strong single-A rating and active ﬁnancial management have served us well in the current ﬁnancial turmoil. Maintaining our
strong single-A rating has been and will remain a key priority.
To cope with the impact of the ﬁnancial crisis, we undertook, amongst others, the following actions:
Liquidity management:
• In order to reduce our reﬁnance risk, we actively structured out our commercial paper maturity proﬁle;
• Throughout the year we had good access to commercial paper markets (particularly in the US at signiﬁcant discounts to Libor);
• During the calendar year we completed three bond issues, for a total amount of €1.4 billion, all at competitive rates; and
• As the business successfully managed year-end working capital positions, Unilever closed the year with a cash balance of around €2.6 billion,
including €0.6 billion from proceeds of disposal of the Bertolli olive oil business received at the year end.
Counterparty exposures:
We regularly reviewed and tightened counterparty limits. Banking exposures were actively monitored on a daily basis. During the year we
reduced the maturity proﬁle of our deposits to an overnight basis providing maximum ﬂexibility. Unilever beneﬁts from collateral agreements
with our principal banks (see also page 110) based on which banks need to deposit securities and/or cash as collateral for their obligations in
respect of derivative ﬁnancial instruments. Unilever did not encounter any material counterparty exposure loss from ﬁnancial institutions during
2008.
Funding costs:
In general, credit spreads have increased signiﬁcantly and are very volatile. This over time will lead to increased funding costs. During 2008 we
were able to issue commercial paper and bonds at competitive rates.
Bank facility renewal:
Our bank facilities are renewed annually. On 31 December 2008 we had US $6 205 million of undrawn committed facilities. As at 1 January
2009 the amount of undrawn committed facilities will be US $5 950 million, to be renewed in October 2009. For further details, see ’Liquidity
risk' section below.
Treasury Risk Management
Unilever manages a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, liquidity and counterparty
risks.
Currency risks
Because of Unilever’s broad operational reach, it is subject to risks from changes in foreign currency values that could affect earnings. As a practical
matter, it is not feasible to fully hedge these ﬂuctuations. Unilever does have a foreign exchange policy that requires operating companies to
manage trading and ﬁnancial foreign exchange exposures within prescribed limits. This is achieved primarily through the use of forward foreign
exchange contracts. On a case-by-case basis, depending on potential income statement volatility that can be caused by the fair value movement
of the derivative, companies decide whether or not to apply cash ﬂow hedge accounting. Regional groups monitor compliance with this foreign
exchange policy. At the end of 2008, there was no material exposure from companies holding assets and liabilities other than in their functional
currency.
In addition, as Unilever conducts business in many foreign currencies but publishes its ﬁnancial statements and measures its performance in euros,
it is subject to exchange risk due to the effects that exchange rate movements have on the translation of the underlying net assets of its foreign
subsidiaries. Unilever aims to minimise its foreign exchange exposure in operating companies by borrowing in the local currency, except where
inhibited by local regulations, lack of local liquidity or local market conditions. For those countries that in the view of management have a
substantial retranslation risk, Unilever may decide on a case-by-case basis, taking into account amongst other factors the impact on the income
statement, to hedge such net investment. This is achieved through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts on which hedge accounting is
applied. Nevertheless, from time to time, currency revaluations on unhedged investments will trigger exchange translation movements in the
balance sheet.
Interest rate risks
Unilever has an interest rate management policy aimed at achieving an optimal balance between ﬁxed and ﬂoating rate interest rate exposures on
expected net debt (gross borrowings minus cash and cash equivalents) levels for the next ﬁve calendar years. The objective of the policy is to
minimise annual interest costs and to reduce volatility. This is achieved by issuing ﬁxed rate long-term debt and by modifying the interest rate
exposure of debt and cash positions through the use of interest rate swaps. The ﬁxing levels per calendar year are determined by ﬁxing bands, with
minimum and maximum ﬁxing level percentages, decreasing by 10 percentage points per calendar year. The minimum level in the ﬁrst year
amounts to 50% and the maximum level amounts to 90%. The minimum level is set to avoid unacceptable interest cost volatility and the
maximum level is set to prevent over-ﬁxing, recognising that future debt levels can be volatile.
At the end of 2008, interest rates were ﬁxed on approximately 56% of the projected net of cash and ﬁnancial liability positions for 2009 and 51%
for 2010 (compared with 68% for 2008 and 53% for 2009 at the end of 2007).

Liquidity risk
A material and sustained shortfall in our cash ﬂow could undermine our credit rating and overall investor conﬁdence and could restrict the Group’s
ability to raise funds.
Operational cash ﬂow provides the funds to service the ﬁnancing of ﬁnancial liabilities and enhance shareholder return. Unilever manages the
liquidity requirements by the use of short-term and long-term cash ﬂow forecasts. Unilever maintains access to global debt markets through an
infrastructure of short-term and long-term debt programmes. In addition to this, Unilever has committed credit facilities in place to support its
commercial paper programmes and for general corporate purposes. During 2008 we made no use of the committed facilities.
Unilever had US $6 205 million of undrawn committed facilities on 31 December 2008 as follows;
• revolving 364-day bilateral credit facilities of in aggregate US $4 230 million (2007: US $3 630 million) out of which US $3 675 million (2007:
US $3 630 million) with a 364-day term out;
• revolving 364-day notes commitments of US $200 million (2007: US $200 million) with the ability to issue notes with a maturity up to
364 days; and
• 364-day bilateral money market commitments of in aggregate US $1 775 million (2007: US $1 720 million), under which the
underwriting banks agree, subject to certain conditions, to subscribe for notes with maturities of up to three years.
As from 1 January 2009 the amount of undrawn committed facilities will be US $5 950 million.
As part of the regular annual process these facilities will be renewed in October 2009.
The ﬁnancial market turbulence and associated illiquidity in credit markets during the second half of 2007 and throughout 2008 did not impact
Unilever’s ability to meet its ﬁnancing requirements.

Credit risk on banks and received collateral
Credit risk related to the use of treasury instruments is managed on a group basis. This risk arises from transactions with banks like cash and cash
equivalents, deposits and derivative ﬁnancial instruments. To reduce the credit risk, Unilever has concentrated its main activities with a limited
group of banks that have secure credit ratings. Per bank, individual risk limits are set based on its ﬁnancial position, credit ratings, past experience
and other factors. The utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored. To reduce the credit exposures, netting agreements are in place with
Unilever’s principal banks that allow Unilever, in case of a default, to net assets and liabilities across transactions. To further reduce Unilever’s credit
exposures, Unilever has collateral agreements with Unilever’s principal banks based on which they need to deposit securities and/or cash as
a collateral for their obligations in respect of derivative ﬁnancial instruments. At 31 December 2008 the collateral received by Unilever amounted
to €369 million (2007: €nil), of which €112 million was cash and the fair value of the bond securities amounted to €257 million. Although
contractually Unilever has the right to sell or repledge the collateral, it has no intention to do so. As a consequence, the non-cash collateral has
not been recognised as an asset in our balance sheet.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
The Group has comprehensive policies in place, approved by the Boards, covering the use of derivative ﬁnancial instruments. These instruments are
used for hedging purposes. The Group has an established system of control in place covering all ﬁnancial instruments; including policies, guidelines,
exposure limits, a system of authorities and independent reporting, that is subject to periodic review by internal audit. Hedge accounting principles
are described in note 1 on page 86. The use of leveraged instruments is not permitted. In the assessment of hedge effectiveness the credit risk
element on the underlying hedged item has been excluded. Hedge ineffectiveness is immaterial.
The Group uses the following types of hedges:
• cash ﬂow hedges used to hedge the risk on future foreign currency cash ﬂows, ﬂoating interest rate cash ﬂows, and the price risk on future
purchases of raw materials;
• fair value hedges used to convert the ﬁxed interest rate on ﬁnancial liabilities into a ﬂoating interest rate;
• net investment hedges used to hedge the investment value of our foreign subsidiaries; and
• natural hedges used to hedge the risk on exposures that are on the balance sheet. No hedge accounting is applied.
Details of the various types of hedges are given below.
The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts represent the gain or loss on revaluation of the contracts at the year-end forward exchange
rates. The fair values of interest rate derivatives are based on the net present value of the anticipated future cash ﬂows. Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group

Cash ﬂow hedges
The fair values of derivatives hedging the risk on future foreign currency cash ﬂows, ﬂoating interest rate cash ﬂows and the price risk on future
purchases of raw materials amount to €(14) million (2007: €85 million) of which €(21) million relates to commodity contracts (2007: €88
million), €7 million to foreign exchange contracts (2007: €(10) million) and €nil to interest rate derivatives (2007: €7 million). Of the total fair
value of €(14) million, €(14) million is due within one year (2007: €82 million).

The impact of exchange rate movements on the fair value of forward exchange contracts used to hedge net investments is recognised in
reserves.
Natural hedges
A natural hedge – sometimes known as an economic hedge – is where exposure to a risk is offset, or partly offset, by an opposite exposure to
that same risk. Hedge accounting is not applied to these relationships.

Of the fair values disclosed above, the fair value of ﬁnancial liability-related derivatives at 31 December 2008 amounted to €539 million
(2007: €320 million) of which €501 million (2007: €78 million) is included under other ﬁnancial assets and €38 million (2007: €242 million) is
included under ﬁnancial liabilities as a positive amount partly offsetting the €(257) million (2007: €(337) million) included under ﬁnancial
liabilities relating to the fair values of derivatives used as net investment hedges. The remaining balances are shown under trade and other
receivables and other liabilities.
Sensitivity to not applying hedge accounting
Derivatives have to be reported at fair value. Those derivatives used for cash ﬂow hedging and net investment hedging for which we do not
apply hedge accounting will cause volatility in the income statement. Such derivatives did not have a material impact on the 2008 income
statement.
Embedded derivatives
In accordance with IAS 39, 'Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement', Unilever has reviewed all contracts for embedded derivatives
that are required to be separately accounted for if they do not meet speciﬁc requirements set out in the standard; no material embedded
derivatives have been identiﬁed.
Fair values of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities
The following table summarises the fair values and carrying amounts of the various classes of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities. All trade
and other receivables and trade payables and other liabilities have been excluded from the analysis below and from the interest rate and

The fair values and the carrying amount of listed investments included in ﬁnancial assets and preference shares included in ﬁnancial liabilities are
based on their market values. Cash and cash equivalents, other ﬁnancial assets, bank loans and overdrafts have fair values that approximate to
their carrying amounts because of their short-term nature. The fair values of listed bonds are based on their market value; non-listed bonds and
other loans are based on the net present value of the anticipated future cash ﬂows associated with these instruments. Fair values for ﬁnance
lease creditors have been assessed by reference to current market rates for comparable leasing arrangements.
Commodity contracts
The Group uses commodity forward contracts and futures to hedge against price risk in certain commodities. All commodity forward contracts
and futures hedge future purchases of raw materials. Settlement of these contracts will be in cash or by physical delivery. Those contracts that
will be settled in cash are reported in the balance sheet at fair value and, to the extent that they are considered as an effective hedge under
IAS 39, fair value movements are recognised in the cash ﬂow reserve. Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group

Capital management
The Group’s ﬁnancial strategy supports Unilever’s aim to be in the top third of a reference group including 20 other international consumer
goods companies for Total Shareholder Return, as explained on page 43. The key elements of the ﬁnancial strategy are:
• appropriate access to equity and debt markets;
• sufﬁcient ﬂexibility for acquisitions that we fund out of current cash ﬂows;
• A+/A1 long-term credit rating;
• A1/P1 short-term credit rating;
• sufﬁcient resilience against economic and ﬁnancial turmoil; and
• optimal weighted average cost of capital, given the constraints above.
For the A1/P1 short-term credit rating the company monitors the qualitative and quantitative factors utilised by the rating agencies. This
information is publicly available and is updated by the credit rating agencies on a regular basis.
The capital structure of Unilever is based on management’s judgement of the appropriate balancing of all key elements of its ﬁnancial strategy
in order to meet its strategic and day-to-day needs. We consider the amount of capital in proportion to risk and manage the capital structure
and make adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. Unilever will take
appropriate steps in order to maintain, or if necessary adjust, the capital structure. Annually the overall funding plan is presented to the Board
for approval.
Return on Invested Capital continues to be one of Unilever's key performance measures. Within this deﬁnition we have deﬁned the components
of our Invested Capital. See page 42 for the details of this deﬁnition and the calculation of Unilever's Return on Invested Capital.
Unilever is not subject to covenants in any of its signiﬁcant ﬁnancing agreements.
Income statement sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates
The values of debt, investments and related hedging instruments, denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities
holding them, are subject to exchange rate movements. The translation risk on the foreign exchange debtors and creditors is excluded from this
sensitivity analysis as the risk is considered to be immaterial because positions will remain within prescribed limits (see currency risks on
page 108).
The remaining foreign exchange positions at 31 December 2008 mainly relate to unhedged US $ loans (total amount at 31 December 2008
US $65 million). A reasonably possible 10% change in rates would lead to a €5 million movement in the income statement (2007: €7 million),
based on a linear calculation of our exposure.
Income statement sensitivity to changes in interest rate
Interest rate risks are presented by way of sensitivity analysis. As described on page 108, Unilever has an interest rate management policy aimed
at optimising net interest cost and reducing volatility in the income statement. As part of this policy, part of the funds/debt have ﬁxed interest
rates and are no longer exposed to changes in the ﬂoating rates. The remaining ﬂoating part of our funds/debt (see interest rate proﬁle tables
on pages 104 for the assets and 107 for the liabilities) is exposed to changes in the ﬂoating interest rates.
The analysis below shows the sensitivity of the income statement to a reasonably possible one percentage point change in ﬂoating interest rates
on a full-year basis.

Net investment hedges: sensitivity relating to changes in foreign exchange rates
To reduce the retranslation risk of Unilever's investments in foreign subsidiaries, Unilever uses net investment hedges. The fair values of these
net investment hedges are subject to exchange rate movements and changes in these fair values are recognised directly in equity and will offset
the retranslation impact of the related subsidiary.
At 31 December 2008 the nominal value of these net investment hedges amounts to €5.1 billion (2007: €7.5 billion) mainly consisting of US$/€
contracts. A reasonably possible 10% change in rates would lead to a fair value movement of €513 million (2007: €750 million). This
movement would be fully offset by an opposite movement on the retranslation of the book equity of the foreign subsidiary.
Cash ﬂow hedges: sensitivity relating to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates
Unilever uses on a limited scale both interest rate and forex cash ﬂow hedges. The fair values of these instruments are subject to changes in
interest rates and exchange rates. Because of the limited use of these instruments and the amount of Unilever's equity, possible changes in
interest rates and exchange rates will not lead to fair value movements that will have a material impact on Unilever's equity. Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group

Description of plans
In many countries the Group operates deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service.
The majority of these plans are externally funded. The Group also provides other post-employment beneﬁts, mainly post-employment healthcare
plans in the United States. These plans are predominantly unfunded. The Group also operates a number of deﬁned contribution plans, the
assets of which are held in external funds.
The majority of the Group’s externally funded plans are established as trusts, foundations or similar entities. The operation of these entities
is governed by local regulations and practice in each country, as is the nature of the relationship between the Group and the trustees (or
equivalent) and their composition.
Exposure to risks
Pension assets and liabilities (pre-tax) of €11 719 million and €15 101 million respectively are held on the Group’s balance sheet as at
31 December 2008. Movements in equity markets, interest rates, inﬂation and life expectancy could materially affect the level of surpluses and
deﬁcits in these schemes, and could prompt the need for the Group to make additional pension contributions, or to reduce pension
contributions, in the future. The key assumptions used to value our pension liabilities are set out below and on pages 116 and 117.
Investment strategy
The Group’s investment strategy in respect of its funded pension plans is implemented within the framework of the various statutory
requirements of the territories where the plans are based. The Group has developed policy guidelines for the allocation of assets to different
classes with the objective of controlling risk and maintaining the right balance between risk and long-term returns in order to limit the cost to
the Group of the beneﬁts provided. To achieve this, investments are well diversiﬁed, such that the failure of any single investment would not
have a material impact on the overall level of assets. The plans invest the largest proportion of the assets in equities which the Group believes
offer the best returns over the long term commensurate with an acceptable level of risk. The pension funds also have a proportion of assets
invested in property, bonds, hedge funds and cash. The majority of assets are managed by a number of external fund managers with a small
proportion managed in-house. Unilever has a pooled investment vehicle (Univest) which it believes offers its pension plans around the world a
simpliﬁed externally managed investment vehicle to implement their strategic asset allocation models, currently for equities and hedge funds.
The aim is to provide a high quality, well diversiﬁed, risk-controlled vehicle.
Assumptions
With the objective of presenting the assets and liabilities of the pensions and other post-employment beneﬁt plans at their fair value on the
balance sheet, assumptions under IAS 19 are set by reference to market conditions at the valuation date. The actuarial assumptions used to
calculate the beneﬁt obligations vary according to the country in which the plan is situated. The following table shows the assumptions,
weighted by liabilities, used to value the principal deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans (which cover approximately 95% of total pension liabilities and
plans providing other post-employment beneﬁts) and in addition the expected long-term rates of return on assets, weighted by asset value.

The valuations of other post-employment beneﬁt plans generally assume a higher initial level of medical cost inﬂation, which falls from 8.8%
to the long-term rate within the next ﬁve years. Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a signiﬁcant effect on the amounts reported for
healthcare plans. A one percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effect:
€ million € million
1% point 1% point
increase decrease
Effect on total of service and interest cost components 2 (2)
Effect on total beneﬁt obligation 18 (17)
The expected rates of return on plan assets were determined, based on actuarial advice, by a process that takes the long-term rates of return
on government bonds available at the balance sheet date and applies to these rates suitable risk premiums that take account of historic market
returns and current market long-term expectations for each asset class.

Demographic assumptions, such as mortality rates, are set having regard to the latest trends in life expectancy (including expectations for future
improvements), plan experience and other relevant data. The assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic
actuarial valuation of the pension plans. The assumptions made in 2008 are consistent with those applied in 2007.
Mortality assumptions for the most important countries are based on the following post-retirement mortality tables: (i) United Kingdom: PNMA 00
and PNFA 00 with medium cohort adjustment subject to a minimum annual improvement of 1% and scaling factors of 110% for current male
pensioners, 125% for current female pensioners and 105% for future male and female pensioners; (ii) the Netherlands: GBMV (2000–2005) with
age set back of four years for males and two years for females; (iii) United States: RP2000 with a projection period of 10–15 years; and (iv)
Germany: Heubeck 1998 (Periodentafel) with a scaling factor of 85%. These tables translate into the following years of life expectancy for
current pensioners aged 65:
United United
Kingdom Netherlands States Germany
Males 21 20 19 18
Females 23 22 22 21
With regard to future improvements in life expectancy, in the UK for example, males and females currently aged 45 are assumed to have a life
expectancy of 24 years and 26 years respectively on retirement at age 65.
Assumptions for the remaining deﬁned beneﬁt plans vary considerably, depending on the economic conditions of the countries where they 
are situated.

The constituents of the ‘Principal plans’ and ‘Other plans’ were reviewed in both 2006 and 2007, such that some ‘Other plans’ were moved 
into ‘Principal plans’ in 2006 and a smaller number of plans were moved out of ‘Principal plans’ into ‘Other plans’ in 2007.

During 2008 some previously unfunded liabilities were funded utilising existing surpluses. As a consequence of this the liabilities of €24 million
were moved from unfunded to funded in the table above. In 2007, a contractual trust arrangement was established in Germany to partially
fund previously unfunded pension liabilities. The initial funding was €300 million whilst the value of the previously unfunded liabilities at 1
January 2007 was approximately €850 million. As a consequence of this funding, the liabilities have been transferred from unfunded to funded
in the table above.
Equity securities include Unilever securities amounting to €25 million (0.2% of total plan assets) and €32 million (0.2% of total plan assets)
at 31 December 2008 and 2007 respectively. Property includes property occupied by Unilever amounting to €57 million and €69 million at
31 December 2008 and 2007 respectively.
The pension assets above exclude the assets in a Special Beneﬁts Trust amounting to €146 million (2007: €162 million) to fund pension and
similar obligations in the US (see also note 11 on page 101).

Signiﬁcant Items on the face of the income statement
During 2006 we updated certain terms of the deﬁned beneﬁt plan in the UK which resulted in a one-off credit to the income statement in
2006 of €120 million. During 2006 a number of initiatives were taken to reduce the cost of post-employment healthcare beneﬁts, principally in
the United States, through changes to the design of the plans. As a consequence, a reduction in liability of €146 million was recognised in the
income statement for 2006.
Cash ﬂow
Group cash ﬂow in respect of pensions and similar post employment beneﬁts comprises company contributions paid to funded plans and
beneﬁts paid by the company in respect of unfunded plans. In 2008, the beneﬁts paid in respect of unfunded plans amounted to €223 million
(2007: €280 million; 2006: €333 million). Company contributions to funded deﬁned beneﬁt plans are subject to periodic review, taking account
of local legislation. In 2008, contributions to funded deﬁned beneﬁt plans including funding of previously unfunded beneﬁts amounted to
€531 million (2007: €878 million; 2006: €758 million). This includes a sum of €254 million to the UK pension plan in expectation of a transfer
of unfunded liabilities to the plan in 2009. Contributions to deﬁned contribution plans including 401k plans amounted to €55 million (2007:
€52 million; 2006: €61 million). In 2008 a €42 million refund was received from the Danish pension plan following action to externally insure
the liabilities. In 2007, a €50 million refund of assets was received out of recognised surplus from Finland. Total contributions by the Group to
funded plans, net of refunds, are currently expected to be about €700 million in 2009 (2008 actual: €531 million). Beneﬁt payments by the
Group in respect of unfunded plans are currently expected to be about €230 million in 2009 (2008 actual: €223 million). Total cash costs of
pensions are expected to be around €1.0 billion in 2009 (2008 actual: €0.8 billion).

A nominal dividend of 6% is paid on the deferred stock of PLC, which is not redeemable.
Internal holdings
The ordinary shares numbered 1 to 2 400 (inclusive) in NV (‘Special Shares’) and deferred stock of PLC are held as to one half of each class by
N.V. Elma – a subsidiary of NV – and one half by United Holdings Limited – a subsidiary of PLC. This capital is eliminated on consolidation. For
information on the rights related to the aforementioned ordinary shares, see Corporate Governance on pages 50 and 51. The subsidiaries
mentioned above have waived their rights to dividends on their ordinary shares in NV.
Share-based compensation
The Group operates a number of share-based compensation plans involving options and awards of ordinary shares of NV and PLC. Full details
of these plans are given in note 29 on pages 133 and 134. Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group

(c) As part of the review of Unilever's corporate structure, and in the light of the constitutional and operational arrangements which enable
Unilever N.V. and Unilever PLC to operate as nearly as practicable as a single company, the Directors have been authorised to take any
action necessary or desirable in order to ensure that the ratio of the dividend generating capacity of PLC to that of NV does not differ
substantially from the ratio of the dividend entitlement of ordinary shareholders in PLC to that of ordinary shareholders in NV. During 2007,
Unilever’s shareholding in Unilever Jerónimo Martins in Portugal was transferred from NV to PLC for no consideration. In addition, a part
of indirect shareholdings in Unilever US was sold by NV to PLC and the fair value economic swap in South Africa led to further adjustments
between NV and PLC. In 2006, shareholdings in the Unilever companies in Czech Republic, Hungary, Russia and Turkey, as well as a part
of indirect shareholdings in Unilever US, were transferred from NV to PLC for no consideration. In addition, part of a dividend which would
otherwise be due from a Unilever US intermediate company to a company within the NV part of the Group was instead paid to a company
within the PLC part of the Group. In 2008 shareholdings in the Unilever companies in Belgium, Austria, Netherlands, Poland and
Switzerland were transferred to 100% NV ownership. In addition, shareholdings in Canada and Indonesia were re-aligned between NV and
PLC. Reorganisations of group companies have produced similar types of adjustments in previous years.
Cumulative goodwill written off directly to reserves prior to the transition to IFRS on 1 January 2004 was €5 199 million for NV and
€2 063 million for PLC. Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group

The Group has sublet part of the leased properties under operating leases. Future minimum sublease payments of €66 million are expected to

Other commitments principally comprise commitments under contracts to purchase materials and services. They do not include commitments
for capital expenditure, which are reported in note 10 on page 99.
Contingent liabilities are either possible obligations that will probably not require a transfer of economic beneﬁts, or present obligations that
may, but probably will not, require a transfer of economic beneﬁts. It is not appropriate to make provisions for contingent liabilities, but there is
a chance that they will result in an obligation in the future. The Group does not believe that any of these contingent liabilities will result in a
material loss.
Contingent liabilities arise in respect of litigation against group companies, investigations by competition, regulatory and ﬁscal authorities and
obligations arising under environmental legislation. The estimated total of such contingent liabilities at 31 December 2008 was some €355
million (2007: €430 million).
Contingent liabilities also arise from guarantees issued by group companies. At 31 December 2008 these amounted to some €45 million
(2007: €81 million). Included in this were discounted trade bills with a value of €1 million (2007: €4 million). We believe that any loss arising in
connection with these would not have a material effect on the Group’s ﬁnancial condition or results of operations. Guarantees given by parent
or group companies that relate to liabilities already included in these consolidated accounts are excluded from this total.
The total value of guarantees which arose or were revised in 2008 was €4 million (2007: €4 million). The fair value of guarantees is not material
in either 2008 or 2007. Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group

Legal proceedings
We are involved from time to time in legal and arbitration proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. However, although the
outcome of legal proceedings are inherently difﬁcult to predict, we are currently not involved in any legal or arbitration proceedings which may
be expected to lead to material loss or expenditure in the context of the Group results. Similarly we do not have any material obligations under
environmental legislation. None of our Directors or Ofﬁcers is involved in any legal proceedings which are material as aforesaid. The following
are the most signiﬁcant legal proceedings in which the group is currently involved.
Ice cream cases
As previously reported, in 2006 the European Court of Justice ruled to dismiss the appeal by Unilever’s Irish ice cream business, HB Ice Cream,
of a 2003 Court of First Instance judgment that upheld the European Commission’s 1998 decision to ban HB Ice Cream from imposing cabinet
exclusivity in Ireland in circumstances where Unilever cabinets were the only cabinets used by the retailer. Although this ﬁnal ruling related to a
Commission decision that applied to Ireland only, Mars subsequently sought to bring legal claims against Unilever before the courts and to
lodge complaints with the competition authorities in a number of European countries in the course of 2007.
In April 2008 Mars and Unilever reached an agreement to settle out of court their differences in respect of distribution arrangements for the
sale of Unilever's impulse ice cream. Neither the talks themselves nor any resulting settlement imply any admission of liability on Unilever's part.
The payment to be made by Unilever to Mars under the terms of the settlement has been fully provided for.
As regards investigations previously instituted by national competition authorities, the Portuguese competition authority conﬁrmed in 2008 that
it had closed its investigation into Unilever’s Portuguese ice cream business, subject to certain monitoring obligations that will apply for three
years. In Italy, a 2007 ruling by the Consiglio di Stato overturned the 2003 decision of the Italian competition authority (‘ICA’) that responded
positively to a notiﬁcation by Unilever of its policy in relation to outlet exclusivity. The Consiglio di Stato took the view that Unilever’s market
position in Italy had not been sufﬁciently investigated by the ICA. To the extent that the ICA decides to reinvestigate the matter, Unilever will
engage proactively with the authority with a view to securing a prompt resolution to any outstanding issues.
Other competition issues
As previously reported, in 2006 the French competition authorities commenced an inquiry into potential competition law infringements in
France involving a number of consumer goods companies in the home and personal care sector, including Unilever France and Lever Fabergé
France, both subsidiaries of the Unilever Group. Interviews have been conducted with present and former members of our staff and documents
have been supplied to the French authorities. No Statement of Objections or proposals for ﬁnes have yet been lodged against either Unilever
France or Lever Fabergé France as the authorities’ investigation has had to be restarted following procedural challenge. Accordingly, the
potential ﬁnancial implications, if any, of this investigation cannot yet be assessed. A Statement of Objections is, however, expected in the near
future.
By a decision dated 19 February 2008, the German Federal Cartel Ofﬁce imposed a ﬁne on Unilever in relation to anti competitive behaviour in
the toothpaste market in Germany. Unilever lodged an appeal against that decision on 29 February 2008. However, in light of a revised decision
reducing the ﬁnes to be imposed upon Unilever, the appeal was withdrawn by Unilever on 9 October 2008.
On 25 February 2008, a purported class action lawsuit was ﬁled in the United States of America in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois alleging, relying upon the German investigation described above, that Unilever N.V., Unilever PLC and Unilever United
States, Inc. allegedly conspired with certain other companies to ﬁx prices of oral, home and personal care products in the United States. On 18
December 2008, the trial court issued an opinion dismissing all claims in the case for lack of jurisdiction.
In April 2008, Unilever received a notice from the UK Ofﬁce of Fair Trading requiring the production of documents in relation to an investigation
into potential co ordination of the retail prices of certain products in the grocery sector. A response to the notice was provided in June 2008. It
is too early to gauge whether the investigation to which the notice relates will lead to a Statement of Objections being addressed to Unilever or
its subsidiaries.
In June 2008, Unilever premises in Austria, Belgium, Italy, The Netherlands and Spain were the subject of unannounced inspections by the
European Commission and/or national competition authorities. The inspections were in relation to the home care and/or personal care markets.
Requests for information from the European Commission relating to alleged anti competitive behaviour in detergents markets in the EEA were
subsequently received by Unilever in July 2008 and December 2008. Responses were provided in October 2008 and January 2009, respectively.
Separately, a request for information relating to alleged anti competitive behaviour in personal care markets in The Netherlands was received by
Unilever from the Dutch Competition Authority in November and a response ﬁled in December 2008. It is too early to gauge whether the
investigations that have been initiated will lead to Statements of Objections being addressed to Unilever or its subsidiaries.
In late 2008 Unilever Greece attended hearings before the Greek Competion Authority in relation to an alleged violation of competition rules
deriving from a term previously included in its contracts with a limited number of retailers in the period 2000 to 2002 in relation to parallel
imports. As from 2003 Unilever Greece had voluntarily removed the relevant term from its contracts. A decision in this case is expected in
March 2009.
It is Unilever’s policy to co-operate fully with the competition authorities in the context of all ongoing investigations. Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group

Tax cases Brazil
During 2004 the Federal Supreme Court in Brazil (local acronym STF) announced a review of certain cases that it had previously decided in
favour of taxpayers. Because of this action, we established a provision in 2004 for the potential repayment of sales tax credits in the event that
the cases establishing precedents in our favour are reversed. Since that time we continue to monitor the situation and have made changes as
appropriate to the amount provided.
In June 2007, the Supreme Court ruled against the taxpayers in one of these cases. Industry associations (of which Unilever is a member)
attempted to negotiate a settlement with the Federal Revenue Service to reduce or avoid the payment of interest and/or penalties on such
amounts. On 3 December 2008 the negotiations resulted in the publication of a settlement by the Brazilian government, open to all taxpayers
including Unilever. The amount payable based on this offer does not result in additional liabilities beyond those already accounted for.
Also during 2004 in Brazil, and in common with many other businesses operating in that country, one of our Brazilian subsidiaries received a
notice of infringement from the Federal Revenue Service. The notice alleges that a 2001 reorganisation of our local corporate structure was
undertaken without valid business purpose. The dispute is in court and if upheld, will result in a tax payment relating to years from 2001 to the
present day. The 2001 reorganisation was comparable with restructurings done by many companies in Brazil. We believe that the likelihood of a
successful challenge by the tax authorities is remote. While this view is supported by the opinion of outside counsel there can be no guarantee
of success in court.
Cumulative preference shares
In November 2006 NV announced that it had agreed a settlement with the main parties in a legal dispute over the conversion of the cumulative
preference shares that were issued in 1999 as an alternative to a cash dividend. These cumulative preference shares were converted into
ordinary shares in 2005 and subsequently cancelled following approval from the Annual General Meeting in 2005. Former cumulative
preference shareholders who held these shares at the opening of trading on 24 March 2004 were entitled to participate in the settlement.
A group of former cumulative preference shareholders who had bought their preference shares after 24 March 2004 and who are not entitled
to the settlement, instituted claims with the Rotterdam District Court for nulliﬁcation of the NV Board’s decision to convert the preference
shares and NV’s Annual General Meeting decision to cancel the preference shares. The Rotterdam District Court has not yet decided on the
merits of these claims. The claims are contested vigorously by Unilever NV. Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group

26 Acquisitions and disposals
2008
With effect from 1 January 2008, we entered into an expanded international partnership with Pepsico for the marketing and distribution of
ready-to-drink tea products under the Lipton brand.
On 3 January 2008 we completed the sale of the Boursin brand to Le Groupe Bel for €400 million. The turnover of this brand in 2007 was
approximately €100 million.
On 2 April 2008 we completed the acquisition of Inmarko, the leading Russian ice cream company. The company had a turnover in 2007 of
approximately €115 million.
On 31 July 2008 we completed the sale of our Lawry’s and Adolph’s branded seasoning blends and marinades business in the US and
Canada to McCormick & Company, Incorporated for €410 million. The combined annual turnover of the business in 2007 was approximately
€100 million.
On 9 September 2008 we completed the sale of our North American laundry business in the US, Canada and Puerto Rico to Vestar Capital
Partners, a leading global private equity ﬁrm, for consideration of approximately US $1.45 billion, consisting mainly of cash, along with
preferred shares and warrants. These businesses had a combined turnover in 2007 of approximately US $1.0 billion.
On 5 November 2008 we completed the sale of Komili, our olive oil brand in Turkey, to Ana Gida, part of the Anadolu Group.
On 4 December 2008 we completed the sale of our edible oil business in Côte d’Ivoire, together with its interests in local oil palm plantations
Palmci and PHCI, to SIFCA, the parent company of an Ivorian agro-industry group, and to a 50:50 joint venture between two Singapore-based
companies, Wilmar International Limited and Olam International Limited. At the same time we acquired the soap business of Cosmivoire, a
subsidiary of SIFCA.
On 23 December 2008 we completed the disposal of our Bertolli olive oil and vinegar business to Grupo SOS for a consideration of €630
million. The transaction was structured as a worldwide perpetual licence by Unilever of the Bertolli brand in respect of olive oil and premium
vinegar. The transaction included the sale of the Italian Maya, Dante and San Giorgio olive oil and seed oil businesses, as well as the factory at
Inveruno, Italy.
2007
During 2007 we purchased minority interests in subsidiary companies in Greece and India. We invested in a new venture fund, Physic Ventures,
which is accounted for as an associate, and made additional investments in two other venture companies, Spa and Salon International Limited
and Langholm Capital, both of which are accounted for as associates.
With effect from 1 October 2007, Unilever and Remgro Ltd. reached agreement to reorganise their respective shareholdings in the Unilever
businesses in South Africa and Israel. In the reorganised shareholding Unilever has a majority share in a single South African business and fully
owns the Unilever Israel foods and home and personal care business. As a result of this transaction, Unilever reported a proﬁt on disposal of
€214 million and goodwill of €168 million.
On 1 January 2007, Unilever completed the restructuring of its Portuguese businesses. The result of the reorganisation is that Unilever now has
a 55% share of the combined Portuguese entity, called Unilever Jerónimo Martins. The combined business includes the foods and home and
personal care businesses. The remaining 45% interest is held by Jerónimo Martins Group. The structure of the agreement is such that there is
joint control of the newly formed entity and so it is accounted for by Unilever as a joint venture.
Other disposals in 2007 included the sale of local Brazilian margarine brands. In addition, to further develop our healthy heart brand margarine,
Becel, in Brazil we established a joint venture with Perdigão.
2006
During 2006 we purchased minority interests in subsidiary companies in Greece and Algeria, trademarks in Czech Republic, distribution in
Tunisia and Vashisti business in India. Also an additional investment into Langholm Capital Partners Fund was made and classiﬁed as an
acquisition of associates (see note 11 on page 101).
On 3 November 2006, Unilever announced that it had reached a ﬁnal agreement with Permira Funds to sell the majority of its European frozen
foods business for €1.7 billion. The Unilever businesses being sold in this transaction include the frozen foods operations in Austria, Belgium,
France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal and the United Kingdom.
Other disposals in 2006 were Mora in the Netherlands and Belgium, Finesse in the US, Canada and Sweden, Friol in Italy and Nihar and tea
plantations in India. Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group

29 Share-based compensation plans
As at 31 December 2008, the Group had share-based compensation plans in the form of performance shares, share options and other share
awards. Starting in 2007, performance share awards and restricted stock awards were made under the Global Share Incentive Plan (GSIP),
except in North America where awards were made under the Unilever North America 2002 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan.
The numbers in this note include those for Executive Directors shown in the report of the Remuneration Committee on pages 60 to 73
and those for key management personnel shown in note 31 on page 135. No awards were made to Executive Directors in 2006, 2007
or 2008 under the Unilever North America 2002 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan. Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of the
share-based compensation plans.
The economic fair value of the awards is calculated using option pricing models and the resulting cost is recognised as remuneration cost
amortised over the vesting period of the grant.
Unilever will not grant share options in total in respect of share-based compensation plans for more than 5% of its issued ordinary capital, and
for all plans together, for more than 10% of its issued ordinary capital. The Board does not apportion these limits to each plan separately.
The actual remuneration cost charged in each period is shown below, and relates almost wholly to equity settled plans:

(a) The Group also provides a Share Matching Plan, an All-Employee Share Option Plan, a TSR Long-Term Incentive Plan (no awards after 2006)
and an Executive Option Plan (no awards after 2005).
Performance Share Plans
The Global Performance Share Plan (GPSP) was introduced in 2005. Under this plan, managers were awarded conditional shares which vest
three years later at a level between 0% and 150% (for middle management) or 200% (for senior executives). The GPSP performance conditions
for middle management are achievement of underlying sales growth and ungeared free cash ﬂow targets over a three year period. For senior
executives, in addition to these two conditions, there is an additional target based on TSR ranking in comparison with a peer group over the
three year period (see description on page 43).
In 2007 we introduced the Global Share Incentive Plan (GSIP). The provisions of this plan are comparable with the GPSP , with the same
performance conditions of underlying sales growth and ungeared free cash ﬂow for middle management, and the additional target based on
TSR ranking for senior executives. Starting in 2008, awards made to GSIP participants normally vest at a level between 0% and 200%. Monte
Carlo simulation is used to value the TSR component of the awards.
North America managers participate in the North America Performance Share Programme, introduced in 2001, that awards Unilever shares
if North America company performance targets are met over a three-year period. The amount to be paid to the company by participants to
obtain the shares at vesting is zero.
A summary of the status of the Performance Share Plans as at 31 December 2008, 2007 and 2006 and changes during the years ended on
these dates is presented below:

29 Share-based compensation plans (continued)
Additional information
At 31 December 2008, there were options outstanding to purchase 53 373 170 (2007: 61 579 485) ordinary shares in NV or PLC in respect
of share-based compensation plans of NV and its subsidiaries and the North American plans, and 16 807 546 (2007: 18 296 234) ordinary
shares in NV or PLC in respect of share-based compensation plans of PLC and its subsidiaries.
To satisfy the options granted, certain NV group companies hold 58 100 378 (2007: 68 011 392) ordinary shares of NV or PLC, and trusts in
Jersey and the United Kingdom hold 9 450 493 (2007: 10 920 385) PLC shares. The trustees of these trusts have agreed, until further notice, to
waive dividends on these shares, save for the nominal sum of 0.01p per 3
1
⁄9p ordinary share. Shares acquired for this purpose during 2008
represented less than 0.1% of the Group’s called up capital. The balance of shares held in connection with share plans at 31 December 2008
represented 2.2% (2007: 2.6%) of the Group’s called up capital.
The book value of €1 191 million (2007: €1 305 million) of all shares held in respect of share-based compensation plans for both NV and PLC
is eliminated on consolidation by deduction from other reserves (see note 23 on page 123). Their market value at 31 December 2008 was
€1 134 million (2007: €2 008 million).
At 31 December 2008 the exercise price of 27 102 133 (2007: nil) NV and PLC options were above the market price of the shares.
Shares held to satisfy options are accounted for in accordance with IAS 32 and SIC 12. All differences between the purchase price of the shares
held to satisfy options granted and the proceeds received for the shares, whether on exercise or lapse, are charged to reserves. In 2008 this
includes €6 million (2007: € nil) for shares held to meet options expiring in the short term which are priced above market value. The basis of
the charge to operating proﬁt for the economic value of options granted is discussed on page 133.
Between 31 December 2008 and 27 February 2009, no grants were made and 161 563 shares were forfeited related to the performance share
plans. Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group

Unilever N.V.
Report on the company accounts
We have audited the company accounts which are part of the
Annual Report 2008 of Unilever N.V., Rotterdam, for the year
ended 31 December 2008 which comprise the balance sheet,
income statement and the related notes on pages 143 to 145.
We have reported separately on the consolidated accounts of the
Unilever Group for the year ended 31 December 2008.
Directors’ responsibility
The Directors are responsible for the preparation and fair
presentation of the company accounts in accordance with United
Kingdom accounting standards and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the
Netherlands Civil Code, and for the preparation of the Report
of the Directors in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the
Netherlands Civil Code. This responsibility includes: designing,
implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the
preparation and fair presentation of the company accounts that
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
error; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies;
and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in
the circumstances.
Auditor’s responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company
accounts based on our audit. We conducted our audit in
accordance with Dutch law. This law requires that we comply
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance whether the company accounts
are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence
about the amounts and disclosures in the company accounts.
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement,
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of
the company accounts, whether due to fraud or error. In making
those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control
relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the
company accounts in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal
control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of
accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates made by the Directors, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the company accounts.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufﬁcient
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the company accounts give a true and fair view
of the ﬁnancial position of Unilever N.V. as at 31 December 2008,
and of its result for the year then ended in accordance with
United Kingdom accounting standards and with Part 9 of Book 2
of the Netherlands Civil Code.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
Pursuant to the legal requirement under 2:393 sub 5 part f
of the Netherlands Civil Code, we report, to the extent of
our competence, that the Report of the Directors is consistent
with the company accounts as required by 2:391 sub 4 of
the Netherlands Civil Code.

taxation and other income and expenses after taxes. The company accounts of Unilever N.V. do not contain a cash ﬂow statement as this is
not required by Book 2 of the Civil Code in the Netherlands.

Accounting information and policies
Basis of preparation
The company accounts of Unilever N.V. comply in all material respects
with legislation in the Netherlands. As allowed by Article 362.1 of
Book 2 of the Civil Code in the Netherlands, the company accounts
are prepared in accordance with United Kingdom accounting
standards, unless such standards conﬂict with the Civil Code in
the Netherlands which would in such case prevail.
The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention as
modiﬁed by the revaluation of ﬁnancial assets classiﬁed as ‘available-
for-sale investments’, ‘ﬁnancial assets at fair value through proﬁt
or loss’, and ‘derivative ﬁnancial instruments’ in accordance with
the accounting policies set out below which have been
consistently applied.
Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies are as follows:
Fixed investments
Shares in group companies are stated at cost less any amounts written
off to reﬂect a permanent impairment. Any impairment is charged
to the proﬁt and loss account as it arises. In accordance with Article
385.5 of Book 2 of the Civil Code in the Netherlands, Unilever N.V.
shares held by Unilever N.V. subsidiaries are deducted from the
carrying value of those subsidiaries. This differs from the accounting
treatment under UK GAAP , which would require these amounts to be
included within ﬁxed investments.
Financial instruments and derivative ﬁnancial instruments
The company’s accounting policies under United Kingdom generally
accepted accounting principles (UK GAAP) namely FRS 25 ‘Financial
Instruments: Presentation’, FRS 26 ‘Financial Instruments:
Measurement’ and FRS 29 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ are the
same as the Unilever Group’s accounting policies under International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) namely IAS 32 ‘Financial
Instruments: Presentation’, IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition
and Measurement’ and IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’. The
policies are set out under the heading ‘Financial instruments’ in note 1
to the consolidated accounts on pages 85 and 86. NV is taking the
exemption for not providing all the ﬁnancial instruments disclosures,
because IFRS 7 disclosures are given in note 17 to the consolidated
accounts on pages 108 to 113.
Deferred taxation
Full provision is made for deferred taxation on all signiﬁcant timing
differences arising from the recognition of items for taxation purposes
in different periods from those in which they are included in the
company's accounts. Full provision is made at the rates of tax
prevailing at the year end unless future rates have been enacted
or substantively enacted. Deferred tax assets and liabilities have
not been discounted.
Own shares held
Own shares held by the company are accounted for in accordance
with Dutch law and UK GAAP , namely FRS 25 ‘Financial Instruments:
Presentation’. All differences between the purchase price of the shares
held to satisfy options granted and the proceeds received for the
shares, whether on exercise or lapse, are charged to reserves.
Retirement beneﬁts
Unilever N.V. has accounted for pensions and similar beneﬁts under
the United Kingdom Financial Reporting Standard 17 'Retirement
beneﬁts' (FRS 17). The operating and ﬁnancing costs of deﬁned
beneﬁt plans are recognised separately in the proﬁt and loss account;
service costs are systematically spread over the service lives of
employees, and ﬁnancing costs are recognised in the periods in which
they arise. Variations from expected costs, arising from the experience
of the plans or changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised
immediately in the statement of total recognised gains and losses. The
costs of individual events such as past service beneﬁt enhancements,
settlements and curtailments are recognised immediately in the proﬁt
and loss account. The liabilities and, where applicable, the assets of
deﬁned beneﬁt plans are recognised at fair value in the balance sheet.
The charges to the proﬁt and loss account for deﬁned contribution
plans are the company contributions payable and the assets of such
plans are not included in the company balance sheet.
Dividends
Under Financial Reporting Standard 21 ‘Events after the Balance Sheet
Date’ (FRS 21), proposed dividends do not meet the deﬁnition of a
liability until such time as they have been approved by shareholders at
the Annual General Meeting. Therefore, we do not recognise a liability
in any period for dividends that have been proposed but will not be
approved until after the balance sheet date. This holds for external
dividends as well as intra-group dividends paid to the parent company.
Taxation
Unilever N.V, together with certain of its subsidiaries, is part of a tax
grouping for Dutch corporate income tax purposes. The members of
the ﬁscal entity are jointly and severally liable for any taxes payable by
the Dutch tax grouping. Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008 145

Share premium account
The share premium shown in the balance sheet is not available for the
issue of bonus shares or for repayment without incurring withholding
tax payable by the company. This is despite the change in tax law in
the Netherlands, as a result of which dividends received from 2001
onwards by individual shareholders who are resident in the
Netherlands are no longer taxed.

Contingent liabilities are not expected to give rise to any material
loss and include guarantees given for group companies. The estimated
total of such liabilities as at 31 December 2008 was some
€6 050 million (2007: €5 204 million) of which €4 420 million
(2007: €3 706 million) was also guaranteed by PLC. The fair value
of such guarantees was not signiﬁcant in either 2007 or 2008.
The guarantees issued to other companies were immaterial.
NV has issued joint and several liability undertakings, as deﬁned in
Article 403 of Book 2 of the Civil Code in the Netherlands, for almost
all Dutch group companies. These written undertakings have been
ﬁled with the ofﬁce of the Company Registry in whose area of
jurisdiction the group company concerned has its registered ofﬁce. Further statutory and other information Unilever N.V .

The rules for proﬁt appropriation in the Articles of Association
(summary of Article 38)
The proﬁt for the year is applied ﬁrstly to the reserves required by law
or by the Equalisation Agreement, secondly to cover losses of previous
years, if any, and thirdly to the reserves deemed necessary by the
Board of Directors. Dividends due to the holders of the Cumulative
Preference Shares, including any arrears in such dividends, are then
paid; if the proﬁt is insufﬁcient for this purpose, the amount available
is distributed to them in proportion to the dividend percentages of
their shares. Any proﬁt remaining thereafter shall be distributed to
them in proportion to the dividend percentages of their shares. The
General Meeting can only decide to make distributions from reserves
on the basis of a proposal by the Board and in compliance with the
law and the Equalisation Agreement.

31 December 2008. The dividend will be submitted for formal
approval at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 14 May
2009. In accordance with FRS 21, these ﬁnancial statements do
not reﬂect this dividend payable, which will be accounted for in
shareholders’ equity as an appropriation of retained earnings in
the year ended 31 December 2009. During 2008, a ﬁnal dividend
of €0.50 per share (totalling €779 million) was paid in respect of
the dividend declared for the year ended 31 December 2007.

Company accounts Auditors’ report – Unilever PLC
Independent auditors’ report to the shareholders of
Unilever PLC on the parent company accounts
We have audited the parent company accounts of Unilever PLC
for the year ended 31 December 2008 which comprise the
balance sheet and the related notes. These parent company
accounts have been prepared under the accounting policies set
out therein. We have also audited the information in the Report
of the Remuneration Committee that is described as having
been audited.
We have reported separately on the consolidated accounts of the
Unilever Group for the year ended 31 December 2008.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the parent company
accounts in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and
United Kingdom accounting standards (United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of
Directors’ Responsibilities on page 78. The Directors are also
responsible for preparing the Annual Report, including the Report
of the Remuneration Committee.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company accounts and
the part of the Report of the Remuneration Committee to be
audited in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and
Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared
for and only for the shareholders of Unilever PLC as a body in
accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for
no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or
assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other
person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may
come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company
accounts give a true and fair view and whether the parent
company accounts and the part of the Report of the
Remuneration Committee to be audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also
report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the
Report of the Directors (excluding the audited parts of the Report
of the Remuneration Committee) is consistent with the parent
company accounts.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the parent
company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for our
audit, or if information speciﬁed by law regarding Directors’
remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and
consider whether it is consistent with the audited parent company
accounts. The other information comprises only the Report of the
Directors (excluding the audited parts of the Report of the
Remuneration Committee), the Shareholder information, the
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities, the Financial record and
the sections headed ‘Further statutory and other information’. We
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of
any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the
parent company accounts. Our responsibilities do not extend to
any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis,
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
parent company accounts and the part of the Report of the
Remuneration Committee to be audited. It also includes an
assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgements made
by the Directors in the preparation of the parent company
accounts, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate
to the company’s circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the parent company accounts and the part of the
Report of the Remuneration Committee to be audited are free
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other

Notes to the company accounts Unilever PLC
Accounting information and policies
Basis of preparation
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with applicable
United Kingdom accounting standards and the United Kingdom
Companies Act 1985.
The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention as
modiﬁed by the revaluation of ﬁnancial assets classiﬁed as ‘available-for-
sale investments’, ‘ﬁnancial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss’,
and ‘derivative ﬁnancial instruments’ in accordance with the accounting
policies set out below which have been consistently applied.
Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies are as follows:
Intangible assets
Intangible assets comprise trademarks purchased after 1 January 1998
and are amortised in the proﬁt and loss account over their expected
useful lives of up to a maximum of 20 years. They are subject to
review for impairment in accordance with United Kingdom Financial
Reporting Standard 11 ‘Impairment of Fixed Assets and Goodwill’
(FRS 11). Any impairment is charged to the proﬁt and loss account
as it arises.
Fixed asset investments
Shares in group companies are stated at cost less any amounts written
off to reﬂect a permanent impairment. Any impairment is charged to
the proﬁt and loss account as it arises.
Financial instruments
The company’s accounting policies under United Kingdom generally
accepted accounting principles (UK GAAP) namely FRS 25 ‘Financial
Instruments: Presentation’, FRS 26 ‘Financial Instruments:
Measurement’ and FRS 29 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ are the
same as the Unilever Group’s accounting policies under International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) namely IAS 32 ‘Financial
Instruments: Presentation’, IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition
and Measurement’ and IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’. The
policies are set out under the heading ‘Financial instruments’ in note 1
to the consolidated accounts on pages 85 and 86. PLC is taking the
exemption for not providing all the ﬁnancial instruments disclosures,
because IFRS 7 disclosures are given in note 17 to the consolidated
accounts on pages 108 to 113.
Deferred taxation
Full provision is made for deferred taxation on all signiﬁcant timing
differences arising from the recognition of items for taxation purposes
in different periods from those in which they are included in the
company’s accounts. Full provision is made at the rates of tax
prevailing at the year end unless future rates have been enacted
or substantively enacted. Deferred tax assets and liabilities have not
been discounted.
Shares held by employee share trusts
Shares held to satisfy options are accounted for in accordance with
UK GAAP , namely FRS 25 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ and
Urgent Issues Task Force abstract 38 ‘Accounting for ESOP Trusts’
(UITF 38). All differences between the purchase price of the shares
held to satisfy options granted and the proceeds received for the
shares, whether on exercise or lapse, are charged to other reserves.
Dividends
Under Financial Reporting Standard 21 ‘Events after the Balance Sheet
Date’ (FRS 21), proposed dividends do not meet the deﬁnition of a
liability until such time as they have been approved by shareholders
at the Annual General Meeting. Therefore, we do not recognise a
liability in any period for dividends that have been proposed but will
not be approved until after the balance sheet date. This holds for
external dividends as well as intra-group dividends paid to the parent
company. Notes to the company accounts Unilever PLC

Contingent liabilities
Contingent liabilities are not expected to give rise to any material loss
and include guarantees given for group companies. The estimated total
of such liabilities at 31 December 2008 was some £7 905 million
(2007: £4 372 million) of which £4 319 million (2007: £2 720 million)
was also guaranteed by NV. The fair value of such guarantees is not
signiﬁcant in either 2007 or 2008. The guarantees issued to other
companies were immaterial.
Remuneration of auditors
The parent company accounts of Unilever PLC are required to comply
with The Companies (Disclosure of Auditor Remuneration) Regulations
2005. Auditors’ remuneration in respect of Unilever PLC is included
within the disclosures in note 32 on page 136.

approval at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 13 May 2009.
In accordance with FRS 21, these ﬁnancial statements do not reﬂect
this dividend payable, which will be accounted for in shareholders’
equity as an appropriation of retained earnings in the year ending
31 December 2009. During 2008, a ﬁnal dividend of 34.11p per share
(totalling £439 million) was paid in respect of the dividend declared for
the year ended 31 December 2007. Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008 151

Further statutory and other information Unilever PLC
Employee involvement and communication
Unilever’s UK companies maintain formal processes to inform,
consult and involve employees and their representatives. A high
proportion of the United Kingdom sites are accredited to the
Investors in People standard. Our sites also use tools such as Total
Productive Maintenance which rely heavily on employee
involvement, contribution and commitment.
A National Consultative Council covering employees and
management representatives exists to provide a forum for
discussing issues relating to the United Kingdom. A European
Works Council, embracing employee and management
representatives from countries within Europe, has been
in existence for several years and provides a forum for discussing
issues that extend across national boundaries.
The directors’ reports of the United Kingdom group companies
contain more details about how they have communicated with
their employees during 2008.
Equal opportunities and diversity
The heads of all operating companies and units in the UK have
committed their businesses to achieving greater diversity. Every
Unilever company in the United Kingdom has an equal
opportunities policy and actively pursues equality of opportunity
for all employees.
Our equal opportunities policy is designed, among other things,
to ensure that people with disabilities, and other under-
represented groups, are given the same training, development
and prospects as other employees. Every effort is also made to
retrain and support employees who become disabled while
working within the Group.
The company carries out regular employee monitoring surveys.
The company continues to review ways in which greater diversity
can be achieved in recruitment and selection.
The company continues to put in place policies which promote
the achievement of diversity in the business. We have policies on
home working, ﬂexible working, maternity and paternity leave,
child care provision and career breaks, which help us to meet this
objective.
Charitable and other contributions
Unilever collates the cost of its community involvement activities
using the London Benchmarking Group model. The model
recommends the separation of charitable donations, community
investment, commercial initiatives in the community and
management costs relating to the programme of activity.
During 2008 UK group companies made a total contribution of
£6.0 million, analysed as follows:
• Charitable donations: £0.7 million.
• Community investment: £0.6 million.
• Commercial initiatives in the community: £4.5 million.
• Management costs: £0.2 million.
No donation or contribution was made or expenditure incurred
for political purposes.
Supplier payment policies
Individual operating companies are responsible for agreeing the
terms and conditions under which business transactions with their
suppliers are conducted. The directors’ reports of the United
Kingdom operating companies give information about their
supplier payment policies as required by the UK Companies Act
1985. PLC, as a holding company, does not itself make any
relevant payments in this respect.
Auditors and disclosure of information to auditors
A resolution will be proposed at the AGM on 13 May 2009 for
the re-appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors of
PLC. The present appointment will end at the conclusion of the
AGM.
To the best of each of the Directors’ knowledge and belief,
and having made appropriate enquiries of other ofﬁcers of the
Unilever Group, all information relevant to enabling the auditors
to provide their opinions on PLC’s consolidated and parent
company accounts has been provided. Each of the Directors
has taken all reasonable steps to ensure their awareness of any
relevant audit information and to establish that the company’s
auditors are aware of any such information.
Authority to purchase own shares
At the AGM of PLC held on 14 May 2008, authority was given
pursuant to Article 64 of the PLC Articles of Association to make
market purchases of PLC ordinary shares of 3
1
⁄9p each, to a
maximum of 290 million shares. This authority will expire at the
AGM on 13 May 2009, and a resolution will be proposed to
renew the authority. On 1 August 2008, Unilever PLC announced
that it had purchased 15 140 779 Unilever PLC ordinary shares
under this authority.
Details of shares purchased by an employee share trust and
Unilever group companies to satisfy options granted under PLC’s
employee share schemes are given in the report of the
Remuneration Committee on page 71 and in note 29 to the
consolidated accounts on pages 133 to 134.
Directors’ report of PLC and limitations of liability
For the purposes of Section 234 of the Companies Act 1985, the
Directors’ Report of Unilever PLC for the year ended 31 December
2008 comprises this and the following page and the information

in this Annual Report.
The Directors’ Report has been drawn up and presented in

liabilities of the Directors in connection with that report shall be
subject to the limitations and restrictions provided by such law. Further statutory and other information Unilever PLC
152 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Financial statements
Under the Companies Act 2006, a safe harbour limits the liability
of Directors in respect of statements in and omissions from the
Directors’ Report. Under English Law the Directors would be liable
to Unilever (but not to any third party) if the Directors’ Report
contains errors as a result of recklessness or knowing
misstatement or dishonest concealment of a material fact, but
would not otherwise be liable.
Business review
The UK Companies Act 2006 requires Unilever PLC to set out in
this report a fair review of the business of the Group during the
ﬁnancial year ended 31 December 2008 including a description of
the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group and an
analysis of the position of the Group’s business at the end of the

Exchange controls affecting security holders
The Netherlands Act on Financial Supervision (Wet op het ﬁnancieel toezicht (Wft)) came into effect on 1 January 2007. The Wft brings
together practically all the rules and conditions that applied to the ﬁnancial markets and their supervision. Under this Act the Minister
of Finance is authorised to issue regulations relating to ﬁnancial transactions concerning the movement of capital to or from third
countries with respect to direct investments, establishment, the performing of ﬁnancial services, the admission of negotiable
instruments or goods with respect to which regulations have been issued under the Import and Export Act in the interest of the
international legal system or an arrangement relevant thereto. These regulations may contain a prohibition to perform any of the
actions indicated in those regulations without a licence. To date no regulations of this type have been issued which are applicable to
Unilever N.V.
There are currently no exchange controls affecting PLC shareholders. Shareholder information continued
Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008 155
Shareholder information
Nature of the trading market
The principal trading markets upon which Unilever shares are
listed are Euronext Amsterdam for NV depositary receipts of
ordinary and preference shares and the London Stock Exchange
for PLC ordinary shares. NV ordinary shares mainly trade in the
form of depositary receipts for shares.
In the United States, NV New York Registry Shares and PLC
American Depositary Receipts are traded on the New York Stock
Exchange. Citibank, N.A. acts for NV and PLC as issuer, transfer
agent and, in respect of the PLC American Depositary Receipts,
depositary.
There have not been any signiﬁcant trading suspensions in the
past three years.
At 27 February 2009 there were 5 976 registered holders of NV
New York Registry Shares and 846 registered holders of PLC
American Depositary Receipts in the United States. We estimate
that approximately 17% of NV’s ordinary shares were held in the
United States (approximately 18% in 2007), while most holders
of PLC ordinary shares are registered in the United Kingdom –
approximately 99% in 2008 and in 2007.
NV and PLC are separate companies with separate stock exchange
listings and different shareholders. Shareholders cannot convert
or exchange the shares of one for shares of the other and the
relative share prices on the various markets can, and do,
ﬂuctuate. Each NV ordinary share now represents the same
underlying economic interest in the Unilever Group as each PLC
ordinary share (save for exchange rate ﬂuctuations).
If you are a shareholder of NV, you have an interest in a Dutch
legal entity, your dividends will be paid in euros (converted into
US dollars if you have shares registered in the United States) and
you may be subject to tax in the Netherlands. If you are a
shareholder of PLC, your interest is in a UK legal entity, your
dividends will be paid in sterling (converted into US dollars if you
have American Depositary Receipts) and you may be subject to
UK tax. Nevertheless, the Equalisation Agreement means that as
a shareholder of either company you effectively have an interest
in the whole of Unilever. You have largely equal rights over our
combined net proﬁt and capital reserves as shown in the
consolidated accounts. See Equalisation Agreement on pages 51
and 52.
As announced on 5 February 2009, at the 2009 AGMs and at
separate Meetings of Ordinary Shareholders we will be proposing
resolutions to authorise the Directors to modify the Equalisation
Agreement to facilitate the payment of quarterly dividends from
2010 onwards. This will allow us to change to a simpler and more
transparent dividend practice for the Unilever Group. These
changes will result in more frequent payments to shareholders,
and better align with the cash ﬂow generation of the business.

listings are shown in the tables on the following page. Shareholder information continued

Shareholder information
Dividend record
Our interim ordinary dividends are normally announced in November and paid in December. Final ordinary dividends are normally
proposed in February and, if approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meetings, paid in June.
The following tables show the dividends paid by NV and PLC for the last ﬁve years, expressed in terms of the revised share
denominations which became effective from 22 May 2006. Dividends have been translated into US dollars at the exchange rates
prevailing on the dates of declaration of the dividend with the exception of the proposed ﬁnal dividend for 2008 (see below).
Differences between the amounts ultimately received by US holders of NV and PLC shares are the result of changes in exchange rate
between the equalisation of the dividends and the date of payment.
The interim dividend is normally 35% of the previous year’s total normal dividend per share, based on the stronger of our two parent
currencies over the ﬁrst nine months of the year. Equalisation of the interim dividend in the other currency takes place at the average
exchange rate of the third quarter. Equalisation of the ﬁnal dividend takes place at the average exchange rate for the full year.
Final dividends for 2008 are payable on 18 June 2009, subject to approval at the AGMs. For purposes of illustration, the amounts
payable in respect of NV New York Registry Shares and PLC ADRs have been translated in the table below at rates of exchange on
4 February 2009, which was the day before the date on which the proposed dividends were announced. The actual amounts payable
in US dollars will be calculated by reference to the exchange rates on the day on which the dividends are approved (14 May 2009 in
the case of NV and 13 May 2009 in the case of PLC).
The dividend timetable for 2008 is shown on page 158.

As announced on 5 February 2009, at the 2009 AGMs and at separate Meetings of Ordinary Shareholders we will be proposing resolutions to
authorise the Directors to modify the Equalisation Agreement to facilitate the payment of quarterly dividends from 2010 onwards. This will allow us
to change to a simpler and more transparent dividend practice for the Unilever group. These changes will result in more frequent payments to
shareholders, and better align with the cash ﬂow generation of the business. Shareholder information continued

This document may contain forward-looking statements, including ‘forward-looking statements’ within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation

based upon current expectations and assumptions regarding anticipated developments and other factors affecting the Group. They are not historical facts, nor are
they guarantees of future performance. Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause actual

consumption levels, costs, the ability to maintain and manage key customer relationships and supply chain sources, currency values, interest rates, the ability to
integrate acquisitions and complete planned divestitures, the ability to complete planned restructuring activities, physical risks, environmental risks, the ability to
manage regulatory, tax and legal matters and resolve pending matters within current estimates, legislative, ﬁscal and regulatory developments, political, economic
and social conditions in the geographic markets where the Group operates and new or changed priorities of the Boards. Further details of potential risks and
uncertainties affecting the Group are described in the Group’s ﬁlings with the London Stock Exchange, Euronext Amsterdam and the US Securities and Exchange

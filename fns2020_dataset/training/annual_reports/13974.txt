_1_SDI_front_ar07.indd   1 08/04/2008   17:00:37 SDI Group is underpinned by over 30 years’ experience operating 
within the retail sector and is aware of the challenges facing customers, 
such as increased competition, margin reduction, consolidation and 
new channels to market. Its solutions are designed to be future proof 
and to help retailers create competitive edge through innovation and 
increased efficiency. The Group is now successfully applying this 
wealth of knowledge to new sectors and working closely with leading 
players in the wholesale, fulfilment and e-commerce arenas.
SDI Group works closely in partnership with each client providing 
a bespoke solution that brings financial value and operational 
efficiencies. Over the years the Company’s impressive growth and 
unrivalled levels of repeat business – over 50% – is testament 
to the success of this approach.
As SDI Group offers both consultancy and systems integration, 
clients can benefit from a total logistics solution package which 
includes materials handling consulting, as well as design, 
engineering, fabrication, installation and integration services.
The Group manufactures some specialised pieces of hardware 
and provides training on operating the systems and also has its 
own teams which programme and maintain the software to run 
the systems. This is important in that it helps lock-in the customer 
in terms of future developments and maintenance revenues. 
The solutions are sometimes installed in completely new buildings 
or alternatively projects can be automated improvements to existing 
operations designed to reduce distribution costs and support the 
customers’ expectations of future growth. These solutions are 
essential for high street retailers to be able to maintain margins 
through reduction of distribution costs at a time when retail globally has 
been experiencing immense competition on both value and choice.
SDI consistently delivers its projects on time and on budget and 
takes responsibility for the success of every aspect of work that 
is undertaken. This means that clients can be rest assured that their 
return on investment is safe.

b CONSULTING AND DESIGN 
b GLObAL OPPORTUNITIES
The Group’s software development resource 
is strongly represented by three dedicated 
development centres located in the USA, the 
UK and in Germany. SDI is continually upgrading 
and enhancing its systems technology to improve 
both its product portfolio and service offering 
to customers. Robust software packages have 
been designed to run sortation, warehouse 
control, diagnostics and maintenance systems 
to the most exacting standards – irrespective 
of whether they are stand-alone or if they have 
been interfaced with customers’ own host systems. 
SDI ensures that its software allows customers 
to get the most from their warehouse or distribution 
centre and operates a ‘best in class’ approach 
ensuring that the most appropriate software 
is supplied. Sortation, storage and distribution 
are all managed in order to balance the efficient 
use of resources against the optimisation 
of available storage. Complete stock and user 
traceability is provided through the systematic 
auditing of all events, either user initiated 
or automatically performed.
SDI’s consulting and design teams have 
considerable experience in a range of different 
disciplines including retail operations, architecture, 
industrial, mechanical and electrical engineering, 
software engineering and marketing. Its unique 
consultancy approach consistently delivers 
innovative solutions that bring about real 
business benefits such as optimised workforce, 
increased operational efficiency, performance, 
visibility and control.
SDI has long-standing relationships with many 
global retailers. By developing its own international 
presence, it has been able to leverage these 
relationships as its customers expand off-shore. 
As retail continues to move into the Eastern Bloc 
and Asia, SDI has the opportunity to further 
develop its global coverage and move into new 
markets. This model is well proven in France, 
Spain and Italy where customers have been able 
to use SDI’s experience to gain a competitive 
advantage in their local markets.

chAIRMAN’s sTATEMENT
I am delighted to present SDI Group plc’s inaugural set of preliminary 
results since the Group’s admission to AIM on 2 July 2007. 
The results, which are ahead of market expectations despite 
a weak dollar for much of the period, cover the twelve months 
ended 30 November 2007. This was a transformation year for 
the Group which is today recognised as a leading international 
specialist in the design, build and support of bespoke integrated 
materials handling solutions for international retail, fulfilment and 
e-commerce distribution.
The admission, and in particular the restructuring of the Group 
into a single entity and brand, is already delivering tangible 
positive results with offices now collaborating on larger projects. 
The admission process was lengthy and time-consuming for senior 
management, and it is a testimony to the quality of the team that 
organic growth was delivered in the period under review. 
fINANCIALS AND kEy PERfORmANCE INDICATORS
The consolidation of Group companies complicates this year’s 
financial results. The consolidation of the Group companies 
took place on 2 July 2007 through a reverse acquisition by 
SDI Industries Inc., a privately held US based company, of the 
SDI Group which contained the remaining Group companies. 
Consequently the figures for the year ended 30 November 2007 are 
for SDI Industries Inc. (and subsidiaries) up to 2 July 2007, and for 
the Group as a whole from then onwards. The comparative figures 
for the year ended 30 November 2006 are for SDI Industries Inc. 
(and subsidiaries) only.
Therefore, in order to give a clearer indication of the Group’s 
progress over the last year, we are providing unaudited proforma 
comparison figures (note 30) for 2007 with comparative unaudited 
proforma results for 2006. These proforma figures are prepared 
on a consistent basis to the analyst research note published by 
Cenkos Securities on 28 May 2007 prior to admission. 
Reported revenue for the year ended 30 November 2007 increased 
47% to £41.3m (2006: £28.1m). Proforma Group revenue increased 
by 9% to £57.5m from £52.7m. The increase in proforma revenue 
was wholly organic. Gross profit margins increased to 25.5% 
(2006: 16.6%), (proforma 2007: 29.5% and proforma 2006: 25.9%). 
Administration expenses excluding exceptional items increased 
to £5.6m (2006: £3.0m), (proforma 2007: £9.5m and proforma 
2006: £9.4m) as a result of the increased costs associated with 
being a listed company.
Operating profit increased 19.2% to £3.8m (2006: £1.3m) 
Operating profit, before amortisation of intangibles arising on the 
business combinations and IPO costs charged to expenses 
of £1.1m, increased 279% to £4.9m (2006: £1.3m). Proforma 
operating profit increased to £7.5m (proforma 2006: £4.3m). 
_1_SDI_front_ar07.indd   4 08/04/2008   17:00:39 SDI GROUP PLC
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007 05
Profit before tax, after amortisation of intangibles arising on the 
business combinations and IPO costs charged to expense, 
increased 147% to £4.2m from £1.7m in 2006 (proforma profit 
before tax increased 67% to £7.7m from £4.6m in 2006).
The cash position and balance sheet remains strong, with the 
Group’s cash and cash equivalents increasing to £10.1m from 
£6.0m at 30 November 2006.
DIvIDEND
On the basis of the performance this year, and reflecting our 
confidence in the future, the Board is recommending a final dividend 
of 0.9p per share, which, if approved at the Annual General Meeting, 
will be in line with market expectations. The final dividend will be paid 
on 9 June 2008 to shareholders registered at 9 May 2008.
STRATEGy The Group has continued to win contracts in existing markets with 
high profile customers across the world such as Asda George 
in the UK, M&S Mode in the Netherlands and Stage Stores 
in the US. The year has also seen project wins in new sectors 
such as automotive and healthcare including a contract win with 
Spanish healthcare service provider Logarithm.
It is our intention, whilst continuing to focus on our core market 
of non-food retail, to continue to explore new product categories where 
our products and solutions are applicable. A further opportunity is the 
growth of ‘buy at point of view’ channels which has led to a significant 
volume increase in parcel handling and the requirement for internet 
fulfilment solutions. The Group has responded to this by extending 
its solutions and software products to meet this new market and, as 
a result, has recently won a contract with Vente-Privee.com in France, 
a fashion internet retailer. 
Our maintenance support, which currently equates to around 10% 
of our business, is another key potential growth area providing 
us with an additional, consistent long term revenue stream.
Our strategy for growth also includes enhancing our international 
offering yet further by creating a presence in additional territories. 
Since the IPO, the Group has continued to develop a market 
presence in India, Germany and Brazil. At the same time, we believe 
the market in which we operate to be highly fragmented and we will 
continue to assess these consolidation opportunities as they arise.
PEOPLE
As part of the admission process the Board was reformulated. 
In addition to myself as Non-executive Chairman, I am delighted 
that Richard Arkle has joined as a Non-executive Director 
with a strong financial background. Don De Sanctis stepped 
out of day-to-day control of the US business but remains 
a Non-executive Director providing a wealth of experience of the 
industry. Mary Adams joined the Board having stepped up to replace 
Don in running the US operations.
I would like to make special mention of CEO Gordon Smith and 
CFO Gary Pyle who led the business through the admission 
and re-organisation process and have done a great job with the 
business emerging in such fine shape.
I would like to take this opportunity, on behalf of the Board, to thank 
all the employees of the Group, across the ten countries in which 
we operate, for their dedication and continuing contribution to the 
success of the Group. We are confident that we can build on the 
successes in 2007 and that we now have the right structure, 
people and strategy in place to continue to develop the business 
and achieve its full potential.
fUTURE REPORTING
The financial year end for many retailers is the end of December 
or the end of January. This can impact decision making processes at 
our primary customers on major capital expenditure. Consequently, 
the clarity of the future pipeline for our business can be obscured 
in the Group’s current reporting and planning cycle at the end of 
November. The Board has taken the decision to move the Group’s 
financial year end to 31 March. As a result, for the next financial 
period there will be two sets of interim results for the periods to 
31 May 2008 and 30 November 2008, followed by preliminary 
results for the 16 month period to 31 March 2009.
CURRENT TRADING AND OUTLOOk The Group has a strong order book as we enter 2008, although the 
benefits of this are likely to be phased towards the second half of the 
year. The services and solutions we provide are such that they can 
demonstrate real cost savings to the retail sector as they help drive 
efficiencies. As a result, we continue to see opportunities for us, even 
in a tougher high street trading environment. In addition, by looking at 
new products and new markets we believe we can continue our drive 
to grow market share in materials handling solutions for the retail, 
wholesale, e-commerce and fulfilment sectors. 
I am delighted with the Group’s progress so far and your Board 
looks forward to the forthcoming year with confidence.

ChIEF ExECUTIVE’S REVIEW 
The past year has been one of both high activity and growth as 
we instigated and completed the restructuring of the Group leading 
up to our admission to AIM in July 2007. Our principal objective 
in bringing the business to AIM was to facilitate a coherent single 
brand across the world and, as a result, utilise our existing capital 
and extensive consultancy capability to grow and develop the 
business. The response from our customers has been extremely 
positive; SDI Group is now being seen as a company which 
is capable of performing on a world stage. 
This result is a testament to the quality of our team. Despite the 
significant nature of the Group restructuring and admission to AIM, 
it did not detract from the effective running and development of the 
business, nor has it diminished the enthusiasm for the future 
development of SDI Group.
I am pleased to report that our more cohesive structure and new 
operational procedures resulting from the reorganisation of Group 
companies have delivered a platform on which we have been able 
to increase collaboration as well as sharing best practice in order 
to broaden our offering to existing and new customers. This has 
meant specifically increasing our strengths in internet fulfilment and 
developing a number of new markets by product and geography.
This continues to be work in progress and is being driven by 
our senior consultants who are seeing real benefit through this 
change. More specifically, the admission to AIM, and in particular 
the restructuring, has enabled the Group to be seen as a market 
leader in apparel materials handling solutions with significant 
market share and customer references. I believe this will continue 
to be a significant strength in the future growth of the business.
During the year to 30 November 2007, we started to see the benefits 
of the globalisation of SDI in that we were able to compete on larger 
projects and secure contract wins with new international customers. 
Furthermore, the added products, in both software and hardware 
terms available from the enlarged Group, enabled contract wins in new 
markets such as the automotive, healthcare and the parcel industries. 
I am also extremely encouraged by the creation of a new maintenance 
department in the USA based on the model employed in the UK. 
Our existing customer base has welcomed this enhancement to our 
offering and we are fast-tracking the recruitment of maintenance staff 
to keep up with growing demand. This model will be rolled out to all 
SDI Group companies by June 2008.
_1_SDI_front_ar07.indd   6 08/04/2008   17:00:41 SDI GROUP PLC
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007 07
The Group’s consultancy services provide the blueprint for the 
solution on any given project and this will typically differentiate the 
Group from its competitors. The Group’s operations in Germany, 
the USA and the UK also provide the bespoke software solution and 
maintenance which ensures that relationships with these customers 
continue after installation. As well as providing the Group with ongoing 
revenue streams, it enables the Group to be well positioned for 
involvement with the future projects of these customers.
Our vision continues to be to grow market share through reaching 
out further internationally to new countries and hence new 
customers, while further enhancing existing solutions to drive 
distribution costs down. 
Whilst the Group’s main operations are in the UK and the USA, 
we have a growing presence in other jurisdictions including France, 
Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Chile. To accompany this growth 
strategy we have also identified the requirement to compete with 
a number of our competitors in their home market of Germany. 
To achieve this objective we have formed SDI Group Germany and 
recruited the former Chief Executive of a major global competitor 
to grow and develop this business. We will seek to accelerate our 
penetration into the German market both organically and through 
acquisition where appropriate.
We are also seeing an expansion across the developing retail 
markets of the world and are currently working on the formation 
of SDI India and the development of SDI Brazil with local partners 
to work on a number of opportunities we currently have through 
references from US retailers. During 2008 we intend to investigate 
opportunities in Eastern Europe where we have had a number of 
enquiries in the last three months for consultancy services which 
we expect to lead to design and build projects in due course.
This expanding international market is driven by three principal 
factors: firstly, retailers are increasing the variety of products sold 
as well as providing a larger variety of sizes, specifications and 
price ranges in an attempt to enhance their offering in response to 
consumer demand; secondly, retailers in general, and large garment 
retailers in particular, are moving to source their products from lower 
cost jurisdictions around the world, leading to a corresponding 
increase in logistics requirements; and thirdly, the developing retail 
markets themselves have been experiencing a dramatic increase 
in distribution requirements as their local market develops with large 
stores and consolidation of smaller retailers.
As a result of the international structure of the business and our 
reducing dependence on any one country for profits, we believe 
that, despite a slowing high street sales environment in UK and USA, 
we are seeing increasing activity levels in mainland Europe and an 
increasing requirement by all retailers to decrease distribution costs 
to improve margins; it is here we are showing ourselves ideally 
placed to show retailers opportunities to reduce costs. 
The global nature of the business and its sustained growth 
continues to present a strong pipeline and since we achieved 
PLC status we are seeing an increase in the number of projects 
we are currently working on. This has resulted in the Group 
already securing orders for the current financial year equal to 43% 
of our revenue forecast and having a potential pipeline of projects 
worth £120m over the next 18 months. 
I am conscious of the fact that this growth will require a strong 
foundation of consultancy and to this end we have attracted 
a number of high calibre consultants from competitor businesses 
since flotation to grow the business and attract new customers. 
Additionally, we also recognise the qualities of our existing teams 
and have put a number of initiatives in place to fast track younger 
members of the Group who have responded favourably to the 
opportunities arising through the growth of the business. 
Our solutions quite often demonstrate such clear, visible and 
quick payback periods. These facts mean that we are well 
placed to pursue our continued expansion into new undeveloped 
territories and into product markets with untapped distribution 
requirements. Our strategies for growth are in place and we look 
forward to delivering this growth in the future.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007 11
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES CONTINUED
ECONOmIC DOwNTURN
As the Group’s business is closely correlated to the retail industry, the Group’s revenue is linked to consumer spending patterns. 
An erosion of consumer confidence or a significant decline in consumer spending, particularly in key markets such as the UK and 
the US where the Group has substantial business operations, would directly impact on demand for the Group’s materials handling 
solutions and its overall business and operating results.
fOREIGN Ex ChANGE CURRENCy RISK
Exchange rates of the relevant local currencies in the countries that the Group operates against Sterling are an important factor as the 
Group will report its Group results in Sterling. The Group’s financial results could, therefore, be adversely affected by significant appreciation 
of Sterling against the relevant currencies. This would distort the operating results of the subsidiaries of the Group based outside the UK.
DEPENDENCE ON KEy ExECUTIvES AND PERSONNEL
The Group’s future success depends on the ability of management and key staff to operate effectively, both individually and 
as a group. The loss of any member of the Group’s senior management could disrupt the business if no immediate suitable replacement 
is available to the Group and management time is spent on finding replacement candidates. The loss of key individuals could, therefore, 
have a material adverse effect on the stability of the Group’s business and the future of the Group going forward. While the Group has 
entered into service agreements with each of its Executive Directors, the retention of their services cannot be guaranteed.
COmPETITION
The Company operates in a competitive market and it can be expected that the competition will continue and possibly increase in the 
future both from established competitors and new entrants to the market. The Group’s competitors may include companies with greater 
financial and other resources than the Company and could compete with the Group for clients and industry personnel. In order to be 
successful in the future the Group will need to continue to respond promptly and effectively to the challenges of changing customer 
requirements. An inability to devote sufficient resources to the development of its products and services in order to achieve this, the 
development of more aggressive competition in the market in which the Group operates and/or the introduction of new entrants into 
those markets, could lead to a material and adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and operating results. 
CREDITOR PAymENT POLICy
The Group seeks to maintain good relations with all its trading partners. In particular, it is the Group’s policy to abide by the terms 
of payment agreed with each of its suppliers. The Group’s average creditor payment period at 30 November 2007 was 63 (2006: 70) 
days and for the Company was nil (2006: nil) days.
fINANCIAL RISK mANAGEmENT
This is discussed in note 2 (S) to the financial statements.

CORPORATE GOvERNANCE
 
The Company’s shares were admitted to trading on the Alternative Investment Market (‘AIM’) of the London Stock Exchange on 2 July 2007. 
The Group is therefore subject to the AIM Admission Rules of the London Stock Exchange and is consequently not required to comply with 
the best practice Corporate Governance provisions contained within the Combined Code appended to the Listing Rules of the Financial 
Services Authority. h owever, the directors have considered the provisions of the 2006 Financial Reporting Council Combined Code and 
summarise below how the principles have been applied in the Group, and the extent of current compliance.
PRINCIPLES Of GOOD GOvERNANCE AND CODE Of BEST PRACTICE (‘ThE COmBINED CODE’)
The directors have based their approach to Corporate Governance on those principles of the Combined Code they believe to be appropriate 
to the Group. The following summary includes details of the Combined Code provisions the Group has complied with and those areas where 
compliance is not deemed appropriate.
ThE B OARD
SDI Group plc is led by an experienced Board. Three out of the current six directors are non-executives, two of whom are independent, 
strengthening the independent representation on the Board. The two independent non-executives own shares in SDI Group plc, 
but in view of the size of their holdings the Board has concluded that this does not preclude them from being independent as defined 
under the Code. The Chairman is one of the non-executive directors and there is a clear division of responsibility between the Chairman 
and the Chief Executive. Under the Company’s Articles of Association, at least one-third of the Board is subject to retirement and 
re-election each year. The Board retains full and effective control of the Group. This includes responsibility for determining the Group’s 
strategy and for approving short and medium term plans for achieving this strategy. All major and other strategic decisions are 
reserved to the Board which also has responsibility for Corporate Governance matters, approving major items of capital expenditure, 
senior executive remuneration, succession planning for top management and acquisitions and disinvestment. As appropriate, 
the Board has delegated certain responsibilities to Board committees, which operate within clearly defined terms of reference. 
Standing committees of the Board include the Audit Committee, the Nominations Committee and the Remuneration Committee. The Audit 
Committee consists entirely of non-executive directors both of whom have recent financial experience. The Remuneration Committee 
and Nominations Committee comprise a majority of non-executive directors. The Board met four times for regularly scheduled 
meetings during the period to 30 November 2007. The Board has scheduled ten meetings for the year ended 30 November 2008. 
At each regularly scheduled meeting, there is a full financial and business review and discussion, including operating performance 
to date against the annual budget and financial plan previously approved by the Board for that year. Each Board member receives monthly 
operating results, including a comprehensive commentary and analysis. Prior to each Board meeting, directors are sent an agenda and a 
full set of Board papers for each agenda item to be discussed at the meeting. Additional information is provided as appropriate. While the 
Board retains overall responsibility for the control of the Group, daily management is conducted by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer. They meet regularly to review operational decisions, strategic plans and proposals to submit to the Board for approval.
DIRECTORS’ REmUNERATION
The Remuneration Committee, which consists primarily of non-executive directors, is responsible for making recommendations on the 
Group’s framework of executive remuneration, and for determining specific remuneration packages for each executive director. The Board 
as a whole determines the remuneration of non-executive directors. A full report on remuneration policy and details of the remuneration of 
each director can be found in the Remuneration Committee report on pages 15 and 16.
RELATIONS wITh ShAREhOLDERS
The Annual Report contains information on the activities of the Group for the preceding year and is sent to every shareholder on 
the share register. The Interim Report is also sent to every shareholder. Management endeavours to keep shareholders informed 
with regular news releases. All regulatory news releases and reports are available on the Group’s website www.sdigroup.com. 
The Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) is the principal forum for dialogue with shareholders.
INTERNAL CONTROL
The directors are responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and reviewing its effectiveness. There is an ongoing process 
for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risk faced by the Company.

SDI GROUP PLC
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007
CORPORATE GOvERNANCE CONTINUED
INTERNAL CONTROL CONTINUED
This process has been in place for the year under review, and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report. It is regularly reviewed 
by the Board and accords with the Turnbull guidance (2005).
The system of internal control implemented by the Board has been in place for the period since admission and up to the date 
of approval of these reports and financial statements. It is recognised that such a system can provide only reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss and manage rather than eliminate the risks associated with the achievement of business 
objectives. Controls within the Group are designed to provide the Board with reasonable assurance regarding the maintenance of proper 
accounting records, the reliability of financial information and the safeguarding of assets.
The Group has an appropriate organisational structure with clear lines of responsibility. Because of the size of the current trading 
operations and the detailed accounting and operational information available, the directors do not believe the expense of an internal 
audit function is justified.
STATEmENT Of DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The directors are responsible for preparing the Group and Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations. Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors 
have prepared the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘lFRSs’) as adopted by the 
European Union, and the Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). The Group and Company financial statements are required by law to give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to: 
b  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
b  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
b  state that the Group financial statements comply with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, and with regard to the parent company 
financial statements that applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements;
b  prepare the Group and parent company financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Group will continue in business, in which case there should be supporting assumptions or qualifications as necessary.
The directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the Group and parent company financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The maintenance and integrity of the SDl Group plc website is the responsibility of the directors; the work carried out by the auditors does 
not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred 
to the financial statements since they were initially presented on the website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO ThE MEMBERS OF SDI GROUP PLC  
We have audited the Group financial statements of SDI Group plc for the year ended 30 November 2007 which comprise the Group 
income statement, the Group balance sheet, the Group cash flow statement, the Group statement of recognised income and expense 
and the related notes. These Group financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of SDI Group plc for the 298 day period ended 30 November 2007.
RESPECTIvE RESPONSIBILITIES Of DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members 
as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept 
or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save 
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the Group financial statements 
have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given 
in the directors’ report is consistent with the Group financial statements. The information given in the directors’ report includes that specific 
information presented in the Chairman’s statement that is cross referenced from the business review section of the directors’ report. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, 
or if information specified by law regarding directors remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited Group financial statements. 
The other information comprises only the directors’ report, the Chairman’s statement, Chief Executive’s review, report of the Remuneration 
Committee and the Corporate Governance report. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent 
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the Group financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
BASIS Of AUDIT OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the Group financial statements. It also 
includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the Group financial statements, 
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide 
us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Group financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information 
in the Group financial statements.
OPINION
In our opinion:
b  the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the state 
of the Group’s affairs as at 30 November 2007 and of its profit and cash flows for the year then ended;
b the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
b the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the Group financial statements.

NOTES TO ThE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
1 GENERAL INfORmATION
CORPORATE hISTORy
SDI Group plc (‘the Company’) was formed as a limited liability company under the name SDI Group Limited on 5 February 2007. 
It re-registered as a public limited company on 25 June 2007. The Company consults, designs, manufactures, and integrates systems 
to retail, wholesale, fulfilment and e-commerce industries for all aspects of distribution centre materials handling. The Company 
acquired subsidiary undertakings on 2 July 2007 as listed in note 28. The results of the acquired subsidiaries are included in the profit 
and loss from the date of acquisition. The subsidiaries and associated undertakings are listed in note 5 of the Company financial 
statements. The Company, its subsidiaries and its associated undertakings are referred to in this financial information as ‘the Group’.
The Company is domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of its registered office is 3 St Mary’s Court, Main Street, hardwick, 
Cambridge CB23 7QS, UK. 
2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
A) BASIS Of PREPARATION 
The financial statements are prepared in Sterling, rounded to the nearest thousand and are prepared on the historical cost basis as 
modified by the revaluation of financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through the income statement.
The consolidated financial information has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU), IFRIC interpretations and those sections of the Companies Act 1985 applicable 
to companies reporting under IFRSs. 
On 2 July 2007, SDI Group plc became the legal parent of SDI Industries Inc. in a share for share exchange. In accordance with 
IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’, this transaction has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition, such that in substance, 
SDI Industries Inc. has acquired SDI Group plc. Accordingly, the comparative information of SDI Industries Inc. has been presented 
for the year ended 30 November 2006.
B) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTImATES AND jUDGEmENTS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, 
the results of which form a basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from 
other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on a regular basis. 
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in 
the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Judgements made by management in the application of IFRSs that have significant effect on the financial statements largely related 
to the estimates used in estimating the percentage completion of construction contracts, income taxes and goodwill impairment.
i) Revenue recognition
The Group uses the percentage of completion method in accounting for its fixed price contracts to deliver engineering services. Use of the 
percentage of completion method requires the Group to estimate the services performed to date as a portion of the total services to be 
performed. Were the proportion of services performed to total services to be performed to differ by 10% from management’s estimates, the 
amount of revenue recognised in the year would be increased by £1,950,000 (2006: £1,456,000) if the proportion performed were increased, 
or would be decreased by £1,950,000 (2006: £1,456,000) if the proportion performed were decreased.
ii) Income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for 
income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary 
course of business. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will 
be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts initially recorded, such differences will impact the 
income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such a determination is made. 
iii) Estimated impairment of goodwill
The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 2(F)(I). 
The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations require 
the use of estimates as stated in note 12.

2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
B) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTImATES AND jUDGEmENTS CONTINUED
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in this consolidated financial information.
C) BASIS Of CONSOLIDATION 
Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Group. Control exists where the Group has the power to govern 
the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The purchase method of accounting is used 
to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, 
equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. 
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair 
values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value 
of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets of the subsidiary acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less 
than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
For acquisitions under common control, the predecessor method of accounting is used whereby the cost of acquisition is measured 
at the book value of the net assets acquired plus the costs directly attributable to the acquisition. The excess of the cost of acquisition 
over the Group’s share of the book value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired is recorded as a reduction to reserves.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated. Unrealised 
losses are also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the assets transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have 
been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
The Group treats transactions with minority interests as transactions with parties external to the Group.
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding 
of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
and are initially recognised at cost.
The Group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition 
movements in reserves is recognised in reserves. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the 
investment. When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured 
receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the 
associates. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. 
Accounting policies of associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
D) fOREIGN CURRENCIES 
The functional currency of each Group entity is the currency of the primary economic environment in which each entity operates. 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling. 
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies other than an entity’s functional currency are translated at the foreign exchange rate prevailing 
at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the exchange 
rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
The results and financial position of all associated entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have 
a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
b  the Group’s share of net assets, including goodwill in associates, is translated at the closing rate of exchange at the date of that 
balance sheet;
b the Group’s share of profits and losses are translated at average exchange rates; and
b all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.

2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
E) PROPERTy , PLANT AND EqUIPmENT 
i) Owned assets
Improvements to leasehold property and plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses 
(see accounting policy on impairment).
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, 
plant and equipment.
ii) Leased assets for own use
Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. 
iii) Depreciation
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis at rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation less estimated residual value of each 
asset over its expected useful life as follows:
Improvements to leasehold property    over the period of the lease 
Plant and other equipment    three to ten years 
Demonstration assets    three years
No depreciation is charged on assets in the course of construction.
The residual value and the useful economic life of the assets are reassessed annually.
f) INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
i) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired 
subsidiary/associate at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in ‘Intangible assets’. Separately recognised 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are not 
reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to an entity sold. 
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash-generating 
units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. 
SDI Group plc allocates goodwill to each country in which it operates.
ii) Backlog and sales pipeline
Acquired backlog and sales pipelines for business combinations are capitalised at the present value of the future profits receivable 
adjusted for deferred taxation. Amortisation is calculated over the life of the contracts on which the goodwill is calculated (0–2 years).
iii) Computer software and licences.
Amortisation is provided on a straight-line basis at rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation less estimated residual value of the 
asset over their expected useful lives as follows:
Computer software     three to five years 
Licenses      three to five years
iv) Research and development 
Research expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred. Costs incurred on development projects (relating to the design and 
testing of new or improved products) are recognised as intangible assets when the following criteria are fulfilled:
b it is technically feasible to complete the intangible asset so that it will be available for use; 
b management intends to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it; 
b there is an ability to use or sell the intangible asset; 
b it can be demonstrated how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits; 
b adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset are available; and  
b the expenditure attributable to the intangible assets during its development can be readily measured.

2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
f) INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED
iv) Research & development continued
Amortisation is charged as follows:
Development assets   three years
G) INvENTORIES 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is calculated using the first-in-first-out principle. In the case 
of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating activity. 
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
h) CASh AND CASh EqUIv ALENTS 
Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and deposits. The Group considers all highly-liquid investments with original 
maturity dates of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
I) ImPAIRmENT 
Assets subject to amortisation and depreciation are reviewed for impairment at each balance sheet date to determine whether there 
is any indication of impairment. If such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is calculated as the greater of their net selling 
price and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate 
largely independent cash flows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable 
amount. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to cash-generating unit (or group of units) and then, to reduce the carrying amount of other assets in the unit (or group of units) 
on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of a receivable carried at amortised cost is reversed if the subsequent increase in recoverable amount 
can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
In respect of other assets an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would 
have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
j) ShARE CAPITAL 
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any 
directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes) is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until 
the shares are cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any 
directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company’s 
equity holders.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
K) DIvIDENDS 
Final dividends on ordinary shares are recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends 
are approved by the Group’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recorded when paid.
L) EmPLOyEE BENEfITS 
i) Defined contribution plans
For defined contribution pension schemes operated by the Group, amounts payable are charged to the income statement as they fall 
due. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all 
employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.

2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
L) EmPLOyEE BENEfITS CONTINUED
ii) Share-based compensation
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense. The total amount 
to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted. 
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital when the options are exercised. 
The share option plans are equity settled.
m) TRADE RECEIvABLES AND TRADE PAyABLES 
Trade receivables are stated at cost less any impairment. An impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence 
that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. The carrying amount of the asset 
is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement within ‘Administrative 
Expenses.’ When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries 
of amounts previously written off are credited against ‘Administrative Expenses’ in the income statement. T rade payables are stated at cost.
N) fINANCIAL ASSETS 
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: loans and receivables and available-for-sale. The classification 
depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets 
at initial recognition. 
i) Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other 
categories. They are included in non-current unless management intends to dispose of this investment within twelve months of the 
balance sheet date.
Available-for-sale financial assets in unlisted securities are initially recorded at cost and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis.
ii) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than twelve months after the balance sheet date. These are classified 
as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are classified as trade and other receivables in the balance sheet (note 2 (M)). 
O) REvENUE 
Revenue from consulting, design, manufacture and installation of systems and other engineering services is accounted for on 
a ‘percentage of completion method’ to determine the appropriate amount to recognise in a given period. The stage of completion 
is measured by reference to the contract costs incurred up to the balance sheet date as a percentage of total estimated costs for each 
contract. Costs incurred in the year in connection with future activity on a contract are excluded from contract costs in determining the 
stage of completion. They are presented as inventories, prepayments or other assets, depending on their nature.
The Group presents as an asset the gross amount due from customers for contract work for all contracts in progress for which costs 
incurred plus recognised profits (less recognised losses) exceed progress billings. Progress billings not yet paid by customers and 
retention are included within ‘trade and other receivables’.
The Group presents as a liability the gross amount due to customers for contract work for all contracts in progress for which progress 
billings exceed costs incurred plus recognised profits (less recognised losses).
When the outcome of a contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised only to the extent of contract costs 
incurred that are likely to be recoverable.
When the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably and it is probable that the contract will be profitable, contract 
revenue is recognised over the period of the contract. When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, 
the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Revenue from maintenance contracts is recognised in the period the services are provided using a straight-line basis over the term 
of the contract.

2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
P) ExPENSES 
i) Lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Minimum lease payments on assets held under finance leases are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the 
outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate 
of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
ii) Net financing costs
Net financing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings, interest receivable on cash and cash equivalents and foreign exchange 
gains and losses.
Interest income and expense is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
q) T Ax ATION 
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. It is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items 
recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The amount of deferred tax provided 
is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted 
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset 
can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
R) SEGmENT REPORTING 
A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged in providing products or services (business segment), or in 
providing products or services within a particular economic environment (geographical segment), which is subject to risks and rewards 
that are different from those of other segments.
S) fINANCIAL RISK mANAGEmENT 
The overall aim of the Group financial risk management policies is to minimise potential adverse effects on financial performance and net 
assets. In the course of its business, the Group is exposed primarily to foreign exchange risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. Interest rate risk is 
not considered significant, as the Group does not have any liabilities that accrue interest and interest income on bank deposits is not material.
The Group manages the principal financial risks within policies and operating parameters approved by the Board of directors. 
The Group does not enter into speculative transactions.
i) f oreign currency risk
The Group operates domestically and overseas and also has investments in overseas entities. The Group does not currently hedge its 
cash flows or investments in overseas entities as the directors do not believe this to be appropriate given the low materiality of the items 
involved, but this is continually under review and may change depending on the Group’s currency exposure and economic conditions.
ii) Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy on liquidity risk is to ensure that sufficient cash is available to fund on-going operations without the need to carry 
significant net debt. Where appropriate financing can be negotiated, assets may be purchased under finance lease arrangements. 
The extent of this financing is not considered material. 
iii) Credit risk
Credit risk arises on financial instruments such as trade receivables. Policies and procedures exist to ensure that customers have an appropriate 
credit history, and appropriate billing schedules for long-term contract work are agreed in order to mitigate the risks on this business activity. 
Overall, the Group considers that it is not exposed to a significant amount of credit risk.

T) ExCEPTIONAL ITEmS 
Exceptional items are events or transactions that fall within the activities of the Group and which by virtue of their size or incidence have 
been disclosed in order to improve a reader’s understanding of the financial statements.
U) fORThCOmING ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
Recent amendments to accounting standards and interpretations effective for the purposes of this financial information but not relevant 
to the activities of the Group are as follows:
b IAS 19 (Amendment), Employee benefits;
b IAS 21 (Amendment), Net investment in a foreign operation;
b IAS 39 (Amendment), Cash flow hedge accounting of forecast intragroup transactions;
b IAS 39 (Amendment), The fair value option;
b IAS 39 and IFRS 4 (Amendment), Financial guarantee contracts;
b  IFRS 1 (Amendment), First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards and IFRS 6 (Amendment), Exploration 
for and evaluation of mineral resources;
b IFRS 6, Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources;
b IFRIC 4, Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease;
b IFRIC 5, Rights to interests arising from decommissioning, restoration and environmental rehabilitation funds; 
b IFRIC 6, Liabilities arising from participating in a specific market – waste electrical and electronic equipment;
b IFRIC 7, Applying the restatement approach under IAS 29;
b IFRIC 8, Scope of IFRS 2; and
b IFRIC 9, Reassessment of embedded derivatives.
A number of forthcoming standards and interpretations will be effective for years commencing after 1 December 2007:
Accounting standards which are not yet mandatory and not early adopted:
b  IFRS 7, ‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’, and the complementary amendment to IAS 1, ‘Presentation of financial statements – 
Capital disclosures’ will be mandatory for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007. This standard replaces IAS 30 and the 
disclosure requirements in IAS 32 and locates in one place all disclosures relating to financial instruments. The new requirements 
incorporate many of IAS 32’s disclosures as well as additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures on the risks arising from 
financial instruments. As this standard affects disclosure rather than measurement, the directors expect that the adoption of the 
standard will have no material effect on the financial results or position of the Group. 
b  IFRS 8, ‘Operating segments’ (effective 1 January 2009). IFRS 8 replaces IAS 14 and aligns segment reporting with the requirements of the 
US standard SFAS131, ‘Disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information’. The new standard requires a ‘management 
approach’, under which segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes. The Group 
will apply IFRS 8 from 1 December 2010. The expected impact is still being assessed in detail by management, but no significant 
changes are expected.
b  IFRIC 11, ‘IFRS 2 – Group and treasury share transactions’, (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 March 2007) clarifies how 
share-based payment charges should be calculated where employees of a subsidiary receive the shares of a parent. IFRIC 11 
also addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions involving two or more entities within one group. The directors 
expect the adoption of this interpretation to have no material impact on the financial statements.

3 SEGmENTAL INfORmATION
Segment information is presented in respect of the Group’s geographical and business segments. The primary format, geographical 
segments, is based on the geographical location of the assets generating the revenue.
GEOGRAPhICAL SEGmENTS
The business operates in three main geographical areas being North America (USA and Canada), South America (Chile) and 
Europe (United Kingdom, holland, Germany, Italy, France and Spain).
BUSINESS SEGmENTS
The Group operates in only one business segment. The Group’s equity associates operate in the same business as the Group, and 
therefore the Group’s share of the net assets and net profit of associates is considered to be part of this single business segment. 
Purchases of goods and services are negotiated between segments on a cost-plus basis.

The decrease in the effective tax rate is due to the change in the mix of country tax rates. The 2006 comparatives are based 
on SDI Industries Inc. due to the reverse acquisition accounting. In 2007 the Group is UK based and has a number of European 
subsidiaries, most of which have an equal or lower tax rate than the 2006 average.

(A) BASIC

number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.

Basic earnings per share in £      0.04 0.02
(B) DILUTED
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume 
conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Company has one dilutive potential ordinary share; share options. A calculation 
is done to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value based on the monetary value of the subscription 
rights attached to outstanding options. The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would 
have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options. As the average share price in 2007 is less than the option price there is 
no dilutive effect.

Amortisation of the development costs will commence once the project is completed.
The goodwill has been provisionally allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units (CGUs) according to geographical segment. Further 
allocation within the European segment could not be completed at this time due to the cross ownership of the subsidiaries in that segment. 
In accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’, this allocation will be completed by the end of the next fiscal period. The goodwill was 
acquired on 2 July 2007 as disclosed in notes 22 and 28. The calculations for the value in use for the provisional allocation is based on 
a discounted cash flow over a five year period at a discount rate of 8% which is considered to be the Group’s expected cost of borrowing. 
The key assumption in the value in use calculation is the estimated growth which is in line with management’s expectations for the Group.
Segment level goodwill is £1,808,000 (2006: £nil) in South America and £12,785,000 (2006: £nil) in Europe.
The directors have concluded that there has been no impairment loss against goodwill for the year ended 30 November 2007.

The result of the Group’s associates, all of which are unlisted and draw up local financial statements to 31 December (SDI Logistica) 
or 30 November (AISL do Brasil) and their assets/including goodwill and liabilities are set out in the following table. The revenues 
and profit/(loss) included in the tables below for SDI Logistica and AISL do Brasil are from the dates of acquisition, 1 December 2007

not have been materially different had the associate prepared accounts to 30 November.
AISL do Brasil & SDI Logistica are not material to the Group and are accounted for as associates. 
During the year the Group acquired the entire shareholding in the former associates MSM Automations Gmbh , SDI Promech Bv 
and SDIGreenstone Ltd as disclosed in note 28. The amounts presented in the following table are therefore the balance sheet values 
on 2 July 2007 and revenues and profits from 1 December 2007 to 2 July 2007. In the prior year the Group’s associates, all of which 
were unlisted, drew up local statutory financial statements to 31 December (MSM-Automations Gmbh & Co. KG and SDI Promech B v) 
or 31 March (SDIGreenstone Limited). The directors were of the opinion that the results for MSM Automations GMBh and Co. KG 
and SDI Promech Bv and net assets of the Group would not have been materially different had the associates prepared accounts 
to 30 November. SDIGreenstone Limited’s results were prorated to include the appropriate proportion of profit for the year ended 
30 November.

Options outstanding in 2006 relate to SDI Industries Inc. Options exercised in 2006 resulted in 253,000 SDI Industries Inc. shares issued 
at 0.06p each. 
The 100,000 share options in SDI Industries Inc. were granted on 1 February 2006 and were exercised on 1 October 2006. The fair 
value of the options granted in 2006 was £338,000. The fair value of the options was determined using the Black-Scholes valuation 
model. The significant inputs of the model were share price of £3.46 at grant date, exercise price of £0.06, volatility of 0.3770, expected 
option life of one year and annual risk free rate of 5%. The volatility was estimated based on the average volatility of listed companies 
in the same sector as the Group.
There were no options exercised in 2007 (2006: 253,000 shares being issued at 0.06p each). No options were exercisable at 
30 November 2007.

(i)  The expected volatility is estimated based on the volatility of the share price since listing bench marked against the volatility of competitors in the same market.  
The history of SDI Group was felt to be unrepresentative because it was a short period so a rate of 15% was used. The expected life is considered to be equal 
to the vesting period. The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the expected option life.
*  These options are subject to the rules of the Share Option Plan and the requirements noted below, each of these options were exercisable on the attainment 
of a specified earnings per share target for the preceding year. 
Options are not exercisable later than midnight on the day before the tenth anniversary of the date of grant. No options have been 
granted to or exercised by directors between the balance sheet date and the date of approval of the financial statements. Options were 
granted at no cost to the directors. At 30 November 2007 the market price of the Company’s shares was 50p and the range during the 
year was 49p to 60p.
The total fair value of the share options is £186,000 which is recognised as an expense over the vesting period. At 30 November 2007, 
£28,000 has been recognised as an expense.

As described in note 28, in accordance with IFRS 3, ‘Business Combinations’, the comparative information for the year ended 
30 November 2006 is that of SDI Industries Inc. The current year results show the full year results for SDI Industries Inc. (which includes 
SARL SDI Industries France and SDI Italia Srl as they were subsidiaries for the full 2006 and 2007 periods) with mid-year acquisitions 
of SDIGreenstone Limited, SDI Promech Bv, MSM-Automations Gmbh & Co. KG, Real Time Integrations Inc., SDIGreenstone Iberia S.L. and

NOTES TO ThE COMPANy FINANCIAL INFORMATION
1 GENERAL INfORmATION
SDI Group plc (‘the Company’) was formed as a limited liability company under the name SDI Group Limited on 5 February 2007. 
It re-registered as a public limited company on 25 June 2007. The Company is a holding company for a group of companies that 
consult, design, manufacture, and integrate systems to retail, wholesale, fulfilment and e-commerce industries for all aspects 
of distribution centre materials handling.
The Company is domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of its registered office is 3 St Mary’s Court, Main Street, hardwick, 
Cambridgeshire CB23 7QS, UK. 
2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
A) BASIS Of PREPARATION 
The Company financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable 
accounting standards in the United Kingdom and the Companies Act 1985. 
A summary of the more important accounting policies, which have been reviewed by the Board of directors in accordance with 
Financial Reporting Standards (‘FRS) 18 ‘Accounting policies’ and have been applied consistently, is set out below.
B) fIxED ASSETS
i) Owned assets
Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses (see accounting policy on impairment).
Where parts of an item of fixed assets have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of fixed assets.
ii) Depreciation
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis at rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation less estimated residual value 
of each asset over its expected useful life as follows:
Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment – three years
The residual value, if not insignificant, and the useful economic life of the assets are reassessed annually.
C) INvESTmENTS
Investments are stated at cost less any amount provided for to reflect a permanent diminution in value.
D) ImPAIRmENT
The need for any fixed asset impairment write down is assessed by comparison of the carrying value of the asset against the higher 
of realisable value and value in use.
E) TAx ATION
Provision is made for deferred tax liabilities and assets, using full provision accounting, otherwise known as the incremental liability 
method, when an event has taken place by the balance sheet date which gives rise to an increased or reduced tax liability in the future 
in accordance with FRS 19. Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the 
timing differences are expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance 
sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
f) ShARE BASED PA ymENT
The fair value of employee share plans is calculated using a Black-Scholes model. In accordance with FRS 20 ‘Share-based payment’ 
the resulting cost is charged to the income statement over the vesting periods of the plans. The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect 
the expected and actual levels of options vesting.
G) fOREIGN CURRENCy TRANSLATION
Assets and liabilities are translated into Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Foreign currency trading 
transactions are translated at the rate ruling at the time of the transaction. All foreign currency exchange differences are dealt with 
in the profit and loss account for the period.

2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
h) fINANCIAL INSTRUmENTS
The Company does not have any financial instruments other than debtors, creditors and cash. Due to the short term nature of these 
balances, the Company considers the fair value of these items equal to the carrying value.
I) OPERATING LEASES
Rental payments under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis. Benefits received as an incentive 
to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
j) RELATED PARTy TRANSACTIONS
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available to parent companies under FRS 8 ‘Related Party Disclosures’, whereby 
transactions between Group entities that have been eliminated on consolidation are not required to be disclosed.

NOTES:
1.  Copies of the service contracts and letters of appointment of each of the directors will be available for inspection at the registered office of the 
Company during usual business hours on any weekday (Saturdays and public holidays excluded) and at the place of the Annual General Meeting 
from at least 15 minutes prior to and until the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting.
2.  The total number of ordinary shares of 1p in issue as at 26 March 2007, the last practicable day before printing this document was 106,100,001 
ordinary shares and the total level of voting rights was 106,100,001, none of which were attached to shares held in treasury by the Company.
3.  In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the meeting, arrangements will be put in place at the meeting so that (i) if a corporate 
shareholder has appointed the Chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative with instructions to vote on a poll in accordance with the 
directions of all of the other corporate representatives for that shareholder at the meeting, then on a poll those corporate representatives will give 
voting directions to the Chairman and the Chairman will vote (or withhold a vote) as corporate representative in accordance with those directions; 
and (ii) if more than one corporate representative for the same corporate shareholder attends the meeting but the corporate shareholder has 
not appointed the Chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative, a designated corporate representative will be nominated, from those 
corporate representatives who attend, who will vote on a poll and the other corporate representatives will give voting directions to that designated 
corporate representative. Corporate shareholders are referred to the guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators 
on proxies and corporate representatives – www.icsa.org.uk – for further details of this procedure. The guidance includes a sample form 
of representation letter if the Chairman is being appointed as described in (i) above. A letter in this form would be acceptable to the Company 
and its Registrars.

Company Overview 
Omega Diagnostics currently operates  
in the fields of Allergy and Autoimmune,  
Food Intolerance and Infectious Disease.  
The acquisition of the IVD allergy  
business combined with the follow on 
instrumentation strategy will substantially  
increase the scale of the Group.
Food Intolerance
Specialising in the research, 
development and production  
of kits to aid the detection  
of immune reactions to food.
What does this cover?
Certain Food Intolerances are caused by an immune 
response associated with a food protein. Detection  
of these IgG antibodies can be helpful in managing  
Food Intolerance and associated symptoms. The Group’s 
products detect IgG antibodies to food proteins, which 
are characteristic of disease states such as Celiac 
Disease and Crohn’s Disease. 
Product information
Tests patients for reactions to different foods. Provides 
clinical analysis to the general public, clinics and health 
professionals as well as supply of consumer facing  
Food Detective
®
 kit.
What does this cover?
Allergy testing involves initial screening to detect the 
presence of IgE antibodies followed by testing against 
allergen groups to narrow down the cause of the allergic 
reaction. Confirmation is then obtained by carrying out  
a more detailed test against a small number of specific 
allergens to identify specific causes. Autoimmune 
diseases are caused by the body’s immune system 
attacking healthy cells, organs, or tissues in the body.  
The Group’s products detect antibodies produced by the 
patient in response to various disease states including 
microarterial diseases, connective tissue diseases,  
liver disease, rheumatoid arthritis and thyroid disease.
Product information
Supply of test kits that can test for reactions against  
more than 600 allergens as well as test kits for various 
autoimmune diseases.
Allergy and  
Autoimmune testing
Specialising in the research, 
development, production and 
marketing of in-vitro allergy  
and autoimmune tests used  
by doctors to diagnose  
patients with allergies or 
autoimmune diseases.
What does this cover?
The Group’s products detect either the infectious  
disease agents, such as bacteria or viruses (antigens)  
or antibodies produced in response to the infection.  
The main Infectious Disease detected using the  
Group’s products is Syphilis.
Product information
Supply of test kits to test for various Infectious Diseases 
including Tuberculosis, Typhoid, Dengue Fever, Chagas

Allergopharma
On 21 December 2010 the Group acquired  
the in-vitro allergy business and certain assets 
from Allergopharma Joachim Ganzer KG.
The business specialises in the research, 
development, production and marketing  
of in-vitro allergy tests used by doctors to 
diagnose patients with allergies. The business 
supplies test kits that can test for reactions 
against more than 600 allergens. 
The product range uses ELISA technology to 
test the serum of allergic patients. The product 
range comprises test kits and allergen discs as 
well as Allergodip, a Point of Care assay used 
to diagnose type 1 allergies such as allergic 
asthma, eczma and gastrointestinal allergies. 
The production facility is based in Reinbek, 
Hamburg, Germany.
The acquisition of the IVD business is intended 
to increase value for Shareholders through  
a two stage three-part strategy:

Vision
As part of the strategy to build a global allergy 
business, the Group has been successful in 
exclusively licensing the use of Immunodiagnostic 
Systems IDS-iSYS automated system for allergy 
testing on a global basis, thus having the potential  
to offer an instrument capable of meeting the 
workflow needs of larger laboratories.
The Group will also adapt its in-house microarray system to provide a broad  
screening option for allergy testing, providing a choice of diagnostic approaches  
to allergy specialists and also aims to use the platform to develop a panel  
of autoimmune tests.

The Directors believe that there is an 
opportunity to enter the global allergy testing 
market which is currently dominated by one 
large multinational company. The Directors’ 
preferred approach, rather than incurring 
large development costs, with long timelines 
to market launch of a new instrument, is to 
licence the IDS-iSYS instrument. 
This is a proven instrument already 
established in immunoassay testing for 
multiple applications, which the Directors 
believe, after discussions with IDS technicians, 
requires only minor modifications to produce 
a competitive working system for allergy 
testing that will be able to process a higher 
volume of tests and thereby increase 
revenues for the Group. 
Product feature 1
The flexible IDS-iSYS system 
will bring efficiency benefits 
to the laboratory stemming 
from automated processing 
of the allergy testing 
work-load.
Product feature 2
All assay steps will be 
carried out on-board the 
instrument, eliminating  
the need for manual 
interventions. Bar-coding 
and other automation 
features will reduce the 
potential for error.
Product feature 3
An extensive test menu of 
600+ allergens is envisaged.
Case study:
IDS-iSYS
Assay development time will be extensive  
due to the large number of individual allergy 
tests required on the test menu and this 
requires development funding which was 
secured as part of the successful placing  
in December 2010.
The agreement to licence the IDS-iSYS 
instrument was signed on 25 March 2011  
and, combined with access to the large 
number of allergens through the IVD  
business, provides a major opportunity  
to build a strategically coherent presence  
in the expanding allergy market.
The flexible IDS-iSYS system will bring  
efficiency benefits to the laboratory.

Chairman’s Statement 
The potential for the Group has been transformed  
with the successful acquisition of a leading  
German-based allergy business.
The current instrument  
systems are used in  
laboratories in Germany  
and there is export  
potential through the  
Omega worldwide  
distribution network.
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to report the progress  
we have made this year, particularly  
in driving the continued growth of Food 
Intolerance products, along with the 
successful fundraising and acquisition  
of Allergopharma’s IVD Allergy business.
Strategy
The strategy to achieve growth through 
acquisition took a major step forward in the 
year, with the completion of the acquisition  
of Allergopharma’s allergy business in 
December. As well as gaining control of the 
existing business in Germany with annual 
revenues of approximately €4m, we have also 
gained access to a large bank of over 600 
allergens. As part of the strategy to build a 
global allergy business, we sought to expand 
the market potential by identifying the need  
to offer an automated instrument for such  
a large product range to meet the workflow 
needs of larger laboratories. To this end, the 
Group was successful in exclusively licensing 
the use of Immunodiagnostic Systems’ 
IDS-iSYS automated system for allergy testing 
on a global basis. Whilst it will take time to 
develop tests on this platform, I believe the 
combination of a large number of allergens 
and the proven capabilities of the IDS-iSYS 
system provides a major opportunity to build 
a strategically coherent presence in the 
expanding allergy market. We also aim to 
adapt our in-house microarray system to 
provide a broad screening option for allergy 
providing a choice of diagnostic approaches 
to allergy specialists and if successful, we  
will also look to use the microarray platform  
to develop a panel of autoimmune tests.
Within our underlying business, we have 
previously recognised the need for continued 
growth of the Food Intolerance business  
and I am pleased to report that this division 
has again delivered growth in turnover.  
Sales of Genarrayt
®
 systems and reagents 
have continued to perform with combined 
revenues of close to £1.7m compared to just 
over £1m last year. Elsewhere, our Infectious 
Disease business benefited from a full year  
of ownership of Co-Tek with sales of bacterial 
suspensions of £349k versus £176k the  
year before.
After the year end, we also announced a 
distribution agreement with Toyota for Food 
Detective
®
 in the United States. Whilst it will 
take some time to complete the regulatory 
procedures, this will also be the first time the 
Group has been able to initiate a strategy  
of potentially building a presence in the US.
Financial
Turnover for the Group increased to £7.9 
million (2010: £6.2 million), an increase of 27% 
over last year, and includes three months of 
post acquisition trading from our German 
business. On a like-for-like basis excluding 
the acquisition, turnover has increased by 
12% over the previous year. On the measure  Annual Report and Accounts 201 1

Overview

of profit, we consistently report on adjusted  
profit before tax so shareholders can more 
easily gauge our performance as compared 
to external market forecasts. The Group 
achieved an increase in adjusted profit before 
tax of 25% to £736k. This figure is arrived at 
by taking statutory profit before tax of £105k 
and then adding back analyst-adjusted items 
including IFRS-related discount charges of 
£22k, amortisation of intangible assets of 
£193k, share-based payment charges of £8k, 
acquisition costs of £412k, and fair value 
adjustments to financial derivatives of (£4k).  
In line with revised accounting standards, 
acquisition-related costs are now charged 
through the income statement which is a 
change over previous years. 
Net finance costs have reduced further to £31k 
(2010: £97k) as the Company has continued  
to benefit from the benign environment for 
interest rates along with a continued reduction 
in loan balances and unwinding of discounts. 
The Group achieved an adjusted profit after 
tax of £662k being adjusted profit before tax  
of £736k less the tax charge of £74k. This 
resulted in adjusted earnings per share of  
1.7p (2010: 3.1p). Statutory profit after tax 
amounted to £31k (2010: £187k) which resulted 
in earnings per share of 0.1p versus earnings 
per share of 1.0p in the previous year. 
In recognition of our presence in the allergy 
market, we are also amending the way we 
manage, review and report the performance  
of the business into three key segments; Food 
Intolerance, Allergy and Autoimmune and 
Infectious Disease/other. Where central costs 
are not allocated to any specific segment, 
these are shown as corporate costs and 
excluded from the divisional reporting results.
Food Intolerance
The Food Intolerance division benefited from 
the continued growth in Genarrayt
®
 systems. 
Total systems placements reached 95 by the 
end of the year and the relatively low cost  
per system means we continue to generate 
revenue from this activity with sales this year 
of £192k (2010: £213k). Reagent sales grew 
substantially, particularly in Spain, and total 
revenues reached £1.5 million compared to 
£0.8 million last year.
Food Detective
®
 volumes grew following 
progress in supplying bulk components into 
China such that annual volumes reached  
over 41,000 compared to over 34,000 the  
year before. Food Detective
®
 revenues fell 
marginally from £790k to £772k reflecting  
the mix towards bulk component supply but 
future growth is foreseen in countries beyond 
Europe which has historically underpinned 
much of the growth to date. 
Overall, the Food Intolerance division 
generated revenues of £3.6 million compared 
to £3.0 million the year before and adjusted 
profit before tax grew to approximately  
£1.0 million from £0.6 million.
Allergy and Autoimmune
In June last year, we set up Omega 
Diagnostics GmbH (‘Omega GmbH’)  
to acquire the allergy business from 
Allergopharma Joachim Ganzer KG,  
a transaction which completed on 21 
December 2010. Omega GmbH incurred 
costs of approximately £90k in advance of 
acquiring the allergy business and incurred 
costs of a one-off nature of £120k between 
the acquisition and the end of the year. 
Divisional turnover was approximately £1.5 
million versus £0.7 million the previous year 
reflecting three months of trading through 
Omega GmbH not present last year. Sales of 
autoimmune products fell by 11% to £584k 
(2010: £658k) reflecting increased competition 
from other companies, who are able to  
supply more automated solutions although 
developing our in-house microarray system 
may, in part, address this issue. Given the 
investment costs within Omega GmbH I have 
referred to, the adjusted profit before tax of 
this division was £37k compared to £157k  
the year before. Excluding these start up 
costs, underlying profitability in this division 
would have been over £200k. However, in  
the years ahead we see this division as having 
the potential to provide significant growth 
opportunity and I have alluded to the means 
of achieving this in the strategy section above.
Infectious Disease/Other
Our Infectious Disease division continues to 
operate in a price competitive environment 
across all the continental regions. Sometimes 
however, the supply of a quality product can 
make the difference and we have seen some 
business regained, particularly in Russia, 
where we lost out previously on price but 
have won back a customer for our Syphilis 
Immutrep™ product on quality and reputation. 
Following the acquisition of Co-Tek in 2009, 
we have also seen some growth both in our 
Micropath™ range of bacterial suspensions, 
particularly in Africa and the Middle East, and 
increased supply through UK OEM contracts. 
Overall, divisional turnover was approximately 
£2.8 million (2010: £2.6 million) and yielded an 
adjusted profit before tax of £406k (2010: £386k).
Balance sheet
Following the acquisition in the year, the 
Group has intangible assets of £9.6 million 
(2010: £5.2 million) at the year-end comprised 
of goodwill of £5.0 million and intangible 
assets of £4.6 million. Those assets purchased 
as part of a business combination, where 
capable of being separately identified, are 
valued in line with current IFRS practice.  
Also included within intangible assets are 
paid and contracted licence fees due under 
the agreement signed with IDS. The Group 
performs annual impairment reviews and 
remains comfortable with the carrying value 
of its intangible assets given the growth  
and results for the year just ended along  
with future prospects.
Further to the placing of new shares in the 
year to raise funds (see below), the Group  
has eliminated its net debt position and now 
has net cash at the year-end of £0.4 million 
(2010: net debt of £1.26 million).
Fund raising
In December, the Company successfully 
raised £7.75 million (before expenses) via the 
placing of 64,583,350 new ordinary shares  
to fund the acquisition of the German allergy 
business and the development of the new 
instrumentation strategy I refer to above (see 
strategy section). We are very grateful for the 
support of our existing and new shareholders 
and hope to deliver a growth in value based 
on our outlined strategy.
Board and employees
I am grateful for the work and effort of all 
employees who ensured we have again 
delivered a promising set of results. I am  
also pleased to report that after the year-end, 
we appointed Jag Grewal as Group Sales  
and Marketing Director. We have also 
strengthened the senior management team 
with the appointment of Mr Ernst Mohler as 
Managing Director of Omega Diagnostics 
GmbH and Dr Edward Valente as Allergy 
Systems Director and I look forward to 
working with Andrew and the expanded  
team to deliver the new potential that now 
exists within the Group.
Outlook
Trading in the first quarter of the year is  
in line with management expectation and  
we are optimistic for the export potential  
of the existing allergy products, having 
recently showcased these at an international 
trade show. Our ability to grow strategically  
in the allergy space is predicated on our 
ability to develop new tests on the IDS-iSYS 
system and the early signs from the 
development programme are cause for 
encouragement.
I look forward to updating you throughout  
the year.

Chief Executive’s Review 
Our latest acquisition of the Allergy IVD business of Allergopharma 
in December 2010 provides us access to the high value allergy 
testing market. We believe that this acquisition, together with 
two high profile instrument development programmes, will  
be transformational for the Group going forward which will 
significantly enhance the Group’s growth prospects.
I am pleased to report that the Group has 
seen an increase in revenue for the year  
to £7.90 million, some 27.4% ahead of last 
year’s figures (2010: £6.20 million) with 
like-for-like sales increasing by 12%. 
Strategy
While increasing revenue and profits through 
organic growth, significant progress was 
made in the year by acquiring the business 
and certain assets of the Allergy IVD business 
of Allergopharma. The allergy tests acquired 
complement the Group’s core Food Intolerance 
product offering. As well as the acquisition,  
it was recognised that to add more value we 
would need to enhance the future product 
offering by developing two new instrument 
systems which would allow us to access higher 
volume testing laboratories. (See Research 
and development).
Food Intolerance
Food Intolerance testing has seen growth  
of 21% in the year resulting in sales of  
£3.56 million (2010: £2.95 million).
For the Genarrayt
®
 laboratory system and 
on-going reagent sales we have seen good 
growth in sales to £1.68 million (2010: £1.04 
million). This growth has been achieved by  
the installation of 38 new systems as well as 
increasing the number of countries active with 
Genarrayt
® 
by six. This now brings the total 
number of installed systems to 95 since launch. 
Sales of Genarrayt
®
 systems fell slightly to 
£192k (2010: £212k) but sales of reagent kits 
increased dramatically to £1.49 million (2010: 
£828k). This shows the pull through effect of 
promoting Food Intolerance testing by placing 
new instruments and promoting test usage in 
partnership with our distributors.
The Food Detective
®
 test for Food Intolerance 
has seen sales fall marginally to £772k (2010: 
£790k). The number of countries where we 
have now sold product has continued to 
increase to 54 (2010: 46) with an increase in 
volumes to 41,665 kits (2010: 34,241). These 
volumes included bulk components supplied 
to a Chinese customer who assembles the 
kits locally with the effect that revenue  
has fallen marginally. The process of product 
registration in China is still proceeding but  
we are still managing to secure small sales  
for market seeding and evaluation purposes. 
Product registration has recently been 
achieved in India for an Indian specific test 
panel and the product was launched in 
February 2011 by our partner in India,  
Thermo Fisher Scientific. 
The UK market for Food Detective
®
 has seen 
a reduction in sales to £127k (2010: £216k) 
following a move to using professional 
re-sellers with lower transfer pricing in return 
for higher volume sales. In response to this 
result we have taken steps to return to  
direct selling ourselves by using web-based 
“ We fully expect that our 
anticipated growth in  
the BRIC countries will  
yield major growth.”

marketing activities and targeted marketing  
to key customer groups. The testing services 
for Food Intolerance and other related tests 
have shown an increase in business to £452k 
(2010: £371k) which has mainly been due  
to increased sales to offshore accounts  
who send samples into the CNS laboratory 
for testing.
After the year end we signed an agreement 
with Toyota Tsusho America Inc for distribution 
of Food Detective
®
 in the United States. There 
is an anticipated timeline of approximately  
one to two years to gain clearance by the US 
Food and Drug Administration (‘FDA’) before 
we can start selling the product but we believe 
the potential market to be substantial.
Allergy/Autoimmune Disease
Allergy
Since acquiring the Allergy range in 
December 2010 sales of £955k have been 
achieved which has been dominated by sales 
to the German domestic market. Export sales 
to Russia and Poland have commenced and  
it is the growth of export sales through the 
Omega distribution network that is a priority 
for the Financial Year ahead.
Autoimmune Disease
Sales of autoimmune tests decreased  
by 11% to £584k (2010: £658k) as a direct 
result of not being able to supply a dedicated 
instrument platform in an increasingly 
automated market. We see further reductions 
in this business likely unless we can offer  
an instrument platform or technology to 
compete in this market. The application  
of the Genarrayt
®
 microarray technology  
to autoimmune disease testing still remains  
a possibility but other options are also being 
explored.
Infectious Disease/Other tests
Sales of Infectious Disease and Other tests 
increased to £2.80 million (2010: £2.59 million) 
for the year representing an increase of 8% 
which reversed the trend over recent years. 
This was in part due to increased sales of the 
Micropath
®
 stained bacterial suspensions 
produced by our Co-Tek subsidiary which  
we acquired in September 2009. Other 
growth came from regaining previously lost 
business and new OEM contract wins with 
our Immutrep
®
 Syphilis product range.
Distribution network
Growth has been recorded in most 
geographic regions of the world with the 
exception of North America which reduced  
by 13% to £267k (2010: £307k) due to lost 
tenders in several markets. The Asia/Far East 
region dropped marginally by 1% to £1.35 
million (2010: £1.36 million). These reductions 
were more than offset by good growth in 
Africa/Middle East with sales rising by 24%  
to £1.47 million (2010: £1.19 million) and  
in the UK/European market by sales rising 
48% to £4.45 million (2010: £3.01 million)  
as a result of the new additional allergy tests 
from our German subsidiary and strong 
performance with key users of the Genarrayt
®
 
Food Intolerance products. Sales to South/
Central America rose by just over 10% to 
£361k (2010: £328k).
In last year’s Report I mentioned the good 
growth rates being experienced in the IVD 
sector in Brazil, India and China. In the year, 
we have made efforts to concentrate on and 
expand our business in the BRIC group of 
countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China)  
and we have achieved some success in three 
out of the four target countries. In Brazil we 
increased sales by 50% across the Group, 
achieving total sales of £220k (2010: £147k),  
in Russia we increased sales by over 500%  
to £89k (2010: £13k) and in China we increased 
sales by 49% to £97k (2010: £65k). Only India 
showed marginal growth at 4% with sales 
rising to £499k (2010: £480k). However,  
with the signing of the Food Detective
®
 
distribution agreement with Thermo Fisher 
Scientific in the latter part of the year, we 
expect this to provide a positive impact in  
the year ahead. Several other initiatives are 
being explored to enhance our growth in 
these key countries.
Research and development
Our move into the allergy testing market now 
drives our R&D activity with the development 
of two new allergy instrument platforms,  
both of which are being funded by the 
Allergopharma acquisition fund-raising.
1. IDS-iSYS – in March 2011 we signed  
an exclusive Licence Agreement with 
Immunodiagnostic Systems Holdings plc 
(IDS) for the worldwide rights to develop 
and distribute allergy tests on its successful 
and US FDA-cleared IDS-iSYS automated 
instrument. IDS will supply the instruments 
and other consumables necessary to 
enable us to develop and distribute allergy 
tests through our worldwide distribution 
network. Although the development will 
take around one year to complete, the early 
signs are encouraging.
2. Genarrayt
®
 – we are aiming to apply  
the expertise used to develop and produce 
the IgG Food Intolerance microarray 
technology to routine IgE allergy testing. 
This requires development and adaptation 
of the existing technology so that it can be 
used on an automated testing instrument 
which will allow the test to be used in 
higher test volume laboratories. Initial 
feasibility studies have proven successful 
but a substantial effort is still required 
before a product and new instrument  
can be launched.
Work was also completed on an Indian variant 
of the Food Detective
®
 macroarray test which 
completed its registration formalities during 
the year and was formally launched in India  
in February 2011.
Outlook
The outlook for the new financial year is very 
encouraging with the addition of the allergy 
test range and with other organic growth 
opportunities being actively pursued. There are 
still difficulties with some Eurozone countries 
but we fully expect that our anticipated growth 
in the BRIC countries will yield major growth 
going forward and counter any negative effects 
experienced elsewhere in the world.
The recent announcement of 19 May 2011  
regarding Cinven’s intended disposal of 
Phadia to Thermo Fisher Scientific on a 6.7x 
multiple of revenue and 16.6x EBITDA only 
goes to show the high valuations possible in 
the world of allergy testing. With our recent 
acquisition and the new development 
programmes which we have commenced in 
this year, it is our ambition to add significant 
value to the Group. Going forward we expect 
to see this reflected in a share price which 
more accurately reflects the true value of  
the Group.

Financial Review 
The successful placing to raise £7.75 million  
has enabled the Group to acquire a presence  
in the highly attractive allergy market.
The Group has reported an increase  
in adjusted profit before tax of 25%, up  
to £735,831 (2010: £589,511). The Group 
reports on adjusted profit before tax 
(excluding IFRS-related items of share-
based payment charges, amortisation  
of intangible assets, discount charges,  
fair value adjustments to financial 
derivatives and acquisition costs) to 
provide a better understanding of the 
results of our normal trading activities 
compared to external research forecasts. 
In the year, the Group set up Omega 
Diagnostics GmbH (‘Omega GmbH’),  
a wholly owned subsidiary, to acquire the 
IVD Allergy Business from Allergopharma 
which completed at the end of December 
2010. The Group results contain the 
results of Omega GmbH, which include 
costs incurred before the acquisition  
of the IVD Allergy Business as well as  
the contribution from three months of  
trading for the period from acquisition  
to 31 March 2011. The Group is also  
now reporting across three main divisions 
comprised of Food Intolerance, Allergy/
Autoimmune and Infectious Disease/Other.
Trading activities
Revenue
Total revenue for the year grew by 27% to 
£7,902,036 (2010: £6,198,742). On a like-for-
like basis excluding the allergy revenue from 
Omega GmbH, sales grew by 12%. On a 
divisional basis, revenues were as follows:
Food Intolerance
Revenue for our Food Intolerance division 
underwent good organic growth of 21%  
to £3,559,110 (2010: £2,953,040). Sales of 
Genarrayt
®
 systems and kits had a strong 
performance, particularly in certain European 
and Middle Eastern countries and the 
provision of consumables to an overseas 
customer to enable them to launch their own 
Foodprint
®
 laboratory service has also met 
with some success.
Allergy and Autoimmune
Revenue from the Allergy and Autoimmune 
division was supplemented by the acquisition 
of the Allergy IVD Business of Allergopharma 
in December 2010. Allergy revenue in the 
three months of trading post acquisition 
amounted to £955,153, the majority of which 
is derived in Germany from sales to end-user 
doctor practices. Sales of Autoimmune 
products decreased in the year by 11% due  
to the activity of competitors able to offer 
more automated instrumentation solutions, 
particularly in Italy and the UK.
Infectious Disease/Other
The Infectious Disease division operates  
in the most price competitive sector of the 
IVD market. Despite this, revenue from this 
division has grown by 8% to £2,803,720 
(2010: £2,587,818). The division benefited  
from a full year of revenue through our Co-Tek 
subsidiary which supplies products for 
bacterial infections. We were also successful 
with our Immutrep
®
 range of Syphilis products 
in Russia, winning back business lost in 
previous years and in Brazil, gains were made 
across a range of products. These increases 
in sales more than offset reductions seen  
in Australia and Iran. 
Gross profit
Gross profit for the year was £4,706,294 
(2010: £3,616,220) yielding a small overall 
improvement in gross margin percentage  
to 59.6% (2010: 58.3%). However, the 
performance in the second half of the year 
has shown a bigger improvement, yielding  
a margin of 61.1% compared to 57.4% in the 
first half of the year. This is primarily down  
to two factors; firstly, the benefits of higher 
margins achievable in the allergy sector and 
secondly, a reflection of twice as many 
Genarrayt
®
 systems being sold in the first half 
compared to the second half and on which 
lower margins are returned. We expect the 
gross margin to continue to increase in the 
future as more of the divisional mix will shift  
to the higher margin allergy business.
Administration costs
Administration costs have increased by 
£1,000,202 to £3,508,810 (2010: £2,508,608). 
The single largest rise is attributable to 
additional costs of £521,102 (2010: £Nil) 
through Omega GmbH which includes 
£74,155 (2010: £Nil) of intangible asset 
amortisation and £32,117 (2010: £Nil) of 
depreciation through this entity itself. Also 
included are acquisition-related costs of 
£412,045 (2010: £Nil) following the adoption  
of IFRS3 Revised which requires such costs 
to be shown through the income statement as 
opposed to the balance sheet as previously.
The remaining net increase of £67,055 may  
be accounted for as follows; intangible asset 
amortisation at Group level (i.e. additional  
to £74,155 above) has increased by £10,002 
reflecting a full year of ownership of Co-Tek. 
Depreciation excluding GmbH has increased 
by £9,251 reflecting the growth in the capital 
asset base. General headcount and 
infrastructure costs have risen by £218,304 in 
line with the increasing size of the Group and 
share-based payment charges have reduced 
by £170,502 which reflects the end of the 
vesting period in the prior year of a large block 
of share options granted in December 2008.
Selling and marketing costs
Selling and marketing costs have increased 
by £268,395 to £1,069,027 which is 
predominantly down to the additional costs 
through Omega GmbH. 
Adjusted profit before tax
As mentioned above, the Group reports 
adjusted profit before tax to provide 
shareholders with the measure of profit for  
a better comparison with external market 
forecasts. The adjusted profit before tax  
for the year increased by 25% to £735,831 
(2010: £589,511). There is a full reconciliation 
on page 28 between adjusted profit before 
tax highlighted here and the statutory profit 
before tax of £105,124 (2010: £210,008).
In line with the new divisional reporting 
structure, the adjusted profit before tax  
of each division is summarised as follows:
Food Intolerance
This division reported adjusted profit of 
£983,285 (2010: £550,053) providing a net 
contribution of 28% (2010: 19%) the growth of 
which is primarily represented by the increase 
in the higher margin Genarrayt
®
 business  
in Spain. This division remains the largest 
segment of the Group at present and continues 
to offer growth, especially in BRIC countries 
as highlighted by Andrew on page 12. Annual Report and Accounts 201 1

Overview
Business  
Review Governance
Financial  
Statements
Allergy and Autoimmune
This division reported adjusted profit of 
£36,604 (2010: £157,058) providing a net 
contribution of 2% (2010: 24%). The apparent 
reduction is accounted for by the setting up  
of Omega GmbH prior to the acquisition of 
the German Allergy Business. Costs of 
£90,420 were incurred prior to the acquisition 
to ensure key people and systems were 
organised and implemented, reflecting the 
‘carve-out’ nature of the transaction and the 
need to ensure the acquired business was 
functionally operational from day one. A large 
element of this cost was the hiring of key 
personnel on an agency basis which provides 
for a quicker appointment but is traditionally 
more expensive than hiring on a permanent 
basis. The higher level of cost continued to be 
incurred up until the year-end but we have 
been fortunate in converting two people into 
permanent positions after the year end which 
will save resources going forward.
Infectious Disease/Other
This division reported adjusted profit  
of £405,874 (2010: £386,102) and a net 
contribution of 14% (2010: 15%). As noted 
above, this sector is the most competitive 
sector in which the Group operates and  
is the most mature by product range. 
Nevertheless, the Group has managed  
to maintain performance and will continue  
to look at niche opportunities.
Corporate costs
Centralised costs which are regarded as not 
relating to any division in particular are treated 
as corporate costs within our segmental 
reporting as highlighted on page 40.
Finance costs
Finance costs reduced further in the year to 
£33,052 (2010: £97,909) principally due to lower 
discount unwinds of £72,990 on the vendor loan 
note and the falling away of Genesis-related 
earn-out payments which were finally settled 
last year. Interest on bank borrowings and 
finance leases reduced by £17,069, reflecting 
the average reduction in borrowing levels and 
net gains on financial derivatives. Currency 
gains on US dollar borrowings reduced by 
£25,202 but still showed a small gain overall  
of £16,776 (2010: £41,978). 
Taxation
There is a tax charge of £73,667 (2010: 
£22,909) in the year, comprising a charge for 
current tax of £125,148 (2010: £33,177) and a 
deferred tax credit of £51,481 (2010: £10,268). 
The apparent rise in the tax charge compared 
to unadjusted profit before tax is due to the 
non-deductibility of acquisition-related  
costs and intangible asset amortisation for 
tax purposes. Prior year adjustments to the 
tax charge arise when there are differences 
between estimated figures chargeable to tax 
and final tax computations.
Earnings per share
Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) amounted 
to 1.7p (2010: 3.1p) and is arrived at by taking 
adjusted PBT of £735,831 minus the tax 
charge of £73,667 and dividing by 38,278,631 
being the weighted average number of shares 
in issue for the year. The IFRS measure of 
EPS amounted to 0.1p in the year (2010: 1.0p).
Acquisitions
Acquisition of IVD Allergy  
Business from Allergopharma
During June 2010, the Group set up Omega 
Diagnostics GmbH as a wholly owned 
subsidiary with the purpose to acquire the 
Allergy Business previously belonging to 
Allergopharma in Reinbek, Germany. The 
transaction completed on 21 December  
2010 following the successful placing of new 
shares to raise funds to meet the acquisition 
price. The Group paid a cash consideration of 
£4.9 million after working capital adjustments 
at completion and related acquisition costs 
amounted to £1.1 million. There is further 
detail in note 8 to the Financial Statements.
Treasury operations
Currency management
The Group conducts its operations in three 
main currencies being sterling, euros and US 
dollars. In the case of transactions in euros  
and US dollars, the Group may be exposed  
to fluctuations in the rates of exchange against 
sterling. Where possible, the Group operates  
a natural hedge by entering into transactions  
of both a buying and selling nature that limits 
the risk of adverse exchange rate losses. The 
Company continues to hold a portion of its 
borrowings in US dollars where this loan can 
be serviced from a net surplus of US dollars 
generated from its trading activities. The 
exchange rate between sterling and the US 
dollar has been relatively stable throughout  
the year such that a translation gain of £16,776 
(2010: £41,978) has been recorded on these 
borrowings offset by a loss on trading 
operations of £22,108 (2010: £28,146) included 
within Administration costs.
The Group’s net investment in and funding  
of Omega GmbH is in euros, which will give rise 
to foreign exchange variations from one period 
to another. In the year, a foreign exchange gain 
arose of £189,009 which has been included 
within other comprehensive income.
Interest rate management
The Group operates certain derivative 
financial instruments for its sterling and US 
dollar borrowings. In the case of its sterling 
loan, the Group has an agreement with Bank 
of Scotland whereby the base rate element  
of the interest charge has been capped at 
5.5% for the entire remaining term. In the  
case of the US dollar loan, the Group has  
two agreements with Bank of Scotland, one 
to cap the interest rate based on US Libor  
at 5% and one to operate a floor rate on US 
Libor of 2.25%. Under IFRS, these derivative 
financial instruments are required to be 
disclosed at their fair values as either assets 
or liabilities and there has been a fair value 
adjustment gain through the income statement 
of £4,086 (2010: £2,580). Accordingly, at the 
balance sheet date, the Group had assets  
of derivative financial instruments of £Nil 
(2010: £196) and liabilities of derivative 
financial instruments of £3,435 (2010: £7,717).
Financing
In December 2010, the Group successfully 
raised £7.75 million of new equity finance 
before expenses of £1.1 million, to fund the 
acquisition of Allergopharma’s IVD Allergy 
Business for £4.9 million. The additional 
working capital is being used to fund 
worldwide exclusive access to the fully 
automated IDS-iSYS instrument, licensed from 
Immunodiagnostic Systems, for allergy use. 
The funds will also be used to develop allergy 
tests from the wide bank of allergens which we 
now have so that they may be run on this 
closed-system platform and we also aim to 
adapt our in-house microarray platform so that 
this too may provide a fully automated solution 
for a broad range of allergens in a single screen.
The fundraising involved the issue of 
64,583,350 new ordinary shares to existing 
and new shareholders and we are grateful  
to the support we received in enabling the 
Group to enter the exciting allergy sector  
of the IVD market.
Cash flow
Net cash inflow for the year was £1,355,113 
(2010: £66,246) which meant that at the year 
end, the Group had cash and cash equivalents 
of £2,054,877 (2010: £678,800). Net cash  
flow generated from operations appears  
on the face of the Cash Flow Statement  
as £348,183 (2010: £212,283). The change  
to adopting IFRS 3 (Revised) requires 
acquisition-related costs to be expensed 
through the income statement and to be 
treated as an operating cashflow, despite  
the fact that these costs would not have been 
incurred without the underlying investing 
activity of acquiring the allergy business. 
Excluding these acquisition-related costs, 
cash flow generated from operations is 
£760,228. With the excess of new funds 
raised over and above the outflow on the 
acquisition in the year, the Group has 
eliminated its net debt and had net cash of 
£446,546 (2010: £1,258,376 net debt) at the 
year-end.
Capital management
The Group funds its operations with a mixture 
of short-term and long-term borrowings or 
equity as appropriate with a view to maximising 
returns for shareholders whilst safeguarding 
the ability to continue to operate as a going 
concern. The financial performance of the 
Group is measured and monitored on a 
monthly basis and the Group manages its 
working capital requirements to ensure it 
continues to operate within the covenant 
limits applicable to any borrowing facilities. 
The use of funds for acquisitions is closely 
monitored by the Board so that existing funds 
are not adversely impacted by such activity 
and the Board reviews and approves an 
annual budget to help ensure it has adequate 
facilities to meet all its operational needs.
Outlook
I am encouraged with the ongoing integration 
of Omega GmbH into the Group and trading  
in the first two months of the new financial 
year has contributed unaudited profit of 
approximately £120k in this period.

Statements
Employees
The Company encourages communication with its employees and favours an environment where staff can put forward their ideas, suggestions 
and concerns on any matter that involves them. The Company gives full and fair consideration to applications for employment made by disabled 
people, having regard to their particular aptitudes and abilities. Where an employee becomes disabled in the course of their employment, where 
possible, arrangements will be made for appropriate retraining to match their abilities with their duties.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The Board meets regularly to review operations and to discuss risk areas. The Corporate Governance Report contains details of the Group’s 
system of internal control. Note 23 to the financial statements contains details of financial risks faced by the Group.
The Board is also aware of non-financial risk areas including:
General economic conditions
The Group may be faced with changes in the general economic climate in each territory in which it operates that may adversely affect the 
financial performance of the Group. Factors which may contribute include the level of direct and indirect competition against the Group, 
industrial disruption, rate of growth of the Group’s sectors and interest rates. The Group seeks to mitigate this risk by conducting operations  
on a broad geographic basis and by introducing new technologies to remain innovative.
Regulatory risk
The manufacturing, marketing and use of the Group’s products are subject to regulation by government and regulatory agencies in many 
countries. Of particular importance is the requirement to obtain and maintain approval for a product from the applicable regulatory agencies  
to enable the Group’s products to be marketed. Approvals can require clinical evaluation of data relating to safety, quality and efficacy  
of a product. The Group seeks to mitigate regulatory risk by conducting its operations within recognised quality assurance systems and 
undergoes external assessment to ensure compliance with these systems.
Acquisition risk
The success of the Group depends upon the ability of the Directors to assimilate and integrate the operations, personnel, technologies and 
products of acquired companies. The Group seeks to mitigate this risk by selecting companies which meet certain selection criteria and by 
conducting a detailed due diligence review.
Donations
The Company made no charitable donations in the year (2010: £Nil) nor any political donations (2010: £Nil).
Auditors
The auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, have indicated their willingness to continue in office and a resolution for their reappointment will be proposed 
at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Directors’ statement as to disclosure of information to auditors
The Directors who were members of the Board at the time of approving the Directors’ Report are listed on page 20. Having made enquiries  
of fellow Directors and of the Company’s auditors, each of these Directors confirms that:
to the best of each Director’s knowledge and belief, there is no information (that is, information needed by the Group’s auditors in connection •	
with preparing their report) of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
each Director has taken all the steps a Director might reasonably be expected to have taken to be aware of relevant audit information and  •	
to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.

Corporate Governance Report
As an AIM-quoted Company, the Group is not required to produce a corporate governance report that satisfies all the requirements of the 
Combined Code. However, the Directors are committed to providing information on an open basis and present their Corporate Governance 
Report as follows:
The Board of Directors
The Board currently comprises: one Non-executive Chairman; one Non-executive Director; and four Executive Directors, who are the 
Chief Executive, the Finance Director, the Sales and Marketing Director and the Managing Director of Genesis Diagnostics Ltd and Cambridge 
Nutritional Sciences Ltd. David Evans, Non-executive Chairman and Michael Gurner, Non-executive Director are considered by the Board 
to be independent in character and judgement. Michael Gurner is the senior independent Non-executive Director. The Board meets at regular 
intervals and is responsible for setting corporate strategy, approving the annual budget, reviewing financial performance, agreeing the renewal 
of and any new banking/treasury facilities and approving major items of capital expenditure. The Board is provided with appropriate information 
in advance of Board meetings to enable it to discharge its duties effectively. 
During the financial year, the Board met on twelve occasions. One of the meetings (on 20 December 2010) was a meeting of an Authorisation 
Committee where the Board had delegated responsibility to Andrew Shepherd and Kieron Harbinson to be able to approve all the final form 
documents in connection with the Admission, Placing and acquisition in December 2010. Of the eleven other meetings David Evans attended 
ten, with Michael Gurner, Andrew Shepherd, Kieron Harbinson and Geoff Gower attending all 11.
The Chairman has additional Non-executive Directorships of the following companies:
BGenuinetec KK
Epistem Holdings plc
Immunodiagnostic Systems Holdings plc

Scancell Holdings plc
EKF Diagnostics plc
Rosnes Limited
Sirigen Limited
Cytox Limited
Venn Life Sciences Limited
BBI Holdings Limited

Lochglen Whisky Limited
St Andrews Golf Art Limited

The Audit Committee
The Audit Committee has met on two occasions during the year and once since the year-end. The Committee is comprised of David Evans,  
as Chairman, and Michael Gurner and has primary responsibility for monitoring the quality of internal controls, ensuring that the financial 
performance of the Company is properly measured and reported on, and for reviewing reports from the Company’s auditors relating to the 
Company’s accounting and internal controls, in all cases having due regard to the interests of shareholders. The Committee shall also review 
preliminary results announcements, summary financial statements, significant financial returns to regulators and any financial information 
contained in certain other documents, such as announcements of a price-sensitive nature.
The Committee considers and makes recommendations to the Board, to be put to shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting,  
in relation to the appointment, reappointment and removal of the Company’s external auditors. The Committee also oversees the relationship 
with the external auditors including approval of remuneration levels, approval of terms of engagement and assessment of their independence 
and objectivity. In so doing, they take into account relevant UK professional and regulatory requirements and the relationship with the auditors 
as a whole, including the provision of any non-audit services. Ernst & Young LLP have been auditors to Omega Diagnostics Limited (‘ODL ’)  
since 2000 and were appointed as Auditors to the Company following completion of the reverse takeover of ODL in September 2006.
The Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the Company’s system of internal controls and has considered the need for an internal audit 
function. At this stage of the Company’s size and development, the Committee has decided that an internal audit function is not required, as the 
Company’s internal controls system in place is appropriate for its size. The Committee will review this position on an annual basis.
The Committee also reviews the Company’s arrangements for its employees raising concerns, in confidence, about possible wrongdoing 
in financial reporting or other matters. The Committee ensures that such arrangements allow for independent investigation and follow-up action.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee has met on one occasion during the year and once since the year end. The Committee is comprised of Michael 
Gurner, as Chairman, and David Evans and has primary responsibility for determining and agreeing with the Board the remuneration of the 
Company’s Chief Executive, Chairman, Executive Directors, the Company Secretary and such other members of the Executive management  
as it is designated to consider. The remuneration of the Non-executive Directors shall be a matter for the Chairman and the Executive Directors  
of the Board. No Director or manager shall be involved in any decisions regarding their own remuneration. Annual Report and Accounts 201 1

Overview

Review Governance
Financial  
Statements
Internal control
The Board is responsible for the Company’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness throughout the year. Such a system 
can only provide reasonable assurance against misstatement or loss.
The Board monitors financial controls through the setting and approval of an annual budget and the regular review of monthly management 
accounts. Management accounts contain a number of indicators that are designed to reduce the possibility of misstatement in financial 
statements.
Where the management of operational risk requires outside advice, this is sought from expert consultants, and the Company receives  
this in the areas of employment law and health and safety management.
The Company is compliant with industry standard quality assurance measures and undergoes regular external audits to ensure that 
accreditation is maintained.
Communication with shareholders
The Board recognises the importance of communication with its shareholders. The Company maintains informative websites for Genesis 
Diagnostics Limited, Omega Diagnostics Limited, Cambridge Nutritional Sciences Limited and Omega GmbH containing information likely to  
be of interest to existing and new investors. In addition, the Company retains the services of financial PR consultants, providing an additional 
contact point for investors. The Board encourages shareholder participation at its Annual General Meeting, where shareholders can be updated 
on the Company’s activities and plans.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the 
Business Review, which runs from page 10 to page 15. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing 
facilities are described in the Financial Review on pages 14 to 15. In addition, note 23 to the financial statements includes the Group’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging 
activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group has adequate financial resources together with long-term relationships 
with a number of customers and suppliers across different geographic areas and industries.
As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well-placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertain 
economic outlook. 
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and Company financial statements in accordance with applicable 
United Kingdom law and those International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.
The Directors are required to prepare Group and Company financial statements for each financial year end. Under Company Law, the Directors 
must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they present fairly the financial position of the Group and Company, 
financial performance of the Group and cash flows of the Group and Company for that period. In preparing the Group and Company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8: Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors and then •	
apply them consistently;
present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information; •	
provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to understand the •	
impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the Group’s financial position and financial performance;
state that the Group and Company has complied with IFRSs, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial •	
statements; and

transactions and disclose, with reasonable accuracy at any time, the financial position of the Group and Company and enable them to ensure 
that the Group and Company financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding assets  
of the Group and Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. Annual Report and Accounts 201 1

Independent Auditor’s Report
to the members of Omega Diagnostics Group PLC
We have audited the financial statements of Omega Diagnostics Group PLC for the year ended 31 March 2011 which comprise the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, Consolidated Cash Flow 
Statement, Company Balance Sheet, Company Statement of Changes in Equity, Company Cash Flow Statement and the related notes 1 to 23. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent Company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.  
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them  
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone  
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on page 26, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require  
us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance  
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of whether  
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied  
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation  
of the financial statements. In addition we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Directors’ Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies  
we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2011  •	
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; •	
the parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union  •	
and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. •	
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you, if, in our opinion: 
adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from •	
branches not visited by us; or 
the parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or •	
certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or •	
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. •

Notes to the Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2011
1 AUTHORISATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The financial statements of Omega Diagnostics Group PLC for the year ended 31 March 2011 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors 
on 1 July 2011, and the balance sheets were signed on the Board’s behalf by David Evans and Kieron Harbinson. Omega Diagnostics Group PLC 
is a Public Limited Company incorporated in England. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on the AIM Market.
2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Basis of preparation
The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial 
statements. These financial statements are presented in sterling and have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU  
and applied in accordance with the provisions of the companies act 2006.
In relation to IFRS 8 – Operating Segments, the Group has identified the Executive Board as the Chief Operating Decision Maker with 
responsibility for decisions over the allocation of resources to operating segments and for the monitoring of their performance. During the year, 
the Group acquired the in-vitro diagnostics business of Allergopharma Joachim Ganzer KG, providing a presence in the allergy testing market. 
Accordingly, the Group has reorganised its internal reporting to provide information over the performance of the following three segments: 
Allergy and Autoimmune •	
Food Intolerance •	
Infectious Disease and Other •	
Comparatives have been adjusted to reflect the new reporting format.
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Omega Diagnostics Group PLC and the entities it controls (its subsidiaries). 
Control comprises the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee so as to obtain benefit from its activities and is 
achieved through direct or indirect ownership of voting rights. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on 
which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases. The financial statements of the 
subsidiaries used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are based on consistent accounting policies. All intercompany 
balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from them, are eliminated. 
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for under IFRS 3 using the acquisition method. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the business 
combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Goodwill is not amortised 
but is subject to an annual impairment review and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. 
After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cash generating units monitored by management, usually at business 
segment level or statutory Company level as the case may be. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying 
amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual 
or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably. Following initial recognition at fair value at the acquisition date, the historic cost 
model is applied, with intangible assets being carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Intangible 
assets with a finite life have no residual value and are amortised on a straight line basis over the expected useful lives, with charges included  
in administration costs, as follows:
Technology assets – 5-20 years
Customer relationships – 5-10 years
Supply agreements – 5 years
Other intangibles – 5 years
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may 
not be recoverable.
Research and development costs
Expenditure on research, which is incurred up to the point of manufacturing validation, is written off as incurred. Thereafter, expenditure on 
product development which meets certain criteria is capitalised and amortised over its useful life. The manufacturing validation stage is when  
it is probable that the product will generate future economic benefits, and the following criteria have been met: technical feasibility; intention  
and ability to sell the product; availability of resources to complete the development of the product; and the ability to measure the expenditure 
attributable to the product. The useful life of the intangible asset is determined on a product by product basis, taking into consideration  
a number of factors. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is charged 
so as to write off the cost of assets to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives, on a straight line basis as follows:
Freehold properties – 33 years, straight line with no residual value
Leasehold improvements – 10 years, straight line with no residual value
Plant and machinery – 8-10 years, straight line with no residual value
Motor vehicles – 5 years, straight line with no residual value Annual Report and Accounts 201 1

2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying 
value may not be recoverable, and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount. Useful lives are reviewed annually and where 
adjustments are required, these are made prospectively.
Impairment of assets
The Group and Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication 
exists, the Group and Company makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s 
or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use, and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not 
generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset 
exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered to be impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their net present value, using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to that asset. Impairment losses on continuing operations are 
recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is defined as standard cost or purchase price and includes all direct 
costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less any 
further costs expected to be incurred prior to completion and disposal. 
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at the lower of original invoice amount and recoverable 
amount. A provision for doubtful amounts is made when there is objective evidence that collection of the full amount is no longer probable. 
Significant financial difficulty or significantly extended settlement periods are considered to be indicators of impairment. Normal average 
payment terms vary from payment in advance to 90 days. Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as remote. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity 
of three months or less.
Financial instruments
Under IAS39, financial assets, liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Financial assets are classified as either:
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss •	
loans and receivables •	
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, both in sterling and US dollars. The Group 
does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. Derivative financial instruments with positive fair values are recognised  
as assets measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date. The fair value of interest rate contracts is determined by reference to market 
values for similar instruments that have similar maturities. Changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement included in finance 
costs, due to the fact that hedge accounting has not been applied.
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables that do not carry any interest and have fixed or determinable payment amounts that are not quoted in an active market are 
classified as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables with a maturity of less than 12 months are included in current assets and are 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. 
Financial liabilities are classified as either:
financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss •	
other liabilities •	
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, both in sterling and US dollars. 
The Group does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. Derivative financial instruments with negative fair values  
are recognised as liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date. The fair value of interest rate contracts is determined by 
reference to market values for similar instruments that have similar maturities. Changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement 
included in finance costs, due to the fact that hedge accounting has not been applied.
Other financial liabilities, whether used as part of the consideration for acquisitions which include deferred consideration or not, are designated 
by the Group as financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss. They are measured at the present value of the consideration expected  
to be payable by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates. At initial recognition, the quantum of liability to be 
recognised will depend upon management’s expectation, at that date, of the amount that would ultimately be payable. Where there is a change 
in the expectation of future cash flows or interest rates, the change is reflected through the income statement.

Overview
Business  
Review Governance
Financial  
Statements
Other liabilities
Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method.
Bank borrowings are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. For 
long-term bank borrowings stated at amortised cost, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the borrowing instrument are recognised 
as an interest expense over the life of the instrument.
A financial asset or liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires. Where an 
existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are 
substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and recognition of the new liability, 
such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised.
Financial assets and liabilities that are held for trading and other assets and liabilities designated as such on inception are included at fair value 
through profit and loss. Financial assets and liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for sale in the short-term. Derivatives 
are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as hedge instruments. Assets are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with 
gains or losses recognised in the income statement. 
Company’s investments in subsidiaries 
The Company recognises its investments in subsidiaries at cost. The carrying value of investments is reviewed for impairment whenever events 
or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Presentation currency
The financial statements are presented in UK pounds sterling. Transactions in currencies other than sterling are recorded at the prevailing rate  
of exchange at the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies 
are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. 
Foreign currencies
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date of the 
transaction. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the net profit or loss for the year. The trading results of the overseas 
subsidiary are translated at the average exchange rate ruling during the year, with the exchange difference between the average rates and  
the rates ruling at the balance sheet date being taken to reserves. Any difference arising on the translation of the opening net investment,  
in the overseas subsidiary, and of applicable foreign currency loans, are dealt with as adjustments to reserves. 
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and net of discounts and sales-related taxes. Sales of  
goods are recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer. This will be when goods have  
been dispatched and the collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Revenue relates to the sale of medical diagnostic kits.
Government grants
Government grants are recognised when it is reasonable to expect that the grants will be received and that all related conditions will be met, 
usually on submission of a valid claim for payment. Government grants in respect of capital expenditure are credited to a deferred income 
account and are released to the income statement over the expected useful lives of the relevant assets by equal annual instalments.
Leasing and hire purchase commitments
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and are depreciated over the shorter of their 
lease period and useful life. The corresponding lease or hire purchase obligation is capitalised in the balance sheet as a liability. The interest 
element of the rental obligation is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease and represents a constant proportion of the 
balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals applicable to operating leases, where substantially all the benefits and risks remain with the lessor, are charged against profits 
on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Share-based payments
Equity-settled transactions
For equity-settled transactions, the group measures the award by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and it is 
recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the  
award. Fair value is determined using an appropriate pricing model. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any service  
and performance (vesting conditions), other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company (market conditions). 
Any other conditions which are required to be met in order for an employee to become fully entitled to an award are considered to be non-
vesting conditions. Like market performance conditions, non-vesting conditions are taken into account in determining grant date fair value.  
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market or non-vesting 
condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other 
performance conditions are satisfied.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has 
expired and management’s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of vesting conditions and of the number of equity instruments that 
will ultimately vest or, in the case of an instrument subject to a market or non-vesting condition, be treated as vesting as described above.  Annual Report and Accounts 201 1 
www.omegadiagnostics.com

2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
This includes any award where non-vesting conditions within the control of the Group or the employee are not met. The movement in cumulative 
expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, the cost  
based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period. In addition, an expense is recognised over the 
remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modification, based on the difference between the fair value of the 
original award and the fair value of the modified award, both as measured on the date of the modification. No reduction is recognised if this 
difference is negative.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised  
in the income statement for the award is expensed immediately. Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation  
or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the income statement.
Pension contributions
Contributions to personal pension plans of employees on a defined contribution basis are charged to the income statement in the year 
in which they are payable.
The Group also operates two defined benefit plans in Germany, which are closed to new members. Obligations under defined benefit  
plans are measured at discounted present values by actuaries, while plan assets are recorded at fair value. The operating and financing costs  
of pensions are charged to the income statement in the period in which they arise and are recognised separately. The difference between  
actual and expected returns on assets during the year, including changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income.
Income taxes
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based 
on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:
where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business •	
combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;
in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the timing  •	
of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future; and
deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the •	
deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related 
asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax and deferred tax is charged or credited in other comprehensive income or directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited  
or charged in other comprehensive income or directly to equity. Otherwise, income tax and deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss.
Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application 
of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The significant areas of estimation and uncertainty and critical judgements in applying the accounting policies that have the most significant 
effect on the amounts recognised in the financial information are discussed below. Further judgements, assumptions and estimates are set  
out in the Group financial statements.
Valuation of intangible assets
Management judgement is required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets having reference to future economic benefits expected 
to be derived from use of the asset. Economic benefits are based on the fair values of estimated future cash flows.
Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. The test considers future cash flow projections of cash generating units that give rise to the  
goodwill. Where the discounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recognised for the difference. 
Further analysis of the estimates and judgements is disclosed in Note 9.
Deferred tax assets
Management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and 
level of future taxable profits together with an assessment of the effect of future tax planning strategies. The carrying value of the deferred tax 
asset at 31 March 2011 is £84,913 (2010: £96,074). Further details are contained in Note 15.

*   The effective dates stated here are those given in the original IASB/IFRIC standards and interpretations. As the Group prepares its financial 
statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union (EU), the application of new standards and interpretations will be 
subject to their having been endorsed for use in the EU via the EU Endorsement mechanism. In the majority of cases this will result in an 
effective date consistent with that given in the original standard or interpretation but the need for endorsement restricts the Group’s discretion  
to adopt standards early.
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Group’s financial 
statements in the period of initial application.
3 ADOPTION OF NEW INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS 
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except for IFRS 3 (Revised) – Business Combinations. 
The key features of IFRS 3 (Revised) are for acquisition-related costs to be expensed through the income statement and not to be included  
in the purchase price and contingent consideration, where applicable, to be recognised at fair value on the acquisition date (with subsequent 
changes recognised in the income statement and not as a change to goodwill).
4 SEGMENT INFORMATION
Following the completion of the acquisition of the In-Vitro diagnostics business of Allergopharma Joachim Ganzer KG and the incorporation  
of Omega GmbH the Group carried out a review of internal reporting and the information presented to the Board.
For management purposes the Group is now organised into three operating divisions: Allergy and Autoimmune, Food Intolerance and Infectious 
and Other. The Allergy and Autoimmune division specialises in the research, development, production and marketing of in-vitro Allergy and 
Autoimmune tests used by doctors to diagnose patients with allergies and autoimmune diseases.
The Food Intolerance division specialises in the research, development and production of kits to aid the detection of immune reactions to food. 
It also provides clinical analysis to the general public, clinics and health professionals as well as supplying the consumer Food Detective
®
 test.
The Infectious diseases division specialises in the research, development and production and marketing of kits to aid the diagnosis of  
Infectious Diseases.
Corporate consists of centralised corporate costs which are not allocated across the three business divisions.
Inter segment transfers or transactions are entered into under the normal commercial conditions that would be available to unrelated third parties.
Comparatives have been adjusted to reflect the new reporting format.  Annual Report and Accounts 201 1

In March 2011, the UK Government announced its intention to accelerate the planned phased decrease in the rate of corporation tax with  
a reduction to 26% on 1 April 2011 and further reducing by 1% per annum until it reaches 23% on 1 April 2014. At 31 March 2011 the change  
in corporation tax rate from the planned 27% to 26% on 1 April 2011 had been substantively enacted and therefore the deferred tax assets  
and liabilities included within these results have been calculated based on the reduced current UK corporation tax rate of 26%. The forecast 
effect of the proposed reductions in the corporation tax rate by 2014 would be to reduce the net deferred tax liability by £50,272.

Equity-settled share-based payments
Consolidated and Company
The share-based payment plans are described below. 
EMI Option Scheme and Unapproved Option Scheme
The plans are equity-settled plans and the fair value is measured at the grant date. Under the above plans, share options are granted to
Directors and employees of the Company. The exercise price of the option is equal to the market price of the shares on the date of grant.
The options vest one year after the date of grant and are not subject to any performance criteria.
The fair value of the options is estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes pricing model taking into account the terms and
conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
The contractual life of each option granted is ten years and there is no cash settlement alternative.
Second Unapproved Option Scheme (SUOS)
The plan is an equity-settled plan and the fair value is measured at the grant date. Under the above plan, share options may be granted to third 
parties for provision of services to the Company. The exercise price of the option is equal to the market price of the shares on the date of grant. 
The options vest three years after the date of grant and are not subject to any performance criteria.
The fair value of the options is estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes pricing model taking into account the terms and conditions 
upon which the instruments were granted.
The contractual life of each option granted is ten years and there is no cash settlement alternative.
Under the EMI Option Scheme 20,000 options lapsed during the year and a further 40,000 were granted. 
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average exercise prices (WAEP) of, and movements in, share options during the year:

The expected life of the options is based on management’s assumption of the options’ life due to the lack of any historical data on the exercise 
period of these options. The assumption takes into account the experience of employees and Directors and is not necessarily indicative of 
exercise patterns that may occur.
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that historical volatility over a period similar to the life of the option is indicative of future trends, 
which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.

8 ACQUISITION OF SUBSIDIARIES
On 21 December 2010, the Group acquired the business and certain assets of the in-vitro allergy diagnostics business of Allergopharma 
Joachim Ganzer KG.
The Group incorporated a 100% owned subsidiary, Omega GmbH, which was used to purchase the business and assets. The business 
specialises in the research, development, production and marketing of in-vitro allergy tests used by doctors to diagnose patients with allergies. Annual Report and Accounts 201 1

Cost of the acquisition
The total acquisition cost of £4,916,049 was settled in one cash payment. Acquisition costs amounted to £1,115,902 (£412,045 is included within 
administration costs in the statement of comprehensive income).
Funding
To fund the cost of the acquisition, the Group raised £7,750,002 (before expenses of £703,857) via the placing of 64,583,350 new ordinary 
shares at a price of 12p per share.
From the date of incorporation, Omega GmbH has contributed revenue of £955,153 and a pre-tax loss of £210,718 to the Group result for the 
year. This is split between a loss of £90,420 in the period from 30 June 2010 (date of incorporation) to 21 December 2010 and a loss of £120,298 
between 21 December 2010 (date of acquisition) and 31 March 2011, being the trading period post acquisition of the business and assets.
The result for the trading period post acquisition would have been an operating profit of approximately £100,000 however the actual result was impacted by 
one off agency costs, one off IT training costs as well as intangible asset amortisation and inter-group interest charged based on funding levels provided.
The combined revenue and profit before tax for the Group, assuming the business and assets had been acquired at the start of the period 
would have been £10,767,495 and £405,124 respectively.
Goodwill
The acquisition of the business and certain assets of the in-vitro allergy business has resulted in goodwill of £1,572,097. This amount of goodwill 
is the total amount deductible for tax purposes in line with current German tax law.
This goodwill represents the advantages, synergies and strategic value to be derived from adding the business to the Group as follows:
driving export sales of current IVD business allergy products through the existing Omega international distribution network •	
apply existing Genarrayt •	
®
 microarray test platform to IgE allergy screening. Automation of the test procedure will allow more rapid processing  
of higher test volumes
developing an instrumentation strategy for performing allergy diagnostics through an automated ‘closed system’ instrument through  •	
an agreement with Immunodiagnostic Systems Holdings Plc.
In the prior year, on 28 September 2009, the Group acquired 100% of the voting shares of Co-Tek (South West) Ltd, an unlisted Company in Devon, 
UK. Co-Tek is a manufacturer of stained bacterial suspensions for the diagnosis of bacterial diseases including Typhoid, Brucellosis and Rickettsia. 
     
The total acquisition cost of £480,978 for Co-Tek comprised a cash payment of £400,000 and acquisition costs amounting to £80,978.
To fund the cost of the Co-Tek acquisition the Group raised £1,000,000 (before expenses of £80,807) via the placing of 5,000,000 new ordinary 
shares at a price of 20p per share.

Impairment testing of goodwill     
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment. The carrying amount of goodwill  
is indicated in the table above. The net book value of goodwill above for Genesis-CNS amounts to £3,016,892 (2010: £3,016,892), Co-Tek 
£332,986 (2010: £332,986) and Omega GmbH £1,624,112 (2010: £Nil).
The recoverable amount of Genesis-CNS, Co-Tek and Omega GmbH has been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow 
projections based on the financial budget approved by the Board covering the period to 31 March 2012, with projected cash flows thereafter 
through to March 2016 based on a growth rate of 4.8% per annum. The key assumptions used in the budget for Genesis-CNS are the sales 
projections which are predicated on the continued success of the Genarrayt
®
 and Food Detective
®
 assays being commercialised on an 
international basis and the gross margins which can be achieved from the sales of these products. The key assumption used in the budget for 
Co-Tek is the growth in sales of the Company’s Micropath™ range of products where increased volumes are dependent upon having accessed a 
lower manufacturing cost through the acquisition of Co-Tek itself. The budget for Omega GmbH assumes continued organic growth in sales in the 
German market as well as achieving an increase in export sales through the existing Omega international distribution network. The Omega GmbH 
forecast also includes revenues in years two to five from the microarray and IDS-iSYS platforms which will allow more rapid processing of higher volume tests.
In all three cases, the Company also makes assumptions in regard to having sufficient production personnel to cope with increased volumes. 
The discount rate applied to cash flows is 12.5% for the group which takes account of other risks specific to each segment such as currency  
risk, geography and price risk. The discount rate is the weighted average cost of pre-tax cost of debt financing and the pre-tax cost of equity 
financing. Cash flows beyond the budget period are extrapolated for Genesis-CNS, Co-Tek and Omega GmbH over the next four years using  
a growth rate of 4.8% that equates to the current growth rate in the IVD industry. Thereafter, a Nil growth rate has been assumed for prudence.  
As a result, there has been no impairment to the carrying value of goodwill.
Sensitivity analysis
Base forecasts show headroom of £3m above carrying value for Genesis-CNS, headroom of £266k above carrying value for Co-Tek and 
headroom of £5.4m for Omega GmbH. Sensitivity analysis has been undertaken to assess the impact of any reasonably possible change  
in key assumptions. If the growth rate were to drop from 4.8% to 3.8% this would have the effect of reducing the headroom in Genesis-CNS  
by £134k over five years, in Co-Tek by £12k over five years and in Omega GmbH by £135k over five years.
For Genesis-CNS, the discount rate would have to increase to 35.5% or the growth rate would have to be a decline of 24% for the headroom to reduce to Nil.
For Co-Tek, the discount rate would have to increase to 40.4% or the growth rate would have to be a decline of 22.5% for the headroom to reduce to Nil.
For Omega GmbH, the discount rate would have to increase to 53.5% or the growth rate would have to be a decline of 60% for the headroom to reduce to Nil. Annual Report and Accounts 201 1

9 INTANGIBLES (continued)
The adjustment relating to the contingent consideration amounting to £44,162 results from a reassessment of the Genesis/CNS earnout. This is 
further analysed in note 20. Other than the adjustment above there has been no impairment to the carrying value of goodwill.

22 EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Group by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.

Within other loans designated at fair value through profit and loss is the vendor loan note of £1.1 million which was issued in September 2007.  
It carries a coupon of base rate only and is repayable in three equal instalments in September 2012, 2013 and 2014. The interest is rolled up  
and repayable with the final capital payment. The fair value is calculated as the future cash flows expected to result based on current estimates 
of interest rates. There has been no change in the year to the fair value of the loan due to changes in credit risk. The movement in the year  
of £27,468 (2010: £86,600) is due to the effect of unwinding discount factors and is included within finance charges in the income statement.
Financial risk management
The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those relating to foreign currency, credit, liquidity and interest rate. These risks 
are managed in accordance with Board-approved policies.
Foreign currency risk
The Group operates in more than one currency jurisdiction and is therefore exposed to currency risk on the retranslation of the income 
statement and the balance sheet of its overseas subsidiary from euros into its functional currency of pounds sterling. The Company funds 
its subsidiary by a mixture of equity and intercompany loan financing in euros and these balances are subject to exchange rate movements  
that can give rise to movements in equity. The Group also buys and sells goods and services in currencies other than the functional currency, 
principally in Euros and US dollars. The Group has US dollar and euro denominated bank accounts and where possible, the Group will offset 
currency exposure where purchases and sales of goods and services can be made in these currencies. The Group’s non-sterling revenues, 
profits, assets, liabilities and cash flows can be affected by movements in exchange rates. It is currently Group policy not to engage in any 
speculative transaction of any kind but this will be monitored by the Board to determine whether it is appropriate to use additional currency 
management procedures to manage risk. At 31 March 2011 (and 31 March 2010) the Group has not entered into any hedge transactions. Annual Report and Accounts 201 1

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a possible change in currency rates on the Group’s profit before tax and equity through  
the impact of sterling weakening against the US dollar, the euro and the Canadian dollar.

An increase in currency rate of 5% would have a similar opposite effect. The sensitivity around bank loans above represents the entire impact 
on the Company’s profit before tax and equity.
Credit risk
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The Group conducts its operations in many countries, so there is  
no concentration of risk in any one area. In most cases, the Group grants credit without security to its customers. Credit worthiness checks 
are undertaken before entering into contracts with new customers, and credit limits are set as appropriate. The Group conducts most of its 
operations through distributors and is therefore able to maintain a fairly close relationship with its immediate customers. As such, the Group 
monitors payment profiles of customers on a regular basis and is able to spot deteriorations in payment times. An allowance for impairment  
is made that represents the potential loss in respect of individual receivables where there is an identifiable loss event which, based on previous 
experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowance  
for doubtful receivables. An analysis of trade receivables from various regions is analysed in the following table:

Liquidity risk
The Group’s objective is to maintain sufficient headroom to meet its foreseeable financing and working capital requirements. The Group has  
in place drawn loan facilities and in the case of bank loans, regularly monitors performance to ensure compliance with all covenants. The Group 
also maintains a surplus balance of cash and cash equivalents to ensure flexible liquidity to meet financial liabilities as they fall due.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities at 31 March 2011 based on the undiscounted cash flows of 
liabilities which include both future interest and principal amounts outstanding based on the earliest date on which the group can be required  
to pay. The amounts of future interest are not included in the carrying value of financial liabilities on the balance sheet.

Interest rate risk
All of the Group’s borrowings are at variable rates of interest. The Group has an exposure to interest rate risk on changes in US dollar and 
sterling interest rates. To manage the interest rate risk, the Group has taken out interest rate hedge instruments relative to the two bank loans 
which will be repaid by September 2012. The change in fair value of these interest rate hedge instruments has been taken to the income 
statement in full. Annual Report and Accounts 201 1

Fair values 
The carrying amount for all categories of financial assets and liabilities disclosed on the balance sheet and in the related notes to the accounts 
is equal to the fair value of such assets and liabilities as at both 31 March 2011 and 31 March 2010. The monetary value attributable to these 
financial assets and liabilities is the same value that has been disclosed in the related notes to the accounts.
The valuation methods used to fair value the financial assets and liabilities have been disclosed in Note 2 to the Financial Statements under the 
heading of Financial instruments.
The carrying amount recorded in the balance sheet of each financial asset as at 31 March 2011 and 31 March 2010, including derivative financial 
instruments, represent the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk.

Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of instruments by valuation technique:
Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2:  other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly  
or indirectly, and
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
The fair value of the financial derivatives, detailed below, have been valued using the hierarchy above and have been categorised as level 2.

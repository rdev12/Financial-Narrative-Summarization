WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2012
Introduction
Performance
I am pleased to report that the Group 
delivered good results for the year  
ended 31 March 2012 in an economic 
environment that continues to be 
challenging. This is testament to the 
breadth and depth of the services we  
offer across the world. It is our geographic 
presence and the broad mix of work that 
we do that have continued to give the 
Group resilience at a time when many  
of our markets still experience uncertainty.
We ended the year in line with 
expectations having improved turnover 
and maintained underlying proﬁt before 
tax as we continue to balance our 
geographic footprint. It is particularly 
pleasing to report that we have 
successfully integrated our PBSJ  
acquisition – which is the largest in the 
Group’s history. In the ﬁrst full year that 
we report results for this new business  
in North America, we have achieved good 
margin progression in our consultancy 
business which conﬁrms that our 
integration strategy and operational 
efﬁciency measures are working.
I remain conﬁdent that our multi local 
presence, together with the mix of skills 
and expertise that we provide to our 
clients’ increasingly complex engineering 
challenges, places us in a strong position 
to provide effective solutions, as clients 
put greater emphasis on planning and 
design disciplines to optimise value from 
their infrastructure programmes. 
We continue to work with governments 
around the world to offer expert opinion 
about how growth can be achieved 
through investment in infrastructure and 
securing vital energy supply for the future. 
We have worked with country leaders  
and their cabinets through one to one 
brieﬁngs and by attending a number  
of trade visits, in particular to the Middle  
East and Asia Paciﬁc regions, where  
there continues to be strong growth 
potential for the Group.
People
Atkins is a people business, and I would 
like to thank our employees in all areas  
of the Group for their hard work and 
dedication over the past year. It is a 
combination of our colleagues’ technical 
excellence and outstanding regional  
and sector capabilities that enables  
us to deliver these results, despite the 
challenging economic environment.  
I would also like to welcome new arrivals 
to the Group: those who are just starting 
their careers, those who have moved  
to Atkins for personal development  
and those who have joined us  
through acquisition.
Board of directors
As chairman of the Board, I am 
responsible for ensuring its effective 
management and processes. I have  
set out my commitment to excellence  
in governance in the Corporate 
Governance Report (pages 64 to 72).
Dr Uwe Krueger succeeded Keith Clarke 
CBE as chief executive ofﬁcer in August 
2011. He has reviewed the Group’s 
strategy and concluded that overall it 
remains appropriate. He has identiﬁed 
three strategic priorities to accelerate  
the growth of the Group: operational 
excellence, portfolio optimisation and 
sector focus. We are making good 
progress against these priorities.
Sir Peter Williams, non-executive director 
and chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee retired from the Board of 
Atkins in September 2011. I would like  
to thank personally Sir Peter, on behalf  
of the Board, for the seven years of 
dedicated service he gave to Atkins.  
I am pleased to report that our existing 
non-executive director, Dr Raj Rajagopal 
has taken over from Sir Peter as chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee.
Also in September 2011, we welcomed 
Rodney Slater as a non-executive director. 
Mr Slater is based in the United States  
and was formerly the secretary of 
transportation under president Bill Clinton 
between 1997 and 2001. Mr Slater’s full 
biography can be found in the Board of 
directors section (pages 58 to 59).
 
Dividend
The Board is recommending a ﬁnal 
dividend of 20.75p per ordinary share in 
respect of the year ended 31 March 2012, 
making the total dividend for the year 
30.5p (2011: 29.0p), an increase of 5.2%. 
If approved at the Company’s annual 
general meeting, the dividend will be  
paid on 31 August 2012 to ordinary 
shareholders on the register on 27 July 
2012. Further details regarding dividend 
payments can be found in Investor 
Information (page 158).
Outlook
The Group’s geographic and sector 
diversiﬁcation continues to provide 
resilience, which is reﬂected in the  
results we have reported for the year 
ended 31 March 2012. Atkins is  
positioned to deliver further growth  
in the year ahead.

WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2012
Introduction
Business position
I am pleased to report that the year to  
31 March 2012 was another good year  
in terms of our ﬁnancial performance. 
Turnover grew by 9% to £1,711.1m. 
Reported proﬁt before tax was £135.5m, 
with the beneﬁt of £30.9m from pension 
gains, as we continue to actively manage 
our pension liabilities and £7.2m 
generated from the sale of our UK asset 
management business in November 2011. 
Excluding these beneﬁts, together with 
amortisation of intangible assets on 
acquisition of £4.2m, gives a more 
representative underlying proﬁt of 
£101.6m, which is comparable with last 
year. Taking into account the departure  
of around 550 staff following the sale  
of our UK asset management business  
in November 2011, underlying headcount 
increased through the year, with a closing 
headcount of 17,420 at the end of  
March 2012.
The Group proﬁt after tax for the year  
of £106.8m (2011: £72.6m) is shown  
in the Consolidated Income Statement 
(page 96).
The Group’s liquidity remains strong, 
driven by a good cash performance in the 
second half of the year as a result of our 
strategic focus on operational excellence 
and cash ﬂow. Net funds at the end  
of the year were £122.6m.
These results include the ﬁrst full year  
of our acquired North America business. 
Integration has gone well and we have 
started to share resources and knowledge 
across the Group which is improving our 
competitive and market share position  
in North America. 
The UK region ended the year well and,  
as anticipated, saw modest growth in 
underlying headcount in the second half 
of the year. The North American region 
reported a slight margin improvement 
despite challenging market conditions  
and a small loss in our Peter Brown 
construction management at risk  
business in relation to some legacy issues. 
The Middle East region continued to enjoy 
strong market conditions while client 
relations remain challenging and the scale 
and complexity of the major projects 
require heightened attention with regard 
to change management and payment 
terms. With projects like the Central 
Planning Ofﬁce in Doha we are 
positioning ourselves strategically as the 
key expert for integrated infrastructure 
consulting in the region. The Asia Paciﬁc 
and Europe business continued to deliver 
a steady performance and Faithful+Gould 
traded well with tailored service solutions 
for major international corporations in 
Asia, Europe and North America. Our 
Energy business achieved strong organic 
growth, which was augmented by the 
strategically important acquisition of 
Pöyry’s oil and gas business during  
the year.
Atkins continues to demonstrate the 
highest levels of technical excellence and 
expertise as it delivers the world’s most 
challenging and time critical infrastructure 
projects. The London 2012 Olympic and 
Paralympic Games is a perfect example  
of Atkins at its best as we are the ofﬁcial 
engineering design services provider to 
the Games. This project showcases British 
engineering expertise on a world stage 
and demonstrates the breadth and depth 
of Atkins’ capabilities. Atkins’ engineering 
is considered to be some of the best in  
the world, and it is from this heritage, 
with engineering design excellence and 
our employees’ passion to perform  
and exceed clients’ expectations, that  
we will continue to grow internationally  
in the future. 
We remain committed to safety in the 
workplace and on all of our project sites. 
Safety forms part of our commitment to 
quality and reliability. It is derived directly 
from the values of our Company and,  
as we push to improve productivity and 
proﬁtability, we should never forget that 
safety must come ﬁrst. The implementation 
of our safety standards worldwide is  
a leadership responsibility at all levels  
in the organisation.
We have formed a strong senior 
leadership team and with a highly skilled 
and motivated employee base we will 
continue to do what Atkins does best: 
listening carefully to the project needs  
of our clients and designing and 
engineering the best possible  
solutions for their requirements. 
Priorities
Our objective is simple: to drive 
shareholder value with unrelenting  
focus on operational excellence and  
to implement our growth strategy with 
the priority on portfolio optimisation  
and focused sector, as well as  
regional, expansion. 
Our medium term goal is to generate 
more than 75% of revenue from our non 
UK and Energy businesses and to generate 
a margin above 8%. We will grow 
organically and through acquisitions that 
add new skills or a regional presence.
Conclusion
We have made good progress in the last 
twelve months despite the challenging 
economic environment. During the  
second half we continued to diversify the 
business, improved cash ﬂow, reduced  
our pension liabilities and are returning  
to growth. We remain focused on driving 
operational excellence throughout the 
business to improve margins, optimise our 
portfolio and meet the evolving needs of 
our clients. Our strategy is clear and the 
Group is well positioned to deliver further 
growth in the year ahead.

Introduction
 Our strategy Our priorities
Our core strategy remains  
to focus on growth and, 
selectively, to increase our 
geographic footprint through 
targeted international 
expansion, while continuing  
to deliver good ﬁnancial 
performance in all our  
markets and geographies.
We are accelerating our  
delivery of the strategy 
through focusing on three 
priorities over the short to 
medium term: operational 
excellence, portfolio 
optimisation and sector focus.
 1 . Operational excellence 
We are driving operational performance across the Group to improve our operating 
margin and cash conversion across all businesses and regions. Key initiatives include 
an increased focus on managing the Group’s working capital requirements, with  
an emphasis on billing, cash collection and competitive payment terms; and  
a continuous review of utilisation to ensure we optimise client facing time.  
Operational excellence will provide a solid platform for future growth.
2. Portfolio optimisation
We will continue to review our portfolio and make appropriate decisions about  
our ongoing ownership as we seek to improve our margin and enhance the  
Group’s growth prospects.
The UK asset management business was identiﬁed as a non core business within  
the Group. This divestment marked an important stage in strategically focusing  
the Group on higher growth, higher margin activities.
3. Sector focus
As we review our portfolio it is clear that a number of our existing sectors have 
attractive growth prospects. We will expand our offering primarily in geographic areas 
where we already have a presence through small to medium sized acquisitions that 
complement our organic growth as we balance our client and sector mix. We will  
also redirect and leverage resources and technical capabilities to address attractive 
market sectors. These may evolve over time, but currently include the following  
areas: Energy, aerospace, security, water.  12 Introduction

 Successful performance Our sectors
A combination of our technical 
excellence and outstanding regional 
and segmental capabilities enables us to 
continue to deliver good results despite 
the challenging economic environment 
in a number of our markets over the last 
few years.
Our current geographic balance helps 
us to deliver sustainable results, proving 
that we can grow organically, in new 
areas and through acquisition. Today, 
more than 50% of the Group’s revenue 
comes from clients outside of the UK.

Energy
Energy has been identiﬁed for investment and reported separately in our results  
for some time.
Aerospace
Aerospace represents another key area, where we will grow from a relatively small 
base. We are targeting the North American aircraft manufacturing market as part  
of our regional growth plan and have recently opened an ofﬁce in Seattle to  
support this.
Security
Security issues, particularly in regions such as the Middle East, are becoming more 
prevalent; we have outstanding capabilities in both this market and region.

UK
In the UK we have pre-emptively 
repositioned our businesses to address 
ongoing market challenges through the 
active deployment of staff, recruitment  
in growth areas and the increasing use  
of our Bangalore operations to deliver  
a competitive cost base.
North America
In North America the integration of  
the acquisition of PBSJ in October 2010, 
together with operational efﬁciency 
initiatives, has delivered margin 
improvement in the consultancy 
business, as a platform for growth. 
Middle East
In the Middle East we have achieved 
targeted geographic expansion in areas 
of high essential infrastructure spend,  
as well as sector diversiﬁcation. We have 
added skills to address the buoyant 
infrastructure market, with headcount 
growing signiﬁcantly during the year. 
Asia Paciﬁc  
and Europe
In Asia Paciﬁc and Europe we  
have improved service quality and  
have gained access to increased  
opportunities through the addition  
of high proﬁle resources.
Energy
In our Energy business we have  
invested for growth, particularly  
through acquisition and our  
n.triple.a joint venture.
We have the right leadership and 
organisational structure to deliver  
our growth strategy. 
Our medium term margin target is to 
generate a margin above 8% across  
all our businesses and regions. 
We are adjusting the geographic 
balance of the Group’s operations and, 
in the medium term, aim to generate 
more than 75% of our revenue from 
our non UK and Energy businesses, 
resulting in less than 25% of our 
revenue being derived from the UK. 
Atkins is a well managed organisation 
with strong leadership delivering good 
ﬁnancial performance in all our markets 
and geographies. We will capitalise  
on growing organically and through 
acquisition, including larger,  
strategically focused transactions  
to drive our Group’s growth and  
proﬁt performance.

WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2012
Headcount was 17,420 at the end of 
March 2012, 102 less than the same time 
last year. This ﬁgure includes the reduction 
of around 550 staff from the sale of our 
UK asset management business, offset  
by increases in staff from underlying 
growth in other regions, most notably  
the Middle East. 
Normalised diluted EPS increased by  
4.0p per share to 79.0p (2011: 75.0p),  
an increase of 5.3%. 
The Group pension schemes have a net 
liability of £251.1m, a reduction year on 
year of £86.7m. The fair value of plan 
assets has increased to £1,078.7m 
(2011: £944.3m) and the liabilities have 
increased to £1,329.8m (2011: £1,282.1m).
Operating cash ﬂow in the year was 
£68.6m (2011: £68.5m), representing 
62.1% (2011: 57.7%) of underlying 
operating proﬁt. The Group’s liquidity 
remains strong with closing net funds  
of £122.6m (2011: £123.3m).
As at 31 March 2012, the Group had 
secured 60% (2011: 55%) of budgeted 
revenue for the coming ﬁnancial year.  
The improvement, compared with  
the previous ﬁnancial year, further 
demonstrates the effectiveness  
of our strategy, at a time when many  
of our markets remain difﬁcult.
Segmental analyses of revenue,  
operating proﬁt, work in hand and  
staff numbers follow. Staff turnover  
is discussed further in the Human 
Resources Review (pages 44 to 49).
Our business
Our core business is helping our clients  
to plan, design and enable capital 
programmes that resolve complex 
challenges in the built and natural 
environment. We are able to plan  
all aspects of our clients’ projects, 
conducting feasibility studies and impact 
analyses covering technical, logistical, 
legal, environmental and ﬁnancial 
considerations. We design systems, 
infrastructures, processes, buildings and 
civil structures. We enable our clients’ 
complex programmes by optimising 
procurement methods and managing 
supply chains on their behalf to reduce 
timescales, cost and risk.
Atkins’ structure of ﬁve business segments 
reﬂects how we manage the business  
in different geographies and markets. 
Details of activities and results by business 
segment are shown in the segmental 
performance section which follows.
Key performance indicators 
The Group uses a range of performance 
measures to monitor and manage the 
business. Those that are particularly 
important in monitoring our progress  
in generating shareholder value are 
considered key performance  
indicators (KPIs).
Our KPIs measure past performance  
and also provide information and context  
to anticipate future events and, in 
conjunction with our detailed knowledge 
and experience of the segments in which 
we operate, allow us to act early and 
manage the business going forward.  
We track volume, proﬁtability, efﬁciency, 
secured workload and capacity.
Revenue, operating proﬁt and margin, 
earnings per share (EPS) and operating 
cash ﬂow provide indications as to the 
volume and quality of work we have 
done. They measure both proﬁtability  
and the efﬁciency with which we have 
turned operating proﬁts into cash.
Work in hand measures our secured 
workload as a percentage of the 
budgeted revenue for the next year.  
Staff numbers and staff turnover are 
measures of capacity and show us how 
effective we have been in recruiting and 
retaining our key resource. KPIs for the 
year ended 31 March 2012 are shown  
on page 15, along with prior  
year comparatives.
Review of the year
As outlined in the Chief executive ofﬁcer’s 
statement and in more detail in the 
Financial Performance section of the 
Business Review on pages 36 to 39,  
this has been another good year in  
terms of Atkins’ ﬁnancial performance. 
Turnover grew by 9% to £1,711.1m 
(2011: £1,564.3m). Reported proﬁt before 
tax was £135.5m (2011: £91.0m) at an 
operating margin of 8.0% (2011: 6.8%). 
These results had the beneﬁt of £30.9m 
from pension gains as we have continued 
to actively manage our pension liabilities 
and £7.2m proﬁt generated from the sale 
of our UK asset management business  
in November 2011. Excluding these 
beneﬁts, together with amortisation  
of intangible assets on acquisition of 
£4.2m (2011: £3.7m), gives a more 
representative underlying proﬁt before  
tax of £101.6m (2011: £102.7m).
 
Reported operating proﬁt was 
£137.2m (2011: £107.0m). The year on 
year increase in margin was primarily due  
to a one off pension event in relation  
to the Group’s deﬁned beneﬁt scheme. 
Adjusting for the effect of this, together 
with amortisation of intangible assets on 
acquisition referred to above, provides  
a better view of the Group’s underlying 
performance, showing operating proﬁt  
of £110.5m (2011: £118.7m) and  
a margin of 6.5% (2011: 7.6%).

2.  Underlying operating proﬁt excludes amortisation 
of intangibles of £4.2m (2011: £3.7m) recognised 
on the acquisition of PBSJ and a pension 
curtailment gain of £30.9m (2011: nil). In addition,

WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2012
Performance
The UK region performed in line with 
expectations as we continue to navigate 
difﬁcult market conditions, notably  
in our rail business. 
In October 2011 we announced the sale 
of our UK asset management business, 
which employed around 550 staff, to 
Sodexo for an initial cash consideration  
of £5m. This accounts for 29% of the 
reduction in revenue and the majority  
of the headcount reduction in the year. 
The disposal masks underlying growth  
in headcount since the half year when 
headcount, excluding asset management, 
was 8,870 and reﬂects our proactive 
management of the composition of the 
Group, focusing on core growth sectors. 
Our broad multidisciplinary offering  
has helped to mitigate the impact of 
constrained public sector spending by 
providing competitive, cost effective,  
high quality expertise. In addition, added 
resilience is brought to the UK business 
through its support of projects for the 
Group’s Middle East operations. 
We are delighted with the progress on  
the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic 
Games, for which we are the ofﬁcial 
engineering design services provider.  
This multiple award winning project  
is an excellent example of Atkins at its 
best as we demonstrate the breadth  
and depth of our skills while showcasing 
British engineering expertise on the  
world stage.
Business model 
This region comprises businesses that  
are primarily focused on the UK market, 
where we plan, design and enable our 
clients’ capital programmes in and around 
the built environment. We are a technical 
consultancy, providing advice and 
engineering design for public and private 
sector clients. Our multidisciplinary skills 
allow us to draw on expertise across  
the business to deliver complex projects  
in the UK and to support other  
regional businesses.
Strategy
As we have previously identiﬁed, material 
growth in this segment will be difﬁcult in 
the near term due to challenging market 
conditions. Therefore, our focus remains 
on driving operational efﬁciency through 
cost reductions and supplementing skills 
with niche acquisitions where appropriate. 
We continue to invest in developing our 
people, focusing on quality, technical 
excellence and innovation. 
In addition, added resilience is brought  
to our UK business by its ongoing support  
on projects for our overseas businesses, 
together with the increasing use of our 
Bangalore operations to deliver a 
competitive cost base.
Business drivers
The economic environment signiﬁcantly 
affects the opportunities available to the 
region, and we continue to reposition 
ourselves to address these challenges.  
Our diversiﬁed business provides some 
resilience to market ﬂuctuations as does 
the fact that a number of our markets 
remain well funded. 
Operations
Rail
As anticipated, our rail business had a 
difﬁcult year as a consequence of major 
signalling work being slow to come to 
market. This had an impact on operating 
margins as we elected to maintain stafﬁng 
levels in anticipation of project awards  
by Network Rail. The position has now 
improved, justifying the decision, as Atkins 
has been awarded work on two Network 
Rail signalling major project frameworks 
for Sussex/Wessex and Kent/Anglia, 
worth in excess of £400m over a seven 
year period. While projects are now 
beginning to be awarded out of these 
frameworks, there remain delays to work 
actually starting.
In addition to these two frameworks,  
we have secured a number of rail design 
projects in recent months. These include 
the Wolverhampton resignalling project 
and in April 2012 the contract to prepare 
preliminary designs for the high speed  
line through the Country South section  
of High Speed 2.
Highways and transportation
Following signiﬁcant restructuring in the 
year ended 31 March 2011, the highways 
and transportation business had a good 
year with increased workload, helped  
by the UK government announcement  
in November 2011, which brought 
forward previously delayed projects. 
The consultancy business had a number  
of signiﬁcant wins, including the Highways 
Agency Specialist Project Support 
Framework and the related Department 
for Transport Technical Engineering  
Advice and Research Framework.

Management consultancy
Our management consultancy business 
performed well. We strengthened our 
position in the UK security and intelligence 
market and we continue to work  
on the BAA IT outsourcing contract  
in partnership with Capgemini,  
leveraging our position in aviation.
Outlook
The outlook for the UK is stable.  
Work in hand has improved and stands  
at 65% (2011: 56%) of next year’s 
budgeted revenue. 
We are the market leader in UK 
engineering consultancy, with pre-
eminent rankings in the roads, rail and 
defence sectors. This industry leading 
position, together with our diversiﬁed 
platform and breadth of quality expertise, 
enables us to navigate short term market 
challenges and will help us to exploit 
opportunities when growth returns  
in the medium term.
The initial design work for the M25 
widening is complete, with the ﬁrst 
sections fully open to trafﬁc in advance of 
the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic 
Games. The M25 30 year operation and 
maintenance joint venture contract is 
progressing in line with our expectations. 
This joint venture brings together Balfour 
Beatty (52.5%), Egis (15%) and Atkins 
(32.5%) and provides services in network 
management, asset inspection, trafﬁc 
management, tunnel operations, incident 
management and routine and winter 
maintenance for the entire M25,  
including over 250 miles of spur  
roads and junctions.
Our highway services business continues 
to operate with strong work in hand, 
helped by recent success with the 
Highways Agency Area 2 contract, which 
extends to 2017. The ﬁrst of our other 
Highways Agency and local authority 
contracts is not scheduled for renewal 
until 2013. 
 
Water and environment
In our water and environment business  
we are seeing volumes improving on the 
ﬁve year regulatory Asset Management 
Programme (AMP5) framework contracts 
we have with a number of the UK water 
companies, as their asset management 
investment programmes progress.  
Our geotechnical, environmental and 
planning businesses continue to support 
large projects such as High Speed 2, 
where we have been awarded the 
contract to carry out the environmental 
impact assessments for the Rural North 
section covering Warwickshire and 
Staffordshire. Other large projects  
include Crossrail and the London 2012 
Olympic and Paralympic Games. 
Faithful+Gould
Faithful+Gould has continued to perform 
well in a challenging but stable market, 
delivering project and cost management 
services to a wide range of clients across 
the public and private sectors.
Design and engineering
Our role as the ofﬁcial engineering design 
services provider for the London 2012 
Olympic and Paralympic Games has 
progressed very well and will culminate 
with the Games in July, August and 
September. Our work on transforming  
the former industrial site, through a 
comprehensive integrated approach 
spanning many disciplines, not only 
provides the regenerated platform for the 
Olympics but will provide a lasting legacy 
once the Games have ended. We expect 
our work to continue when the Olympic 
Park transitions into the next phase of its 
life as the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.
Defence, aerospace and 
communications
Our defence, aerospace and 
communications businesses have 
performed well during the year,  
focusing on high technology industries, 
predominantly in the UK but also 
supporting Europe and the Middle East. 
Our aerospace business performed 
particularly strongly and we continue  
to expand our offering and geographic 
footprint with key clients such as Airbus 
and Rolls Royce. Communications and 
security remain strong market segments 
for our skills and capabilities within both 
the UK and the Middle East.

Performance
The North American region performed 
well, delivering an operating proﬁt  
of £21.2m. This is in line with our 
expectations, in what remains a slow 
market, and includes an increase in the 
consultancy margin to 6.6% (2011: 5.7%, 
six months only) as we have focused  
on operational efﬁciencies. Addressing 
weaker market demand in the second half 
of the year, we reduced our headcount  
by around 100 through the last quarter, 
closing the year at 3,255 (2011: 3,336).
This is the ﬁrst set of full year results for 
our North America segment, following 
the acquisition of PBSJ on 1 October 
2010. This acquisition, which included the 
Peter Brown construction management 
business which employs just under  
100 staff, transformed the scale of our 
operations in the region and augmented 
our established 500 person strong 
Faithful+Gould business.
Constraints on federal spending continue, 
with some uncertainty about the timing 
and funding of awarded projects due  
to budget restrictions and delays ahead  
of the US presidential elections in 
November 2012.
Business model 
We are primarily focused on the  
North American market where we plan, 
design and enable our clients’ capital 
programmes. We operate from over  
91 locations in 28 states plus Puerto Rico, 
Trinidad and Canada and serve a range  
of public and private sector clients.  
We currently focus on multidisciplinary 
design and engineering consultancy 
services in highways and transportation, 
water and environment and infrastructure 
related projects. 
Strategy
The acquisition of PBSJ was a major step 
in our strategy to develop a number  
of home markets. It has increased our 
presence in North America to over  
3,000 staff and provides us with access  
to the world’s largest engineering 
consultancy market.
Our strategy in the region is consistent 
with the Group’s strategy of combining 
technical excellence with regional 
multidisciplinary capability delivered 
through our local network of ofﬁces.  
This allows us to draw on expertise from 
across the region to deliver complex 
projects in North America and to provide 
specialist skills from within North America 
to strengthen the Group’s offering in 
other segments. An example of this  
is our work in the Middle East on the 
Jeddah airport project, where we 
deployed world class airport planning  
and engineering expertise from within  
our North America business.
We expect to grow our operations in the 
region, both by extending our technical 
offering and by expanding geographically 
across North America. We are looking to 
expand our relationships with the US Air 
Force and the US Army Corps of Engineers 
(USACE); to position ourselves for private 
sector opportunities as we see increased 
activity in some regions; to expand 
regionally where well funded public 
markets exist; and to continue to grow  
in the energy, hospitality and water 
infrastructure markets.
In addition, our growth in the North 
American market will be supported  
by increasing the use of technical 
resources from across the Group.
Business drivers
Approximately 57% of our work currently 
comes from state and local government 
clients, with around a further 13% from 
federal contracts, providing a relatively 
stable underlying workload of repeat 
business. Our workload is therefore 
dependent on public sector funding, 
which remains under close political 
scrutiny and is subject to protracted 
negotiation within local and federal 
government, with consequent delays likely 
ahead of the US presidential elections.
The disaster response and emergency 
management aspects of our federal work 
arise as a consequence of natural disasters 
and emergencies and, as such, are 
unpredictable in nature and timing.
Operations
Consultancy
Highways and transportation
Our highways and transportation 
business, of around 1,150 staff, has had a 
good year and has achieved a number of 
successes. We have continued our work 
on the Florida turnpike toll system and 
have secured a new intelligent transport 
systems contract in Atlanta for trafﬁc 
operations/management centres.  
We continue as general engineering 
consultant for ﬁve Florida Department of 
Transport (FDOT) districts and for the state 
wide intelligent transportation system’s 
general consultant contract. We are also 
general engineering consultant to FDOT’s 
Florida Turnpike Enterprise, one of the 
nation’s top toll road organisations 
overseeing nearly 500 miles of toll roads.

Faithful+Gould
Our Faithful+Gould business continues  
to win work for public and private sector 
clients, providing project management 
and cost control services in a cost 
conscious market.
Peter Brown
Peter Brown’s new leadership team has 
worked hard to address a number of 
project issues previously reported, limiting 
the loss for the year to £1.1m. The 
business operates in a very competitive 
sector and we face challenges securing 
workload at acceptable margins.
Outlook
The outlook for North America is stable 
with a future order book of 59% of next 
year’s budgeted revenue (2011: 47%). 
However, continued uncertainty 
surrounding federal and local funding  
and the impact of the US presidential 
elections is causing a more cautious 
outlook, resulting in reduced market 
demand. In the medium term, the region’s 
need to address its ageing infrastructure 
remains a key driver for future growth  
in which we expect to participate as  
we broaden our service offering and 
geographic presence.
The National Transportation Bill remains 
held up through Congress, which has 
reduced the volume of work coming to 
market. We expect this to remain the case 
until after the presidential elections, but 
once the Bill is passed, the signiﬁcant 
backlog of infrastructure maintenance  
and upgrade work should begin  
to be addressed.
Design and engineering
Overall, our design and engineering 
business of around 700 staff performed  
in line with expectations. Recent key 
federal wins include new contracts with 
the Headquarters Air Combat Command, 
USACE Huntsville District and USACE 
Louisville District (jointly with 
Faithful+Gould).
Under a framework agreement with the 
National Park Service, Atkins continues  
to provide construction management, 
administration and oversight for safety 
upgrades and structural repairs to many  
of America’s most treasured national 
parks. We have recently been selected  
for projects at the Statue of Liberty, 
Castillo de San Marcos in St Augustine 
and Alcatraz Island’s famous  
penitentiary building.
Water and environment
We have been expanding our water and 
wastewater infrastructure expertise into 
the California and Arizona markets.  
We were recently selected by San Diego 
County and the City of Los Angeles, 
California, to provide wastewater  
services on an as needed basis. One of  
our signature projects, the Little Patuxent 
Water Reclamation Plant Addition No. 7 
project in Howard County, Maryland 
recently opened. This state of the art 
project is designed to protect water 
quality in Chesapeake Bay by removing 
excess nutrients and to meet new efﬂuent 
standards required for wastewater 
treatment plants discharging efﬂuent  
into the Bay. 
Our water and environment business of 
around 460 staff has had a challenging 
year, with a shortfall in workload in the 
second half of the year, which resulted  
in some restructuring. Currently, we are 
providing ﬂoodplain mapping and related 
technical services for approximately one 
third of the US with over 100 employees 
supporting the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA). We 
continue to make progress in the energy 
market, providing environmental and 
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) 
services in shale gas and offshore wind 
farms, as well as feasibility and routing 
studies for gas and electric transmission 
lines. Our water resources staff and 
environmental scientists are pre-
positioning for the upcoming  
$230bn Texas water market.
International
There has been no change in the view 
taken by management regarding the 
longstanding matter self reported by PBSJ 
in 2009 to the Department of Justice and 
the Securities and Exchange Commission 
that predates the acquisition by Atkins 
and relates to potential Foreign Corrupt 
Practices Act violations (see note 37).  
We are not able to estimate the extent,  
if any, of penalties that might be assessed 
and so have not, therefore, made 
provision for any penalties. The 
investigation by the government 
authorities continues.

Performance
The Middle East region had a good year, 
with 22% revenue growth and headcount 
up by more than 400 on the same time 
last year to 1,972 (2011: 1,555). We 
reported an operating margin of 9.8%, 
which is slightly down from last year’s 
underlying margin after removing 
exceptional debt recoveries of around 
£8m in the year ended 31 March 2011. 
We have demonstrated good progress 
against our strategy of sector and 
geographic diversiﬁcation with some 
exciting and challenging projects,  
drawing on multidisciplinary expertise 
from across the Group.
Business model
We have an established presence in  
seven Gulf locations, through which we 
deliver our multidisciplinary design and 
engineering consultancy services. We 
continue to expand our services in the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), where 
our permanent establishment and local 
partnership allow us to deliver signiﬁcant 
resources and expertise to the Kingdom  
to meet the demand for our services.  
This adds to our well established 
businesses in Abu Dhabi, Dubai,  
Qatar, the Sultanate of Oman,  
Bahrain, India and Kuwait. 
Strategy
Our strategy in the Middle East continues 
to be one of sector diversiﬁcation and 
geographic expansion as we develop  
a multidisciplinary business across the 
region. This strategy focuses on serving 
the broad infrastructure market, by 
securing work in rail, urban development, 
property, defence, airports and 
programme and cost management.  
In addition, local resources support  
our Energy business in the region.
Business drivers
The economic climate in the Middle East  
is primarily driven by the global price of 
oil, which affects demand for our services 
since regional spending ultimately ﬂows 
through to infrastructure, where there is  
a clear view of well funded programmes. 
Additionally, the longer term need to 
develop infrastructure for growing 
economies and populations will drive 
demand for our services. Events such  
as the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar  
also create localised opportunities.
Operations
We have a well balanced workload  
across the region following our expansion 
in Qatar, having secured government 
contracts advising on infrastructure 
planning and design projects to meet 
Qatar’s ambitious 2030 vision and to 
support the 2022 FIFA World Cup.
In KSA we are completing the design of 
the King Abdulaziz International Airport  
in Jeddah, where we are the lead designer 
and programme manager for this 
challenging new 30 million passenger  
per annum terminal, as well as associated 
buildings and infrastructure. This project  
is an excellent example of how technical 
expertise from around the Group has 
been leveraged to support a large and 
complex design project. Also in KSA we 
are progressing the design and supervision 
of the Makkah Metro, where there are 
good opportunities for additional work. 
This adds to our portfolio of successful rail 
design projects in the region, including 
the concept design of the 1,300km Etihad 
Rail project in the United Arab Emirates, 
the Dubai Metro, where the Green line 
was opened in September 2011, Lusail 
Light Rail in Qatar, the Kuwait Metro  
and support for India’s Kolkata Metro.

We have a good order book and are 
looking conﬁdently towards the future  
in this region. We will need to manage  
the ebb and ﬂow of major projects  
where timing remains unpredictable  
and resource planning challenging,

Performance
Overall this segment has performed well, 
increasing turnover by 5% as the business 
has beneﬁted from the improved quality, 
diversity and proﬁle of our service 
offering. Nevertheless, despite our 
operating margins having improved from 
5% at the half year, proﬁt and margin are 
lower year on year, reﬂecting continued 
difﬁcult trading conditions in parts  
of Europe.
Our businesses in Asia Paciﬁc and 
Scandinavia are performing well and 
continue to grow, but operations in 
Ireland and Portugal, with a combined 
staff of 90, continue to struggle due  
to general economic conditions and 
government austerity measures.
Business model
We operate through a network of ofﬁces 
in Asia Paciﬁc and Europe. The segment 
comprises our design and engineering 
consultancy and Faithful+Gould 
businesses in Hong Kong, mainland  
China and Singapore, together with  
six countries across Europe: Denmark, 
Ireland, Norway, Poland, Portugal  
and Sweden.
Strategy
In China, we continue to invest in order  
to take advantage of opportunities as the 
market opens up, recognising that it could 
be several years before material growth  
is achieved. We have focused on the 
development of our architectural and 
urban masterplanning businesses, 
applying world class design and planning 
talent to take advantage of the market 
potential. Our architectural design 
capability, which we strengthened last 
year, has improved our service offering 
and this, coupled with our Hong Kong 
infrastructure design skills, provide added 
value to our customers.
In Hong Kong, we have been building on 
our core competencies of rail design work 
(notably for MTRC) and civil, highway and 
bridge engineering by broadening our 
service offering and applying Group skills 
to our local client base of government 
agencies, contractors and private sector 
developers. This is creating a greater 
platform for further revenue and  
margin growth.
We continue to develop our core 
Scandinavian businesses, broadening  
the services we offer through organic 
growth and targeted acquisitions.
In Poland, we remain focused  
on environmental services for the  
transport and energy markets.
Business drivers
The two regions in this operating segment 
are at different stages of the economic 
cycle. Asia Paciﬁc, and more speciﬁcally 
China, is growing – albeit at a reducing 
rate of late – and investment in public  
and private sector infrastructure  
is giving us good growth potential.
In a number of areas of Europe, especially 
Scandinavia, investment is also underway 
in critical infrastructure in both the public 
and private sectors, providing good 
growth potential. However, government 
austerity measures in Ireland and Portugal 
are reducing the available work in these 
markets, which is having an impact on 
future opportunities and increasing  
pricing pressure.
Operations
Asia Paciﬁc
In the Asia Paciﬁc region we have  
1,233 staff (2011: 1,217). Our Chinese 
business continues to improve margins 
and has a strong order book, particularly 
in Hong Kong where the market remains 
buoyant and our design work for MTRC  
is progressing well. Our order book has 
been further increased from the reported 
ﬁgure by the recent award of a £7m 
design consultancy contract for the  
Hong Kong Link Road.

We continue to invest in building quality 
resources in mainland China, where we 
operate out of three primary locations, 
focusing on the development of our 
architectural and urban masterplanning 
businesses. Our growing capability and 
reputation have been recognised and we 
have secured increasingly sizeable and 
complex projects with better quality 
earnings. Excellent examples of this are 
our ongoing design work on the 200 
metre high headquarters tower for the 
Bank of China and our success with  
the MIPIM Asia Gold award for the 
Intercontinental Shimao Quarry hotel.
Faithful+Gould, which has 156  
(2011: 150) staff in the Asia Paciﬁc region, 
is seeing stable pharmaceutical and oil 
and gas sector work, with additional 
opportunities in the industrial and 
property sectors.
Europe
We have approximately 580 (2011: 550) 
staff in our Scandinavian businesses, 
which are performing well. We continue 
to broaden our service offering to 
capitalise on critical public and private 
sector infrastructure investment.  
An example of this is the award by Rail 
Net Denmark, as part of a consortium 
with Vössing, EKJ consulting engineers 
and Sweco, to design the ﬁrst phase of 
Denmark’s high speed enabled rail line. 
This ﬂagship project is the ﬁrst Danish  
line designed for high speed operation. 
We are progressing well with Denmark’s 
European Rail Trafﬁc Management System 
project (ERTMS), a signiﬁcant resignalling 
design contract extending over 15 years 
and we continue to work on the 
preliminary studies and design work for 
several new and existing bridge structures 
as part of a widening programme on 
Denmark’s Køge Bay motorway.
In Poland, we continue work as the 
owner’s engineer for the Polish liqueﬁed 
natural gas (LNG) project.
Outlook
Overall, the outlook for this segment 
remains good. There are good prospects 
for our rail design and infrastructure 
businesses in Hong Kong. While GDP 
growth forecasts for mainland China 
suggest some slowing, there remains 
strong demand for urban planning  
and architectural design services.  
Our Scandinavian businesses continue  
to grow steadily, although our other 
European businesses face challenging 
market conditions.
We have secured work in hand of 50%  
of budgeted revenue (2011: 53%),  
which provides a good platform for 
continued growth.

Performance
Our Energy business continues to perform 
well, with revenue and proﬁt up more 
than 30% year on year, operating at  
a margin of 8.9%. The margin reﬂects 
ongoing investment in the strategic 
growth of this sector through  
acquisitions and joint ventures. 
In June 2011 we acquired Pöyry’s 130 
people strong oil and gas business for  
a cash consideration of £15.0m and we 
are delighted with its performance and 
integration. 
Business model
The Energy business operates worldwide 
in several home markets, competing both 
in its own right and through several joint 
ventures, against a wide range of 
competition from large multinational 
engineering consultancies to specialist 
niche players.
Strategy
We remain focused on nuclear, oil and 
gas, conventional power generation and 
renewables. In these industries we are 
applying our high end engineering skills to 
assure the integrity of existing operational 
facilities and design new facilities.
We continue to look at investment 
opportunities, selectively extending our 
geographic footprint and service offering 
through organic growth, partnering 
arrangements and targeted acquisitions.
Successful integration of the Pöyry  
teams, the resulting enhanced geographic 
footprint and the ability to deliver process 
led multidisciplinary projects have all 
helped us to secure signiﬁcant framework 
contracts in the Middle East, Norway and 
the UK.
In February we extended our strategic 
nuclear alliance, n.triple.a, with French 
engineering consultancy Assystem,  
to support EDF’s nuclear new build 
programme in the UK.
Business drivers
Our business in the energy market is 
underpinned by the requirements of  
a sector that is dealing with increasing 
demand in areas of high population  
and income growth, dwindling  
natural resources and an imperative  
to decarbonise.
High oil prices drive demand to keep 
existing facilities operating longer, 
drawing on our safety and integrity 
services. At the same time, with the 
industry seeking to maximise more 
challenging reserves, such as marginal  
and deepwater ﬁelds, there is a continued 
increase in demand for our advanced 
engineering skills.
In nuclear we continue to see a similar 
focus on keeping existing facilities 
operating safely for longer, with an 
ongoing requirement for technical support 
around nuclear decommissioning. In 
addition, many countries around the 
world are still planning new build of 
nuclear power plant as part of their long 
term solutions for decarbonisation, 
despite the Fukushima Daiichi power 
station incident. Our valuable nuclear  
skills are in high demand across the  
entire nuclear lifecycle. 
Across the whole of our Energy business, 
the limitation on growth is the availability 
of skills. We therefore continue to invest in 
our in house training academy, which this 
year welcomed more than 300 staff on  
to its courses. 
Operations 
Nuclear
Our nuclear business remains busy  
on existing nuclear generation and 
decommissioning work, continuing to 
build on its established base in the UK. 
We continue to support EDF Energy as  
a strategic partner, providing engineering, 
safety and environmental services on the 
existing UK ﬂeet as well as support  
to its Japanese Earthquake Response 
programme. 
Work won in the year includes the design 
contract for the proposed plant extension 
for Urenco’s largest plant in the UK, the 
technical advisor role for the United  
Arab Emirates’ peaceful nuclear energy 
programme and support for EDF’s  
nuclear new build programme in the UK.

Our role as architect engineer, as part  
of the Engage consortium, continues on 
the €3bn International Thermonuclear 
Experimental Reactor (ITER) programme  
in the south of France. ITER is the next 
step in a global research and development 
programme to harness nuclear fusion  
to generate electricity.
We have also continued our work across 
all the UK Magnox sites for the design of 
facilities for the retrieval and processing of 
solid intermediate level radioactive waste. 
Oil and gas
Our oil and gas business has experienced 
strong demand for its services within  
a buoyant sector. In addition to our 
existing major framework agreements 
with Chevron, BP, Shell and Talisman,  
we have added Nexen, Statoil and Maersk 
as clients, and strengthened relationships 
with Apache and Premier Oil. 
Our work on liqueﬁed natural gas (LNG) 
projects in Singapore and Poland 
continues with the addition in the year  
of work on Australia’s largest LNG 
development, Ichthys, through the Pöyry 
acquisition, as well as a two year design 
contract of an onshore gas processing 
plant for Block 60 in the Sultanate of 
Oman. We are also leading on safety  
for a major operator who is pioneering 
ﬂoating LNG (FLNG), which positions  
us well for further opportunities in the 
developing FLNG market.
A signiﬁcant part of our design focus  
has been on difﬁcult or marginal ﬁeld 
developments, where our strong technical 
skills have supported the development  
of new concepts in ﬂoating production, 
storage and ofﬂoading facilities. Allied  
to this, we successfully completed the 
subsea front end engineering design for 
the Chevron Alder high pressure, high 
temperature (HPHT) ﬁeld and recently 
won a similar study for the HPHT  
Culzean development for Maersk.
Power
Our power business remains busy 
following the successful integration of the 
Technical Services Scotland consultancy 
acquired in the last ﬁnancial year. This has 
led to signiﬁcant expansion in our client 
base – for example, becoming lead 
technical provider to both Drax and 
Eggborough, and an increasing role  
in biomass projects.
In addition, our ﬁve year contract renewal 
to play a key role in National Grid’s 
complex construction programme  
further strengthens our position  
in the UK energy sector.
Renewables
We have continued to build on our 
previous successes in the offshore 
renewables sector by securing 
multidisciplinary technical support 
frameworks with Forewind, E.ON and 
RWE on developments across the UK,  
as well as individual contracts with  
Dong Energy on its portfolio of projects 
across Northern Europe. These contracts 
are in addition to design commissions 
undertaken on meteorological mast, wind 
turbine generator and offshore substation 
structures for developers, vendors, 
fabricators and installation contractors. 
We continue to provide expert 
engineering design advice as part of  
the high proﬁle Beatrice Offshore Wind 
Alliance supporting Scottish and Southern 
Energy plc in its drive to boost marine 
renewable energy provision.
Outlook
The outlook for our Energy business 
remains very good: we are well positioned 
in growth markets and have work in hand 
ahead of last year at 32% (2011: 28%).

Cash contributions of £26.0m 
(2011: £32.0m) were made to the Plan 
during the year. Under the latest agreed 
recovery plan the Group will contribute 
£26m in the year ending 31 March 2013 
and £32m for the following seven years 
ending 31 March 2020.
Charges
The Group accounts for pension costs 
under IAS 19, Employee beneﬁts.  
The total credit to the income statement  
in respect of deﬁned beneﬁt schemes  
was £19.1m (2011: charge of £20.4m), 
comprising service cost of £3.3m 
(2011: £5.7m), curtailment and settlement 
gains of £33.3m (2011: £nil) and a net 
ﬁnance cost of £10.9m (2011: £14.7m).  
The charge relating to deﬁned 
contribution schemes decreased  
to £31.0m (2011: £32.1m).
IAS 19 valuation and accounting 
treatment
The Group determines pension scheme 
funding with reference to actuarial 
valuations, but for reporting purposes 
uses IAS 19. Under IAS 19 the Group 
recognised a reduced retirement beneﬁt 
liability of £251.1m at 31 March 2012 
(2011: £337.8m) due to the impact of the 
one-off pension events described above, 
coupled with a strong asset performance.
The assumptions used in the IAS 19 
valuation are detailed in note 31 to the 
Financial Statements (pages 140 to 147).
Future changes to accounting 
standards
On 16 June 2011 the International 
Accounting Standards Board published  
a revised version of IAS 19 effective for 
reporting periods starting on or after  
1 January 2013. The standard will be 
applied to the Group Financial Statements 
for the ﬁrst time for the year ending  
31 March 2014 and will require the 
comparatives for the year ending  
31 March 2013 to be restated.
Performance summary
Turnover grew by 9% to £1,711.1m 
(2011: £1,564.3m). Reported proﬁt  
before tax was £135.5m (2011: £91.0m), 
with the beneﬁt of £30.9m from pension 
gains arising from steps taken to actively 
manage our pension liabilities and  
£7.2m proﬁt generated from the sale  
in November 2011 of our UK asset 
management business. Excluding these 
beneﬁts, together with amortisation  
of intangible assets on acquisition of 
£4.2m (2011: £3.7m), gives a more 
representative underlying proﬁt before  
tax of £101.6m (2011: £102.7m). 
Reported operating proﬁt was  
£137.2m (2011: £107.0m), at a margin  
of 8.0% (2011: 6.8%). The year on year 
increase in margin was primarily due  
to the one off pension gains referred  
to above. Adjusting for the effect  
of this, together with amortisation  
of intangible assets on acquisition  
of £4.2m (2011: £3.7m), provides  
a better view of the Group’s underlying 
performance, showing operating  
proﬁt of £110.5m (2011: £118.7m)  
and a margin of 6.5% (2011: 7.6%). 
Net ﬁnance cost
Net ﬁnance cost was £10.8m  
(2011: £14.1m). The year on year 
reduction was primarily the result 
of a reduction in net pension interest.
Taxation
The Group’s income tax expense for  
the year was £28.7m (2011: £18.4m), 
giving an effective tax rate of 21.2% 
(2011: 20.2%). The Group’s normalised 
effective tax rate was 22.0% 
(2011: 21.0%). This rate is lower  
than the UK statutory rate (26%) due 
to continued beneﬁts from research  
and development (R&D) tax credits,  
the utilisation of losses not previously 
recognised for tax and the impact  
of prior year adjustments.
The Group’s tax position will continue  
to be driven by our regional proﬁle of 
proﬁts and the beneﬁt of R&D tax credits.
Earnings per share (EPS)
Basic EPS from continuing operations was 
109.0p (2011: 74.3p). Normalised diluted 
EPS on continuing operations was 79.0p 
(2011: 75.0p), an increase of 5.3%.
Pensions 
Funding
During the year the Group’s principal UK 
employing company commenced a 
consultation process with those of its 
employees who are members of the 
Atkins Pension Plan (the Plan) relating  
to a proposal to remove the link between 
an employees’ accrued pension and future 
increases in salary. On 1 February 2012, 
following the completion of the 
consultation process, the link was 
removed. The resultant reduction in the 
past service liability of £30.9m has been 
recognised as an exceptional curtailment 
gain in the year ended 31 March 2012. 
In addition, and primarily to reduce  
the future volatility of any deﬁcit, the 
Group’s principal UK employing company 
undertook an enhanced transfer value 
(ETV) exercise for deferred members of 
the Plan. Notwithstanding this objective, 
the exercise resulted in a slight reduction 
in the deﬁcit of £1.8m, offset by costs of 
£1.8m incurred in relation to the exercise.
As a result of the sale of the UK asset 
management business during the year, 
certain active members left the building 
management section of the Plan on  
30 November 2011. The individuals retain 
their past service accrued beneﬁts in the 
Plan. However, as the link to future salary 
increases for these members was broken 
upon the sale, there was a reduction in 
past service liability. This reduction of 
£0.6m resulted in a curtailment gain  
being recognised in the year ended  
31 March 2012.

operations. The main purpose of these 
ﬁnancial instruments is to ﬁnance the 
Group’s activities. The Group also enters 
into derivative transactions, principally 
forward foreign currency contracts in 
order to manage foreign exchange risk  
on material commercial transactions 
undertaken in currencies other than  
the local functional currency. 
The main risks arising from the Group’s 
ﬁnancial instruments are market risk 
(including foreign exchange risk, interest 
rate risk and price risk), credit risk and 
liquidity risk, along with other risks arising 
from the ﬁnancing of the Group’s 
activities in the Public Private Partnership 
(PPP) and Private Finance Initiative (PFI) 
sectors. The Group’s exposures to and 
management of each of the main risks, 
together with sensitivities and risk 
concentrations, are described in more 
detail in note 2 to the Financial 
Statements.
The most signiﬁcant impact for the Group 
is the introduction of net interest on the 
net deﬁned beneﬁt liability, removing the 
expected return on assets and instead 
applying the discount rate to the plan 
assets as well as to the plan liabilities.  
Had the standard been applied to next 
year’s ﬁnancial statements the combined 
estimated net ﬁnance cost for the Group’s 
deﬁned beneﬁt schemes would increase 
from approximately £10m to £15m as a 
result of the reduction in the expected 
rate of return on plan assets.

of pension curtailment and settlement 
gains totalling £33.3m, along with the 
proﬁt on disposal of the UK asset 
management business of £7.2m.  
During the year to 31 March 2011 the 
Group charged the income statement  
with £6.5m for the impairment of loan  
notes receivable.
Net tax paid amounted to £11.0m  
(2011: £12.3m).
Net capital expenditure in the year, 
including the purchase of computer 
software licences, amounted to £19.2m 
(2011: £11.6m). The year on year increase 
was due to the full year effect of our  
US acquisition, increased purchases of 
equipment to support the highways  
and transportation operational services 
business, and a reduction in proceeds  
on sale of assets no longer required  
by the Group. 38 Reviews

Contract accounting
The value of contract work in progress 
comprises the costs incurred on contracts 
plus an appropriate proportion of 
overheads and attributable proﬁt. Fees 
invoiced on account are deducted from 
the value of work in progress and the 
balance is separately disclosed in trade 
and other receivables as amounts 
recoverable on contracts, unless such fees 
exceed the value of the work in progress 
on any contract when the excess is 
separately disclosed in trade and other 
payables as fees invoiced in advance.
Revenue is recognised on the majority  
of the Group’s contracts on a percentage 
completion basis when the outcome  
of a contract or project can be reasonably 
foreseen. Under the percentage 
completion method, the percentage of 
the total forecast revenue reported at any 
point in time is calculated based upon the 
proportion of total costs incurred to date 
as a percentage of total forecast costs or, 
in some cases, based upon the estimated 
physical percent complete of the total 
work to be performed under the contract.
In some cases, a margin provision is then 
made, depending on how far progressed 
each project is and the risk proﬁle of the 
project. Where contracts span two or 
more accounting periods, proﬁt is not 
generally recognised until the contract  
is 50% complete. In addition, provision  
is made in full for estimated losses and, 
where the outcome of a contract cannot 
be reasonably foreseen, proﬁt is taken  
on completion.
The Group funds its ongoing activities 
through cash generated from its 
operations and, where necessary,  
external borrowings and ﬁnance leases. 
The Group’s debt facilities are described  
in note 28 to the Financial Statements  
(pages 138 and 139). Utilisation of the 
Group’s facilities is a consequence of prior 
year acquisitions. As at 31 March 2012  
the Group had £35.4m of undrawn 
committed borrowing facilities available  
(2011: £88.8m).
Post balance sheet events 
After the balance sheet date, but  
before the date of signing these  
Financial Statements, the Group raised 
US$75m (£46.7m) through the successful 
execution of its debut issue in the US 
private placement market. The proceeds 
are intended to be used to repay drawn 
funds under the Group’s existing  
banking facilities and for general 
corporate purposes.
On 4 May 2012 the Group completed  
the sale of its minority interest in RMPA 
Holdings Limited (which delivered the 
Colchester Garrison PFI project). The 
investment has been disclosed as an asset 
held for sale in these Financial Statements 
and further information regarding the 
transaction is provided in note 10.
There have been no signiﬁcant changes  
to the Group’s treasury policies during  
the year.
Critical accounting policies
The Group’s principal accounting policies 
are described in note 1 to the Financial 
Statements (pages 102 to 111). The 
Financial Statements for the year ended  
31 March 2012 have been prepared  
under International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU.
The preparation of Financial Statements  
in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles requires the use of 
estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
at the date of the Financial Statements 
and the reported amounts of revenues 
and expenses during the reporting period. 
Although these estimates are based on 
management’s best knowledge of the 
amount, event or actions, actual results 
ultimately may differ from those 
estimates. Material estimates applied 
across the Group’s businesses and joint 
ventures are reviewed to a common 
standard and adjusted where appropriate 
to ensure that consistent treatment  
of similar and related issues that  
require judgement is achieved upon 
consolidation. Any revisions to estimates 
are recognised prospectively.
The accounting policies and areas that 
require the most signiﬁcant estimates and 
judgements to be used in the preparation 
of the Financial Statements are in relation 
to contract accounting, including 
recoverability of receivables, goodwill 
impairment and deﬁned beneﬁt  
pension schemes.

Revenue recognition on outsourcing 
contracts is determined by reference  
to the proportion of the annual service 
delivered to date. Where the costs of 
obligations in relation to the non renewal 
or termination of a contract are higher  
in the ﬁnal period of the contract, a 
proportion of revenue is deferred each 
period to meet these anticipated costs. 
Full provision is made for losses on 
outsourcing contracts if the forecast  
costs of fulﬁlling the contract throughout 
the contract period exceed the forecast 
income receivable. In assessing the 
amount of the loss to provide on an 
outsourcing contract, account is taken  
of the Group’s share of the forecast  
results from any joint ventures which  
the contract is servicing.
The projected outcome of any given 
project is necessarily based on estimates  
of revenues and costs to completion. 
Whilst the assumptions made are based  
on professional judgements, subsequent 
events may mean that estimates calculated 
prove to be inaccurate, with a consequent 
effect on the reporting of results.
Deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes
Accounting for pensions involves 
judgement about uncertain events in  
the future such as inﬂation, salary levels  
at retirement, longevity rates, rates of 
return on plan assets and discount rates. 
Assumptions in respect of pensions and 
post retirement beneﬁts are set after 
consultation with independent qualiﬁed 
actuaries. Management believes the 
assumptions are appropriate. However,  
a change in the assumptions used would 
have an impact on the Group’s results and 
net assets. Any differences between the 
assumptions and the actual outcome will 
affect results in future years. An estimate 
of the sensitivity to changes in key 
assumptions is disclosed in note 31 to the 
Financial Statements (pages 140 to 147).
Goodwill impairment
Goodwill is stated at cost less impairment. 
Prior to 1 April 2004, goodwill was 
amortised over its estimated useful 
economic life. Amortisation ceased on  
1 April 2004 and the carrying value of 
existing goodwill was frozen at that date 
and subject to annual impairment review.
On acquisition of a business, fair values 
are attributed to the assets, liabilities  
and contingent liabilities of the acquired 
business at the date of acquisition. 
Goodwill arises when the fair value of the 
consideration given for a business exceeds 
the fair value of the identiﬁable net assets. 
In accordance with IFRS 3, Business 
combinations, goodwill arising on 
acquisitions is capitalised and is subject  
to impairment review both annually  
and when there are indications that the 
carrying value may not be recoverable. 
The carrying value of goodwill is 
compared to the recoverable amount, 
which is the higher of value in use and the 
fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment 
is recognised immediately as an expense 
and is not subsequently reversed. Gains 
and losses on the disposal of an entity 
include the carrying amount of goodwill 
relating to the entity sold.
For the purpose of impairment testing, 
goodwill acquired in a business acquisition 
is allocated to each of the Cash 
Generating Units (CGUs), or groups  
of CGUs, that is expected to beneﬁt  
from the synergies of the combination. 
Each unit or group of units to which the 
goodwill is allocated represents the lowest 
level within the entity at which the 
goodwill is monitored for internal 
management purposes. Goodwill is 
monitored at the operating segment level.  WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2012

Principal risks and uncertainties  Reviews 41
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2012
Reviews
It is intended that these principles  
be adopted throughout the Group, 
without exception, to achieve progressive 
improvement in the effectiveness of risk 
management processes. 
We have a number of potential risks and 
uncertainties which could have a material 
impact on our long term performance. 
Many of these risks are common to  
other companies and we assess them  
to establish the principal risks for the 
Group. The following table outlines  
these principal risks and the mitigating 
activities. We assess them under two main 
categories of strategic and operational. 
Effective risk management is embedded  
in our governance framework, which is 
explained in the Corporate Governance 
Report (pages 64 to 72).
The Group risk committee, chaired  
by the chief executive ofﬁcer, oversees  
the operation of the Group’s risk 
management framework and provides 
support to the Board and the  
Audit Committee.
This framework supports the systematic 
identiﬁcation, assessment and 
management of risk at all levels,  
and seeks to ensure that:
 the public, employees and the 
environment are safe from potential 
hazards inherent in our operations
 the potential for damage to our 
corporate reputation, or ﬁnancial loss  
to shareholders and other stakeholders,  
is minimised.
The Board believes that for risk 
management to be successful, it must 
integrate the framework into all activities 
and develop a culture within the 
organisation that ensures:
 the management of risk is clearly driven 
from business strategy and objectives 
 group functions assist management  
in setting minimum standards across  
the Group
 the ownership and management of risk 
is not just the exclusive responsibility  
of senior management, but is passed 
down to appropriate staff members
 all signiﬁcant risks have mitigating 
strategies and action owners  
are identiﬁed
 operational risks are fully articulated  
and subject to regular review across  
the organisation as part of our normal 
management process 
 we operate in a culture that encourages 
disclosure of issues or concerns, so that 
timely and appropriate action can be 
agreed and implemented as necessary. 42 Reviews

Economic outlook
Continuing and increased government 
austerity measures impact our trading 
performance as spending on public sector 
infrastructure is reduced.
Worsening economic conditions lead to 
reduced levels of private sector infrastructure 
spend and adversely impact our clients’  
ability to pay for our services.
We have increased our sector and geographic 
diversiﬁcation to provide resilience at a time 
when many of our markets still experience 
uncertainty. We have a clear strategic priority 
to focus on sectors which have attractive 
growth prospects with good levels of funding.
We actively seek to redeploy staff around the 
Group to meet demand in growth markets 
and sectors, frequently moving work to  
people and people to work.
We perform client credit checks and maintain 
regular management reviews of credit terms, 
debt and work in progress.
We have already reshaped our business  
to achieve more than 50% of our revenue 
outside the UK. Our medium term goal  
is to generate more than 75% of revenue 
from our non UK and Energy businesses.
We have added resilience to our UK  
business through its ongoing support  
for overseas projects. 
 
 
 
 
Financial 
The deterioration of the Group’s ﬁnancial 
position limits our ability to invest in growth.
Adverse movements in liability assumptions  
or asset values result in a signiﬁcant increase 
in the Group’s deﬁned beneﬁt pension 
obligations increasing the cash funding 
required to repay the deﬁcit and  
reducing our ability to invest in further 
growth opportunities. 
We review the Group’s trading and funding 
position on an ongoing basis.
We have made good progress in implementing 
our strategy to continue to de-risk our deﬁned 
beneﬁt pension schemes. We will continue  
to actively manage the assets and liabilities  
of our pension schemes.
We have announced the successful execution 
of the Group’s debut issue in the US private 
placement market which has broadened the 
Group’s sources of funding to support  
future growth.
During the year we completed a consultation 
with members of the deﬁned beneﬁt section 
of the Atkins Pension Plan (the Plan) who  
had prior accrued rights that were revalued 
annually in line with changes in salary.  
As a result of the changes agreed with each 
member during the consultation process, 
these staff have become deferred members 
of the Plan.
We also undertook an enhanced transfer 
value exercise for deferred members  
of the Plan.
Geo-political
Political instability in the regions within which 
we operate negatively impacts our ability to 
deliver contractual services, receive payment 
and endangers the safety of our staff.
We have focused on geographies that have 
more stable trading environments.
We obtain the latest professional risk and 
security information before engaging in 
contracts in new geographies and continue  
to monitor the stability of the markets in 
which we trade.
Market
Worsening economic conditions lead to 
changes in contracts resulting in increased 
risk transfer from clients as competitors 
accept more onerous contract terms  
to win work. 
Reductions in the amount of available work 
increases pricing pressure and reduces our 
operating margins.
We have robust review procedures, which 
include peer reviews, during the bidding  
and contracting stage of our projects.
We have focused our strategy on sectors  
with strong growth prospects, good levels of 
funding and high technical barriers to entry.
We have a strategic focus on operational 
excellence.
We are driving operational performance 
across the Group to improve our margins.  
Our operational excellence programme, 
together with increasing use of our  
Bangalore operations, aim to deliver  
a competitive cost base.
 
 
Regulatory/Legal
Legislation and regulations restrict our ability 
to operate in certain locations or perform 
certain activities leading to the need to exit 
these markets.
Breaches of regulation or legislation  
result in ﬁnes, imprisonment and  
reputational damage.
We seek ongoing external advice as  
to new and/or changing trading restrictions, 
communicating these changes across  
our business. 
We continue to invest in staff training and 
communication.

Crisis event
A signiﬁcant one-off event affecting a key 
business location, project or employees  
could interrupt service delivery, threaten  
life and/or causes reputational damage  
to our business.
We have a robust Group crisis management 
plan in place to respond quickly to  
such events.
During the year we tested the robustness of 
our plan with a simulated incident involving 
our senior leadership.
Health, safety and environmental 
Shortcomings in our design or works’ 
supervision result in a health, safety or 
environmental incident involving staff,  
clients or other third parties leading to  
injury, loss of life and/or signiﬁcant damage 
to our reputation with all stakeholders.
Safety is part of our commitment to quality 
and reliability. Clear and explicit senior 
management leadership on health, safety  
and environmental matters is regularly 
reinforced via targeted campaigns. 
We have implemented our safety standards 
worldwide.
We mandate accident and near-miss reporting 
and provide a whistleblower hotline to enable 
staff to raise concerns conﬁdentially.
We continue to invest in staff training and 
communication about the importance of 
safety and security in the work place.
Our worldwide awareness programme,  
Safe by Choice, is just one example of our 
commitment to creating a leading health  
and safety culture.
Physical and data security
Conﬁdential client, business and personal 
data is mishandled resulting in breach  
of contract, the inappropriate release of 
commercially sensitive information or the  
loss of the personal information of our  
clients and/or employees.
Our business systems suffer an attack  
from hackers or viruses.
Political instability in the regions within  
which we operate threatens the safety  
of our employees.
We use appropriate physical security, secure 
networks and encryption to protect data. 
We train staff on best practice in information 
assurance.
The Group Security Ofﬁcer seeks to ensure 
best practice and raise the proﬁle of security 
across the business. 
During the year we launched a new 
information assurance training module  
for UK based staff.
Projects
Poor management of projects leads to client 
dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation  
for technical excellence and a deterioration  
in the Group’s ﬁnancial performance.
We have continued to augment our Business 
Management Systems by the introduction  
of a new online project management system 
to drive consistently high standards across  
the Group.
We invest in ongoing project management 
training for our staff.
We continue to improve project controls  
which include regular ﬁnancial reviews of 
project performance.
We have increased our investment in project 
management capabilities.
Staff recruitment and retention
Failure to attract and retain the most  
talented, motivated professionals in their 
respective ﬁelds makes us unable to deliver 
on clients’ expectations and respond  
to the most technically challenging and  
time critical projects thereby eroding  
our market share and damaging our  
ﬁnancial performance. 
Regular business reviews evaluate a number  
of metrics including headcount, retention, 
vacancy levels and employees engagement.
We are targeting an intake of over 500 
graduates in 2012, the largest in our history.
Engagement is essential in a people based

Overview
Making Atkins a great place to work  
is not just a desirable objective – it is 
central to our shareholder proposition.  
By providing an environment in which 
engineers, planners, architects and a 
myriad of related professionals ﬂourish, 
we support our clients both in meeting 
their current needs and in addressing 
tomorrow’s challenges. 
Achieving this goal relies on our ability  
to attract and retain the most talented, 
motivated professionals in their respective 
ﬁelds. To this end, people performance is 
an important element of Atkins’ business 
performance and is managed via a 
structured process of business reviews 
which evaluate metrics such as headcount, 
retention, vacancy levels and employee 
engagement alongside broader 
assessments of our future skill and  
resource needs to meet future client  
and market needs.
While the three years to 2011 witnessed 
signiﬁcant restructuring across the Group, 
2012 was largely a year of stability, during 
which we concentrated our efforts on 
supporting growth in our Middle East  
and Energy businesses alongside initiatives  
to support other businesses in meeting 
changing market conditions.
Headcount
Underlying headcount increased by  
approximately 600 people to 17,420  
after allowing for the divestment of our 
UK asset management business and the 
departure of some staff in April as a result 
of restructuring actions implemented  
at the end of the previous ﬁnancial year. 
This is an encouraging result, reﬂecting 
our view that the signiﬁcant headcount 
reductions of recent years are over.
Our main areas of growth were the 
Middle East (+25%), which beneﬁted 
from important contract wins in Qatar, 
and Energy (+19%), which experienced 
strong organic growth and beneﬁted  
from the Pöyry acquisition. These 
increases were partly offset by reductions 
in North America (-2.4%), as this region 
improved efﬁciency and underlying  
staff utilisation.
Vacancy levels continued to increase 
steadily throughout the year from  
around 1,100 at the start of the year  
to 1,850 at the end of March 2012, 
reﬂecting increased conﬁdence in  
many of our businesses. 
Recruitment performance was good, 
although there are a number of areas 
where competition for people remains 
high – notably Energy and aerospace.

Engagement
In a people based business, it is essential 
that we maintain regular and open 
communications with staff at all levels  
on information ranging from the Group’s 
strategy and performance through to 
changes in policy and process affecting 
their daily work. We achieve this through 
a variety of channels that include regular 
chief executive ofﬁcer letters to all staff, 
management brieﬁngs and the Group’s 
intranet. In particular, following the 
announcement of the Company’s full and 
half year results, we issue updates on the 
Company’s performance via our staff 
intranet, and online presentations from 
our chief executive ofﬁcer and Group 
ﬁnance director, which are also available 
in transcript form and as recorded 
telephone messages. The chief executive 
ofﬁcer and Group ﬁnance director also 
conduct pre- and post-results brieﬁng 
teleconferences with our worldwide 
management team. 
We ask Atkins people around the world to 
complete our annual Viewpoint employee 
engagement survey to help us understand 
their views on working for Atkins. 
This year we refreshed the survey with  
a new questionnaire to address the  
most important issues across the  
Group. We also launched the survey in 
September, rather than April, which has 
aligned it with our corporate calendar and 
ensured that staff in North America had 
been part of the Group for a full year  
by the time they took the survey.
Our UK recruitment team was voted 
’Recruitment Team of the Year‘ by 
Recruiter magazine for the second  
year running.
We are targeting a graduate intake of  
540 for 2012. This is a signiﬁcant increase 
on recent years, particularly in the UK 
where the graduate intake has increased 
by 50% to 325 and where we remain  
one of the biggest and most popular 
recruiters of newly graduated engineers.
We are seeking over 100 more new 
graduates in India and will also be 
recruiting graduates in North America,  
the Middle East and Asia. We have also 
increased our intake of apprentices, 
recognising that this is becoming an 
increasingly attractive entry route for 
young people. 
Retention
Staff turnover remains at a relatively low 
level in most regions, reﬂecting both 
market conditions and the appeal of 
Atkins as an employer. Turnover by  
region was:
Business area
2012
 Turnover
2011
 Turnover
UK 9.20% 8.53%
North America 8.70% 10.65%
Middle East 11.10% 13.87%
Asia Paciﬁc  
and Europe 17.50% 16.55%
Energy 16.80% 13.33%
Atkins 10.60% 10.40%
The reduction in Middle East turnover  
was encouraging, as this was set  
against a backdrop of improving market 
conditions. The increase in the UK reﬂects 
growing demand for staff in several areas, 
notably aerospace and water. Similarly, 
the increase in Energy reﬂects high 
demand for staff in oil and gas  
in the UK and North America.
We also monitor the stability of our 
workforce using an index which calculates 
the proportion of current employees  
with one or more years’ service as  
a proportion of the total workforce 
employed 12 months ago. This allows  
us to assess our performance in  
retaining more experienced employees. 
The stability index by region and for the 
Group was:
Business area 2012 2011
UK 85.0% 81.6%
North America 75.0% 84.8%
Middle East 79.3% 68.2%
Asia Paciﬁc  
and Europe 82.7% 77.8%
Energy 88.9% 90.1%
Atkins 80.1% 81.3%
Although the overall index has fallen 
slightly, an index of 80.1% represents 
good performance. 
In several regions of our business, we 
track feedback from colleagues who have 
left the Group via an online process which 
guarantees anonymity. Of those who 
completed a questionnaire, 87.6% said 
they would work for Atkins again and 
85.8% said they would recommend 
Atkins as a place to work.

Technical development remains at the 
heart of our learning and development 
strategy, accounting for over 60% of  
our training spend. We use our Technical 
Network Chairs continuously to drive 
excellence in key skill areas by capturing 
and promulgating best practice, and by 
encouraging cross-regional collaboration. 
This year our Network Chairs met in 
Bangalore for a three-day workshop  
to set the agenda for technical 
development across Atkins. A key  
output from this was the requirement  
for common design principles and core 
project delivery tenets that recognise the 
evolutionary stages of a design from 
concept to ﬁnal delivery.
Project management is a core capability  
in successfully delivering our clients’ 
engineering solutions. We continued  
to improve project management using 
Enterprise Advantage, our project 
management tool. A competency 
framework based on the Association  
of Project Managers’ (APM) framework 
has been launched, supported by a range 
of development tools, including an 
e-learning portal, to support our  
project managers’ development. 
This year’s survey also incorporated  
a new engagement model measuring  
our peoples’ alignment (relationship  
with management); involvement 
(relationship with their jobs); and loyalty 
(relationship with the organisation).
Our results showed that we are ahead  
of global sector averages on engagement 
(see scorecard below). Our overall 
employee engagement score is also  
ahead of the professional services sector 
benchmark: Atkins 64% positive,  
average 58% positive. 
The results provide very positive feedback 
that our people care about Atkins’ 
success, feel treated with fairness and 
respect, have the necessary knowledge  
to perform their roles and feel that we 
value the diversity of our people. 
The results also indicate where we need  
to improve to make Atkins an even better 
place to work. Over the next year we  
will take action to improve collaboration 
across our businesses and our approach  
to personal development and  
career planning.
 
We remain committed to fully discussing 
survey results in our teams to create an 
ongoing dialogue through which we can 
sustain our strengths and continuously 
improve our employee engagement.
On a less positive note, we were 
disappointed not to be ranked among  
The Sunday Times Top 25 Best Big 
Companies, something we have achieved 
for six of the last eight years. The 
feedback from this survey is being used 
alongside our Viewpoint results to focus 
our improvement actions.
Investment in people
Developing the skills and capabilities of 
our people is a strategic imperative for 
driving our performance and growth.
 
At £15m, this year’s Group training spend 
during the year was slightly up on 
previous years, reﬂecting heightened 
spend in key areas such as Energy. We 
also increased our investment in project 
management and leadership capabilities, 
which are critical in achieving our growth 
strategy; over 1,000 project managers  
and 2,000 line managers attended these 
development programmes.

of senior employees with those of 
shareholders. A discretionary bonus 
scheme covers the wider Atkins 
population; this year, we expect to pay  
a bonus to around one-third of staff, 
recognising individual contribution  
and performance. 
Good progress has been made in 
implementing the Group’s UK pension 
strategy. The objectives are to de-risk the 
deﬁned beneﬁt sections of the Atkins 
Pension Plan (the Plan) and the Atkins 
section of the Rail Pension Scheme whilst 
improving engagement for the members 
of the deﬁned contribution sections  
of the Plan.
In January we completed a consultation 
with approximately 1,300 members of  
the deﬁned beneﬁt section who had prior 
accrued rights under the Plan, which were 
revalued annually in line with changes  
in salary. As a result of the changes 
agreed with each member during the 
consultation process, these staff will now 
become deferred members of the Plan but 
will beneﬁt from revaluation in line with 
RPI subject to a cap of 5% per annum. 
They will also beneﬁt from transitional 
relief for a period of six years whilst they 
remain in employment with Atkins.
Concurrently, we reviewed how best  
to respond to the projected need to 
signiﬁcantly increase contributions for 
staff who are members of the Atkins 
section of the Rail Pension Scheme. 
Following consultation, proposals have 
been submitted to the Trustees to provide 
lower cost options for members of the 
Atkins section.
Signiﬁcant progress was also made in  
our people development and leadership 
programmes, with several of our business 
units launching bespoke people 
management programmes. We also 
redesigned our career development 
centres and senior management 
development programme to embed  
the leadership capabilities that will  
drive our growth strategy. 
We are improving the balance between 
classroom and online learning to provide 
an efﬁcient, engaging experience. Our 
North American virtual university delivered 
over 2,000 online courses this year, with 
investment planned for an online learning 
portal and online performance and 
development review process in 2012/13. 
Reward
Although some of our markets are 
experiencing higher levels of wage 
inﬂation than in recent years, we 
continued to exercise pay restraint across 
the Group. Salary increases were targeted 
to focus on promotion candidates, 
instances where individual salaries fell 
below market rates and regions and 
business units experiencing high market 
demand and associated salary inﬂation, 
for example China, India and our  
Energy business. 
An extensive remuneration benchmarking 
review was conducted across all our key 
talent markets – the UK, North America, 
the Middle East, Asia Paciﬁc and Europe –  
to ensure that we provide remuneration  
in line with our international markets.
We also conducted an extensive review  
of the remuneration framework for senior 
staff to provide a reward structure to 
attract high-calibre senior managers and 
reward them for delivering stretching 
growth objectives aligned with our 
strategy. Key elements include an 
increased element of bonus paid for 
meeting demanding personal objectives 
and restructured long-term share awards 
to reward long-term proﬁts and share 
price growth. These proposals will be 
subject to shareholder approval at the 
annual general meeting.
Employee share ownership is encouraged
to facilitate alignment of employee and
shareholder interests. In the UK,
employees are given the opportunity  
to become shareholders through the
Company’s Share Incentive Plan (SIP).
Approximately 12% of eligible employees
participate in the SIP. In addition, at its
annual general meeting in August, the
Company will be seeking approval of
further all-employee share plans with  
the potential for operation in countries 
where the Group has a signiﬁcant 
presence. Further details are provided  
in the Directors’ remuneration report 
(pages 73 to 93).
Approximately 1,000 senior leaders across 
the Group participate in our executive 
bonus scheme (EBS). This provides an 
incentive to deliver above-average results 
and rewards staff to the extent that their 
business and the Group meet stretching 
targets. Under the terms of the EBS they 
are required to defer one third of any 
bonus paid into a share award. This 
deferral further aligns the interests

Our UK deﬁned contribution membership 
includes almost 10,000 staff; in common 
with many large organisations we are 
concerned that the majority do not take 
an active interest in managing their 
retirement funds. We are working with 
the Trustee to rectify this by providing a 
better investment platform for managing 
their pensions, supported by an extensive 
communications programme.
In North America, we have been working 
with our insurers to mitigate signiﬁcant 
projected increases in the cost of medical 
insurance by offering the option of high 
deductible health plans, supported by 
health improvement programmes. These 
encourage employees to minimise health 
claims and share the costs and beneﬁts 
more equitably between the Company  
and employees. 
Diversity
The Group is committed to eliminating 
discrimination and encouraging diversity 
amongst its workforce. The aim is for the 
Group’s employees to be representative  
of all sections of society and for each 
employee to feel respected and able to 
give their best. The Group believes this 
supports the attraction and retention of 
the best people, improves effectiveness, 
promotes excellence in delivery and 
enhances the success of the Company.
Policies have been adopted to ensure  
this commitment is implemented from  
the point of recruitment and continues 
throughout an individual’s employment 
with the Group. Employees are provided 
with the opportunity to develop to their 
full potential regardless of sex, race,  
age, religion or belief, disability, sexual 
orientation, gender identity, marriage  
and civil partnership status, pregnancy, 
parental obligations and background, 
subject to the laws of the jurisdictions  
in which we work.
The Group encourages recruitment, 
training, career development and 
promotion on the basis of aptitude and 
ability, without regard to disability.  
It is also committed to retaining and 
retraining as necessary employees  
who become disabled during the  
course of their employment.
Focusing particularly on gender diversity, 
while we have seen some improvement at 
a senior level in recent years, with female 
representation of 22.2% at Board level 
and 15% within the senior leadership 
team, the proportions within the wider 
senior management population and the 
organisation as a whole remain largely 
unchanged at 11% and 27% respectively. 
This is despite signiﬁcant effort across  
the Group, where we have implemented 
regional action plans, including 
establishing women’s networks and 
participation by a number of women in a 
targeted career development programme.
This remains a concern, as we believe that 
Atkins will fail to realise its potential unless 
we are able to attract, retain and develop 
talented individuals from a broader range 
of backgrounds than we traditionally have.
We will continue to challenge our 
performance and make changes to 
improve the diversity of our business, 
particularly regarding gender and ethnicity.

This is an ongoing investigation

Regulatory activity 
Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA) issued two 
citations following its investigation into 
the fatality in 2010 at Houston Airport.  
In 2011 an appeal was upheld and OSHA 
voluntarily withdrew the citation related  
to a safety procedure for ensuring that 
dangerous machines are properly shut  
off and not started up again prior to  
the completion of maintenance or 
servicing work because Atkins was  
not in operational control of the site.  
Leadership vision 
“Nothing is more urgent, nor important, 
than safety in the workplace and on our 
project sites. Safety forms part of our 
commitment to quality and reliability.  
It is derived directly from the values  
of our Company. As we push to improve 
productivity and proﬁtability we should 
never forget that safety must come  
ﬁrst. The implementation of our safety 
standards is a leadership responsibility  
at all levels, worldwide and locally.  
I count on your support, so we can

in a safe and secure manner. It is our 
shared responsibility.”

Safety performance 
Comprehensive, transparent accident  
and near miss reporting is fundamental  
to our worldwide safety culture. 
Our accident incident rate (AIR) measures 
our peoples’ and our contractors’  
accident performance. Our peoples’  
AIR performance remains better than 
industry norms (cf HSE Labour Force 
Survey), with a decrease in major injury 
accidents and a slight increase in minor 
accidents. Similarly, contractor AIR 
performance achieved a decrease in major 
accidents, although there was an increase 
in minor accidents and a greater number  
of incidents and near misses. 
Raising awareness of the importance  
of recording unsafe behaviours has  
driven an increase in near miss reporting.  
We will intensify our efforts in 2012/13  
to improve our already strong 
performance in this area. 
There was an accident in Diego Garcia  
in 2011, when a ﬁshing boat was hit by  
a wave and capsized. The captain, who 
was employed by the Diego Garcia 21 
joint venture in which Atkins had a 24.5% 
equity stake, together with a member  
OSHA also adjusted the second citation, 
which had no relation to the accident  
(fall protection), to the lowest severity 
level, ‘other than serious’, and reduced 
the associated penalty from US$7,000  
to US$6,500.
Unrelated to the investigation of the 
fatality, there were further legal 
proceedings in 2011 regarding the  
three citations issued to PBSJ by OSHA 
following their visit in August/September 
2010. Two of the three citations were 
withdrawn by OSHA at the start of the 
hearing, but in a judicial decision the  
third citation was upheld as issued,  
with a severity level of ‘Serious’ and  
an associated penalty of US$6,300.

We continually reﬁne our behavioural 
safety model to reduce the number of 
accidents and injuries and to increase  
near miss reporting. Safe by Choice  
has a measurable impact when it is 
implemented: in one business unit,  
minor incidents fell by 50% while near 
miss reporting increased dramatically, 
indicating a greater awareness of safe  
and unsafe behaviours. 
Behavioural safety model
Our behavioural safety model is tripartite: 
safe by leadership, safe by design and safe 
by choice – with each element addressing 
different business risks.

Driver assessment programme
Driving remains a signiﬁcant risk for our 
business. Driver assessment and training 
was deployed in the UK and North 
America to reduce driving related risks 
and costs associated with accidents and 
vehicle damage. In North America this 
resulted in a 45% year on year reduction 
in moving vehicle accidents.
Industry involvement
Atkins in Denmark is represented on  
the Danish Association of Consulting 
Engineers’ health and safety committee. 
During the last year we have co-authored 
a publication on health and safety in 
construction management, chaired 
workshops and presented at a variety  
of industry events.

As part of ACKtiv Nuclear, a joint venture 
with Carillion and Jacobs, Atkins’ nuclear 
business won a RoSPA Gold Award for 
the continued safe delivery of nuclear 
projects to the highest standards.
The UK Environmental Agency awarded

time we have been honoured with the 
Safety Star Award; we also received this 
award in 2008 and 2010.
Behavioural programmes 
Our goal is for safety to become a natural

and foster an innate safety culture 
through three pathways: safe by choice, 
safe by design and safe by leadership.  
All are supported and developed through 
lessons learned from proactive work with

Excellence in delivery 
Business management system
Our business management system  
is being embedded throughout our  
UK operations, establishing common 
processes to improve performance.  
Work to harmonise business controls 
supporting technical delivery is ongoing.
Technical excellence – worldwide 
design principles
Our goal is for Atkins to be the world-
class design company. We must deliver 
world class design to be competitive and 
proﬁtable, adding superior value and 
outperforming the competition as we 
evolve to become the world’s best 
infrastructure consultancy.
World class design requires professionals 
with vision, creativity, intuition and 
technical ability working in a framework 
that systematises the design journey and 
processes, enabling our professionals to 
freely apply their creative abilities to meet 
and exceed client requirements. 
The most experienced designers in our 
organisation have developed universally 
accepted design principles to help us 
achieve our vision and support our drive 
for worldwide operational excellence.
Respect for the environment 
We maintain high levels of  
environmental stewardship.
Waste
We continued to halve our waste  
to landﬁll. In the UK our highways  
and transportation business recycled  
over 85% of its waste, representing  
a 5% year on year increase, while our 
Gloucestershire highways contract 
developed a cold mixing technique  
with reused coal mix tar, recycling 
approximately 8,000 tonnes of material 
and generating a potential client  
saving of over £1m in disposal costs. 
In Denmark, Sweden and Norway waste  
is used as fuel in district heating plants 
and is also recycled.
Water
Atkins in China actively reduces water 
waste by using sustainable drainage 
systems for client projects. The tourism 
consultancy and conceptual plan 
developed by our Shanghai ofﬁce  
for Swan Lake in Dongying, China  
is an example of eco friendly water  
reduction design.
Ecology and biodiversity
Atkins’ ecology experts run annual 
colleague seminars to raise awareness  
of biodiversity and ecological issues, 
ecological constraints and opportunities  
to increase project site biodiversity.  
Atkins recently created the ﬁrst estuary 
speciﬁc water quality goals for the Collier 
County Coastal Zone Management 
Department in south west Florida to 
protect the Clam Bay estuary’s water 
quality and natural resources. Our teams 
used a variety of scientiﬁc assessments  
to determine water quality. 
Performance
There was one reportable environmental 
incident in 2011/12: an oil leak from  
a hydraulic hose went into a UK river.  
The Environment Agency was notiﬁed

containing the oil. There were 12 other 
low level incidents, largely related to 
minor spills in the UK and North America. 
Safecall is a worldwide independent, 
conﬁdential telephone hotline, available  
to all Atkins people wherever they work.
Safecall received a report in May from  
an anonymous North American employee 
concerned about the use, storage  
and disposal of hazardous materials  
in the Atkins laboratory, Houston.  
The investigation found that hazardous 
materials were not being stored or 
disposed of correctly and did not meet 
current legal requirements, while the  
risks of using hazardous materials

 Atkins is a patron of RedR, an 
international disaster relief charity  
which trains aid workers and provides 
skilled professionals to humanitarian 
programmes worldwide, helping to save 
and rebuild the lives of people affected 
by natural and man made disasters.  
Our support includes raising and 
donating money and encouraging our 
employees to make themselves available

 Atkins also supports educational 
establishments around the world:  
for example we sponsor university 
programmes aimed at developing 
expertise like rail signalling at  
the KTH Royal Institute of  
Technology in Stockholm, Sweden.
These core project delivery tenets 
recognise the evolutionary stages of  
a design from concept through to  
ﬁnal delivery, targeting operational 
excellence, risk management, continuous 
improvement and customer focus –  
the drivers for Atkins’ industry  
leadership and success.
The Atkins design principles are now 
incorporated in the business management 
system as a directive, making them 
mandatory for all of our businesses  
and subject to audit, as are other parts  
of our business management system.
We continue to deliver award winning 
projects; for details please see our 
website: www.atkinsglobal.com/projects.

London 2012 sustainability 
achievements 
Our selection as provider to the London 
2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games 
demonstrates our people’s technical 
excellence, our ability to deliver world 
class infrastructure projects and our 
leadership position, creating prime 
opportunities to showcase our market-
leading sustainability strategy.
Our experience and commitment to 
sustainability are now being shared by 
partnering the UK-Green Building Council 
London 2012 Sustainability Lessons 
Learned series, part of the Olympic 
Delivery Authority’s London 2012  
Learning Legacy.
Community impact
Atkins has designed and overseen  
the installation of a new culvert that 
intercepts the overland ﬂood route, 
reducing the risk of ﬂooding for almost 
4,000 properties.
Sustainable sourcing
In May 2009 the Olympic Board agreed 
that London 2012 will employ and 
maintain a clear and consistent policy for 
mitigating the impacts of manufacture, 
supply, use and disposal of all materials for 
the London 2012 Games. As a signiﬁcant 
number of temporary facilities and 
materials (or ‘overlay’) will be required for 
London 2012 – more so than at previous 
Games – so the selection of the materials 
and components used to create overlay 
and where they go afterwards is crucial  
in respect of sustainability.
 In the US, we are promoting equal 
learning opportunities through targeted 
programmes and services delivered 
through Atkins’ STEM (science, 
technology, engineering and maths) 
Digital Learning Initiative, which is run  
in partnership with Learning Ally. 
Founded in 1948 as Recording for the 
Blind, Learning Ally serves more than 
300,000 primary and secondary school 
students, university and graduate 
students, veterans and lifelong learners 
who cannot read standard print due to 
blindness, visual impairment, dyslexia  
or other learning disabilities. Learning 
Ally – with support from Atkins – is 
creating as many as 200 STEM digital 
audio textbooks and promoting STEM 
educational achievement through 
continued advocacy, awareness and 
outreach activities
 Atkins in North America sponsored  
the Emerald Coast Regional Envirothon 
in Panama City, Florida. This event is 
associated with North America’s largest 
high school environmental education 
competition. Reaching more than 
500,000 students across North America 
annually, the Envirothon’s mission is  
to develop knowledgeable, skilled and 
dedicated citizens who are willing and 
prepared to work toward achieving 
balance between quality of life and 
environmental quality. Atkins  
employees helped students learn about 
environmental professions they might 
wish to pursue to help ensure that the 
Florida Panhandle continues to be a 
biologically diverse region
 Atkins in North America is active in  
the Future City competition, which is 
sponsored by the National Engineers 
Week Foundation, professional and 
technical societies and companies  
in the US. This programme is geared  
to students in grades 6 to 8 (aged 11  
to 14) who, with guidance from an 
educator and an engineer-mentor, 
compete against other teams as they 
plan cities, problem-solve and build 
models using recycled materials. 
Winning regional teams move on to 
participate in the national ﬁnals.  
Atkins’ support encourages students  
to consider engineering and technical 
career opportunities at regional and  
national levels.

Delivery excellence
Two wetland bridges link the east and 
west areas of the Olympic Park. Bridge 
design reﬂects the Olympic Delivery 
Authority’s objective of aligning high 
quality design with a consistent approach 
to sustainability, inclusivity and security. 
The permanent sections of the wetland 
bridges are designed to meet legacy 
requirements, while the temporary 
sections will support crowd ﬂow during 
the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic 
Games and be removed afterwards.  
The wetland bridges project is the  
highest scoring CEEQUAL project to date, 
achieving an Excellent (98.3%) Whole 
Project Award. CEEQUAL assessment of 
Atkins’ work on water, gas and electrical 
utilities also achieved an ‘Excellent’ rating 
score of 87.7%, signiﬁcantly above the 
CEEQUAL threshold of 75%.
Short term usage
In general, most sustainability assessments 
on materials tend to focus on permanent 
or long term use rather than short  
term use. However, as a temporary 
organisation the London Organising 
Committee of the Olympic Games and 
Paralympic Games (LOCOG) looks to 
minimise any spend which may present 
issues in respect of reuse and recycling.
Procurement framework 
Developed in collaboration with Atkins, 
the ‘Temporary Materials Handbook’ 
provides a framework on how to manage 
the sustainability impacts of materials 
selection in a temporary context. The 
Handbook has been developed for the 
procurement, design and engineering 
teams in LOCOG and other key partners 
and stakeholders for the Games.
Carbon 
Carbon reduction has been achieved by 
the reuse of materials across a wide range 
of projects. Our designers, engineers and 
specialists have worked to transform 
2.5km
2
 of derelict urban wasteland to 
create the Olympic Park for London 2012. 
During the design process, Atkins had  
a number of carbon tools at hand, 
supporting the teams in maximising the 
effectiveness of Carbon Critical Design.
Waste
When Atkins designed the Olympic Park 
soil was reused and waste minimised to 
ensure a positive ecological legacy. In 
addition, 4,000 smooth newts, 100 toads 
and 300 common lizards were relocated. 
We managed the demolition of over 200 
buildings and cleared over 1,300,000m
2
 
of land, with over 97% of the material 
being reclaimed, reused or recycled  
on site.
Ecology and biodiversity
Atkins prepared the Olympic Park site for 
construction work and created the 
ecology for the largest new urban park  
in the UK for a century, relocating 1km
2
  
of open land, wet woodlands, wetlands, 
reed beds and ponds. Our ecologists 
rescued local plants and wildlife ahead  
of the site clearance to ensure that local 
habitats were retained. There are a 
number of waterways on this 2.5km
2
 site. 
We developed a wetlands habitat at the 
core of North Park, which is a signiﬁcant 
area surrounded by open space and the 
hockey, basketball and velodrome venues.

challenges in the built and natural 
environment. The Companies Act 2006 
(the Act) and the UK Listing Authority’s 
Listing Rules and Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules (the LRs and DTRs 
respectively) require the directors to set 
out in the annual management report that

WC2A 3ED at 1100 on Wednesday  
1 August 2012. Details of the business  
to be considered at the AGM, together 
with an explanation of each of the 
resolutions, are set out in the separate 
Notice of Meeting.
Directors
The names and biographies of those 
persons serving as directors of the 
Company as at the date of this report  
are set out in this Annual Report  
(pages 58 and 59). Uwe Krueger was 
appointed as a director with effect from 
14 June 2011 and replaced Keith Clarke  
as chief executive ofﬁcer following  
his retirement from the position on  
31 July 2011. Rodney Slater was appointed 
as a non-executive director with effect 
from 9 September 2011. Sir Peter Williams 
retired as a non-executive director  
on 8 September 2011.
Under the Company’s articles of 
association all directors must retire at the 
ﬁrst AGM following their appointment by 
the Board and may offer themselves for 
election by shareholders. Rodney Slater, 
following his appointment by the Board  
as a director from 9 September 2011, will 
stand for election at the AGM. In line with 
the requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, which has applied to 
the Company since 1 April 2011, all other 
directors, will retire at the AGM and, 
being eligible, will offer themselves for 
re-election. The Board considers that the 
performance of each of the directors 
continues to be effective and that each of 
them demonstrates a strong commitment 
to their role.

ofﬁcers’ liability insurance cover in respect 
of legal actions brought against them. In 
addition, directors of the Company are 
indemniﬁed in accordance with article  
138 of the Company’s articles of 
association to the maximum extent 
permitted by law. Prior to the adoption of 
new articles of association by shareholders 
on 3 September 2008, all directors in 
appointment on that date had separate 
deeds of indemnity. These indemnities, 
which still remain in force, are available  
for inspection by shareholders at the 
Company’s registered ofﬁce during 
normal business hours and will be 
available for inspection at the AGM.
Neither the insurance nor the indemnities 
provide cover where the relevant director 
or ofﬁcer has acted fraudulently  
or dishonestly.
Articles of association
The Company’s articles of association  
set out the Company’s internal regulation 
and cover such matters as the rights  
of shareholders, the appointment and 
removal of directors, the power to issue 
and buy back shares and the conduct of 
the Board and general meetings. A copy 
of the Company’s articles of association  
is available on the Group’s website:

request from the company secretary. 
Amendments to the articles of association

the Company’s articles of association and 
any directions given by a special resolution 
of the shareholders, the Board of directors

ﬁt. Details of the main committees of the 
Board are contained in the Corporate 
Governance Report (pages 64 to 72).

Governance
Research and development
The Group develops and delivers 
innovative technical solutions to its clients, 
the costs of which are expensed to the 
income statement. The Group obtains 
enhanced tax relief for these costs in 
certain territories.
Suppliers
The Group’s policy is to agree terms and 
conditions for its business transactions 
with suppliers and to endeavour to abide 
by these terms and conditions, subject  
to the supplier meeting its obligations.
No one supplier arrangement is 
considered to be essential to the business 
of the Group.
The Company, as a holding company,  
did not have any amounts owing  
to trade creditors as at 31 March 2012.
Political donations and expenditure
The Group made no political donations 
and incurred no political expenditure  
in the UK or European Union during  
the year ended 31 March 2012  
(31 March 2011: nil).
On 1 October 2010 the Group completed 
the acquisition of The PBSJ Corporation 
and its subsidiaries (the acquired 
companies). On acquisition, the acquired 
companies had, in accordance with 
relevant US Federal and state election 
laws, historically made political donations 
in the US both directly and to afﬁliated  
US state and Federal political action 
committees (PACs). As a result, political 
donations in the US of US$16,360 
(£10,317) were made in the six months 
from 1 October 2010 to 31 March 2011. 
The afﬁliated PACs were funded partly  
by contributions from the acquired 
companies and partly by employee 
contributions.
Political donations in the US from  
1 April 2011 to 30 June 2011 totalled 
US$4,820 (£3,017). As from 25 June 2011 
any political donations from the acquired 
companies have been made via their 
afﬁliated PACs, funded entirely by 
employee contributions. From 1 April 
2012 the acquired companies may 
contribute directly to non-partisan ballot 
initiatives supporting infrastructure 
development and maintenance. Political 
donations to individual candidates and 
political parties will only be made via their 
afﬁliated PACs, which remain funded 
entirely by employee contributions.
Charitable donations
During the year, the Group made 
charitable donations of £98,810  
(2011: £134,996). The beneﬁciaries  
of these donations were local charities 
serving the communities in which the

Shares
Share capital
As at the date of this report, the 
Company’s share capital consists of 
104,451,799 issued and fully paid ordinary 
shares each with a nominal value of 0.5p, 
listed on the London Stock Exchange, and 
American Depositary Shares (ADSs). 
Shares may be held in certiﬁcated or 
uncertiﬁcated form. Further details of the 
Company’s authorised and issued share 
capital, including changes during the year, 
can be found in note 33 to the Financial 
Statements (page 147).
The rights and obligations attaching to the 
Company’s ordinary shares are contained 
in the Company’s articles of association.  
In summary, the ordinary shares and ADSs 
allow holders to receive dividends and to 
exercise one vote on a poll per ordinary 
share for every holder present in person  
or by proxy at general meetings of the 
Company. Shares held in treasury are  
not entitled to vote or receive dividends. 
There are no restrictions on the transfer  
or sale of ordinary shares or ADSs and  
no requirements for prior approval of  
any transfers, except as described  
below. Under the Company’s articles of 
association, the directors have the power 
to suspend voting rights and the right to 
receive dividends in respect of ordinary 
shares and to refuse to register a transfer 
of ordinary shares in circumstances where 
the holder of those shares fails to comply 
with a notice issued under section 793  
of the Act. The directors also have the 
power to refuse to register any transfer  
of certiﬁcated shares that does not  
satisfy the conditions set out in the  
articles of association.
Shares acquired through Atkins’ employee 
share schemes rank equally with all other 
ordinary shares in issue and have no 
special rights. The trustees of the 
Company’s Employee Beneﬁt Trusts (EBTs) 
have waived the rights of the EBTs to 
receive dividends on shares they hold, 
with one EBT fully waiving this right and 
another waiving the right to dividends in 
excess of 0.01p per share. In addition 
neither of the EBTs exercises its right to 
vote in respect of such shares. Shares held 
in trust on behalf of participants in the 
Atkins Share Incentive Plan are voted by 
the trustee, Capita IRG Trustees Limited, 
as directed by the participants. Details  
of share-based payments, including 
information regarding the shares held by 
the EBTs, can be found in note 34 to the 
Financial Statements (page 148).
At the AGM held in 2011 shareholders 
granted authority for the directors to allot 
relevant securities up to approximately 
one third of the issued share capital and  
a further one third in connection with  
an offer by way of a rights issue. The 
directors intend to seek shareholder 
approval to renew this authority at this 
year’s AGM, details of which are 
contained in the Notice of Meeting.
The Company is not aware of any 
agreements between shareholders that 
might result in the restriction of transfer  
or voting rights in relation to the shares 
held by such shareholders.
Share purchases
At the AGM held in 2011, the Company 
was granted authority by shareholders  
to purchase up to 10,011,000 ordinary 
shares, representing approximately 10% 
of the Company’s ordinary share capital as 
at 15 June 2011. No ordinary shares were 
purchased pursuant to this authority 
during the year ended 31 March 2012  
or to the date of this Annual Report.  
This authority will expire at the 
forthcoming AGM and, in accordance 
with current best practice, the Company 
will seek to renew it. 62 Governance  
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2012
Directors’ Report
continued
4,341,000 ordinary shares of 0.5p each, 
representing approximately 4.2% of the 
Company’s issued share capital, were  
held in treasury (the treasury shares) 
throughout the year and to the date  
of this Annual Report following a share 
buy back programme.
Signiﬁcant shareholders
As at the date of this report, the Company 
had been notiﬁed of holdings of 3% or 
more of the total voting rights attaching 
to its issued share capital as detailed  
in table 1.
Change of control
No agreement with a director or 
employee of the Company provides  
for compensation for loss of ofﬁce  
or employment (whether through 
resignation, purported redundancy  
or otherwise) that occurs as a result  
of a change of control.
All of the Company’s employee share 
schemes contain provisions relating to  
a change of control of the Company. 
Under these provisions, a change of 
control would normally be a vesting  
event, facilitating the exercise of options 
or transfer of allocations subject to  
any relevant performance conditions 
being satisﬁed.
The Company is not a party to any other 
signiﬁcant agreements that take effect, 
alter or terminate upon a change of 
control other than its funding facilities, 
which provide that in such a situation the 
Company is unable to draw down any 
further amounts under the facilities  
and/or that they may be cancelled.
Directors’ statement of responsibility
The directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report, the Remuneration 
Report and the Financial Statements  
in accordance with applicable law  
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to 
prepare ﬁnancial statements for each 
ﬁnancial year. The directors have prepared 
the Group and Company Financial 
Statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union. Under company law the 
directors must not approve the Financial 
Statements unless they are satisﬁed that 
they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Company and the Group 
and of the proﬁt or loss of the Company 
and the Group for that period.
In preparing the Financial Statements,  
the directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies  
and then apply them consistently
 make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent
 state whether applicable IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union have 
been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in 
the Financial Statements
 prepare the Financial Statements  
on the going concern basis, unless  
it is inappropriate to presume that  
the Group and the Company will 
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufﬁcient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose  
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
ﬁnancial position of the Company and the 
Group and that enable them to ensure 
that the Financial Statements and the 
Remuneration Report comply with the  
Act and, as regards the Group Financial 
Statements, Article 4 of the International 
Accounting Standard Regulation. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and the Group and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.

(pages 58 and 59), conﬁrm that, to the 
best of their knowledge:
 the Directors’ Report contained in the 
Annual Report includes a fair review  
of the development and performance  
of the business and the position of the 
Group, together with a description of 
the principal risks and uncertainties  
that it faces
 the Group Financial Statements, which 
have been prepared in accordance with

Disclosure of audit information
The directors conﬁrm that, as at the date 
this report was approved, so far as each 
director is aware there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s 
auditor is unaware and that he or she has 
taken all the steps that he or she ought to 
have taken as a director in order to make 
himself or herself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that  
the Company’s auditor is aware of  
that information.
Going concern
The directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the 
Group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future and therefore continue 
to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the Financial Statements.
Auditors
The Company’s independent auditor, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has 
expressed its willingness to continue  
in ofﬁce and resolutions for its 
reappointment and to authorise  
the directors to determine its 
remuneration will be proposed  
at the forthcoming AGM.

Cautionary statement
Under the Companies Act 2006, a company’s 
directors’ report is required, among other matters,  
to contain a fair review by the directors of the 
company’s and, if applicable, group’s business 
through a balanced and comprehensive analysis of 
the development and performance of the business  
of the company and group and the position of the 
company and group at the year end, consistent  
with the size and complexity of the business.
The directors’ report set out above, including the 
Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s 
Statement, Our Strategy, the Business Review,  
the Human Resources Review, the Corporate 
Responsibility Review, the Corporate Governance 
Report, the Remuneration Report and certain notes 
to the accounts incorporated into it by reference 
(together, the Directors’ Report), has been prepared 
only for the shareholders of the Company as a whole 
and its sole purpose and use is to assist shareholders 
to exercise their governance rights. In particular, the 
Directors’ Report has not been audited or otherwise 
independently veriﬁed. The Company and its 
directors and the Group’s employees are not 
responsible for any other purpose or use or to any 
other person in relation to the Directors’ Report.
The Directors’ Report contains indications of likely 
future developments and other forward-looking 
statements that are subject to risk factors associated 
with, among other things, the economic and business 
circumstances occurring from time to time in the 
countries, sectors and business segments in which 
the Group operates. These factors include, but are 
not limited to, those discussed under Principal Risks 
and Uncertainties (pages 40 to 43). These and other 
factors could adversely affect the Group’s results, 
strategy and prospects. Forward-looking statements 
involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. They 
relate to events and/or depend on circumstances  
in the future which could cause actual results and 
outcomes to differ materially from those currently 
anticipated. No obligation is assumed to update any 
forward-looking statements, whether as a result  
of new information, future events or otherwise. 64 Governance  
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2012
Dear Shareholder
I am once again pleased to present the Board’s annual report on corporate governance. My personal 
commitment, with the support of the Board, to the continued maintenance of effective corporate governance 
across the Group continues. The Board has maintained and strengthened its focus on ensuring that the 
framework in place remains meaningful, relevant and aligned with our business priorities. Continuing the work 
we started last year in response to the Financial Reporting Council’s (FRC) drive to reduce clutter in governance 
reporting, we have focused on changes during the year rather than boiler plate disclosure seeking to cover all 
aspects of our governance framework. The more detailed standing information is available online.
In addition to the ongoing drive to ensure effective corporate governance, the Board has made the following 
items areas which demand speciﬁc attention:
Diversity
In September 2011, in response to Lord Davies of Abersoch’s call to chairmen to publish their diversity goals, 
we announced our aspiration to have one third of our Board members as women by 2015. We believe in  
the beneﬁts of greater gender diversity and are actively supportive of appropriate measures to achieve this 
without resorting to unnecessary quotas. Women currently account for 22% of our Board. Our focus will 
remain on attracting the right talent and skills irrespective of gender or ethnicity.
In our 2011 Annual Report, we reported our progress towards achieving greater diversity in our Board 
composition. Today, the Board’s make-up reﬂects the increasing internationalisation of the Group with 
directors demonstrating diversity of perspective, experience, thought, gender, ethnicity and nationality.
Succession planning
We recognise that the gender imbalance experienced at Board level could be a symptom of an issue below  
the Board. The gender imbalance among employees in our Group remains an issue, as it is for many other 
organisations in the science, engineering, maths and technology sectors. In an attempt to address this,  
the Board has approved action plans developed by each of the Group’s regional management teams to 
achieve a signiﬁcant difference in the gender balance at a senior level in management and technical roles. 
Progress on this action plan has been reported in the Human Resources Review (page 49).
Performance evaluation
The Board undertook a further internal performance evaluation process during the year. It also continued  
to build upon the actions identiﬁed during the performance evaluation process in the prior year.

Governance
Statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code
Throughout the year ended 31 March 2012 the Company complied with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance  
Code, a copy of which is available on the FRC’s website: www.frc.org.uk.
Full details of the Group’s governance framework are available on the Company’s website: www.atkinsglobal.com/ 
investors_governance.
Leadership
The Board is responsible for ensuring the long term success of the Company. It does so by determining the Company’s long term 
direction and strategic aims within a framework of appropriate and robust controls. A key principle of the framework is the 
delegation of operational management to the chief executive ofﬁcer with a matrix of authorities setting out how this is further 
delegated through the organisation. This approach is followed to enable the efﬁcient and effective operation of the Group’s 
businesses on a daily basis.
Following his appointment as chief executive ofﬁcer, Dr Uwe Krueger made a number of organisational changes to ensure that we 
have the right leadership and organisation structure in place to deliver our strategy for growth. He redeﬁned the role of the heads  
of our regions, appointing them as regional chief executive ofﬁcers in recognition of the broader level at which they work, the 
responsibility they each have for the overall performance and development of our regional businesses and the contribution expected 
from each of them. The Strategy Group was reconstituted and renamed as the Senior Leadership Team, expanding its membership  
to include additional senior Group directors. Finally, as the Group expands geographically and in size, management focus and  
decision making must inevitably be devolved to the regional management teams. As a result, the Group Executive was dissolved  
with regional management teams being empowered to develop the strategy for growth for their region.
The Board has retained control of a number of matters for its sole consideration. The schedule of matters reserved to the  
Board includes:
 the consideration and approval of strategy
 general oversight of the Group’s operations
 approval of signiﬁcant bids and contracts
 the Group’s capital, corporate, management and control structures
 approval of ﬁnancial statements and shareholder communications
 approval of dividend policy and interim dividends
 approval of Group policies
 implementation and monitoring of internal control and risk management systems
 signiﬁcant contracts, acquisitions and disposals
 material changes to the Group’s pension schemes.
Whilst the Board has speciﬁc responsibility for those matters reserved for its consideration, in certain areas speciﬁc responsibility is 
delegated to committees of the Board within deﬁned terms of reference. The activities of these committees are discussed in more 
detail later in this report and their terms of reference are available on the Group’s website: www.atkinsglobal.com or on request  
from the company secretary.
In addition the Board may delegate authority to a standing committee, consisting of any two directors, to provide the ﬁnal sign-off 
for an agreed course of action within pre-deﬁned parameters.

5.  Rodney Slater was appointed as an independent non-executive director on 9 September 2011. Two Remuneration Committee meetings coincided with engagements 
made prior to his appointment. One meeting of the Remuneration Committee was convened at short notice and coincided with a prior engagement.
6. With the Chairman’s agreement, Keith Clarke did not attend one meeting that was convened solely to discuss his successor’s appointment.
7. Two meetings of the Board were convened at short notice and coincided with prior engagements.
Allan Cook’s external appointments remained unchanged during the year. However, it was brought to the Board’s attention that 
SELEX Galileo was undergoing a major restructuring as part of Finmeccanica and he was actively involved in this project. To enable 
him to carry out his responsibilities as chairman, he continues to spend at least three days per week with Atkins.
Directors’ conﬂicts of interest
Each director is required, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, to declare any interests that may give rise to a conﬂict of 
interest with the Company on appointment and subsequently as they arise. Where such a conﬂict, or potential conﬂict, arises the 
Board is empowered under the Company’s articles of association to consider and authorise such conﬂicts as appropriate. In addition, 
the Company undertakes an annual review of all authorised conﬂicts to ensure such authorisation remains appropriate, the last such 
review having taken place in October 2011.

committee 
appointments
 Recommendation to Board regarding appointment of the new chief executive ofﬁcer  
and a new non-executive director
 Election and re-election of directors in accordance with the Company’s articles of association
 Board committee memberships
Information regarding the Committee, including its terms of reference, is available on the Group’s website: www.atkinsglobal.com.
Appointment processes
During the year the Committee recommended the appointments of Dr Uwe Krueger as chief executive ofﬁcer and Rodney Slater  
as a non-executive director. The process followed for the appointment of Dr Krueger was described in detail in the previous year’s 
annual report.
The Board, recognising the increased presence of the Group in North America, commissioned a search for a non-executive director 
with signiﬁcant and relevant US business experience. This particular attribute was identiﬁed alongside others set out in a detailed  
role speciﬁcation, developed by the Nomination Committee. Each candidate was assessed against this role speciﬁcation as well  
as undergoing a comprehensive interview process. Following its successful involvement in the identiﬁcation and appointment  
of Dr Krueger as chief executive ofﬁcer, Korn/Ferry Whitehead Mann provided support for the search.
Performance evaluation
Following the appointment of Dr Uwe Krueger as chief executive ofﬁcer in August 2011 the Board considered it inappropriate to 
conduct an evaluation exercise facilitated by an external third party during the year as originally anticipated. This was to allow  
Dr Krueger time to work with the Chairman to identify working practices and areas for change.
Allan Cook therefore, once again, undertook a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of the Board, its committees and 
individual directors via private one-to-one meetings in late 2011. The ﬁnal report, prepared with the assistance of Richard Webster, 
the company secretary, was considered in detail at a meeting in early 2012. The Board was content that its overall performance 
remained satisfactory but is not complacent and continually seeks to drive further improvement. It therefore continues to keep  
under review progress made on the actions identiﬁed in 2010, as outlined in table 2(a), as well as identifying a number of areas  
for improvement in 2011 as outlined in table 2(b).

as part of the next performance evaluation.
An externally facilitated evaluation exercise is now scheduled to be undertaken in early 2013. 
Commitment
During the year all directors, particularly the non-executive directors, committed signiﬁcant time to the Company. Following  
the appointment of Dr Krueger as chief executive ofﬁcer, the Group’s strategy has been reviewed in detail and this, along  
with the comprehensive review of executive director remuneration (discussed in more detail in the Remuneration Report,  
pages 73 to 93), has required signiﬁcant additional time from the directors.
Development
Allan Cook regularly reviews training requirements with each director. The company secretary ensures suitable opportunities are 
identiﬁed. During the year the directors have undertaken training on topics including executive remuneration, board effectiveness  
and the role of diversity, and ﬁnancial reporting.
On joining the Board, directors take part in a formal induction process. This includes the provision of past Board materials to provide 
background information on the Group, information on Board processes and governance, site visits and meetings with key employees. 
The induction is tailored to each new director’s speciﬁc needs. Rodney Slater received a comprehensive induction programme, which

Values and ethics
The Group operates through a devolved and decentralised structure, which is considered a key part of the Group’s ability to deliver 
multi local services to its clients and hence is reﬂected in our governance framework. Under this structure the chief executive ofﬁcer 
delegates authority and control to the regional chief executive ofﬁcers (each of whom are members of the Senior Leadership Team), 
from them to the managing directors of the principal businesses and then downward to business and project managers as 
appropriate. Within this framework:
 authority is delegated within clearly prescribed limits
 decisions are escalated where either project size or risk proﬁle require a higher level of authority
 activity and performance are tracked through monthly and quarterly reports
 effectiveness is audited via internal audit and self-assessment controls.
The governance framework is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve stated business objectives.  
It can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.

Governance
Following the acquisition of PBSJ, an integration programme was implemented to embed the Group’s governance framework  
within the acquired business. Work continues on this programme with an appropriate control framework continuing to operate  
in the interim.
Joint ventures in which the Company does not have overall control are not covered by the Group’s governance framework.  
For these joint ventures, systems of internal control are applied as agreed between the joint venture parties.
The Board monitored and reviewed the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s governance framework, which includes internal 
controls and risk management, on a continual basis throughout the year ended 31 March 2012 and up to the date of approval  
of the Annual Report. Support was provided by the Group Risk Committee, the internal audit function and the Company’s 
independent auditor.

WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2012
The independent auditor is currently PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), who has acted in this capacity since the Company listed  
on the London Stock Exchange in 1996. Having considered the relationship with the independent auditor, its qualiﬁcation, expertise, 
resources and effectiveness, in particular noting the rotation of audit partner during the year, the Audit Committee concluded that 
the appointment continues to meet the Group’s needs and therefore recommended the reappointment of the independent auditor  
to the Board. Accordingly, it has not considered it necessary to date to undertake a tender process for the audit work although  
it has considered PwC’s appointment on an annual basis. There are no contractual obligations restricting the Company’s choice  
of independent auditor.
The impact on independence, if any, of non-audit work performed by the independent auditor is considered regularly by the 
Committee. Approval is required prior to the independent auditor commencing any material non-audit work in accordance with  
a Group policy approved annually by the Committee. The policy identiﬁes certain non-audit work that may be awarded with the 
approval of the executive directors, within certain limited ﬁnancial parameters, and other work that requires the speciﬁc approval  
of the Committee. Certain work, such as providing bookkeeping services, is prohibited. The appointment of former employees  
of the independent auditor to positions in the Group is also regulated by the Committee.
Note 5 to the Financial Statements (page 120) sets out the fees paid to the independent auditor for audit and non-audit work. 
Approximately 25% of the non-audit fees incurred related to projects associated with the implementation of the pension strategy 
and it was therefore considered appropriate, in light of PwC’s detailed understanding of the Group and expertise in this area,  
to engage its services in this regard. The Committee concluded that the level of non-audit fees, which represent a value of 62%  
of the audit fees for the Group, did not have a negative impact on PwC’s independence.
Information regarding the Committee, including its terms of reference, is available on the Group’s website: www.atkinsglobal.com.
Remuneration
Details of the directors’ remuneration and the work of the Remuneration Committee can be found in the Remuneration Report  
(pages 73 to 93).
Relations with shareholders
The primary means used by the Board for communicating with all Company shareholders are the Annual Report, half year results  
and annual general meeting (AGM). It also recognises the importance of the internet as a means of communicating widely, quickly 
and cost-effectively and an investor relations section is provided on the Group’s website: www.atkinsglobal.com/investors to facilitate 
communications with shareholders.
Following the successful introduction of calling a poll for all resolutions considered at last year’s AGM, we intend to continue this 
practice in future. This ensures the Company continues to operate in line with best practice and allows all shareholders, present  
in person or by proxy, to vote on all resolutions in proportion to their shareholding.
Details of the 2012 AGM are set out in the separate Notice of Meeting.

Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Remuneration Committee’s annual report on directors’ remuneration.
Before presenting my ﬁrst report to shareholders, I would like to thank my predecessor, Sir Peter Williams, for  
his commitment to the Committee during his tenure as its chairman. His leadership provided a strong focus and 
balance for the Committee which I hope to continue and develop over time with the support of my colleagues.
The content of this report has been refreshed to provide investors with greater transparency of our remuneration 
structure, making it clearer how performance is rewarded and aligned with strategy. 
As chairman of the Committee I am very mindful of the increased focus on the subject of executive 
remuneration, from investors, governments and the public. The announcement earlier this year of proposed 
changes to remuneration reporting and governance in the UK, together with recent shareholder voting on 
remuneration reports, conﬁrm the importance of the Committee’s role in ensuring that directors’ pay is aligned 
to investors’ interests and appropriately linked to performance.
Looking back over the past year, the Group has delivered good results in the last twelve months despite the 
challenging economic environment.
As set out in last year’s report to shareholders, the Committee has undertaken a comprehensive review of 
remuneration during the year. We have made no signiﬁcant changes to remuneration since 2006, and we 
undertook this exercise starting from ﬁrst principles.
The Committee sought to ensure that the new framework fully supports the implementation of our strategy 
following the appointment of our new chief executive ofﬁcer during 2011. In summary, we believe the proposed 
changes are right for Atkins because they:
 improve strategic alignment
 provide the right balance between short and long term incentives
 align senior management remuneration with that of the executive directors
 recognise that we operate a people business, where reward and incentive structure is critical to our success
 achieve this whilst not increasing quantum for executive directors.
The proposed structure for executive directors includes:
 leaving salaries unchanged
 an increase in the proportion of annual bonus based on measurable individual strategic objectives, from 10% 
to 25%, subject to meeting a threshold level of ﬁnancial performance, to reﬂect the importance of reshaping 
our business in line with our renewed strategy
 long term performance measures based on absolute earnings per share (EPS) growth and long term 
sustainable share price growth, which are considered to be the measures best aligned with Atkins’ success
 introducing a new plan (the Long-term Growth Unit plan) which will be based on sustained long term share 
price performance with extended four, ﬁve and six year time horizons
 introducing malus provisions across all our executive share plans, in line with best practice and the interests  
of our shareholders.
These changes are set out in more detail in this report and have been the subject of an extensive consultation 
and dialogue with key shareholders and representative bodies, whose feedback was important in ﬁnalising  
the framework set out in this report. I would like to take the opportunity to thank shareholders for their 
engagement in the process and welcome the broad support we have received for our proposals to date.
We will put elements of the proposed changes to our remuneration structure to shareholders at the forthcoming 
annual general meeting, along with a resolution to vote for this remuneration report. I very much hope you will 
support the proposals and the report.

The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is a committee of the Board. Its terms of reference are available on the Company’s website:  
www.atkinsglobal.com or on request from the company secretary. The Committee has responsibility for setting remuneration policy 
and structure for the Company’s chairman and executive directors. The Committee also has oversight of remuneration practice across 
the Group, including the senior leadership team.

The independent non-executive directors who served on the Committee during the year are shown in table 1.

The Committee met nine times during the year (2011: seven). The number of meetings was greater than last year as a result of  
the Committee’s comprehensive review of remuneration. Details of the attendance of members at meetings can be found in the 
Corporate Governance Report (page 67). The Board believes that the members of the Committee bring diversity of thought and 
perspective to the deliberations surrounding remuneration matters, with a range of views drawing on insights into both public and 
private sectors.
Committee meetings are attended by the Group HR director, Alun Grifﬁths. The chairman, Allan Cook, and the chief executive ofﬁcer, 
Uwe Krueger, also attend meetings at the discretion of the Committee chairman. The company secretary, Richard Webster, acts as 
secretary to the Committee. No director or other attendee, including the company secretary, participates in discussions regarding 
their own remuneration.
Advisors to the Committee
Before commencing the review of executive remuneration, the Committee undertook a detailed tender process for the provision  
of advisory services. As a result of this process, the Committee appointed Deloitte LLP (Deloitte) as the provider of advice on 
remuneration policy and structure, replacing New Bridge Street Consultants (NBSC). Deloitte subsequently supported the executive 
remuneration review.
During the year, the Committee received independent advice from NBSC, a brand of Aon Hewitt Limited (Aon Hewitt), and  
Deloitte on remuneration policy and structure. NBSC and, subsequently, Deloitte also monitored the Company’s total shareholder 
return (TSR) performance. None of NBSC, Aon Hewitt or Deloitte provided any other material services to the Group. Linklaters LLP 
and Tapestry LLP provided legal advice with respect to share plans. The Committee also consulted the chief executive ofﬁcer, the 
Group HR director and the company secretary regarding remuneration policy.
Committee activities
The Committee has a schedule of standing agenda items that aligns to the reward communication programme for all employees 
within the Group. This schedule commences with the conﬁrmation of remuneration for the year ahead advised to employees  
in April each year, followed by notiﬁcation of their bonuses for the prior ﬁnancial year following the announcement of the Group’s 
preliminary results in June. In addition, the Committee discusses remuneration policy and market practice throughout the year. This 
year the Committee spent a signiﬁcant time at its meetings discussing and debating the changes to remuneration as part of the 
review process. The key matters discussed during the year included:

Alignment with our strategy
During the year, the Committee carried out a comprehensive review of the executive remuneration framework. The principal aim  
of this review was to improve the alignment of remuneration with strategy. 
Following Uwe Krueger’s appointment as chief executive ofﬁcer in August 2011, he conﬁrmed our strategic direction to deliver  
long term shareholder value through a focus on core growth sectors in engineering and design. As set out in Our Strategy  
(pages 10 to 13), this strategy has three principal priorities over the medium term:
 operational excellence
 portfolio optimisation
 sector focus.
The overall objective of our strategy is to create shareholder value through:
 driving margins above 8%
 reducing dependence on the UK (with our long term aspiration being to have more than 75% of our business outside the UK)
 growing organically and through acquisition.

in Our Strategy
 
Our Strategy. Pages 10-13 76 Governance  
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2012
The Committee’s review started from ﬁrst principles, recognising that the previous framework had operated for a number of years.  
It considered what was appropriate for our business and the markets in which we operate, taking into account the key principles of 
good corporate governance. This led to the formulation of the following key themes, from which the framework was developed:
 as a people business, the remuneration framework must incentivise and retain the right people
 the framework must be based on simple principles with clear line of sight for participants and alignment with shareholders
 remuneration should be aligned with strategy, with any changes seeking to improve this alignment, not increase quantum
 a signiﬁcant portion of the package should be performance related (on both a short and long term basis) and delivered  
in the form of Atkins shares
 growth in earnings per share (EPS) is a key metric for measuring the performance of our business and should be balanced with  
a focus on long term share price growth and performance against strategic objectives.
Key changes for 2012
Following this review, the key changes to the framework for 2012 are:
 no change to salaries or incentive opportunities
 an increase in the proportion of the annual bonus based on individual performance against strategic objectives from 10% to 25% 
to incentivise and reward actions taken to reshape our business in line with the stated strategy
 a reduction in the size of annual Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards from 100% to 75% of salary. Awards will be based  
on stretching EPS targets, requiring growth of 12% per annum for maximum vesting
 the introduction of a new share plan, the Long-term Growth Unit (LGU) plan, focussed on sustained share price growth over four, 
ﬁve and six years
 the introduction of malus provisions across all our executive share plans.
As part of the review we undertook an extensive consultation with key shareholders and representative bodies, whose feedback was 
important to shaping the new framework. We welcome the broad support we have received for our proposals from our major 
shareholders. Following the review we are seeking approval by shareholders at the 2012 Annual General Meeting (AGM) for both the 
new LGU plan and the LTIP.

Remuneration in the context of the wider Group
As a people business our reward and incentive structure is critical to the success of our business. The principles that underpin our 
executive remuneration philosophy also cascade throughout the organisation. Participation in the success of the Group, both through 
bonus arrangements and, for the senior leadership team, through long term share-based awards, is a cornerstone of our 
remuneration framework. 
The Committee regularly reviews the remuneration of staff throughout the Group to ensure that it is attuned to general pay and 
conditions when considering the remuneration of executives. 
For the current ﬁnancial year the ratio between the salary of the chief executive ofﬁcer and the average wage within the Group  
was approximately 13:1. For the year ending 31 March 2013, the average salary increase across the Group was approximately 3% 
compared to 0% for the executive directors.
The executive remuneration framework set out in this report will also apply to the senior leadership team below the Company’s board 
to ensure our executive team is rewarded on a consistent basis.
The Committee also recognises the importance of having reward structures that create a sense of ownership and participation  
in the long term growth of our shares. Around 1,050 Group employees participate in some form of share-based incentive 
arrangement. In addition, at the 2012 AGM, we are seeking approval for new all-employee share plans in the UK, the US  
and other major jurisdictions in which the Group operates.

Alun Grifﬁths retains an entitlement to a deﬁned beneﬁt pension on the same basis as other long serving UK employees. During the 
year a consultation was held with staff with a deﬁned beneﬁt pension entitlement to remove the link to ﬁnal salary via amendment to 
their contracts of employment. From 1 February 2012 this ﬁnal salary link has been removed and transitional relief will be paid to all 
employees (including Alun Grifﬁths) affected by the contractual change. The transitional relief is 2% of salary until 2015 and a further 
3% for 2015 to 2018. This is in addition to the Company contribution of 10% of salary. The maximum company contribution to other 
UK based staff is also 10% of salary, except those affected by the removal of the link to ﬁnal salary.

Annual bonus payments via our Executive Bonus Scheme (EBS) reward in-year performance. Executive directors are required to  
defer one third of any bonus they receive in the form of an award of shares under the terms of the Atkins Deferred Share Plan (DSP). 
The DSP:
 provides a direct link to the Company’s share price and dividend performance
 seeks to aid retention, as awards are subject to forfeiture on resignation within three years of grant.
For awards in respect of the ﬁnancial year ending 31 March 2013, the deferred shares will be subject to malus provisions which allow 
the Committee to reduce deferred awards in certain circumstances, as described in more detail later in this report (page 86).
Bonus framework for 2012/13
For the ﬁnancial year ending 31 March 2013, 75% of the bonus for executive directors will be based on Group proﬁt after tax 
performance. 50% of the maximum will be paid for meeting the budgeted proﬁt after tax target and 100% for meeting a stretch 
target. The stretch target is set annually by the Committee at a level which is considered to be very challenging. In reaching a decision 
on the stretch target, the Committee is also mindful of the need to deliver shareholder value after payment of bonuses.

The remaining 25% will be based on individual objectives aligned to areas which underpin our strategic priorities as we reshape our 
business and our portfolio over the coming years. For the year ending 31 March 2013, objectives have been set in relation to the 
following key strategic areas which relate to the speciﬁc role of each executive director.
Name Strategic areas included in 2012/13 bonus framework
Heath Drewett Capital efﬁciency and capacity
 Project reporting and risk management
Alun Grifﬁths International resourcing
 Senior staff development, talent management and diversity
Uwe Krueger Implementation of the Company’s growth strategy
 Raising the proﬁle and recognition of the Group
 Senior staff development, talent management and diversity
The above provides the headline strategic areas under which performance targets have been set. The performance targets that apply 
to these areas are measurable, challenging and subject to rigorous review by the Committee, both at the time they are set, during the 
year and at the year end when performance is assessed. Subject to commercial sensitivity, we intend to provide an overview of the 
Committee’s assessment of performance against the underlying target in next year’s report.
Executive directors will only receive bonus payments in relation to the achievement of their individual objectives if the threshold 
Group ﬁnancial performance target is also met.
Bonus assessment for 2011/12

Group ﬁnancial 
target (90%)
As explained in the chairman’s statement (pages 6 to 7), the Company has delivered good results in the last 
twelve months despite the challenging economic environment and this is reﬂected in bonus payments.
The reported proﬁt after tax of £106.8m was above budget and met the full stretch target. However, the 
Committee in making its bonus determination adjusted this ﬁgure principally to exclude the one off gain 
arising from the implementation of the Group’s pension strategy and the proﬁt on disposal of the UK asset 
management business. As a result, the Committee determined that 70% of the ﬁnancial target had  
been achieved.
The Committee considered quality, safety and environmental performance when making the bonus awards 
and determined that no adjustment was necessary.

Keith Clarke was also eligible for an annual bonus in respect of both his period of service prior to retiring as a Company director  
on 31 July 2011 and his period of service following his retirement from the Board of directors. This is discussed in a separate section 
later in this report (page 86) and shown in table 16 (page 91).
Other senior management will receive a bonus payment through the EBS, reﬂecting achievement against a combination of targets 
comprising Group ﬁnancial performance, business ﬁnancial performance and personal objectives. These employees are also required 
to defer one third of this bonus into a share award granted under the terms of the DSP, in line with the requirement for executive 
directors. In addition, around 30% of other Group employees will receive a discretionary cash bonus based on individual 
performance, for which there is no deferral.
Long term incentives
The Committee carefully considered long term incentives during the review. The Committee concluded that the long term incentive 
framework should provide an element of reward that acts as an incentive to management to deliver long term performance and that 
it should be built around two performance measures, both of which are simple in design and fundamentally aligned to the creation of 
shareholder value, as illustrated in ﬁgure 2:
 Growth in EPS. This was identiﬁed as the primary metric for measuring the delivery of our growth objective over the medium to 
long term
 Sustained growth in the share price. This ensures alignment between executive reward and sustained share price growth over 
the long term, representing the ultimate measure of performance for our shareholders.
On this basis, the Committee has developed a long term incentive framework which includes two components: 
 LTIP. Awards over Atkins shares which vest after three years subject to EPS performance. This will be our primary long term 
incentive vehicle, reﬂecting the importance of EPS growth to our strategy 
 LGU. Awards of units which deliver value based on a sustained increase in the Atkins share price over a long term horizon. 
We will be seeking shareholder approval for both plans at the 2012 AGM.

WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2012
Governance
The key changes to the long term incentive framework for the year ending 31 March 2013 compared to previous years are as follows:
 A rebalancing of the package with no overall increase to quantum. This involves a reduction in the LTIP award level from 100% to 
75% of salary, to be replaced by an LGU award with broadly equivalent value
 The LTIP award will be based solely on EPS growth rather than a split between EPS and relative TSR. This reﬂects the importance of 
EPS as a performance metric and the Committee’s view that relative TSR is not appropriate for our business given the difﬁculties in 
determining a fair and appropriate group of listed peers, and the arbitrary outcomes that can arise when using a broad index, due 
to cyclical factors
 To ensure a component of the long term incentive remains based on long term share price performance, the LGU plan, which is 
focused on sustained share price growth over four, ﬁve and six years, has been developed
 New absolute EPS targets have been determined. The Committee considers that these are appropriately stretching in the current 
environment. The link to the UK Retail Prices Index has been removed to reﬂect the Group’s international focus, and the level of 
threshold vesting under the LTIP has been reduced from 30% to 25%. The EPS targets will be subject to additional safeguard 
checks relating to cash conversion, acquisitions and inﬂation
 The introduction of malus provisions into all executive share plans, as described later in this report (page 86).

LTIP award policy for 2012/13
Each executive director will receive a LTIP award of 75% of salary following shareholder approval of the plan. The Committee intends 
to apply this award policy for the foreseeable future. The vesting of these awards will be subject to the EPS targets described in table 9.
Table 9: LTIP performance measure for awards to be made in 2012
Atkins’ EPS growth % of award that vests
12% or greater per annum 100
Between 5% and 12% per annum Pro rata between 25 and 100 on a straight line basis
5% per annum 25
Below 5% per annum 0
The Committee believes that these EPS targets are appropriate and stretching in the current environment.
As part of the review, the Committee has also developed a number of additional safeguards which will apply alongside the targets 
above. The Committee will have discretion to adjust vesting to take account of any of the following:
 the impact of any signiﬁcant acquisitions in the period on the level of challenge in the targets above
 the level of inﬂation during the performance period, if it deems that this has had a signiﬁcant impact on the level of challenge 
presented by the targets, in the context of Atkins’ business model
 cash conversion over the performance period to ensure that the achieved EPS growth is suitably underpinned by cash generation 
over the period
 the potential application of malus provisions (page 86).
At the 2012 AGM, shareholders will be asked to approve the terms of the LTIP, which are substantially unchanged from the previous 
LTIP and are in line with established best practice principles. 
Under the LTIP, the maximum award which may be granted to an individual within any 12 month period remains at 150% of salary. 
However, this limit will now also take into account any awards made under the LGU plan within the same 12 month period. If no LGU 
award is made, the LTIP limit will remain at 150% of salary. If the maximum LGU award of 50% of salary is made, then the maximum 
LTIP award which can be made will be reduced to 125% of salary. This is to maintain a broadly equivalent value for the individual limit 
(recognising that the face value of LTIP and LGU, as a percentage of salary, is not a like-for-like comparison). For LGU awards between 
0% and 50%, the LTIP limit will vary from 150% to 125% on a straight line pro rata basis. 
LTIP awards made in 2011/12
During the ﬁnancial year ended 31 March 2012, executive directors received LTIP awards of 100% of salary (as shown in table 18 
(page 92)). These awards, as in previous years, were subject to the following performance measure: half of the award was based  
on the TSR measure shown in table 10(a) and half was subject to the EPS measure shown in table 10(b).

 Subject to malus provisions 
During the review, the Committee concluded that the LTIP should focus executives on achieving strong EPS growth over a three year 
period. At the same time, the Committee believes it is important to have an element of the long term incentive that is directly linked 
to sustainable long term increases in share price. On this basis, the Committee developed the LGU plan.
The key features of the LGU plan are as follows:
 Awards of units that deliver value based on the increase in the Company’s average share price over the long term. Awards to 
executive directors would have a maximum face value of 50% of salary and an expected value of around 10% of salary
 The awards vest in three equal tranches on the fourth, ﬁfth and sixth anniversaries of grant
 The vesting of each tranche will be subject to the Committee’s determination that share price performance over the period is 
suitably underpinned by the underlying ﬁnancial performance of the Group over the period
 Following vesting, the units can be exercised at the discretion of the participant
 On exercise, the value of each unit is equal to the difference between the six month average share price at exercise and the six 
month average share price at grant. This value is delivered in the form of Atkins shares
 No more than 50% of any award can be exercised in any rolling 12 month period
 There will be no entitlement to dividends; participants will beneﬁt from capital growth only
 Awards are subject to malus provisions as described later in this report (page 86).
The basic concept behind the LGU plan is simple: it delivers value based on the long term growth in Atkins’ share price. LGU awards 
provide no value if the share price does not increase on a sustained basis. Therefore it is directly aligned with the value delivered for 
our shareholders. 
The awards are intended to create a sense of ownership and participation in the long term performance of our shares, as we seek to 
retain the people we need to deliver our strategy over the coming years. They therefore vest over a longer time period than the LTIP 
and most conventional long term incentive plans.  86 Governance  
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2012
Vesting of each tranche will be subject to the Committee being satisﬁed that share price performance is suitably underpinned by 
appropriate ﬁnancial performance. Prior to the vesting of each tranche, the Committee will explicitly consider the Group’s progress 
against its strategy which may include consideration of:
 margin
 expansion of international revenues
 organic growth.

Each executive director will receive the maximum LGU award of 50% of salary following shareholder approval of the plan.
Malus provisions
As a result of the remuneration review, the Committee has determined that malus provisions will be included in the LTIP and LGU  
and will apply for awards made in 2012 and to deferred bonus awards made in respect of the ﬁnancial year ending 31 March 2013.
These provisions will allow the Committee to reduce the number of shares to which an award relates (including to zero) in 
circumstances in which the Committee considers such action is appropriate. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to:
 a material misstatement of the Company’s audited results
 a material downturn in the ﬁnancial performance of the Company
 a material failure of risk management by the Company
 serious reputational damage suffered by the Company
 the participant’s misconduct.
Retirement of Keith Clarke
Keith Clarke retired from his role as a director of the Company on 31 July 2011. Following this, he remained an employee of the 
Group until his retirement on 31 March 2012, assisting with the development of our Middle East business and serving as director  
of sustainability. He continues to provide services to the Group on an ad hoc consultancy basis following his retirement.
There was no compensation for loss of ofﬁce under his service agreement as a director of the Company or of the Group.
His remuneration to 31 July 2012 is set out in table 16 (page 91). He was entitled to a pro rata bonus in respect of his services  
as an executive director in this period. His bonus was based entirely on the Group ﬁnancial target with no personal objectives.  
The Committee assessed this on the same basis as the other executive directors (page 81) and determined that an amount of  
£102,142 should be paid in respect of his role as chief executive ofﬁcer. This bonus will be paid entirely in cash.

The Committee, in accordance with the rules of the relevant share plans, determined that the treatment of his outstanding  
share awards would be as follows:
 deferred bonus shares vested on his retirement from the Group on 31 March 2012 and must be exercised within six months  
of that date
 LTIP awards will mature on the original vesting date (subject to the original performance conditions) but have been reduced  
pro rata to reﬂect his period of employment to 31 March 2012 and will only be exercisable for six months following vesting.
In respect of the period from 31 July 2011 to 31 March 2012, Keith Clarke received aggregate emoluments of £277,509 in respect  
of his role as an employee of the Group. This comprised a base salary, beneﬁts and bonus.

The executive directors’ service agreements include provision for the Company to make phased payments in the event that the 
agreement is terminated on giving 12 months’ notice. They also include a duty for the executive director to mitigate loss where the 
agreement is terminated and any payment in lieu of notice may be reduced to take account of such mitigation. No service agreement 
provides for predetermined amounts of compensation in the event of early termination of service contracts or any change of  
control provisions.
The service agreements are terminable on giving 12 months’ notice. Copies of each director’s service agreement will be available  
for inspection prior to and during the AGM and are also available for inspection at the Company’s registered ofﬁce during normal  
business hours.
External appointments
The Board and the Committee recognise the beneﬁt we can obtain if our executive directors serve as non-executive directors of other 
companies. Subject to review in each case, the Board’s general policy is that each executive director may accept one non-executive 
directorship with another FTSE 350 company from which any fees received may be retained. At present no executive director holds 
such an appointment with a FTSE 350 company, although Uwe Krueger and Alun Grifﬁths are currently non-executive directors of 
the companies listed in table 13 and retain the fees payable, as outlined in respect of these appointments.

Copies of the letters of appointment of the chairman and non-executive directors will be available for inspection prior to and during 
the AGM and are also available for inspection at the Company’s registered ofﬁce during normal business hours.
The remuneration of the chairman is determined by the Committee. The Committee reviewed the chairman’s remuneration during 
the year and made no increase.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors was previously reviewed biennially by the Board on the recommendation of the 
executive directors within the limits set out in the articles of association. It is now reviewed annually in line with the review of the 
remuneration of the chairman, the executive directors and all employees in the Group. The executive directors’ recommendation is 
made in light of remuneration levels within the Group, independent advice and the level of fees paid to non-executive directors of 
comparator companies.
In undertaking their review of non-executive directors’ fees, the executive directors considered:
 salary levels within the Group
 the increasing internationalisation of the Group since the last review of fees in October 2010 and, in particular, the corresponding 
increase in demands placed on the non-executive directors in terms of both the complexity of their role and the time commitment 
required of them
 benchmarking against published fee data for FTSE 250 companies and a bespoke comparator group of companies of a similar size, 
background and complexity. 
The Board, on the recommendation of the executive directors, approved:
 an increase in the basic annual fee paid to non-executive directors, as disclosed in table 15 (page 89), in line with the salary  
increase budgeted for the Group
 an increase to the annual fee paid to the chairmen and members of the Audit and Remuneration Committees, as disclosed  
in table 15 (page 89), in recognition of the permanent increase in the demands being placed on members of the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees
 an additional fee be paid to the senior independent director, as disclosed in table 15 (page 89), in recognition of the increasing 
importance of the role in ensuring good governance and the consequential additional time commitment required.

During its review of executive remuneration, the Committee considered carefully the shareholding guidelines for executive directors. 
Previously each executive director was encouraged to hold shares in the Company (either directly or through share awards made in 
connection with annual bonuses) equivalent to the level of their annual salary, based on the value of such shares at the time of their 
acquisition (or award), or their current market value from time to time, whichever is the higher. In future, executive directors will 
ordinarily be expected to build up an interest in the Company’s shares equivalent to one times their salary, based on the value of  
such shares at the time of the acquisition or their current market value, whichever is the higher. Such an interest would normally  
be expected to be built up within a ﬁve year period following the adoption of the policy in 2012.
The interests of the directors and their families in the ordinary shares of 0.5p each in the Company as at 31 March 2012 are shown  
in table 19 (page 93). 
Details of the share options and long term incentives of each executive director as at 31 March 2012 are given in table 18 (page 92).
For each share under option that had not expired at the end of the ﬁnancial year, the mid market price on 30 March 2012 (being  
the last trading day before 31 March 2012) was 734.0p and the highest and lowest mid market prices during the ﬁnancial year  
were 820.0p and 490.2p respectively. 90 Governance

Performance graph
Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 requires the Company 
to provide a graph comparing a hypothetical holding of shares in the Company with a broad equity market index over a ﬁve year 
period. The Company’s performance, measured by TSR, can be compared with the performance of the FTSE 250 Index (excluding 
investment trusts) over the past ﬁve years. This index is considered the most appropriate index against which to measure performance 
as the Company has been a member of the FTSE 250 for the whole of the ﬁve-year period. This is illustrated in ﬁgure 4.

TSR is deﬁned as the return shareholders would receive on a notional holding of shares including dividends received on those shares 
over a period of time. Assuming dividends are reinvested into the Company’s shares, it measures the percentage growth in the 
Company’s share price together with the value of any dividends paid.
All-employee share plans
The Company operates a Share Incentive Plan, as approved by HM Revenue & Customs, which is offered to all eligible UK employees, 
including the executive directors.
In addition, at the annual general meeting to be held in August, the Company will be seeking approval of all-employee share plans  
in countries where the Group has a signiﬁcant presence. These will take the form of:
 a Save As You Earn (SAYE or Sharesave) plan in the UK
 a ‘423 plan’, an American tax-favoured employee share plan (also known as a tax-qualiﬁed Employee Stock Purchase Plan) similar  
in operation to a UK SAYE, in the US
 a global all-employee plan in other jurisdictions where the Group has a signiﬁcant presence such as the Middle East and Asia.
At this stage it is proposed that the necessary approvals (including, but not limited to, shareholder approval) are sought to enable 
such plans to be put in place sometime in the future. There is no speciﬁc intention to launch any all-employee plans during the 
ﬁnancial year ending 31 March 2013. The Committee will need to approve the launch of any proposed all-employee plan.
Dilution
DSP share awards can only be satisﬁed using market purchase shares held in the Employee Beneﬁt Trust (EBT). LTIP and LGU share 
awards can be satisﬁed using new issue shares, shares held in treasury or market purchase shares held in the EBT. The Committee 
reviews the hedging and dilution position of the Company at least bi-annually prior to making grants of share awards. Both the  
LTIP and LGU operate 5% in 10 years (executive schemes) and 10% in 10 years aggregate dilution limits in line with best practice.  
At 31 March 2012 the EBT held 2,375,800 shares to hedge outstanding awards over 3,732,383 shares. At this date the EBT held 
shares to satisfy 63.7% of all outstanding awards. No new issue shares have been used to satisfy share awards since 2005 and,  
to date, no treasury shares have been used.
Remuneration paid to directors during the year
The remuneration of each director, excluding long term share based incentive awards, during the year ended 31 March 2012 
compared with 2011 is set out in table 16 (page 91).

1.  Increase in transfer value was the result of several factors including the incorrect calculation of the transfer value at 31 March 2011 (which accounts for around half  
of the increase in transfer value reported), the fall in gilt yields, the impact of assumed interest and a salary increase. The correct transfer value at 31 March 2011  
was £1,432,852. 92 Governance

3. Keith Clarke retired as a director on 31 July 2011. He retired as an employee of the Group on 31 March 2012. 
4. Uwe Krueger was appointed as a director on 14 June 2011.
5. Subject to performance criteria described in note 34 to the Financial Statements.
6.  Following the exceptional write down in relation to Metronet, the Company’s EPS for the ﬁnancial year ended 31 March 2007 was (56.8)p. The consequence of this 
was that any LTIP awards made in 2007 would never be capable of vesting. Pursuant to the rules of the plan, the Remuneration Committee considered that it was 
appropriate to remove proﬁt in respect of discontinued operations and the exceptional loss in respect of Metronet and that the EPS for the ﬁnancial year ending 
immediately before the commencement of the performance period for the 2007 awards be deemed to be 57.3p.
7.  In 2009 the Remuneration Committee considered the impact of the £7.0m tax beneﬁt from the purchase of prior year consortium relief from the Metronet companies 
and concluded that the non-trading nature of this beneﬁt was not a fair reﬂection of underlying earnings. Pursuant to the rules of the plan, the Remuneration 
Committee considered it was appropriate to remove the beneﬁt of this item and that the EPS for the ﬁnancial year ending immediately before the commencement of 
the performance period for the 2009 award was 76.4p.
8.  In 2010 the Remuneration Committee considered the impact of the expiry of a letter of credit in respect of the Metronet enterprise and the related provision giving 
rise to a one off, non-cash pre-tax credit of £25m in the Group’s income statement for the year. It concluded that the non-trading nature of this beneﬁt was not a fair 
reﬂection of underlying earnings. It was therefore excluded and the lower normalised basic EPS for the year ended 31 March 2010 of 79.4p was used to calculate the 
vesting of LTIP awards made in 2007 and was also used as the EPS for the ﬁnancial year immediately before the commencement of the performance period for the 
2010 awards.
9. Keith Clarke exercised this award following his retirement as a director but before his retirement as an employee of the Group on 31 March 2012.
10.  In accordance with the rules of the LTIP, this award was pro-rated to reﬂect the proportion of the period from the award date to the ﬁrst date of exercise that had 
elapsed as at the date of his retirement as an employee of the Group on 31 March 2012.

WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2012
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements 
of WS Atkins plc for the year ended  
31 March 2012 which comprise the 
Consolidated Income Statement,  
the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated 
and Parent Company Balance Sheets,  
the Consolidated and Parent Company 
Statements of Cash Flows, the 
Consolidated and Parent Company 
Statements of Changes in Equity and  
the related notes. The ﬁnancial reporting 
framework that has been applied  
in their preparation is applicable law  
and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union and, as regards the 
Parent Company ﬁnancial statements,  
as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Respective responsibilities of 
directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
Responsibilities Statement (page 62),  
the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the ﬁnancial statements 
and for being satisﬁed that they give a 
true and fair view. Our responsibility is  
to audit and express an opinion on the 
ﬁnancial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with  
the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions,  
has been prepared for and only for  
the Company’s members as a body in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16  
of the Companies Act 2006 and for  
no other purpose. We do not, in giving 
these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose  
or to any other person to whom this 
report is shown or into whose hands  
it may come save where expressly  
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the  
ﬁnancial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence 
about the amounts and disclosures in  
the ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to give 
reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial 
statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud  
or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s and Parent 
Company’s circumstances and have  
been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of 
signiﬁcant accounting estimates made  
by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. 
In addition, we read all the ﬁnancial and 
non-ﬁnancial information in the annual 
report to identify material inconsistencies 
with the audited ﬁnancial statements.  
If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies 
we consider the implications for  
our report.
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements 
In our opinion: 
 the ﬁnancial statements give a true and 
fair view of the state of the Group’s and 
of the Parent Company’s affairs as at  
31 March 2012 and of the Group’s proﬁt 
and Group’s and Parent Company’s  
cash ﬂows for the year then ended; 
 the Group ﬁnancial statements  
have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted  
by the European Union; 
 the Parent Company ﬁnancial 
statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted  
by the European Union and as applied  
in accordance with the provisions  
of the Companies Act 2006; and
 the ﬁnancial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 
2006 and, as regards the Group 
ﬁnancial statements, Article 4  
of the lAS Regulation. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed 
by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
 the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006;
 the information given in the Directors’ 
Report for the ﬁnancial year for which 
the ﬁnancial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the ﬁnancial statements.
Matters on which we are required  
to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect  
of the following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006  
we are required to report to you if,  
in our opinion: 
 adequate accounting records have not 
been kept by the Parent Company, or 
returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited 
by us; or
 the Parent Company ﬁnancial 
statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or
 certain disclosures of Directors’ 
remuneration speciﬁed by law are  
not made; or
 we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for  
our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required  
to review: 
 the Directors’ statement (page 63)  
in relation to going concern; 
 the part of the Corporate Governance 
Statement relating to the Company’s 
compliance with the nine provisions of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code 
speciﬁed for our review; and
 certain elements of the report  
to shareholders by the Board on 
Directors’ remuneration.

Consolidated and Parent Company Statements  
of Changes in Equity
For the year ended 31 March 2012 102 Financial Statements  
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2012
1. Accounting policies
WS Atkins plc (the Company) is a public limited company which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled  
in England and Wales. The address of its registered ofﬁce is Woodcote Grove, Ashley Road, Epsom, Surrey, KT18 5BW, England.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements are set out below. These policies  
have been consistently applied to all the years presented, including the application of new IFRSs and interpretations unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
The Consolidated Financial Statements of WS Atkins plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU), IFRIC interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modiﬁed by the 
valuation of pensions, share-based payments, available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets, and ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities (including 
derivative instruments) at fair value through proﬁt or loss.
The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions  
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues  
and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, event  
or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. Material estimates applied across the Group’s businesses and joint 
ventures are reviewed to a common standard and adjusted where appropriate to ensure that consistent treatment of similar and related 
issues that require judgement is achieved upon consolidation. Any revisions to estimates are recognised prospectively.
The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with IFRS also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of 
applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions  
and estimates are signiﬁcant to the Consolidated Financial Statements, are disclosed under ‘Critical Accounting Policies’ and are incorporated 
by reference on page 38 of the Business Review.
Going concern
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future and therefore continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Financial Statements.
Basis of consolidation
The Consolidated Income Statement and Balance Sheet include the accounts of the Company, its subsidiary undertakings and its share of 
joint ventures. The results of the subsidiary undertakings acquired during the year are included in the Consolidated Income Statement from 
the date of acquisition. The results of subsidiary undertakings disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated Income Statement 
up to the date of disposal.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Group. Control exists where the Group has the power to govern the 
ﬁnancial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain beneﬁts from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that are 
currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. Investments in subsidiaries are  
stated at cost less impairments. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets, equity instruments issued and liabilities 
incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identiﬁable assets acquired and liabilities 
and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date irrespective of 
any non-controlling interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identiﬁable net assets 
acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference  
is recognised directly in the income statement. Goodwill is reviewed on ﬁnalisation of fair values and any adjustments required to the 
accounting are recorded within 12 months of the acquisition date.
Where subsidiaries adopt accounting policies that are different from the Group, their reported results are restated to comply with the 
Group’s accounting policies. All intra-group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation. Where subsidiaries do not adopt 
accounting periods that are coterminous with the Group’s, results and net assets are based upon accounts drawn up to the Group’s 
accounting reference date based on unaudited accounts.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses  
are also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred.

WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2012
Financial Statements
Joint ventures
In accordance with IAS 31, Interests in joint ventures, the Group accounts for joint ventures under the equity method of accounting.  
The Group’s share of a joint venture’s proﬁt after tax is included from the date on which the Group acquires joint control. Within the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet the investment is recorded at cost (classiﬁed as a non-current asset) and subsequently adjusted to reﬂect  
the Group’s share of the movements in the joint venture’s net assets post acquisition.
The results, assets and liabilities of joint ventures are stated in accordance with Group accounting policies. Where joint ventures adopt 
accounting policies that are different from the Group, their reported results are restated to comply with the Group’s accounting policies.
Where joint ventures do not adopt accounting periods that are coterminous with the Group’s, results and net assets are based upon 
unaudited accounts drawn up to the Group’s accounting reference date.
PPP/PFI concessions
Assets constructed by PPP/PFI concession companies are classiﬁed in the accounts of the joint ventures as ﬁnancial assets or intangible  
assets, depending on whether the grantor or user has the primary responsibility to pay the operator for the concession services. To date,  
all of the Group’s PPP/PFI concession assets have been classed as ﬁnancial assets.
The ﬁnancial asset represents an interest-bearing, long term receivable. The cost of the ﬁnancial asset at any one time is equal to the 
accumulated value of the service delivery plus accumulated interest charged to the ﬁnancial asset less amounts received to date.
The ﬁnancial asset is measured at fair value. Where it is classed as a loan receivable, any movement in fair value is taken to the income 
statement. Where it is classed as available-for-sale, any movement in fair value is taken to reserves.
Revenue is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received for goods and services provided in the normal course of business,  
net of value-added tax, rebates and discounts. Revenue from contracting activities represents the value of work carried out during the year 
including amounts not yet invoiced. Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective 
interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the ﬁnancial asset 
to that asset’s net carrying value.
Where the outcome of a construction contract can be measured reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage  
of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date, as measured by the contract costs incurred. Where the outcome of a 
construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that contract costs 
incurred will be recovered.
When it is probable that the total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected resultant loss is recognised as an  
expense immediately.
Employee Beneﬁt Trusts
The accounts of the Employee Beneﬁt Trusts (EBTs) are incorporated into the results of the Group as, although they are administered by 
independent trustees and their assets are held separately from those of the Group, in practice the Group’s advice on how the assets are  
used for the beneﬁt of employees is normally accepted. The Group bears the major risks and rewards of the assets held by the EBTs  
until the shares vest unconditionally with the employees. Shares in WS Atkins plc held by the EBTs are shown as a reduction in retained 
earnings/deﬁcit. Other assets and liabilities held by the EBTs are consolidated with the assets of the Group.
Foreign currency transactions and translation
Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the Financial Statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in pounds  
sterling (£), which is the Company’s and Group’s presentation currency.
Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions 
or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from 
the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income 
statement, except when deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash ﬂow hedges, for example. 104 Financial Statements  
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2012
Group companies
Assets and liabilities of all of the Group’s entities that have a functional currency different from the Group’s presentation currency are 
translated into the Group’s presentation currency at the closing rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. Trading results are translated  
at average rates of exchange. Differences resulting from the retranslation of opening net assets and results for the period at closing rates  
are taken to other comprehensive income.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity  
and translated at the closing rate. Exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Operating segments
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker (CODM). 
The CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identiﬁed as the 
chief executive ofﬁcer and the Group ﬁnance director.
The Group’s operating segments for management purposes reﬂect predominantly its key geographical markets. The segments are: UK;  
North America; Middle East; Asia Paciﬁc and Europe; and Energy. These segments form the basis for reporting the Group’s segment 
information as it is the main determinant of the Group’s risks and returns. The Group considers the United Kingdom to be its country  
of domicile. 
Inter-segment transfers and transactions are entered into under the normal commercial terms and conditions that would also be available  
to unrelated third parties. 
Revenue 
Revenue from long term contracts comprises the value of work performed during the period calculated in accordance with the Group’s 
policy for contract accounting set out below. Revenue from other contract activities represents fee income receivable in respect of services 
provided during the period.
Under certain services contracts, the Group manages customer expenditure and is obliged to purchase goods and services from third-party 
contractors and recharge them to the customer at cost. The amounts charged by contractors and recharged to customers are excluded from 
revenue and cost of sales where the Group is acting solely as an agent. Receivables, payables and cash relating to these transactions are 
included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Revenue recognition and contract accounting 
The value of contract work in progress comprises the costs incurred on contracts plus an appropriate proportion of overheads and 
attributable proﬁt. Fees invoiced on account are deducted from the value of work in progress and the balance is separately disclosed  
in trade and other receivables as amounts recoverable on contracts, unless such fees exceed the value of the work in progress on any 
contract in which case the excess is separately disclosed in trade and other payables as fees invoiced in advance.
Revenue is recognised on the majority of the Group’s contracts on a percentage completion basis when the outcome of a contract or project 
can be reasonably foreseen. Under the percentage completion method, the percentage of the total forecast revenue reported at any point  
in time is calculated based upon the proportion of total costs incurred to date as a percentage of total forecast costs or, in some cases, based 
upon the estimated physical percent complete of the total work to be performed under the contract.
In some cases, a margin provision is then made, depending on how far progressed each project is and the risk proﬁle of the project. Where 
contracts span two or more accounting periods, proﬁt is not generally recognised until the contract is 50% complete. In addition, provision  
is made in full for estimated losses and, where the outcome of a contract cannot be reasonably foreseen, proﬁt is taken on completion. 
Revenue recognition on outsourcing contracts is determined by reference to the proportion of the annual service delivered to date. Where 
the costs of obligations in relation to the non-renewal or termination of a contract are higher in the ﬁnal period of the contract, a proportion 
of revenue is deferred each period to meet these anticipated costs. Full provision is made for losses on outsourcing contracts if the forecast 
costs of fulﬁlling the contract throughout the contract period exceed the forecast income receivable. In assessing the amount of the loss to 
provide on an outsourcing contract, account is taken of the Group’s share of the forecast results from any joint ventures which the contract  
is servicing.

WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2012

Interest income
Interest income is recognised on a time-apportionment basis using the effective interest method. When a receivable is impaired, the Group 
reduces the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the estimated future cash ﬂow discounted at the original effective interest  
rate of the instrument, and continues unwinding the discount as interest income. Interest income on impaired loans is recognised using  
the original effective interest rate.
Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Pre-contract costs 
The Group accounts for all pre-contract costs in accordance with IAS 11, Construction contracts. Costs incurred before it becomes probable 
that a contract will be obtained are charged to expenses. Directly attributable costs incurred after that point are recognised in the balance 
sheet and charged to the income statement over the duration of the contract or, in the case of PPP/PFI concessions, over the same period  
as the Group’s interest in any Special Purpose Company (SPC) charges the equivalent capitalised amounts to the income statement.
Bid recovery fees are deferred and credited to the income statement over the duration of the contract or, in the case of PPP/PFI concessions, 
over the same period as the Group’s interest in any SPC credits the equivalent capitalised amounts to the income statement. Where the 
Group’s interest in any SPC reduces, the deferred bid recovery fees are credited to the income statement in proportion to the reduction  
of the Group’s interest.
Exceptional items
Where certain expense or revenue items recorded in a period are material by their size or incidence, the Group reﬂects such items  
as exceptional and these are shown separately in the income statement. 
Exceptional items are also summarised by class in the segmental analyses, excluding those that relate to interest and tax.
Retirement beneﬁt schemes
The Group operates deﬁned contribution and deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes which require payments to be made into separately 
administered funds.
A deﬁned contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays ﬁxed contributions into a separate entity. The Group has no legal 
or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufﬁcient assets to pay all employees the beneﬁts relating  
to employee service in the current and prior periods. A deﬁned beneﬁt plan is a pension plan that is not a deﬁned contribution plan. Typically 
deﬁned beneﬁt plans deﬁne an amount of pension beneﬁt that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more 
factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
For deﬁned beneﬁt schemes, regular valuations are prepared by independent professionally qualiﬁed actuaries to determine the level  
of contributions required to fund the beneﬁts set out in the scheme rules.
The Group accounts for pensions in accordance with IAS 19, Employee beneﬁts. The cost of the deﬁned contribution schemes is charged  
to operating proﬁt as incurred. The cost of the deﬁned beneﬁt schemes is charged as follows:
 the current service cost incurred during the period to provide retirement beneﬁts to employees is charged to operating proﬁt
 gains or losses arising from settlements or curtailments not covered by actuarial assumptions are included in operating proﬁt
 a charge representing the expected increase in scheme liabilities is included in net ﬁnance costs. This is based on the present value of 
scheme liabilities at the beginning of the period
 a credit representing the expected return on scheme assets is included within net ﬁnance costs. This is based on the market value of the 
assets of the schemes at the start of the period allowing for expected cash ﬂows during the period .
For deﬁned beneﬁt schemes, all actuarial gains and losses (asset experience, liability experience and changes in assumptions) are recognised 
immediately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. The difference between the market value of scheme assets and the present value  
of scheme liabilities is recognised as a retirement beneﬁt asset or liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. To the extent that it is recoverable, 
any related deferred tax asset or liability is included in the relevant category of receivable/payable.
The Group has elected to recognise actuarial gains and losses in full as they arise through retained earnings/deﬁcit. 106 Financial Statements

Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans, under which the entity receives services from employees 
as consideration for equity instruments (options) of the Group.
In accordance with IFRS 2, Share-based payments, the cost of share-based payments awarded after 7 November 2002 is charged to the 
income statement over the performance and vesting periods of the instruments. The cost is based on the fair value of the awards made at 
the date of grant adjusted for the number of awards expected to vest. In accordance with the transitional provisions within IFRS 2, no charge 
is made in respect of instruments awarded before 7 November 2002. The credits associated with the amounts charged to the income 
statement are included in retained earnings/deﬁcit until the awards are exercised. Where awards are settled by the new issue of shares,  
any proceeds received in respect of share options are credited to share capital and share premium. Where awards are settled in shares held 
by the EBTs, any proceeds are credited to retained earnings/deﬁcit.
Share awards are granted by the Company to employees of its subsidiaries. The Company charges to cost of investment in subsidiaries  
an amount equivalent to the equity-settled element of the annual IFRS 2 charge, with an equivalent credit to reserves in accordance with 
IFRIC 11, Group and treasury share transactions.
Income tax
Current and deferred income tax are recognised in the income statement for the period except where the taxation arises as a result  
of a transaction or event that is recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Income tax arising on transactions  
or events recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity is charged or credited to other comprehensive income or  
directly to equity respectively.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the 
countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, deferred income tax is not accounted for if it  
arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction 
affects neither accounting nor taxable proﬁt or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted  
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or  
the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable proﬁt will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures, except where it is known that the 
earnings will be distributed.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill is stated at cost less impairment. Prior to 1 April 2004, goodwill was amortised over its estimated useful economic life. Amortisation 
ceased on 1 April 2004 and the carrying value of existing goodwill was frozen at that date and subject to annual impairment review.
On acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired business at the date of 
acquisition. Goodwill arises when the fair value of the consideration given for a business exceeds the fair value of the identiﬁable net assets. 
In accordance with IFRS 3, Business combinations, goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and is subject to impairment review both 
annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the 
recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment is recognised immediately as an 
expense and is not subsequently reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to 
the entity sold.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business acquisition is allocated to each of the cash-generating units (CGUs), 
or groups of CGUs, that is expected to beneﬁt from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill  
is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill  
is monitored at the operating segment level.
Goodwill that arose prior to 1 April 1997 was written off to retained earnings/deﬁcit. Proﬁt or loss on disposal of the underlying businesses  
to which this goodwill related will not include goodwill previously recorded as a deduction from equity.

Acquired customer relationships
Acquired customer relationships consist of intangible assets arising on the consolidation of recently acquired businesses, that are separable 
from goodwill in accordance with IFRS 3, Business combinations, and IAS 38, Intangible assets, and do not fall within the Group’s other 
classes of intangible assets. These comprise principally existing customer relationships which may give rise to future orders (customer 
relationships), and existing order books (backlog orders).
Acquired customer relationships are recognised at fair value and have a ﬁnite useful life.
Amortisation of customer relationships is calculated on a straight-line basis over the customer relationships’ estimated useful lives of between 
one and twenty years.
Backlog orders are amortised over their estimated useful lives of three years.
Software licences 
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the speciﬁc software. 
These costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives of between two and ﬁve years.
Corporate information systems
In accordance with IAS 38, Intangible assets, the Group’s corporate information systems are treated as an intangible asset. Costs included are 
those directly attributable to the design, construction and testing of new systems (including major enhancements and internally generated 
costs) from the point of inception to the point of satisfactory completion where the probable future economic beneﬁts arising from the 
investment can be assessed with reasonable certainty at the time the costs are incurred. Maintenance and minor modiﬁcations are expensed 
in the income statement as incurred. The corporate information systems recognised as assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their 
estimated useful life of six years.
Trade names and trademarks
Trade names and trademarks have arisen on the consolidation of recently acquired businesses and are recognised at fair value at the 
acquisition date. Where trade names and trademarks are considered to have a ﬁnite useful life, amortisation is calculated on a straight-line 
basis over that life.
Property, plant and equipment
 Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Cost comprises purchase price after 
discounts and rebates plus all directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to working condition for its intended use.
Property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis calculated at annual rates to write off the cost less residual value of each 
asset over the term of its estimated useful economic life as follows:
Freehold buildings – 10 to 50 years
Short leasehold – over the life of the lease
Plant and machinery  – 3 to 12 years
No depreciation is provided in respect of freehold land.
The directors annually review the estimated useful economic lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment.
Impairment of non-ﬁnancial assets
Assets that have an indeﬁnite useful life, such as goodwill, are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment and when 
there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment 
wherever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised  
for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair 
value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are 
separately identiﬁable cash ﬂows (cash-generating units). 108 Financial Statements  
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2012
Financial assets
The Group classiﬁes its ﬁnancial assets into the following categories: at fair value through proﬁt or loss, loans and receivables, and available-
for-sale. The classiﬁcation depends on the purpose for which the ﬁnancial assets were acquired. Management determines the classiﬁcation  
of its assets at initial recognition. 
Financial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss
Financial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss are ﬁnancial assets held for trading. A ﬁnancial asset is classiﬁed in this category if acquired 
principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they are designated as 
hedges. Assets in this category are classiﬁed as current assets except where the maturity is greater than 12 months after the balance sheet 
date, in which case they are classiﬁed as non-current assets.
The fair value of ﬁnancial instruments traded in active markets (Level 1) is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.  
A market is regarded as active if quoted market prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, 
pricing service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s-length basis. 
The quoted market price used by the Group is the mid-market price.
The fair value of ﬁnancial instruments that are not traded in an active market (Level 2) are determined by using valuation techniques.  
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on estimates.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.  
They are included within current assets except where the maturity is greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date in which case  
they are included as non-current assets. The Group’s loans and receivables consist of trade and other receivables and cash and cash 
equivalents, which are shown separately in the balance sheet. Trade receivables are recognised at original invoice amount less provision  
for impairment which, due to their short term nature, approximates to their fair value. 
Other receivables include loan notes receivable in respect of disposals, which are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method less any provision for impairment. This valuation approximates to their fair value.
Available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets
Available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classiﬁed in any of the other 
categories. They are included in non-current assets unless the investment matures or management intends to dispose of it within  
12 months of the end of the reporting period. 
Available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at fair value. Changes in fair value are 
recognised in other comprehensive income.
Interest on available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the income statement as part  
of ﬁnance income.
Impairment of ﬁnancial assets
Assets carried at amortised cost
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a ﬁnancial asset or group of ﬁnancial assets is 
impaired. A ﬁnancial asset or a group of ﬁnancial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence  
of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after initial recognition of the asset (a loss event) and that loss event  
(or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash ﬂows of the ﬁnancial asset or group of ﬁnancial assets that can be reliably estimated.
Any impairment is charged to the income statement. Impairment testing for trade receivables is described below in the accounting policy 
paragraph relating to trade receivables. For other receivables carried at amortised cost, impairment loss is measured as the difference 
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash ﬂows discounted at the ﬁnancial asset’s original 
effective interest rate.
Assets classiﬁed as available-for-sale
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a ﬁnancial asset or group of ﬁnancial assets is 
impaired. The Group uses the criteria referred to in the accounting policy relating to trade receivables below. If any evidence of impairment 
exists, the cumulative loss – measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on 
that ﬁnancial asset previously recognised in proﬁt or loss – is removed from equity and recognised in proﬁt or loss. If, in a subsequent period, 
the fair value of a debt instrument classiﬁed as available-for-sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring 
after the impairment loss was recognised in proﬁt or loss, the impairment loss is reversed through the Consolidated Income Statement.

WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2012

Inventories
Inventories are stated at cost less impairment. Cost is determined using the ﬁrst-in, ﬁrst-out method.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for services performed in the ordinary course of business. If collection is expected in  
one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer), they are classiﬁed as current assets. If not, they are presented  
as non-current assets.
Trade receivables are recognised at original invoice amount. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is 
objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Signiﬁcant 
ﬁnancial difﬁculties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or ﬁnancial reorganisation, and default or delinquency  
in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, demand deposits and other short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible 
to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insigniﬁcant risk of changes in value.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments and hedging activities
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair 
value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if 
so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised 
asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash ﬂow hedge).
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk 
management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge 
inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes 
in cash ﬂows of hedged items.
The fair values of various derivative instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in note 22. The full fair value of a hedging derivative 
is classiﬁed as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months, and as a current asset 
or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.
Cash ﬂow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash ﬂow hedges is recognised in other 
comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassiﬁed to proﬁt or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects proﬁt or loss (for example, 
when the forecast cash ﬂow that is hedged takes place).
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or 
loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast cash ﬂow is ultimately recognised in the income 
statement. When a forecast cash ﬂow is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately 
transferred to the income statement.
Lease obligations
Finance leases
Lease arrangements that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee are treated as ﬁnance leases. Assets held 
under ﬁnance leases are capitalised within property, plant and equipment at the lease’s commencement and depreciated over the shorter  
of the lease term and the useful life of the asset. A liability is recognised for the present value of the minimum lease payments within current 
and/or non-current liabilities as appropriate. Rental payments are apportioned between capital and interest expense to achieve a constant 
rate of interest charge on the outstanding obligation. 110 Financial Statements  
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2012
Where the Group acts as a lessor in a ﬁnance lease, receivables under ﬁnance leases represent outstanding amounts due under these 
agreements less ﬁnance charges allocated to future periods. Finance lease interest is recognised over the primary period of the lease so  
as to produce a constant rate of return on the net cash investment.
Operating leases
Where the Group acts as lessee in an operating lease arrangement, the lease payments are charged as an expense to the income statement 
on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease incentives received are also recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Where the Group acts as lessor in an operating lease arrangement, rental income from operating leases is accounted for on a straight-line 
basis over the period of the lease. Lease incentives provided are also recognised over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
Trade payables 
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods and services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. 
Accounts payable are classiﬁed as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business 
if longer). If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Trade payables are recognised at original invoice amount.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost;  
any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the 
period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some  
or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that  
it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised 
over the period of the facility to which it relates.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classiﬁed as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are shown  
in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Provisions for other liabilities and charges
Onerous contract provisions are recognised for losses on contracts where the forecast costs of fulﬁlling the contract throughout the contract 
period exceed the forecast income receivable. In assessing the amount of the loss to provide on any contract, account is taken of the Group’s 
share of the forecast results from any joint ventures which the contract is servicing. The provision is calculated based on discounted cash 
ﬂows to the end of the contract.
Vacant property provisions are recognised when the Group has committed to a course of action that will result in the property becoming 
vacant. The provision is calculated based on projected discounted cash ﬂows to the end of the lease, after making assumptions for void  
and rent free periods.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s Financial Statements in the period in which  
the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised when paid. 
Disposal groups held for sale
Disposal groups are classiﬁed as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction  
and a sale is considered highly probable. They are stated at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell.

Application of new IFRSs and interpretations
(a) New and amended standards adopted by the Group
There are no new IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are effective for the ﬁrst time during the current ﬁnancial year that would be expected  
to have a material impact on the Group.
(b)  New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the ﬁnancial year beginning 1 April 2011  
and not early adopted
 Amendment to IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures on derecognition (effective 1 July 2011)
 Amendment to IFRS 1, First time adoption, on ﬁxed dates and hyperinﬂation (effective 1 July 2011)
 Amendment to IAS 12, Income taxes, on deferred tax (effective 1 January 2012)
 Amendment to IAS 1, Financial statement presentation, regarding other comprehensive income (effective 1 July 2012)
 Amendment to IAS 19, Employee beneﬁts (effective 1 January 2013)
 IFRS 9, Financial instruments (effective 1 January 2015)
 IFRS 10, Consolidated ﬁnancial statements (effective 1 January 2013)
 IFRS 11, Joint arrangements (effective 1 January 2013)
 IFRS 12, Disclosures of interests in other entities (1 January 2013)
 IFRS 13, Fair value measurement (effective 1 January 2013)
 IAS 27 (revised 2011), Separate ﬁnancial statements (effective 1 January 2013)
 IAS 28 (revised 2011), Associates and joint ventures (effective 1 January 2013).
Of these, the amendment to IAS 19 and IFRS 9 are expected to have the most signiﬁcant effect on the Group’s Financial Statements.
IAS 19 was amended in June 2011. The impact on the Group will be as follows: to immediately recognise all past service costs; to amend  
the way in which administrative expenses are allowed for; and to replace interest cost and expected return on plan assets with a net interest 
amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability. The Group is yet to assess the full impact of the 
amendments. Changes to treatment of expenses are unlikely to result in a material change to the overall income statement charge, however 
had the standard been applied to next year’s ﬁnancial statements the combined estimated net ﬁnance cost for the Group’s deﬁned beneﬁt 
schemes would increase from circa £10m to circa £15m as a result of the removal of expected rate of returns.
IFRS 9 is expected to replace IAS 39, Financial instruments: recognition and measurement, from 2015, subject to EU adoption. IFRS 9 in  
issue at 31 March 2012 only concerns the classiﬁcation and measurement of ﬁnancial assets. New requirements for accounting for ﬁnancial 
liabilities, impairment and hedge accounting are still under discussion by the International Accounting Standards Board and the Financial 
Accounting Standards Board (US). The requirements for IFRS 9 in issue as at 31 March 2012 would result in the Group’s available-for-sale 
ﬁnancial assets being reclassiﬁed as ﬁnancial assets measured either at amortised cost or at fair value through proﬁt or loss. As a result, 
movements in the fair value of these assets would no longer be recognised in other comprehensive income. Retrospective application of this 
requirement would result in the closing balance of fair value movements recognised in other comprehensive income being transferred to 
retained earnings. The effect within the Group’s reserves at 31 March 2012 would be a transfer of £1.6m gain to retained earnings. 112 Financial Statements  
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2012
2. Financial risk management
Financial risk factors
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of ﬁnancial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk, fair value interest rate risk,  
cash ﬂow interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the 
unpredictability of ﬁnancial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s ﬁnancial performance. The Group  
uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. 
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department (Group Treasury) under policies approved by the Board of directors.  
Group Treasury identiﬁes, evaluates and hedges ﬁnancial risks in close cooperation with the Group’s operating units. The Board provides 
written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering speciﬁc areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest  
rate risk, credit risk and use of derivative ﬁnancial instruments, and investment of excess liquidity.
These policies are further described within the ‘Treasury policies and objectives’ section of the Business Review.
Where individual sensitivities are disclosed below, all other variables are held constant.
a) Market risk
Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, debt investments, deposits and derivative ﬁnancial instruments.  
The following foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk analysis, required by IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, is intended  
to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being primarily the US dollar to sterling and euro to sterling exchange rates,  
and UK interest rates.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis:
 changes in the fair value of ﬁnancial instruments designated as available-for-sale are recognised directly in other comprehensive income
 changes in the carrying value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments designated as hedges are fully effective with no impact on the 
Consolidated Income Statement 
 changes in the carrying value of other ﬁnancial instruments not in hedging relationships only affect the Consolidated Income Statement.
i) Foreign exchange risk 
The Group operates in a number of international territories. Each business undertakes a large proportion of its commercial transactions 
within its local market and in its local functional currency. Foreign exchange risk arises from a proportion of commercial transactions 
undertaken in currencies other than the local functional currency, from ﬁnancial assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other  
than the local functional currency and on the Group’s investments in foreign operations.
Group policy is for each business to undertake commercial transactions in its own functional currency whenever possible. When this is  
not possible, the Group manages its foreign exchange risk from future commercial transactions using appropriate derivative contracts 
arranged via Group Treasury. Cash ﬂows are reviewed on a monthly basis throughout the duration of projects and the future cover  
amended as appropriate.
Trade receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency arise from commercial transactions  
and are therefore largely hedged as part of the process described above. Remaining ﬁnancial assets and liabilities denominated in  
currencies other than the local functional currency include bank accounts, loans and intercompany funding balances. These are generally 
unhedged, with the exception of balances that are themselves designated as hedging instruments used to hedge the Group’s investments  
in foreign operations.
The Group’s primary exposure to foreign exchange risk on unhedged ﬁnancial instruments arises mainly in respect of movements  
between US dollar (including dollar-pegged currencies) and sterling and between the euro and sterling. At 31 March 2012, if sterling  
had strengthened/weakened by a reasonably possible change of 10% against the US dollar then proﬁt after tax would be higher/lower  
by approximately £1.4m (2011: £7.9m lower/higher) and equity would be £1.4m higher/lower (2011: £7.9m lower/higher). If sterling  
had strengthened/weakened by a reasonably possible change of 10% against the euro, then proﬁt after tax would be lower/higher  
by approximately £0.5m (2011: £0.1m higher/lower) and equity would be £0.5m lower/higher (2011: £0.1m higher/lower).
The Group has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk. A proportion  
of the currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Group’s foreign operations has been managed by taking out foreign currency 
loans in the relevant currency.
Notes to the Financial Statements 
continued  Financial Statements 113
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2012
Financial Statements
ii) Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and ﬁnancial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss which 
are all interest bearing, offset in part by interest bearing bank loans. The majority of these items are at ﬂoating rates of interest or ﬁxed 
deposits for periods of less than six months; changes in the interest rate results in changes in interest-related cash ﬂows. No interest hedging 
is currently undertaken by the Group or its subsidiaries. If interest rates for the year to 31 March 2012 had been 10 basis points higher/lower, 
then proﬁt after tax for the year would have been approximately £0.1m (2011: £0.2m) higher/lower.
iii) Price risk 
Price risk is the risk that a decline in the value of assets adversely impacts the proﬁtability of the Group.
The Group is exposed to equity securities price risk because of investments held by the Group and classiﬁed on the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet as ﬁnancial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss. To manage this risk, the Group diversiﬁes its portfolio. Diversiﬁcation of the 
portfolio is done in accordance with limits set by the Group.
The Group is also exposed to price risk because of investments held by the Group in unlisted corporate bonds (available-for-sale ﬁnancial 
assets). The fair value of these investments at 31 March 2012 was £6.1m (2011: £nil).
Management monitors exposures to price risk on an ongoing basis.
The Group is not materially exposed to commodity price risk. Certain longer term project and framework contracts include indexation clauses 
that are applied to unit rates to offset the effect of inﬂation on input costs over the duration of the agreement. The Group is exposed to 
price risk to the extent that inﬂation differs from the index used and forecast project outcomes that form the basis of revenue recognition 
include an estimate of this risk where it is present.
b) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that the Group will suffer ﬁnancial loss as a result of counterparties defaulting on their contractual obligations.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative ﬁnancial instruments and deposits with banks and ﬁnancial institutions, and 
investments in unlisted corporate bonds (available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets), as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding 
receivables and committed transactions, with the maximum exposure to the risk equivalent to 100% of the carrying value disclosed in  
the Group’s balance sheet at 31 March. The Group does not hold any collateral as security. The Group’s derivative ﬁnancial instruments  
and cash deposits are placed with banks which are rated investment grade. The Group’s policy is that cash and investments should not be 
concentrated with any one counterparty.
For trade and other receivables, concentration of credit risk is very limited due to the Group’s broad customer base. An assessment of credit 
quality of the customer is made where appropriate using a combination of external rating agencies, past experience and other factors. In 
circumstances where credit information is unavailable or poor, the risk is mitigated primarily by the use of advance payments. Exposure and 
payment performance are monitored closely both at individual project and client level, with a series of escalating debt recovery actions taken 
where necessary. In view of current economic circumstances, additional management attention has been focused on the recovery of debtors. 
c) Liquidity risk
 The Group funds its activities through cash generated from its operations and, where necessary, bank borrowings and ﬁnance leases.  
The Group’s banking facilities include cash facilities and bank guarantees. Cash ﬂow forecasting is performed in the operating entities  
of the Group and aggregated by Group Finance. Group Treasury monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity requirements to ensure  
it has sufﬁcient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufﬁcient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities.  
Such forecasting takes into consideration the Group’s debt ﬁnancing plans and covenant compliance.
Any surplus cash is invested by Group Treasury in interest bearing current accounts, term deposits and money market deposits,  
choosing instruments with appropriate maturities and sufﬁcient liquidity to provide sufﬁcient headroom as determined by the  
above-mentioned forecasts. 114 Financial Statements

Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide  
returns for shareholders and beneﬁts for other stakeholders, and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
The Group maintains or adjusts its capital structure through the payment of dividends to shareholders, issues of new shares and buyback  
of existing shares, and through its loan facility. 
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the ratio of net debt plus deﬁned beneﬁt pension deﬁcit net of deferred tax to EBITDA.  
This policy is unchanged from the prior year. 
The ratios of net debt plus deﬁned beneﬁt pension deﬁcit net of deferred tax to EBITDA at 31 March 2012 and 2011 were as follows:

The calculation as at 31 March 2011 was restated as a result of deferred tax being amended to reﬂect the ﬁnalisation of the accounting  
for the acquisition of The PBSJ Corporation, (note 20).
The Group’s banking facilities include a number of ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial covenants. Compliance with these covenants is monitored  
and as at 31 March 2012, and since, none of the covenants had been breached.
Fair value estimation
The table below analyses the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been  
deﬁned as follows:
Level 1 ﬁnancial instruments
 The fair value of ﬁnancial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. A market is 
regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service,  
or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s-length basis. The quoted 
market price used for ﬁnancial assets held by the Group is the mid-market price.
Level 2 ﬁnancial instruments
 The fair value of ﬁnancial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation 
techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on estimates. The fair value of 
certiﬁcates of deposit is calculated as the present value of the future cash ﬂows, discounted at an appropriate market rate of interest. 116 Financial Statements

3. Segmental information
The chief operating decision-maker has been identiﬁed as the chief executive ofﬁcer and the Group ﬁnance director. The chief executive 
ofﬁcer and the Group ﬁnance director review the Group’s internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources. 
Management has determined the operating segments based on these reports.
The chief executive ofﬁcer and the Group ﬁnance director assess the performance of the operating segments based on operating proﬁt 
before interest and tax. Information provided to the chief executive ofﬁcer and the Group ﬁnance director is measured in a manner 
consistent with that in the Financial Statements.

13. Earnings per share (EPS)
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of 
shares in issue during the year, excluding shares held by the Employee Beneﬁt Trusts (EBTs), which have not unconditionally vested in the 
employees, and shares held in treasury.
Diluted earnings per share is the basic earnings per share after allowing for the dilutive effect of the conversion into ordinary shares  
of the number of options outstanding during the year. The options relate to discretionary employee share plans.

Impairment test for goodwill
Goodwill is not amortised but tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of assets, at least once a year or more frequently 
where there is an indication that it may be impaired.
Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s CGUs identiﬁed to carry out the impairment test. The following is a summary of goodwill allocation  
by CGU or group of CGUs, summarised at the operating segment level:
2012 
£m 
Group
Restated
 2011
 £m
UK 30.6  30.6
North America 136.4  135.2
Middle East –  –
Asia Paciﬁc and Europe 14.3  14.5
Energy 23.7  11.7
Total 205.0  192.0
The impairment test involves comparing the carrying value of the CGU or group of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated including 
goodwill arising on in year acquisitions, to their recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is based on the higher of fair value less costs  
to sell and value in use. An impairment loss is recognised when the carrying value of those assets exceeds their recoverable amount.
Recoverable amount
Fair value less costs to sell is the best estimate of the amount obtainable from the sale of a CGU or group of CGUs in an arm’s-length 
transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties, less the costs of disposal. Value in use is the present value of the future cash ﬂows 
expected to be derived from the CGU or group of CGUs.
Fair value is assessed from an external perspective and value in use from a Group-internal perspective. Both are determined using a  
business valuation model, taking into account planned future cash ﬂows. If available, third-party valuations are taken as a basis for 
determining fair value.
Value in use calculations
Methodology
The internal value in use calculations use cash ﬂow projections based on the following ﬁnancial year’s budget approved by management.  
This budget is based on country-speciﬁc assumptions regarding the development of key economic indicators such as GDP and are, amongst 
others, derived from macroeconomic and ﬁnancial studies. The cash ﬂow projections from that budget are extrapolated for the next four 
years using GDP-based growth factors, and then extrapolated beyond that ﬁve year period using a terminal GDP-based growth rate. These 
growth rates are derived from experience and future expectations for the individual CGU or group of CGUs and do not exceed the long-term 
average growth rates in the markets in which the CGU or group of CGUs are active. The cash ﬂows are then discounted using the Group’s 
discount rates which reﬂect the speciﬁc risks relating to the relevant operating segments. These discount rates are based on nominal 
weighted average cost of capital.
Assumptions
The key assumptions used for the internal value in use calculations are as follows:
2012 
Group
 2011
Five-year growth rate 0%-5% 0%-6%
Post ﬁve-year growth rate 0%-5% 0%-2.5%
Taxation rate 23% 20%
Average pre-tax discount rate 14% 12% 128 Financial Statements  
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2012
These ranges of assumptions have been used for the analysis of each CGU or group of CGUs within the Group’s operating segments.  
Goodwill of £136.4m (2011: £135.2m) allocated to the North America operating segment includes £129.5m of goodwill arising on the 
acquisition of The PBSJ Corporation. This goodwill has been allocated to The PBSJ Corporation’s group of CGUs and is considered signiﬁcant 
in comparison with the Group’s total carrying amount of goodwill. The recoverable amount of this group of CGUs has been determined 
using an internal value in use calculation. The key assumptions used for this calculation are as follows:
2012
Five-year growth rate 3%
Post ﬁve-year growth rate 3%
Taxation rate 23%
Average pre-tax discount rate 12%
The carrying amount of intangible assets with indeﬁnite useful lives allocated to The PBSJ Corporation’s group of CGUs for the purposes  
of the impairment test is £2.4m. 
As at 31 March 2012 and 2011, based on these internal valuations, the recoverable value of goodwill required no impairment.
In the prior year, on 1 October 2010, the Group acquired The PBSJ Corporation and prior to 31 March 2011 the Group performed an 
impairment test of the goodwill arising on this acquisition. The recoverable amount of The PBSJ Corporation’s group of CGUs to which this 
goodwill was allocated was based on fair values less costs to sell. This amount was determined using an external valuation and the model 
used to support that valuation, which comprised a net present value calculation of future cash ﬂows. This calculation used cash ﬂow 
projections over a ﬁve year period. These projections were then extrapolated beyond that period using a terminal GDP based growth rate.
The key assumptions used in the net present value calculation of future cash ﬂows were as follows:
 
2011
Five-year growth rate 9%-16%
Post ﬁve-year growth rate 3%
Discount rate 17%
At 31 March 2011, based on this valuation, together with subsequent trading in the period following the acquisition, the recoverable amount 
of goodwill required no impairment.
16. Business combinations
Pöyry Pty Ltd, Pöyry Energy (Aberdeen) Limited and Pöyry Energy AS
On 3 June 2011, the Group acquired the oil and gas business of Pöyry plc (Pöyry). The acquisition included the integration of 130 staff across 
three locations: Aberdeen, Stavanger (Norway) and Perth (Australia).
The transaction included purchasing the entire share capital of Pöyry Pty Ltd (Perth, Australia), Pöyry Energy (Aberdeen) Limited (Aberdeen, 
UK) and Pöyry Energy AS (Stavanger, Norway), (together the Pöyry companies).
The acquisition expands the Group’s service offering in the oil and gas sector and provides a platform from which to grow in the world’s 
major oil and gas centres. In particular, the acquisition provides increased access to signiﬁcant gas developments and the liqueﬁed natural  
gas market in Western Australia.
As at 31 March 2012 the fair values of acquired assets, liabilities and goodwill for this business combination have been determined  
on a provisional basis, pending ﬁnalisation of the post-acquisition review of the fair value of the acquired net assets. Under IFRS 3,  
Business combinations, adjustments to these provisional values can be made within one year of the date of acquisition relating to facts  
and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. The ﬁnalised position will be reﬂected in the Group’s interim ﬁnancial statements  
for the six months ended 30 September 2012.
The goodwill of £12.0m arising from the acquisition is attributable to the extensive complementary skills which enable the combined 
operation to provide an enhanced offering to clients and extend the Group’s reach to new markets in Australia and Norway. None of  
the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

provisionally pending ﬁnalisation of the post-acquisition review of the fair value of the acquired net assets. Adjustments to these provisional 
values have been made in respect of The PBSJ Corporation (acquisition date 1 October 2010) and Technical Services Scotland (acquisition 
date 11 March 2011). The accounting for the acquisition of Gimsing & Madsen A/S (acquisition date 4 November 2010) has been ﬁnalised

The fair value of trade and other receivables is $178.5m (£113.0m) and includes trade receivables of $90.2m (£57.1m). The gross contractual 
amount of trade receivables due is $93.5m (£59.2m), of which $3.3m (£2.1m) is expected to be uncollectable.
The effect of the adjustments to the provisional values determined at 31 March 2011 is to reduce the fair value of trade and other receivables 
by $0.2m (£0.1m), to increase the fair value of trade and other payables by $7.5m (£4.9m) and to reduce the fair value of deferred tax 
liabilities by $2.9m (£1.9m), offset by an increase in goodwill of $4.8m (£3.1m). Certain assets and liabilities have also been reclassiﬁed 
between major classes of assets and liabilities.
The goodwill of £129.5m ($204.5m) arising from the acquisition is attributable to The PBSJ Corporation’s long-established market position 
and highly skilled and educated, assembled workforce, which will enhance the Group. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for 
income tax purposes.

Following the March 2011 Budget Statement, the main rate of UK corporation tax was reduced to 26% from 1 April 2011. Finance Act 2011 
enacted a reduction in the rate to 25% applicable from 1 April 2012. An additional 1% reduction was announced in the March 2012 Budget 
Statement resulting in a tax rate of 24% from 1 April 2012. Further reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate by 1% per 
annum to 22% by 1 April 2014 but these later reductions had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, are 
not included in these Financial Statements.
The proposed reductions in the main rate of UK corporation tax by 1% per year to 22% by 1 April 2014 are expected to be enacted separately 
each year. The overall effect of the further changes from 24% to 22%, if these applied to the deferred tax balance at 31 March 2012, would 
be to reduce the net deferred tax asset by approximately £6.2m (being £3.1m recognised in 2013 and £3.1m recognised in 2014).
During the prior year the Group made several acquisitions. The initial accounting for these at 31 March 2011 had been determined 
provisionally. Adjustments to these provisional values have since been made in respect of The PBSJ Corporation, as stated in note 16.  
The effect of these adjustments is that the value of deferred income tax assets at 31 March 2011 has been restated from £93.1m to £95.0m. 
Additionally, following a review of the offset available for deferred tax assets and liabilities in the various jurisdictions the comparatives have 
been restated.

Group is required to lend Connect Plus (M25) Intermediate Limited £20m over a period from May 2009 to October 2012. This funding is lent 
on by Connect Plus (M25) Intermediate Limited to Connect Plus (M25) Limited, the main trading entity for the Connect Plus M25 project and 
the company which holds the 30 year PFI contract with the Highways Agency to design, build, fund and then operate and maintain the M25. 
One of the subcontractors used by Connect Plus (M25) Limited to deliver its main obligations under this project is Connect Plus Services. The

The Group operates both deﬁned beneﬁt and deﬁned contribution pension schemes. The two main deﬁned beneﬁt schemes are the  
Atkins Pension Plan (the Plan) and the Railways Pension Scheme, both of which are funded ﬁnal salary schemes. The assets of both schemes 
are held in separate trustee-administered funds. Other pension schemes include the Atkins McCarthy Pension Plan in the Republic of Ireland, 
which is a ﬁnal salary funded deﬁned beneﬁt scheme, and a range of deﬁned contribution schemes or equivalent.
The Plan is closed to the future accrual of beneﬁt; all deﬁned beneﬁt members of the Plan were transferred to a deﬁned contribution  
section for future service where it was clear they did not beneﬁt from a statutory or contractual right to a ﬁnal salary pension.
Notes to the Financial Statements

WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2012

On 1 February 2012 and following a consultation programme with employees who are members of the Plan, Atkins Limited (the Group’s 
principal UK employing company) removed the link between individual employees’ accrued pension and future increases in salary via 
contractual amendment. The reduction in the past service liability is £30.9m and this has been recognised as a curtailment gain in the year 
ended 31 March 2012.
In addition, primarily to reduce further future volatility of any deﬁcit, Atkins Limited undertook an enhanced transfer value (ETV) exercise  
for deferred members of the Plan. The exercise gave rise to a settlement gain under IAS 19 in respect of those members who transferred  
out their beneﬁts. The reduction in the past service liability was £1.5m and the reduction of the assets was £1.3m, giving rise to a settlement 
gain of £0.2m which has been recognised in the year ended 31 March 2012.
A further 248 members elected to transfer their beneﬁts prior to 31 March 2012, although the actual transfers had not occurred by this  
date. An allowance for this has been made in these disclosures. Estimated assets of £14.0m are to be transferred alongside £15.6m of 
liabilities which gives rise to a settlement gain of £1.6m reﬂected in the Consolidated Income Statement and an equal reduction in the 
deﬁned beneﬁt obligation. 
As a result of the sale of the UK Asset Management business during the year, certain active members left the Building Management Section 
of the Plan on 30 November 2011. The individuals retain their past service accrued beneﬁts in the Plan, however a curtailment gain arises 
under IAS 19 as the link to future salary increases for these members was broken at the time of the sale. The reduction in the past service 
liability for this event was £0.6m and this has been recognised as a curtailment gain in the year ended 31 March 2012. 
In the previous year, on 8 July 2010, the UK Government announced that private sector pension schemes should be able to link inﬂationary 
pension increases to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rather than the Retail Price Index (RPI). For the Railways Pension Scheme, the rules of the 
scheme imply that the move from RPI to CPI would impact the increases granted to pensions in payment and to increases granted to deferred 
pensions. Calculations for the Railways Pension Scheme are therefore based on a CPI-based inﬂation assumption. The effect of this change in 
the year ended 31 March 2011 was to reduce the liabilities by £27m. The Plan continues to apply RPI for the purpose of indexation.
The Atkins McCarthy Pension Plan is also closed to future accrual of beneﬁts for members who do not beneﬁt from a statutory or contractual 
right to a ﬁnal salary pension. These members transferred to the Personal Retirement Savings Accounts – Ireland (PRSA – Irish Life) scheme. 
The deﬁned beneﬁt sections of all pension schemes are closed to new entrants, who are offered membership of the deﬁned  
contribution scheme.

Restricted members in 2011 consisted of staff who were no longer accruing ﬁnal salary beneﬁts but who retained their entitlement to 
pensions linked to ﬁnal salary based on years of service accumulated prior to the closure of the scheme to future accrual. As a result of the 
exercise to remove the link between individual employees’ accrued pension and future increases in salary, these staff are now disclosed as 
deferred pensioners. In both cases, these staff are also included where appropriate within deﬁned contribution schemes.  142 Financial Statements

The actuarial tables used to calculate the retirement beneﬁt liabilities for the Plan were the Self-Administered Pension Schemes (SAPS)  
tables, with medium cohort improvements from 2002 to 2009 and a scaling factor of 0.85/0.90 for males/females respectively.  
Future improvements are based on CMI improvements with a 1.5% per annum improvement trend, based on year of use application.  
The Railways Pension Scheme results have been adjusted on an approximate basis to be based on the same mortality tables.

The Group expects employer contributions to be paid during the ﬁnancial year to 31 March 2012 to be circa £29.3m, of which £26.0m is in 
relation to the funding of the actuarial deﬁcit, and employee contributions paid to be circa £1.6m. Expected beneﬁt payments made directly 
by the Group to pensioners in the ﬁnancial year to 31 March 2013 are £nil.
The approximate effect on the liabilities from changes in the main assumptions used to value the liabilities are as follows: 
Change in assumption Effect on plan liabilities
 Atkins Pension Plan Railways Pension Scheme
Discount rate increase/decrease 0.5% decrease/increase 10.0% decrease/increase 8.0%
Inﬂation increase/decrease 0.5%increase/decrease 7.0% increase/decrease 8.0%
Real rate of increase in salaries increase/decrease 0.5% increase/decrease 2.0% increase/decrease 2.0%
Longevity increase 1 year increase 3.0% increase 2.0%
The effect of the change in inﬂation on liabilities assumes a corresponding increase in salary increases and inﬂation-related pension increases. 
b) Other post-employment beneﬁt liabilities 
The Group operates unfunded schemes within certain of its non-UK businesses, including Gratuity schemes, Key Employee Supplemental 
Option Plans (KESOP) and post-retirement medical beneﬁt schemes. 
Members of the Gratuity schemes are entitled to receive a cash gratuity on leaving the business which is dependent on their length of 
employment and ﬁnal salary. Valuation of the gratuity obligation is carried out in line with the principles of IAS 19, Employee beneﬁts.
The Group operates a KESOP plan providing some key ofﬁcers and employees in its North American business (the business) with post-
retirement beneﬁts, known as a Supplemental Income Program (SIP). The SIP is an unfunded plan that provides participants with retirement 
income for a speciﬁed period of between 5 and 15 years upon retirement, death or disability. The plan ﬁxes a minimum level for retirement 
beneﬁts to be paid to participants based on the participant’s position in the business, their age and service at retirement. Additionally, certain 
executive agreements have been amended to provide post-retirement medical beneﬁts to those employees and their spouses, at a level 
substantially similar to those medical and hospitalisation beneﬁts paid and provided to senior executives currently employed by the business. 
The insurance beneﬁts will be provided without any further or additional services from the employee to the business and they will be paid  
for and provided for as long as the employee and their spouse shall live.

Long Term Incentive Plans
Atkins Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) September 2006 onwards
A share plan for senior executives and key employees used to make awards to employees that are settled in equity or, in limited 
circumstances, in cash. There are different performance targets for different categories of management. Awards made to executive  
directors and senior employees have 50% of the award subject to the Company’s total shareholder return (TSR) performance relative to the 
constituents of the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) at the start of the performance period. Full vesting of this portion of the 
award will take place if the Company is ranked in the upper quartile and 30% vesting will be achieved with a median ranking, with pro rata 
vesting for intermediate performance. No vesting will occur for a ranking below median.
The remaining 50% of the award made to executive directors and senior employees is subject to the Company’s real growth in underlying/
normalised earnings per share (EPS) over the performance period. For the 2006 and subsequent awards, the growth target required the 
increase to be more than 10% per annum above the UK Retail Price Index (RPI) in the three-year performance period to allow full vesting;  
if the increase is less than 4% per annum above the UK RPI, then there will be no vesting. A sliding scale operates between 4% and 10% 
above the UK RPI.
Awards made to other participants are subject solely to the EPS condition. As a general rule, awards made to participants who leave 
employment prior to vesting will be forfeited. In the event a participant leaves as a result of a qualifying reason, they receive a pro-rated 
entitlement.
Subject to vesting, participants are entitled to receive the beneﬁt of dividends declared following award, without interest.
Atkins Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) September 2003 to August 2006 
A share plan for senior executives and key employees used to make awards to employees that are settled in equity or, in limited 
circumstances, in cash. The performance condition was TSR with an EPS growth underpin measured over three ﬁnancial years starting with 
the ﬁnancial year beginning immediately after the award was granted. Full vesting of any award took place for a TSR performance where  
the Company ranked in the top 20% in a group of up to 16 comparator companies, 30% vesting for median ranking and no award if  
TSR fell below the median. The EPS underpin was the UK RPI plus 2% per annum. As a general rule, awards made to participants who left 
employment prior to vesting were forfeited. In the event a participant left as a result of a qualifying reason, they received a pro-rated 
entitlement. All awards have now vested.
Deferred Share Plans
Atkins Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP)
A share plan for senior executives and key employees used to make awards to employees that are settled in equity or, in limited circumstances, 
in cash. There is no performance condition but awards are restricted for at least three years from the date of award. As a general rule, awards 
made to participants who leave employment prior to vesting will be forfeited. In the event a participant leaves as a result of a qualifying 
reason, they will receive their award in full. Subject to vesting, participants are entitled to receive the beneﬁt of dividends declared following 
award, without interest.
Atkins Deferred Share Plan (DSP)
A share plan for senior executives and key employees used to make awards to employees that are settled in equity or in cash. There is no 
performance condition but awards are restricted for a set period, ﬁxed by the Remuneration Committee at grant, from the date of the 
award. As a general rule, awards made to participants who leave employment prior to vesting will be forfeited. In the event a participant 
leaves as a result of a qualifying reason, they will receive their award in full. Awards may be granted to an executive director under the plan 
but only in connection with the deferral of an annual bonus entitlement. Awards may also be granted under the plan to employees that do 
not form part of their annual bonus. Subject to vesting, participants are entitled to receive the beneﬁt of dividends declared following award, 
without interest.

WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2012
At 31 March 2012 the Company’s Employee Beneﬁt Trusts held a beneﬁcial interest in 2,589,261 shares (2011: 2,105,603 shares)  
at a nominal value of £0.0m (2011: £0.0m) and market value of £19.0m (2011: £14.8m).
For the purposes of valuing LTIP awards with market performance conditions, the Monte Carlo model has been used to arrive at the 
share-based payments charge. The assumptions used in the model are as follows:
LTIP  LTIP 
 2012 2011 
Exercise price £nil £nil
Risk-free interest rate n/a 1%
Discount in respect of dividend yield 0% 0%
Volatility of share price 38.0% 39.0%
Share price at grant date: 
– 21/06/2010 698.5p 698.5p
– 20/06/2011 760.0p – 
Expected term 3 years from
grant date
3 years from
grant date
Volatility was determined based on the movement in share price over a period prior to the grant date equal in length to the period over 
which the TSR condition applies, which equates to a three-year share price history (2011: three-year share price history). The fair value of 
share plans involving market performance conditions takes into account market information.
In accordance with the rules of the plan, the Monte Carlo model simulates TSR for the Company and a comparator group. In 2012 and 2011 
the comparator group consisted of the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts. The model takes into account historic dividends and share price 
volatilities for the Company and the comparator group to produce a predicted distribution of relative share performance. 
Awards that do not contain market performance conditions are valued at market value at the date of award and discounted in the event that 
the award does not beneﬁt from dividends during the vesting period.
The weighted average fair value of awards granted during the year was 723.04 pence (2011: 685.14 pence).

37. Contingent liabilities
The Group has given indemnities in respect of performance and contractual-related bonds, as well as letters of credit issued on its behalf.  
The amount outstanding at 31 March 2012 includes £4.0m in respect of Connect Plus M25 letters of credit and £6.6m letters of credit issued 
as a result of the PBSJ acquisition.
During the prior year the Group acquired The PBSJ Corporation. Prior to the acquisition, the Audit Committee of the Board of directors of 
PBSJ undertook an internal investigation to determine whether any laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), had been 
violated in connection with certain projects undertaken by PBS&J International, Inc. (one of PBSJ’s subsidiary undertakings). The investigation 
suggested that FCPA violations may have occurred but did not extend beyond the International operation and that none of PBSJ’s executive 
management were involved in criminal conduct. PBSJ voluntarily disclosed this matter to the Department of Justice and to the SEC and is 
cooperating fully with their review. The FCPA provides for penalties, criminal and civil sanctions and other remedies. Neither at the date of 
acquisition nor at subsequent year ends has management been able to estimate the potential penalties that may be imposed and therefore 
no provision has been made. It is not considered possible to determine an accurate estimate of the ﬁnes and penalties imposed as they are 
not formula driven or in any way the result of a predeﬁned calculation. The Group does not have an estimate of when this will be resolved 
but it is considered unlikely to be within the next ﬁnancial year.
Group companies are from time to time involved in claims and litigation. The Group carries signiﬁcant Professional Indemnity insurance cover 
for such claims.

Unsolicited mail
The Company is obliged by law to make 
its share register available to third parties 
who may then use it for a mailing list. If 
you are a UK shareholder and you wish  
to limit receipt of unsolicited mail you  
may do so by registering with the Mailing 
Preference Service (MPS). Registration can 
be made online at www.mpsonline.org.uk 
or via telephone on 0845 703 4599.
Giving your shares to charity
If you only have a small number of shares 
whose value makes it uneconomic to sell 
them, you may wish to consider donating 
them to charity though ShareGift, an 
independent share donation scheme.  
The relevant share transfer form can be 
obtained from the registrar. ShareGift  
is administered by The Orr Mackintosh 
Foundation, registered charity number 
1052686. Further information may be 
obtained on +44 (0)20 7930 3737  
or from www.sharegift.org.
Identity theft
Identity theft is on the increase. Criminals 
may steal your personal information, 
putting your Atkins shareholding at risk.
 
Tips for protecting your Atkins shares:
 ensure all your certiﬁcates are kept  
in a safe place or hold your shares 
electronically in CREST via a nominee
 keep all correspondence from the 
registrar that shows your shareholder 
reference number in a safe place,  
or destroy your correspondence  
by shredding it
 if you change address inform the 
registrar in writing or via our share 
portal at www.myatkinsshares.com
 know when dividends are paid and 
consider having your dividend paid 
directly into your bank account. This will 
reduce the risk of the cheque being 
intercepted or lost in the post. If you 
change your bank account, inform the 
registrar of the details of your new 
account. You can do this by post  
or online using our share portal at 
www.myatkinsshares.com. Respond  
to any letters the registrar sends you  
about this
 if you receive a letter from the registrar 
regarding a change of address or  
a dividend instruction but have not 
recently moved or requested a change 
to how you receive your dividends 
please contact them immediately  
as you may have been a victim  
of identity theft
 if you are buying or selling shares only 
deal with brokers registered in your 
country of residence or the UK.
Warning to shareholders
Share fraud includes scams where 
investors are called out of the blue and 
offered shares that often turn out to be 
worthless or non-existent, or an inﬂated 
price for shares they own. These calls 
come from fraudsters operating in ‘boiler 
rooms’ that are mostly based abroad.
While high proﬁts are promised, those  
who buy or sell shares in this way usually 
lose their money.
The Financial Services Authority (FSA)  
has found most share fraud victims are 
experienced investors who lose an 
average of £20,000, with around  
£200m lost in the UK each year.
If you are offered unsolicited investment 
advice, discounted shares, a premium 
price for shares you own, or free company 
or research reports, you should take these 
steps before handing over any money:
1.  get the name of the person and 
organisation contacting you
2.  check the FSA Register at  
www.fsa.gov.uk/fsaregister to ensure 
they are authorised
3.  use the details on the FSA Register  
to contact the ﬁrm
4.  call the FSA Consumer Helpline on 
0845 606 1234 if there are no contact 
details on the FSA Register or you are 
told they are out of date
5.  search our list of unauthorised  
ﬁrms and individuals to avoid doing 
business with
6.  remember: if it sounds too good  
to be true, it probably is.
If you use an unauthorised ﬁrm to buy  
or sell shares or other investments, you 
will not have access to the Financial 
Ombudsman Service or Financial Services 
Compensation Scheme (FSCS) if things  
go wrong.
If you are approached about a share scam 
you should tell the FSA using the share 
fraud reporting form at www.fsa.gov.uk/
scams, where you can ﬁnd out about the 
latest investment scams. You can also  
call the FSA Consumer Helpline on  
0845 606 1234.
If you have already paid money to share 
fraudsters you should contact Action 
Fraud on 0300 123 2040. WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2012

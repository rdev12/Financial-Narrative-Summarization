Significant discovery announced in 2009 with 
the Miran West discovery well. Exploration 
and appraisal drilling continues in 2010.  
The Miran West-2 well has intersected 
hydrocarbon-bearing intervals over 
approximately 1,800 metres within the 
Cretaceous formations. The well is drilling to 
the deeper Jurassic and Triassic exploration 
targets with the potential to contain substantial 
volumes of additional hydrocarbons.
Planned to acquire 1,000 kilometres of 
seismic in 2010 with the first exploration well 
in the area planned for the fourth quarter. 
The well will target a structure with a 
potential 500 mmboe.
Production set to increase over the year 
with additional development drilling. The 
Zapadno Chumpasskoye Field 
development project was approved in 
2009 to develop the field utilising 
horizontal drilling technology and expand 
the current production facilities.
Currently awaiting Presidential Decree. 
Management considers the DRC side of the 
Albert Basin to be potentially as prospective 
for significant oil accumulations as the 
Ugandan side.
Pioneering company with entry into Uganda 
in 1997 . Six successful wells drilled. Proved

OVERVIEW

CHAIRMAN’S  
STATEMENT
I am pleased to report that 
2009 has been another 
momentous year for 
Heritage. We have 
crystallised value with the 
disposal of our Omani 
interests and the proposed 
disposal of our Ugandan 
interests. We are now 
moving forward into a 
new chapter of core area 
activities.
It is with some sadness that we prepare to 
leave Uganda, but this is countered with 
pride that we have left a lasting legacy 
which has benefited people in our 
concession areas and has established a 
hydrocarbon future capable of supporting 
infrastructure and industrial development. 
This will have lasting benefits for the people 
of Uganda. We have established a solid 
base for other companies to build upon and 
we fully expect new entrants into Uganda to 
continue with the numerous corporate 
social responsibility (“CSR”) programmes 
that we have initiated and pursued with 
enthusiastic support from Ugandans 
individually and from the Ugandan 
Government. 
As we prepare to dispose of our interests in 
Uganda, which has been a core area of 
focus for us, it seems appropriate to reflect 
briefly on the evolution of Heritage. We 
listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange at the 
beginning of 1999 with a market 
capitalisation of less than $15 million and 
assets focused in Uganda and Congo. 
Through our own initiatives and technical 
expertise, combined with excellent strategic 
guidance, Heritage has evolved into a 
company with a market capitalisation at 
year end of $2.0bn with an extensive 
portfolio of core assets focused on Africa, 
the Middle East and Russia.
Heritage was the pioneering company in the 
Albert Basin. Entering Uganda in 1997, 
Heritage was the first company to explore 
for and operate Ugandan oil and gas 
interests in almost 60 years. Our entry into 
the region was exploration-led because we 
believed, from the geology, that it had the 
potential to be a significant oil basin. Our 
first licence covered the original Block 3. We 
were active on our licence for four years 
before Energy Africa farmed into our 
acreage. In 2004, part of Block 3 was 
relinquished and Block 3A, which covered 
most of the exploration acreage in the 
original Block 3, was re-licenced along with 
Block 1 at the northern end of the basin. 
Over the last 13 years we have carried out 
extensive work in the basin. Since 2006, we 
have drilled six wells on our licences, all of 
which have found hydrocarbons. The two 
wells tested in our licence areas each 
produced at rates in excess of 12,000 bopd. 
In addition to new field discoveries, we  
also established many other leads and 
prospects in our licence areas which 
have confirmed the Albert Basin to have 
multi-billion barrel resource potential. 
Our operations in Uganda have adhered 
consistently to CSR policies which we are 
now beginning to extend to our other core 
area holdings as work commences in these 
new areas. We expect to achieve significant 
value accretion for our shareholders in a 
work environment that benefits local 
populations and establishes legacy assets 
that sustain long-term benefits for the 
countries in which we are working.
Operations
Uganda
In 2009, in Uganda, we continued building 
on successes achieved in 2008. The Giraffe 
discovery in Block 1, at the beginning of 
2009, allowed us to exceed comfortably the 
required commercial threshold for 
development. This enabled us to progress 
methodically with our work with the 
Government of Uganda to plan for an early 
phased development, based initially on our 
Kingfisher discovery in Block 3A and 
progressing to commercialisation of 
the Albert Basin. 
Kurdistan
Heritage commenced drilling the Miran 
West-1 well in December 2008, less than  
15 months after being awarded the licence, 
demonstrating both the Company’s 
operational efficiency and our commitment 
to the region. Initial testing operations 
concluded in May 2009. The Miran Field has 
been estimated to have oil-in-place of 
3.4 billion barrels. Further testing on the 
Miran West-1 well indicated that it could 
produce at between 8,000–10,000 bopd.

Heritage Oil Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009
We announced in April 2010, that the Miran 
West-2 appraisal well had intersected 
significant hydrocarbon-bearing intervals 
over approximately 1,800 metres within the 
Cretaceous formations. The well is now 
drilling down to the deeper Jurassic  
and Triassic exploration targets with the 
potential to contain substantial volumes  
of additional hydrocarbons.
Combined Code of Corporate Governance
We recognise our responsibility to 
shareholders for the Company’s standard 
of governance and we also recognise the 
importance of maintaining responsible 
corporate governance practices. I am 
pleased to advise our shareholders that  
we have made further progress during the 
year to advance our adherence to the 
Combined Code on Corporate Governance 
published in 2008 (the “Combined Code”).
In 2009, General Sir Michael Wilkes was 
appointed Senior Independent Director to 
comply with the Combined Code. His 
chief responsibility is to maintain sufficient 
contact with major shareholders to help 
develop a balanced understanding of their 
issues and concerns. In this role, General 
Sir Michael Wilkes is available to 
shareholders who have concerns 
that have not been, or cannot be, resolved 
through discussion with the Chairman, 
Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial 
Officer or where such contact 
is inappropriate. 
Other significant developments during 
2009 and early 2010 included establishing 
a performance evaluation process for the 
Board and Board committees and for the 
Chairman, developing a formal framework 
for remuneration policy across the 
Company, confirming no annual bonuses 
would be paid to the Non-Executive 
Directors, undertaking an independent 
review of Executive Directors’ 
remuneration, developing the Company’s 
processes for reviewing key risks, internal 
controls and assessments, initiating 
processes for reviewing Director 
appointment and succession planning, 
establishing a Reserves Committee and 
establishing a CSR Committee. 
Corporate Social Responsibility
We remain committed to adhering to our 
CSR policies and recognise the importance 
of engaging with local stakeholders at an 
early stage. The framework of our CSR 
policy has been refined through our 
experiences in Uganda where we have 
worked diligently with stakeholders to allay 
potential concerns arising from our activities 
and to address needs and requirements in  
a way that establishes a respected local 
reputation and identity for us. We believe 
that our active, ongoing involvement in 
community projects in Uganda and 
Kurdistan is fundamental in developing  
and maintaining strong relationships within 
these regions. 
Outlook
Kurdistan remains a focus area for Heritage 
this year. As we continue with drilling on the 
Miran West structure and in the second half 
of the year plan to start exploration drilling 
on the Miran East structure, we expect to 
confirm the enormous potential of the Miran 
Block. 2010 will also bring to the fore a new 
set of projects and initiatives based on 
seismic and drilling campaigns in Malta and 
Pakistan scheduled for the second half of 
the year. 
The Board believes that Heritage, with its 
technical and financial strengths, will 
continue to identify further attractive growth 
opportunities. The portfolio of assets within 
Heritage offers shareholders geographical 
diversification combined with a mix of 
exploration, development and production. 
This, together with a strong financial base, 
positions Heritage perfectly to pursue 
exciting opportunities. 
Our management team has a track record 
of creating value for shareholders and holds 
a strong determination to continue that

successful track record. Development of 
our Company could not have been achieved 
without the determination, commitment and 
dedication of our management team and 
our staff, together with contractors and 
suppliers. The Board thanks them all for 
their continued efforts and professionalism.

Business Review
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S 
STATEMENT
2009 saw further 
significant operational 
success and corporate 
developments in our core 
assets in Uganda and 
Kurdistan propelling 
Heritage forward into a 
new phase as we enter a 
new decade. 
We are demonstrating the success of our 
strategy as a first-mover by the proposed 
monetisaton of our Ugandan interests and 
are considering many new opportunities 
with the potential to generate value for our 
shareholders.
After reaching five-year lows, equity markets 
saw a recovery during 2009. Brent Oil prices 
moved up from the low of $36.40 per barrel 
in January 2009 to a high of $79.20 per 
barrel in November 2009 and the outlook for 
the oil and gas markets remains positive. 
Leading figures around the world 
acknowledge that demand for hydrocarbons 
will continue to increase as both populations 
and economies grow. Since much of the 
“easy oil” has already been discovered, it is 
frontier exploration that will be required to 
satisfy this growth. These areas often come 
with their challenges which we consider we 
are well equipped to manage through our 
experienced management and technical 
teams and our proven operating capability. 
Uganda
At the beginning of 2009, we announced  
the successful Giraffe discovery in Block 1, 
Uganda, adding to our previous discoveries in 
the block, Warthog and Buffalo. Pressure and 
seismic data indicate that the Giraffe discovery 
is structurally connected to the Buffalo Field, 
creating a combined Buffalo-Giraffe Field 
covering approximately 48 square kilometres 
with an oil column of approximately 
140 metres. This was a pivotal discovery that 
confirmed the viability of the Albert Basin as a 
commercial oil basin. The success of our 
multi-well programme, which began in 
October 2008, is evident with net contingent 
resources that have been estimated at 250 
million barrels. 
In February 2009, we completed the drilling 
of the successful Kingfisher-3A sidetrack well 
which appraised the Kingfisher discovery in 
Block 3A. This well intersected all three 
Kingfisher reservoir intervals encountered in 
the Kingfisher-1A and -2 wells. All three 
Kingfisher wells have been suspended as 
future producers. 
Since discovering the Kingfisher Field in  
2007 , net contingent resources in Heritage 
operated Blocks 1 and 3A have been 
estimated at 355 million barrels with a value 
of $1.126 billion, based on a discount rate 
of 10%.
Kurdistan
Kurdistan remains a core area for Heritage. 
Since signing the licence in October 2007 , we 
have shot seismic, drilled a discovery well on 
the Miran West structure and are currently 
drilling the Miran West-2 well. This is a huge 
achievement demonstrating our commitment 
to the region and confirming the high level of 
operational expertise within Heritage. 
The Miran West-1 exploration well 
commenced drilling on 21 December 2008 
and initial testing operations completed in  
May 2009. A gross oil bearing column of 
approximately 700 metres was discovered and 
the oil in place for the field has been estimated 
to be approximately 3.4 billion barrels with net 
combined contingent and prospective 
resources totalling approximately a billion 
barrels. Excellent recoveries, of between 
50–70%, are expected from the fractured 
carbonate reservoirs, based on fracture 
porosity alone. During testing operations, 
concluded in August 2009, the Miran West-1 
well flowed at a maximum rate of 3,640 bopd 
from a single reservoir interval. 
We announced in April 2010 that the Miran 
West-2 appraisal well had intersected 
hydrocarbon-bearing intervals over 
approximately 1,800 metres within the 
Cretaceous formations. Three zones, 
determined from logging, within the 
Cretaceous formations have been identified  
for testing once drilling operations have 
completed. 
The well is being deepened to approximately 
4,600 metres to explore further potential in the 
underlying Jurassic and Triassic structures. 
These exploration targets have the potential to 
contain substantial volumes of additional 
hydrocarbons. We are planning to acquire 3D 
seismic over the Miran Block in the second

half of 2010 to enable further appraisal drilling 
to encounter the fracture networks efficiently. 
The Miran West-1 well has previously 
demonstrated that where open fractures are 
encountered in wells the reservoir will support 
potential production rates of approximately 
10,000 bopd. 
Future plans for drilling of the Miran East-1 
exploration well are progressing and we are 
looking to contract a rig for later this year.
Russia
The Zapadno Chumpasskoye Field is located 
in Western Siberia. Approval was received at 
the end of 2009 for a Field Development Plan 
to enable us to commence horizontal drilling 
to improve the recovery efficiency and also to 
enhance the economics of the field. The field 
was shut in for most of the first quarter of 
2009 following a temporary reduction in 
domestic oil prices in Russia. After 
production restarted, measures were 
undertaken to increase output to the current 
production rate of approximately 650 bopd.
Financial and Corporate
With the disposal of the Oman operations  
in April 2009, oil production and revenue  
is now generated from the Zapadno 
Chumpasskoye Field in Russia. Heritage’s  
net production decreased by 13% to an 
average of 329 bopd during 2009, compared 
to 2008, as a result of the field being shut in 
during 2009. 
During 2009, our liquidity was enhanced 
through two initiatives. Firstly, in April 2009, 
$28.4 million was realised through the sale of 
Eagle Energy (Oman) Limited (“Eagle Energy”). 
Secondly, in June 2009, 25.4 million new 
Ordinary Shares were placed successfully at a 
price of £5.20 per share for total gross 
proceeds of $217 million.
In November 2009, we announced that a 
Letter of Intent (“LOI”) had been signed with 
ENI International B.V. (“Eni”) to sell our 
Ugandan interests for up to $1.5 billion. In 
December 2009 a Sale and Purchase 
Agreement (the “SPA”) was executived with 
Eni. Subsequently, Tullow Uganda Limited, 
our partner in the blocks, exercised its right of 
pre-emption on the same terms and 
conditions as agreed with Eni. In April 2010, 
we announced that we had received a letter 
from the Ugandan Government stating that it 
supports Heritage’s sale and transfer of its 
Ugandan interests and that it will conclude its 
review of the transaction within eight weeks. 
Following this, Heritage expects to receive 
formal consent and to close the transaction 
shortly thereafter.
On completing the disposal we will have 
operations in seven countries and some of 
the disposal proceeds will be used to 
accelerate exploration, appraisal and 
development of these areas. Furthermore, 
Heritage will have the financial flexibility to 
participate in opportunities to generate 
further value for shareholders.
Other 2010 Operations 
Operations are planned to expand in Malta this 
year with the acquisition of 1,000 kilometres 
of seismic and the drilling of an exploration 
well. Heritage has already identified a number 
of large targets from over 3,500 kilometres of 
seismic acquired when the Company was 
awarded the Malta licences at the end of 2007 .
In Pakistan, we are in the process of acquiring 
infill seismic in the Zamzama North Block. The 
current seismic database used to map the 
Zamzama North Block comprises some 750 
kilometres of fair to good quality, 2D seismic. 
On the basis of this data we have mapped a 
number of structural leads. An exploration well 
is planned to be drilled in the second half of 
this year following interpretation of the current 
seismic programme.
Genel Enerji A.S.
In June 2009, Heritage announced that it had 
entered into a non-binding Memorandum of 
Understanding with Genel Enerji A.S. (“Genel”) 
to acquire the entire share capital of Genel 
Energy International Limited (“Genel Energy”). 
In November 2009, after signing a LOI with  
Eni for the sale of our Ugandan interests, 
discussions with Genel were terminated  
before the terms of a definitive agreement  
had been settled.
Operating Capability
We are proud of both our environmental and 
safety records. We have continued our goal 
of pursuing operational excellence and have 
achieved the challenging goals set for last 
year. In addition, we have also maintained 
an excellent track record of no significant 
environmental issues. Last year’s lost time 
incident frequency rate was well below 
industry average and was achieved at a 
time when Heritage’s operational scope 
increased significantly. 
Outlook
2010 is set to be another significant year  
for Heritage. We have never been stronger 
financially and we believe that we have a  
very valuable and prospective portfolio  
which will see high impact drilling in 
Kurdistan, Malta and Pakistan. Capital 
expenditures in 2010 are expected to be 
approximately $155 million, of which 
approximately $100 million will be allocated  
to exploration and appraisal activities and

development activities.
In summary, 2010 promises to be a year  
of significant change for Heritage as we 
increase production, continue with high 
impact exploration and look for further 
exciting opportunities for our portfolio. 
 
As always, I am very grateful to our talented 
management team and employees and

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S  
Q&A
Anthony Buckingham, CEO, answers some frequently  
asked questions about the progress and future of 
Heritage.
What, for you, were the 
highlights of 2009?
A. 2009 was a remarkable year for Heritage 
and marked another milestone in our 
development. Operational success continued 
in Uganda where we concluded our 
successful drilling campaigns in both blocks 
and in Kurdistan where we announced the 
significant Miran West-1 discovery. From a 
corporate perspective, we are in the process 
of disposing of our Ugandan interests and  
we raised $217 million through a successful 
offering of Ordinary Shares last summer. The 
proposed sale of our Ugandan interests is a 
demonstration of our ability to seek an early 
opportunity, based on our strong technical 
capability and network of relationships,  
and to successfully operate, explore and 
monetise. Delivering on our promises in this 
respect has been a wonderful achievement.
What does 2010 hold for 
Heritage?
A. 2010 will continue to be a very 
interesting year for Heritage as we have  
a diversified drilling programme and the 
financial flexibility to accelerate programme 
execution in several of our core areas. In the 
near-term the main priorities for the Group 
are to continue to drive our current portfolio 
forward with drilling in Kurdistan, Malta and 
Pakistan. 2010 will be full of many exciting 
opportunities for our Company. Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Overview

Heritage Oil Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009
What are the key components 
of your strategy?
A. We aim to continue to generate growth 
in shareholder value by focusing on high 
impact international plays with the potential 
to discover significant hydrocarbon 
reserves. We look to acquire and invest  
in exploration and early development 
opportunities throughout the world, with  
a particular emphasis on our core areas 
where we have a strong technical 
understanding. By entering into regions 
early we seek to obtain a large equity 
interest and operatorship.
How would you describe the 
culture at Heritage?
A. We have an excellent track record of 
attracting and retaining talented personnel. 
All staff are encouraged to participate in the 
development of the Company. Heritage is 
an ambitious company that is moving fast. 
We attract individuals, therefore, with the 
same ambitions who want to seek out high 
impact, value creating opportunities.
 
What is the Company’s 
approach to CSR and how has 
this developed?
A. Heritage has always recognised that our 
licence to operate is closely linked to our 
adoption of CSR concepts. A key element 
of this is our approach to the conduct of  
our business matters. It is an important 
management priority to ensure that our 
relationships in the countries in which we 
operate are conducted in a transparent and 
responsible manner. Our systems in this 
area are reviewed regularly and will be an 
important responsibility of our new CSR 
committee.
We work closely with a variety of local 
stakeholders in the areas where we operate. 
We aim to ensure that the economic value 
generated by our operations is applied to 
address important aspects of local need. 
We have worked closely with the local 
authorities in Uganda to develop important 
health, educational and economic 
infrastructure projects. For example, we 
have built a school and a potable water 
project for the local villagers. We aim to 
apply our experience in Uganda to the other 
parts of the world in which the company 
operates. This approach is already being 
reflected in a number of our activities in 
Kurdistan.
What distinguishes Heritage 
from its peers?
A. The Company has many competitive 
strengths including:
a strong balance sheet; >
a proven management team; >
strong and established technical  >
expertise;
a geographically diversified portfolio of  >
high impact exploration plays; and
well-established connections in all areas  >
in which we operate.
How does the Company engage 
with shareholders?
A. The Chairman, with input from the 
Senior Independent Director, is responsible 
for ensuring effective communication of 
shareholders’ views to the Board as a whole 
and will update the Board accordingly.  
We employ an investor relations specialist 
and an investor relations programme is in 
place for Executive Directors and senior 
management to meet with institutional 
investors in European and North American 
cities. The website is updated continually  
to keep investors informed of our activities.
Do you have a message for 
shareholders?
A. The Company has an excellent track 
record built over many years, one that we 
continue to live up to. Since we listed in 
London in March 2008, we have enjoyed 
incredible success. We have delivered on 
our promise to generate shareholder value, 
expand analyst coverage and to increase 
liquidity and we are firm in the knowledge 
that we have the right people and the right 
assets to allow us to continue to deliver high 
impact results for our shareholders.

5 This information is not covered by the audit opinion of the independent registered public accounting firm that has audited and reported on the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.  Why did Heritage consider Uganda to 
be a potential oil basin?
Several geological elements are necessary 
for oil and gas to accumulate in sufficient 
quantities to justify commercial production. 
These elements include a source rock to 
generate the oil (or gas), a porous reservoir 
rock to store the oil in and a trap to stop it 
leaking away.
The Heritage technical team were first 
attracted to the Albert Basin because 
surface geology maps indicated a large 
sedimentary basin with numerous oil seeps 
around the margin of the basin. Geologists 
determined that, over a period of time, the 
level of Lake Albert varied and developed a 
sequence of sand and shale. The source 
rock, shale, is where the hydrocarbons 
actually form and the reservoir rock, the 
sand, is where the hydrocarbons are held. 
Regional satellite data was suggestive of a 
strike-slip origin to the basin, thereby 
generating the traps. Analogous rift basins in 
Africa were reviewed because they were 
considered to be similar. 
How did the work programme develop?
Seismic data is used to probe the structure 
of the subsurface. This is done by generating 
sound waves at the surface which are 
reflected back from the different rock layers 
in the sub-surface and are detected using 
geophones. This data is then converted into 
seismic lines which will be interpreted by 
geophysicists.
Early seismic surveys confirmed at least five 
kilometres of sediment in the basin and a 
number of drillable structures. Subsequent 
regional seismic surveys allowed detailed 
mapping of the Ugandan side of the basin 
confirming yet more drillable structures 
amongst which Kingfisher was evidently  
one of the largest structures in the Basin.  
In 2008, the large Buffalo-Giraffe Field  
was defined.
What are the results?
Heritage went to Uganda because of the 
potential for exploration elephants which 
could transform the Company and the 
results have been very successful. In Block 
3A and Block 1 Heritage has drilled six wells 
and all have encountered hydrocarbons. 
Kingfisher, in Block 3A, was the first 
discovery in 2007 , where three wells were 
drilled and two tested at over 12,000 bopd. 
A five month drilling programme in Block 1 
resulted in another three discoveries and 
opened up a new play type in the northern 
part of the Basin. In 2009, the Buffalo-Giraffe 
Field was discovered which management 
considers to be the largest onshore oil field 
to be discovered in Sub-Saharan Africa for 
more than two decades.
Heritage’s success in monetising assets stems from seeing 
an opportunity at an early stage and drawing on its 
knowledge and skills – both technical and managerial.  
The Company looked favourably at the balance of risk and 
reward in u ganda in 1997 and was the first company to 
explore for and operate Ugandan oil and gas interests in 
almost sixty years. After establishing the potential for oil, 
the Company had to establish a work programme and 
deliver results.

Heritage was one of the 
first companies to be 
awarded a Production 
Sharing Contract (“PSC”) 
in Kurdistan. Kurdistan is 
an autonomous region in 
federal Iraq bordering 
Syria, Iran and Turkey.
In October 2007, the Group signed a PSC 
with the Kurdistan Regional Government 
(“KRG”) and was appointed operator of the 
Miran Block in the southern part of Kurdistan. 
The licence area covers approximately 1,015 
square kilometres. The Miran structure lies 
approximately 65 kilometres from the giant 
Kirkuk oilfield, which has remaining reserves 
thought to be in excess of 10 billion barrels, 
and 30 kilometres from the Taq Taq Field, 
which is on production. In April 2009, Heritage 
announced that Genel Energy had been 
nominated as the third party participant in  
the Miran Block. This right of appointing  
an additional party to the PSC is typically 
included as standard in contracts 
in Kurdistan.
As an early entrant in the Kurdistan region, 
the Group is strongly positioned to benefit 
from development of this significant 
hydrocarbon-prone region especially as the 
already stable security situation continues 
to improve.
It is generally acknowledged that there is 
huge potential in the Kurdistan region for as 
yet undiscovered hydrocarbons, estimated 
by the US Geological Survey at 
approximately 40 billion barrels of oil and 60 
trillion cubic feet of gas. Additionally, it has 
been reported that 80% of all wells drilled in 
Iraq have encountered hydrocarbons.
The Miran Block contains two large 
structures, Miran West and Miran East, 
which have been mapped from the 
332 kilometres of excellent quality 2D 
seismic data acquired by Heritage in the 
second quarter of 2008. The Miran West 
structure is believed to be one of the larger 
structures in Kurdistan, with an estimated 
areal extent of approximately 200 square 
kilometres. Miran East has an estimated 
areal extent of 130 square kilometres.
Upon completion of seismic interpretation, 
the Company decided to accelerate the 
Miran work programme. Consequently, 
drilling commenced on the Miran West-1 
well in December 2008. 
In March 2009, drilling of the Miran West-1 
well was completed having reached a  
total depth of 2,935 metres. The well 
encountered oil shows over a 1,100 metre 
interval including the three principal proven 
reservoir formations in the region. 
The initial test programme on the Miran 
West-1 well was completed in May 2009. 
Miran West-1 drilling operations were 
designed to cope with the potential for high 
reservoir pressures and this resulted in the 
loss of drilling fluid and lost circulation 
material in the highly permeable fractured 
reservoirs. The large volumes of lost fluids 
severely constrained initial testing operations.

West-1 discovery was completed in August 
2009 with a flow rate of 3,640 bopd recorded 
from a single upper reservoir interval. The well 
was suspended as a future producer.
The Miran West-2 appraisal well, located 
approximately four kilometres north-west  
of the Miran West-1 discovery well, 
commenced drilling in November 2009.
In April 2010 it was announced that the 
Miran West-2 appraisal well had intersected 
significant hydrocarbon-bearing intervals 
over approximately 1,800 metres within  
the Cretaceous formations. Three zones, 
determined from logging within the 
Cretaceous formations have been identified 
for testing once drilling operations have 
been completed.  
The well is currently being deepened to 
approximately 4,600 metres in order to 
explore further potential in the underlying 
Jurassic and Triassic structures. These 
targets have been identified from additional 
seismic data acquired in January 2010, after 
the Miran West-2 well had commenced 
drilling.  These exploration targets have the 
potential to contain substantial volumes of 
additional hydrocarbons.
Heritage is planning to acquire 3D seismic 
data over the Miran Block to enable further 
appraisal drilling to encounter the fracture 
networks more efficiently.  The Miran West-1 
well has previously demonstrated that where 
open fractures are encountered in wells, the 
reservoir will support potential production 
rates of approximately 10,000 bopd.  
Future plans for the drilling of the Miran 
East-1 exploration well are progressing and 
the Company is looking to contract a rig for 
later this year.

In December 2007, the 
Group entered into a  
PSC with the Maltese 
Government for a 100% 
interest in a reas 2 and 7 
in the south-eastern 
offshore region of Malta.
The licences cover almost 18,000 square 
kilometres and are situated approximately 80 
kilometres and 140 kilometres, for Area 2 and 
Area 7 respectively, from the south-eastern 
Maltese coast in water depths of 
approximately 300 metres. The two Areas are 
close to a number of producing fields 
offshore Libya and Tunisia. 
The licences are under-explored with only 
one well previously drilled in Area 2; the 
Medina Bank-1 well in 1980. The well was 
drilled to a depth of 1,225 metres but failed 
to reach the target horizons, estimated to 
be between 1,500 and 4,500 metres. The 
well did, however, encounter gas shows in 
porous, fractured carbonates.
Current seismic interpretation is based on 
an extensive data set of almost 3,500 
kilometres of 2D seismic acquired in 2000. 
This data indicates the presence of a variety 
of potential prospects. Primary targets are 
Miocene, Lower Eocene and Cretaceous 
mounded carbonates that are recognised 
as major hydrocarbon producing zones in 
the central part of the Mediterranean. In 
addition, the Company has recognised the 
presence of a north-south trending shelf 
margin on the eastern margin of the blocks 
and a number of attractive reef prospects 
have been mapped.
Heritage will acquire a further 1,000 kilometres 
of 2D seismic this year and a high impact 
exploration well is planned for the second 
half of 2010 targeting approximately 500 
mmboe.

The Sanjawi Block 
(number 3068-2) in 
z one II (Baluchistan) was 
awarded in November 
2007. Heritage has a 54% 
interest and is operator. 
This onshore exploration licence covers a 
gross area of 2,258 square kilometres. The 
block is considered highly prospective due to 
the recent oil discovery to the west of the 
licence and a number of gas fields to the 
south-east of the licence as well as the 
presence of oil seeps. The block is 
dominated by a series of broad east-west 
trending surface features including the 
Dabbar and Warkan Shah anticlines. These 
are large structures, the Dabbar anticline 
being some 300 square kilometres in area.
In December 2008, Heritage obtained a 48% 
interest in the Zamzama North Block (number 
2667-8) and was appointed operator. The 
Zamzama North Block is located in the south 
of Pakistan in the western part of the Sindh 
Province approximately 200 kilometres 
north-west of Hyderabad and comprises  
an area of 1,229 square kilometres. 
Any discovered hydrocarbons could be 
readily connected to the existing infrastructure 
as one of the main pipelines runs through 
the block. To the south of, and adjacent to 
Zamzama North, is the Zamzama Gas Field,  
a major Upper Cretaceous gas accumulation.
The current seismic database used to map 
the Zamzama North Block comprises some 
750 kilometres of fair to good quality, 2D 
seismic. On the basis of this data, Heritage 
has mapped a number of structural leads. 
Further seismic is being acquired with a  
well on the Zamzama North Block planned 
for the second half of 2010. 24

The overall broad symmetry of the lake 
would indicate that the DRC side of the 
basin should potentially be as prospective 
as the Ugandan side. There are oil seeps 
around the basin indicating that oil has 
migrated throughout the basin in both the 
DRC and Uganda.
In 2006 the Group, with its partners in these 
licences, executed a Production Sharing 
Agreement (“PSA”) with the Government of 
the DRC. The initial exploration term is five 
years, during which seismic data will be 
acquired and exploration wells drilled. 
However, the programme only commences 
following receipt of a Presidential Decree, 
the timing of which is still uncertain. The 
validity of the licences has been disputed, 
however, Heritage is working closely with 
the operator and Government of the DRC 
and continues to be confident in the title 
granted through the PSA with the 
Government of the DRC.

In a pril 2008, Heritage 
entered into farm-in 
agreements on two 
licences in eastern 
Tanzania, comprising 
four areas (Latham, 
Kimbiji, Kisangire and 
Lukuliro licence areas). 
The four areas have a total area of 
approximately 25,000 square kilometres. 
The Kimbiji and Latham licence areas cover 
approximately 9,300 square kilometres and 
are held under one PSA, whilst the Kisangire 
and Lukuliro licence areas cover 
approximately 16,100 square kilometres and 
are held under a second PSA.
The licence areas are close to the 
Mkuranga-1 gas discovery which was drilled 
in 2007 and reportedly flowed gas at a rate 
of 20 mmcf/d from an Upper Cretaceous 
reservoir. The large Songo Songo producing 
gas field is located to the south-east of the 
licence areas. The Wingayongo oil seep is 
present within the Kisangire licence area, 
indicating the presence in the region of a 
working hydrocarbon system that is 
generating both oil and gas. The recent Mafia 
Deep discovery has an estimated 
recoverable gas of 4 TCF and is close to the 
Latham licence area.
Latham and Kimbiji
The Latham and Kimbiji licence areas, 
encompasses onshore (1,881 square 
kilometres), near shore (2,981 square 
kilometres) and deep water (4,491 square 
kilometres) areas. The PSA was awarded to 
Petrodel Resources Limited (“Petrodel”) by 
the Tanzanian Government in September 
2006. In October 2009, the partnership was 
granted 12 month extensions on the 
exploration periods for both the Kimbiji and 
Latham licence areas
Under the terms of the farm-in agreement 
with Petrodel, the Group has the right to earn 
a 70% working interest in the Kimbiji licence 
area, and a 29.9% working interest in the 
Latham licence area, by funding all seismic 
costs of the required work programmes on 
both blocks. Heritage is acting initially as 
work programme operator, being responsible 
for all technical and operational aspects of 
the work programmes, and will be appointed 
operator of the licence upon drilling the 
second exploration well in the Kimbiji Area.
Kisangire and Lukuliro
The PSA was originally awarded to Dominion 
Oil & Gas Limited (“Dominion”) in May 2005. 
An extension to the initial exploration period 
for the Kisangire and Lukuliro licence areas 
for 18 months was granted in 2009.
Under the terms of the farm-in agreement 
with Dominion, the Group has the right to 
earn a working interest of 55%, initially, in 
both the Kisangire and Lukuliro licence 
areas. The Group also has an option to earn 
an additional working interest of 15% thereby 
increasing its participating interest to 70%. 
The acquisition of 207 kilometres of 2D 
seismic commenced in the onshore part of 
the Kimbiji licence area in September 2008 
and was followed by the acquisition of 
198 kilometres of 2D seismic in the Kisangire 
licence area. The data is currently being 
analysed and will be used as a basis for a 
drilling programme, which is expected to 
commence in 2011.

Heritage announced in 
March 2008 that the 
Government of Mali had 
approved Heritage’s farm-
in on two exploration 
licences. 
The two licences have a gross area of over 
72,000 square kilometres in the Gao 
Graben. Heritage has been appointed 
operator with the right to earn a 75% 
working interest in each of Blocks 7 and 11 
by financing 100% of the minimum work 
programme of seismic acquisition and the 
drilling of one exploration well. The Group’s 
partner is Mali Oil Developments SARL, a 
wholly owned subsidiary of Centric Energy 
Corporation (“Centric Energy”).
The two licences are located in the eastern 
part of the country that includes the Gao 
Graben; a Mesozoic basin that 
management considers geologically similar 
to other Mesozoic interior-rift basins within 
North Africa, such as the Muglad Basin of 
Sudan and the Doba Basin of Chad. The 
Gao Graben has been delineated by various 
surveys conducted since the early 1970’s, 
including over 2,000 kilometres of 2D 
seismic and a comprehensive gravity and 
magnetic survey. This data shows the 
presence of tilted fault-blocks and indicates 
the possible presence of up to 4,000 metres 
of sediments above basement.
Previous drilling in the Gao Graben has 
encountered oil and gas shows. The Tin 
Bergoui water well, which lies approximately 
30 kilometres to the west of Block 11,  
was drilled to a depth of 350 metres and 
encountered oil and gas shows in a number 
of horizons, indicating the potential for a 
working hydrocarbon system. 
A two year extension to the licences was 
awarded in January 2009 allowing the 
Group a better opportunity to refine the 
work programme. Over the next 12 months 
the Group will proceed with a programme of 
seismic acquisition, of approximately 1,000 
kilometres, and reprocessing to support 
selection of initial drilling locations.

Since 2005, the Group has 
held a 95% equity interest 
in Chumpassn efteDobycha 
Limited, a Russian 
company whose sole  
asset is the z apadno 
Chumpasskoye licence.
This licence, which expires in 2024, is in the 
hydrocarbon-rich West Siberian province of 
Khanty-Mansiysk, approximately 100 
kilometres from the city of Nizhnevartovsk and 
in the area of the region’s prolific Samotlor oil 
field, which makes it accessible to existing 
development and production infrastructure 
and facilities. The licence covers an area of 
about 200 square kilometres and contains the 
Zapadno Chumpasskoye Field, discovered in 
1997 . A total of nine wells were drilled on the 
licence prior to 2005, and the Group has 
drilled a further three wells.
RPS, in an independent evaluation, estimated 
that Zapadno Chumpasskoye contains 
proved and probable reserves of 60.6 million 
barrels of oil net to the Group as at 30 June 
2009. Net Present Value, discounted at 10%, 
is $298 million net to the Group.
Since 2006, the Group has acquired 2D 
seismic data covering an area of 200 
kilometres, constructed pilot production 
facilities, drilled three wells and re-entered 
existing well #226. Production facilities were 
commissioned and production commenced in 
May 2007 . In 2009, an electric submersible 
pump (“ESP”) was installed on well #226 to 
arrest the natural well production decline. Also, 
in 2009, a water shut-off was completed on 
well P4 which was concurrent with the 
installation of an ESP . The well is continuing to 
clean up and the oil rate is increasing. 
At the end of 2009 the Zapadno 
Chumpasskoye Field Development Project 
was approved, enabling horizontal drilling 
which should improve the recovery 
efficiency and improve economics.  
The plan calls for thirteen wells including six 
horizontal wells. One of these horizontal 
wells will be drilled in the second half of 
2010. Production and testing results among 
the different type of wells will be compared 
to evaluate optimal effectiveness for 
improved productivity and drainage. Current 
production facilities will be expanded to 
handle increased volumes of fluid from the 
new wells and permanent water injection 
facilities will be added.
The crude is light, sweet, 42
o
 API crude  
oil, with moderate gas-to-oil ratios. In 2009, 
production averaged 329 bopd, a decrease of 
approximately 13% from 2008 levels due to 
the field being shut in for most of the first 
quarter as a result of temporary lower 
domestic oil prices in Russia. The current 
production rate is 650 bopd and is expected 
to increase further over the year as a result  
of drilling.
During March 2010, Heritage re-entered a 
suspended Russian oil well, P14, to 
investigate possible Cretaceous oil 
accumulations within the licence area. 
Cretaceous production is known in the 
adjacent licence to the east.

In 1997, Heritage became 
the first oil and gas 
company in almost  
60 years to undertake 
exploration in Uganda 
after being awarded a 
licence in the Albert Basin 
of western Uganda.
In 2001, the Group farmed out 50% of the 
licence to Energy Africa, which was 
subsequently acquired by Tullow Oil plc 
(“Tullow”). 29 wells have been drilled in the 
Albert Basin since the beginning of 2006 
with 28 finding hydrocarbons and three of 
the wells testing at over 12,000 bopd. 
Blocks 1 and 3A are located in the Albert 
Basin which straddles the border with the 
DRC in the western arm of the East African 
Rift Valley. Approximately 80% of Block 3A 
is covered by the south-eastern part of Lake 
Albert and the remainder of the block 
comprises the Semliki flats to the south of 
the lake. 
The Mineral Expert’s Report, prepared by 
RPS and included in the circular issued on 
21 December 2009, estimated Heritage’s 
mean working interest share of contingent 
resources in Uganda of 355 mmbbls was 
valued at $1.126 billion, based on a discount 
rate of 10%.
Block 3a 
The original Block 3 licence was awarded  
in 1997. Most of the exploration acreage 
which previously constituted Block 3 was 
reconfigured and re-licenced as Block 3A  
in 2004 for a term of six years. Block 3A is 
located in the southern portion of the Albert 
Basin and covers an area of 2,024 square 
kilometres. All three wells drilled since 2006 
on the Kingfisher field have been successful 
and found hydrocarbons. Energy Africa 
(now owned by Tullow) farmed-in to the 
licence in August 2001, acquiring 50% in 
return for funding a seismic survey and 
partly funding the costs of a well. 
The discovered oil in Block 3A is good 
quality, light (between 30
o
 and 32
o
 API) and 
sweet with a low gas-oil ratio and some 
associated wax. The reservoirs are highly 
permeable sandstones with an estimated 
permeability of up to 3,000 milliDarcies. In 
February 2009, the successful Kingfisher-
3A sidetrack completed drilling. The same 
three sandstone reservoir intervals were 
encountered in all of the Kingfisher wells 
highlighting the continuity and the lateral 
extent of the reservoirs. All three Kingfisher 
wells drilled to date have been suspended 
as future producers. A number of other 
prospects, including the large Pelican and 
Crane prospects, have been mapped in the 
lake from various seismic surveys acquired 
by Heritage. Buffalo Buffalo East

Block 1 
Block 1 is located at the northern end of 
Lake Albert, and encompasses an area of 
3,659 square kilometres. A seismic survey 
comprising approximately 670 kilometres of 
2D data was completed on Block 1 in 
February 2008 and identified many 
encouraging direct hydrocarbon indicators. 
A successful drilling campaign which began 
in 2008 discovered the Warthog and 
Buffalo-Giraffe Fields. The Buffalo-Giraffe 
Field covers approximately 48 square 
kilometres and has an oil column of 
approximately 140 metres.
All wells drilled in Block 1 are relatively 
shallow with total depths of between 600 
and 920 metres. Downhole pressure testing 
and sampling and the recovery of oil to 
surface has confirmed the presence of 
moveable oil in the Block 1 discoveries. Log 
interpretation and core analysis has 
confirmed excellent reservoir quality with 
porosities of up to 35%. All three wells 
drilled to date in Block 1 have been 
suspended as future producers.
Potential Development
Development studies have been undertaken 
to optimise and fast-track the development 
of the basin. Options include local use, 
powerstations and refinery schemes, use of 
the existing rail infrastructure in Kenya or 
Tanzania or the building of an export 
pipeline to the east coast of Africa for crude 
oil export. 
Proposed Disposal of u gandan Interests
On 18 December 2009, Heritage 
announced that the Company, and its 
subsidiary Heritage Oil & Gas Limited, had 
entered into a SPA, with Eni for the sale of 
its 50% interests in Blocks 1 and 3A in 
Uganda (“the Disposed Assets”). On 17 
January 2010, Tullow Uganda Limited 
exercised its right to pre-empt the sale of 
the Disposed Assets to Eni on the same 
terms and conditions as agreed in the SPA 
entered into between Heritage and Eni. The 
transaction was overwhelmingly approved 
by shareholders at the General Meeting on 
25 January 2010.
In April 2010, Heritage announced that it 
had received a letter from the Ugandan 
Government stating that it supports 
Heritage’s sale and transfer of the Disposed 
Assets and that it will conclude its review of 
the transaction within eight weeks. 
Following this, Heritage expects to receive 
formal consent and to close the transaction 
shortly thereafter.

Heritage The Company has changed its accounting 
policy in relation to the recognition of equity 
or financial liabilities arising from the issue of 
convertible bonds. As a result, the loss for 
the year ended 31 December 2008 has 
been restated to increase the previously 
reported net loss attributable to owners of 
the Company by $4.9 million to $46.2 
million. Uganda and Oman operations have 
been classified as discontinued operations 
and therefore the 2008 numbers have been 
restated accordingly.
Corporate Performance
Production and Sales Volumes
Following the disposal of our Oman 
operations, with effect from 1 January 
2009, all production revenue from 
continuing operations is generated from the 
Zapadno Chumpasskoye Field in Russia. 
For the 2009 and 2008 statements Oman 
has been classified as discontinued 
operations following its sale in April 2009.
Average daily production from continuing 
operations decreased by 13% from 379 
bopd in 2008 to 329 bopd in 2009. This 
decrease resulted from the shut in of the 
Zapadno Chumpasskoye Field between 
December 2008 and February 2009 due to 
unfavourable domestic market conditions in 
Russia. Crude production recommenced in 
March 2009 and averaged 420 bopd for the 
remainder of 2009.
Notwithstanding lower average daily 
production, average daily sales volumes 
increased by 9% year on year due to 
increased sales from inventories.
Revenue
Petroleum revenue, from continuing 
operations, decreased 29% to $2.7 million, 
due to lower average realised prices 
mitigated by slightly higher volumes of 
crude oil sales. The average realised price 
per barrel in 2009 of $20.20 was 35% lower 
than in 2008, driven by lower average 
commodity prices in Russia in 2009.
Operating Results
Petroleum operating costs, from continuing 
operations, decreased by 10% to 
$1.5 million in 2009, due to lower crude 
oil production. 
Production tax in Russia decreased from 
$2.6 million in 2008 to $1.3 million in 2009 
as a result of both lower volumes of oil 
production and decreased average 
commodity prices in 2009 used in the 
calculation of production tax.
General and administrative expenses 
decreased from $21.0 million in 2008 to 
$18.7 million in 2009. This is due, principally, 
to lower non-cash share-based 
compensation expenses. Share-based 
compensation expenses were lower as the 
fair value of a number of share options 
issued previously had been fully recognised 
by the end of 2008. 
If share-based compensation expenses are 
excluded, net general and administrative 
expenses increased from $13.6 million in 
2008 to $15.6 million in 2009. This 15% 
increase resulted mainly from an increase in 
the bonuses in 2009 in comparison with 
2008. In 2009, the Group capitalised $3.5 
million (2008 – $6.3 million) of general and 
administrative costs relating to exploration 
and development activities, including 
share-based compensation of $2.1 million 
(2008 – $4.6 million).
Corporate reorganisation and subsequent 
listing costs of $9.7 million incurred in 2008 
represent a one-off expense relating to the 
Company’s re-domiciling to the LSE in 
March of that year.
Acquisition expenses of $7.1 million in 2009 
represent one-off expenses relating to an 
aborted acquisition of Genel Energy. In 
November 2009, Heritage announced that 
the discussions with Genel had been 
terminated and consequently all expenses 
incurred with respect to the planned 
acquisition of Genel Energy were expensed.

REVIEW
2009 saw several 
corporate developments 
leaving the Company with 
a strong balance sheet and 
financial flexibility for 
2010.
Paul Atherton
Chief Financial Officer Depletion, depreciation and amortisation 
expenses decreased by 18% to $1.7 million 
in 2009, primarily due to lower production 
volumes. 
Exploration expenditures, expensed in the 
year and not capitalised, decreased from 
$0.8 million in 2008 to de minimis levels in 
2009 due to the Group’s focus on its 
existing exploration portfolio.
In 2009, the Group recognised an 
impairment write-down of property, plant 
and equipment of $2.9 million (2008 – 
$0.7 million) relating to a reduction in the fair 
value of the corporate jet due to 
unfavourable economic conditions. The 
impairment loss of $0.7 million in 2008 
related to the write-down of a drilling rig.
In 2009, interest income was $0.6 million 
(2008 – $4.0 million). Cash and cash 
equivalents are typically held in interest 
bearing treasury accounts. This reduction in 
interest income is primarily due to a 
reduction in average interest rates received 
in 2009.
decided to change accounting policy from 
the former option to the latter believing that 
the latter option better reflected the 
commercial terms of the financial 
instruments operative currently. Prior year 
results have been restated to reflect the new 
policy.
On the basis of the changed policy, on 
expiry of the Company’s call option in 
February 2008, the bondholders’ 
conversion option has been reclassified 
from a liability classification (with all changes 
in fair value being reflected in the income 
statement) to an equity classification. 
Consequently, the fair value of bondholders’ 
conversion option of $30.6 million has been 
transferred to equity at that date with no 
subsequent income statement impact; a 
gain of $6.1 million was recognised up to 
that date.
At 30 June 2009, the carrying value of 
investments in unlisted securities (shares of 
SeaDragon Offshore Limited (“SeaDragon”)) 
was written down to nil following completion 
of a financial reorganisation by SeaDragon 
and resulted in an impairment write-down of 
$2.4 million in 2009. It is not possible to 
determine whether any of the original 
investment will be recoverable in the near 
future.
Other finance costs decreased from 
$11.3 million in 2008 to $4.3 million 2009, 
due primarily to bondholders exercising 
their conversion rights in respect of 
$30.6 million of convertible bonds in 2009 
and forgoing the right to earn any interest. 
Additionally, the level of interest costs 
capitalised was higher in 2009 compared to 
2008 due to increased cumulative amounts 
of capital expenditures financed from 
interest bearing borrowings.
Convertible bonds are separated into equity, 
liability and derivative liability components 
(being the bondholders’ conversion option 
of the host bond contract and the 
bondholders’ put option) and each 
component is recognised separately. The 
Company had the right to redeem, in whole 
or part, the bonds for cash at any time on or 
before 16 February 2008, at 150% of par 
value (the “Company call option”). 
Due to significant volatility that movements 
in the Company’s share price created in the 
income statement under its previous 
treatment, the Company reassessed its 
accounting policy in respect of its 
convertible debt. The Company previously 
assessed the debt/equity classification of 
each component of a compound financial 
instrument only on issue or where there was 
a change in contractual terms. However, an 
alternative policy is to make this assessment 
throughout the life of the instrument and, in 
particular, to treat changes in effective 
terms, such as the lapsing of the 
Company’s call option, in the same way as 
changes in contractual terms, i.e. as 
requiring reassessment. The Company

REVIEW continued
The Group incurred foreign exchange 
losses of $1.0 million in 2009 (2008 — 
$5.6 million), primarily as a result of the 
strengthening of sterling against the US 
dollar, as the loan secured on an office in 
London is sterling-denominated. An office 
building in London is not revalued for 
exchange rate purposes, but acts as a 
natural hedge against adverse movements 
in exchange rates with this loan. 
Heritage recognised an unrealised gain of 
$1.0 million in 2009 compared to a loss of 
$1.7 million in 2008, in the fair value of its 
investment in Afren plc (“Afren”) warrants. 
The gain or loss is determined by the 
performance of the share price of Afren. 
Heritage holds 1,500,000 warrants in Afren 
with an exercise price of £0.60 per warrant, 
received as partial consideration from the 
sale of Heritage Congo Limited in 2006. The 
warrants have a term until 22 December 
2011. At 31 December 2009, Afren’s share 
price was £0.85 per share.
Heritage’s loss from continuing operations 
in 2009 was $36.8 million, compared to 
$43.3 million in 2008. The adjusted loss 
from continuing operations in 2009 was 
$21.2 million compared to $20.8 million in 
2008 if certain non-cash items (share-based 
compensation expense, gain on derivative 
financial liability, property, plant and 
equipment impairment write-down, 
impairment of investment in unlisted 
securities, foreign exchange gains/losses 
and unrealised gain/loss on revaluation of 
Afren warrants) and the one-off aborted 
acquisition costs and reorganisation costs 
are excluded.
Disposals and Proposed Disposal
On 7 April 2009, the Company completed 
the sale of Eagle Energy, a wholly owned 
subsidiary of Heritage, to RAK Petroleum 
Oman Limited for $28 million, plus a 
working capital adjustment of $0.4 million, 
both of which were received in 2009. Eagle 
Energy, which had a 10% interest in Block 8 
offshore Oman, was acquired by the 
Company in 1996. Block 8 contains the 
Bukha field which has been producing since 
1994 and the West Bukha field which 
commenced production in February 2009. 
On 18 December 2009, Heritage 
announced it had entered into a SPA for 
the sale of its 50% interests in Blocks 1 
and 3A in Uganda. The Disposed Assets 
consideration comprises cash of $1.35 
billion and a further contingent, deferred 
consideration of either $150 million in cash 
or an interest in a mutually agreed 
producing oil field independently valued 
at a similar amount.
The results of operations in Uganda and 
Oman have been classified as discontinued 
operations. The loss on disposal of 
discontinued operations in Oman was $0.7 
million in 2009. The loss from discontinued 
operations in Uganda was $1.8 million in 
2009 compared to the loss from 
discontinued operations of $2.9 million in 
2008 relating to discontinued operations in 
Oman.
In 2009, the basic and diluted loss per 
share from continuing operations was $0.13, 
compared to the basic and diluted loss per 
share from continuing operations of $0.17 
in 2008.
Heritage’s net loss in 2009 was $39.3 million, 
compared to $46.2 million in 2008. The 
adjusted net loss in 2009 was $23.7 million, 
compared to $23.7 million in the previous 
year if certain non-cash items (share-based 
compensation expense, gain on derivative 
financial liability, property, plant and 
equipment impairment write-down, 
impairment of investment in unlisted 
securities, foreign exchange gains/losses 
and unrealised gain/loss on revaluation of 
Afren warrants) and one-off aborted 
acquisition costs and reorganisation costs 
are excluded. 
In 2009, the basic and diluted loss per 
share was $0.14, compared to the basic 
and diluted loss per share of $0.18 in 2008.
Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures
Cash used in operating activities was $20.7 
million in 2009 compared to $32.8 million in 
2008. Total cash capital expenditures in 
2009 of $104.1 million were broadly in line 
with the previous year (2008 – $103.2 
million). The following major work 
programmes were undertaken in 2009:
in March 2009, Heritage completed  >
drilling of the Miran West-1 well in 
Kurdistan. The Miran West-1 well reached 
target depth of 2,935 metres in March 
2009. Testing completed in August 2009 
and a flow rate of 3,640 bopd was 
recorded from a single reservoir interval. 
The well was suspended as a future 
producer, with an anticipated production 
rate of between 8,000 – 10,000 bopd for 
the well;
the Miran West-2 well commenced drilling  >
in November 2009;
in February 2009, Heritage completed  >
successful drilling of the Kingfisher-3A 
well in Block 3A, Uganda. The well 
reached a total measured depth of 2,712 
metres (1,875 metres true vertical depth) 
and was suspended as a future

exploration and development programmes 
will be derived from inter alia disposal 
proceeds from the sale of assets, such as 
the sale of the Company’s holdings in Oman 
in 2009 and the proposed disposal of its 
interests in Blocks 1 and 3A in Uganda (see 
disposals section of the Financial Review on 
page 32), using its existing treasury 
resources, new credit facilities, reinvesting 
its funds from operations, farm-outs and, 
when considered appropriate, issuing debt 
and additional equity. Accordingly, the 
Group has the ability to access a number of 
different sources of finance. 
Capital Structure
Heritage’s financial strategy has been to 
fund its capital expenditure programmes 
and any potential acquisitions by selling 
non-core assets, reinvesting funds from 
operations, using existing treasury 
resources, finding new credit facilities and, 
when considered appropriate, either issuing 
unsecured convertible bonds or equity. 
On 7 April 2009, the Company completed 
the sale of Eagle Energy, a wholly owned 
subsidiary of Heritage, to RAK Petroleum 
Oman Limited for $28 million, plus a 
working capital adjustment of $0.4 million. 
On 18 June 2009, the Company completed 
the placing of 25,400,000 new Ordinary 
Shares at a price of £5.20 per share for 
gross proceeds of $216,848,944 
(£132,080,000). Share issue costs were 
$11,820,609 (£7,157,379). 
Heritage had net cash of $41.7 million (cash 
and cash equivalents less total liabilities) 
and nil gearing (net debt as a percentage of 
total shareholders’ equity) at 31 December 
2009 compared with net debt of 
$121.1 million (excess of total liabilities over 
cash and cash equivalents) and gearing of 
39% at 31 December 2008.
Important Events Subsequent to the  
Year End
On 18 December 2009, Heritage 
announced that the Company, and its 
subsidiary Heritage Oil & Gas Limited, had 
entered into a SPA, with Eni for the sale of 
its 50% interests in Blocks 1 and 3A in 
Uganda. On 17 January 2010, Tullow 
Uganda Limited exercised its right to 
pre-empt the sale of the Disposed Assets to 
Eni on the same terms and conditions as 
agreed in the SPA entered into between 
Heritage and Eni. The transaction was 
overwhelmingly approved by shareholders 
at the General Meeting on 25 January 2010.
In April 2010, Heritage announced that it 
had received a letter from the Ugandan 
Government stating that it supports 
Heritage’s sale and transfer of its Ugandan 
interests and that it will conclude its review 
of the transaction within eight weeks. 
Following this, Heritage expects to receive 
formal consent and to close the transaction 
shortly thereafter.
Risk and Internal Controls 
Heritage’s business, financial standing and 
reputation may be impacted by various 
risks, not all of which are within its control. 
The Group identifies and monitors the key 
risks and uncertainties affecting the Group 
and runs its business in a way that 
minimises the impact of such risks where 
possible. A summary of the Group’s key 
risks, as currently identified, is provided on 
pages 34 to 37.
There is further information on the risks 
facing the Company in the Directors’ Report 
on pages 62 to 64 and also in note 3 of the 
financial statements on pages 83 to 84.
Internal Controls
A system of internal controls was designed 
and tailored to ensure key risks are 
addressed appropriately and to provide 
assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and preparation of 
financial statements. Risk and internal 
controls are assessed continually. One 
possible weakness has been identified, 
concerning accounting for complex 
transactions, although the Company seeks 
third party advice to mitigate against this 
weakness. 
As part of the internal controls, all 
transactions with related parties are 
identified, scrutinised and disclosed in the 
financial statements appropriately. 
Heritage maintains insurance policies in 
accordance with industry standards. 
Heritage believes that the level of insurance 
cover it maintains is adequate based on 
various factors such as the cost of the 
policies, industry standard practice and the 
risks associated with the exploration and 
development of oil and gas properties in the 
countries in which it operates. Heritage 
does not insure against political risk and, 
therefore, shareholders have full exposure 
to the risks and rewards of investing in its 
territories.
Heritage maintains detailed financial models 
which allows the Company to plan future 
operating and capital activities in an 
efficient manner.

Strategic Risks
Identification and Management of Risk  The Group’s level of risk and its management approach is  
discussed and reviewed by the Board, Audit Committee and senior 
management. The Group maintains comprehensive risk 
management procedures.
Portfolio Mix  The Group maintains a diverse portfolio of assets across a range  
of geographies and life cycles in order to minimise exposure to  
local geographical, political and cyclical market risk.
Business Model  Our experienced management team and our highly knowledgeable 
advisers devised the Company’s business model at the outset and 
review it regularly in light of current economic and political 
circumstances.
Acquisitions and Disposals  The Group and its advisers have considerable experience in  
the business environment in which the Group operates. This 
experience is applied regularly and carefully to assess potential 
merger, acquisition and disposal opportunities.
Political  The Group recognises political risks and opportunities associated 
with parts of the globe where it conducts business. The Group’s 
management and advisory network have considerable experience  
in this area and apply this knowledge to regularly assess and  
monitor this aspect of activities.

Operational Risks
Exploration and Development Expenditure and Success Rates  The Group has experienced management and technical teams  
with a track record of finding attractive oil discoveries and has a 
diversified portfolio of exploration, development and production 
assets. Considerable technical work is undertaken to reduce 
related areas of risk and maximise opportunities.
Availability of Rigs and Services  The Group applies its knowledge of the industry to devise 
structured planning processes which allow sufficient time for 
procurement of services.
Factors Associated with Operating in Developing Countries,  The Group maintains close contact with Governments in the areas 
Political and Regulatory Instability  within which it operates and, where appropriate, invests in 
community projects. Considerable work is undertaken before 
commencing operations in any new territory.
Title Disputes  Notwithstanding potential challenges in the DRC, Kurdistan and 
Malta, the Group believes that it has good title to its stated oil and 
gas properties. However, the Group cannot control or protect itself 
completely against the risk of title disputes or challenges and there 
can be no assurance that claims or challenges by third parties 
against the Group’s properties will not be asserted at a future date. 
Naturally the Group strives to employ the best internal and advisory 
knowledge available to help to minimise this risk associated with  
its activities.
Local Community Issues  Continual dialogue exists between the Group and its stakeholders 
which is central to operations. Local labour is employed wherever 
possible and there is a transfer of skills.
Loss of Key Employees  Remuneration packages are reviewed regularly to ensure key 
executives and senior management are properly remunerated.  
Long-term incentive programmes have been established.
Environmental Issues  The Group undertakes operations to the high international 
environmental standards of the oil industry. Environmental impact 
assessments are prepared before any major capital expenditures 
are incurred.
Health and Safety  The Group is aware of the local cultural issues that can impact  
its management of health and safety matters. It has devised a 
comprehensive policy framework as well as health and safety 
management and reporting systems. These are regularly monitored 
and reviewed by our CSR committee and senior management.  
The Group also works closely with the local authorities where  
it is based to manage this aspect of our activities.

RISKS continued
Description of Risk Mitigation
Financial Risks
Oil and Gas Sales Volumes and Prices  Whilst not under the direct control of the Company, a material 
movement could have an impact on the Group. The Group did not 
hedge oil prices in 2009.
Interest Rate Risk Reviewed periodically by the Board. No hedges in 2009.
Foreign Exchange Exposure  Generally, it is the Group’s policy to conduct and manage its business 
in US dollars, which is its reporting currency. Cash balances in Group 
subsidiaries are primarily held in US dollars but small amounts may be 
held in other currencies in order to meet immediate operating or 
administrative expenses or to comply with local currency regulations.
Liquidity Risk  A formal budgeting and forecasting process is in place and cash 
forecasts identifying liquidity requirements of the Group are reviewed 
regularly to ensure compliance with the approved funding plans.
Credit Risk  Trade debtors of the Company are subject to internal credit review to 
minimise risk of non-payment. Additionally, the Group monitors closely 
the funding position of joint venture partners and key contractors.
Compliance and Ethical Risks
Legal, Regulatory and Litigation  The Group’s activities are subject to various laws and regulations 
around the world. Changes could affect the short, medium and 
long-term value of the Group. Risks are mitigated by employing 
skilled and experienced staff and advisers to conduct proactive 
assessment, contingency planning and, where necessary, the use 
of appropriate mitigation techniques.
Relations with Local Stakeholders  The Group believes that maintenance of good relations with local 
communities is an important and integral part of its strategy. The 
Group therefore maintains regularly reviewed relationship protocols 
to ensure that this is the situation at all of its sites. More information 
is recorded within the CSR section of this report on pages 38 to 43, 
and in the separate CSR report.
Business Conduct Risks  The Group recognises the importance of maintaining close, 
transparent and responsible relationships with a wide variety of 
stakeholders (including host Governments). The Group is developing 
its systems in this area continually to ensure that it is managing 
related areas of risk effectively. Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Overview

Investor Sentiment  The Company maintains a regular dialogue with the Group’s 
shareholder base and the general public. A Senior Independent 
Director has been appointed and the Company employs an investor 
relations specialist.
Corporate Governance   The Group recognises the importance of maintaining strong 
corporate governance procedures and processes. The Group is 
developing systems in this area continually and generally this is 
managed by employing the skill, expertise and resources of the 
Group and its advisers. The Board reviews compliance with the 
Combined Code and other regulatory guidelines regularly.

Heritage has always recognised that its licence to 
operate is closely linked to adoption of CSR 
concepts. We work closely with stakeholders to 
ensure that the economic value generated by our 
operations is applied effectively to address 
important aspects of local need.
Establishing a Legacy
Our investments in the communities around our Ugandan 
licences have been significant, but it is the legacy that we 
will leave there that will ultimately have the greatest 
impact on the lives of Ugandans locally and nationally.
Our presence and investment in Uganda have played a 
large part in uncovering vast oil resources which will, on 
development, generate revenues that will contribute 
significantly to the development of the domestic 
economy. 
We are confident that our business partners will continue 
to work effectively with the local authorities within the 
country and carry on the process in which we have been 
closely involved in.
A Blueprint for our Future Activities
Our experiences in Uganda have enabled us to develop 
our CSR strategy, policies and performance. 
In particular, we are now working in partnership with the 
local authorities in Kurdistan on a variety of social and 
educational projects and contributing towards the 
development of the local economy.
Our aim is to apply the knowledge base and skill set we  
acquired in Uganda to ensure that we contribute 
significantly and responsibly to the parts of the world 
where we operate. We wish to secure a sustainable 
future for the communities where we are based and to 
conduct our business responsibly and transparently in 
partnership with them. Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Overview

Heritage is committed to restore sites 
where we operate to their original state 
and to comply with conditions imposed 
by bodies such as the National 
Environmental Management Authority 
(“NEMA”) in Uganda. In this picture the 
suspended well is in the process of being

both the infrastructure for future use and 
so that the local wildlife can return to the

this process fulfils all requirements. 
Consequently, our operations have the

donations were made to the schools that 
participated. These donations varied from 
school to school depending on the

overall winner was selected by Anthony 
Buckingham to appear on the cover of 
this year’s annual report. Congratulations

Corporate Governance Report
The Directors recognise the importance of 
maintaining good corporate governance practices. 
This report demonstrates the commitment to 
applying the highest industry standards of business 
ethics, health and safety, environment, risk 
management and corporate social responsibility 
throughout the Group.
Board of Directors
The Board is currently comprised of seven Directors, five of whom 
are Non-Executive Directors. The Chairman and three of the 
Non-Executive Directors are deemed to be independent under the 
terms of the Combined Code.
Chairman
The Chairman’s role is to ensure the effective running of the Board 
on all aspects of its roles and setting its agenda. His other key 
responsibilities include leading the Board, ensuring effective 
communication with shareholders, ensuring constructive relations 
between all Directors and that all Directors are encouraged to 
participate fully in the activities and decision-making process of  
the Board.
Chief Executive
The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for managing the 
Group’s business, proposing and developing the Group’s strategy 
and overall commercial objectives in consultation with the Board 
and, as leader of the executive team, implementing the decisions 
of the Board and its Committees. 
The Company is incorporated in Jersey where there is no formal 
code relating to corporate governance. However, the Board 
recognises that it has a responsibility to ensure good governance of 
the Company in order to help it fulfil its obligations to all its 
stakeholders, not just shareholders. It is, therefore, strongly 
committed to the highest standards of corporate governance and 
has decided to adhere, wherever possible, to the provisions of the 
Combined Code on Corporate Governance published in 2008 (the 
“Combined Code”), in the same way as if the Company was 
incorporated in the United Kingdom. A copy of the Combined Code 
is publicly available on the website of the UK Financial Reporting 
Council (www.frc.org.uk). The Board continues its commitment to 
work towards voluntary compliance with the Combined Code in all 
material respects.
The Directors recognise the importance of maintaining good 
corporate governance practices. This report demonstrates the 
commitment to applying the highest industry standards of business 
ethics, health and safety, environment, risk management and CSR 
throughout the Group.
The Company maintains a Premium Listing on the Main Market of 
the LSE and is a member of the FTSE 250 Index. As such, the 
Directors recognise their responsibility as guardians of the interests 
of a broad range of investors and stakeholders and are determined 
to continually review and develop the corporate governance 
framework in which the Company operates. To this end, the Board 
has made significant progress in adopting policies and procedures 
to conduct and monitor its activities, along with working practices, 
and to establish a business culture that ensures openness and full 
accountability. Developments and initiatives during 2009 and early 
2010 include:
appointing General Sir Michael Wilkes as the Senior Independent  >
Director;
establishing a performance evaluation process for the Board and  >
Board Committees and for the Chairman; 
developing a formal framework for remuneration policy across the  >
Company; 
confirming that no annual bonuses would be paid to the  >
Non-Executive Directors;
undertaking an independent review of the Chief Executive  >
Officer’s and Chief Financial Officer’s remuneration;
developing the Company’s processes for reviewing the key risks,  >
internal controls and assessments, which are subject to annual 
review; 
initiating processes for reviewing Director appointment and  >
succession planning; 
establishing a Reserves Committee; and >
establishing a CSR Committee. >
Compliance with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance
This report describes the extent to which the Company is in 
compliance with the principles set out in Section 1 of the Combined 
Code and how it intends to work towards voluntary compliance with 
those principles going forward. At the year end, the Board 
considers that the Company has complied with Section 1 of the 
Combined Code, save in the following respects. The Board has 
addressed one area of non-compliance, but believes that 
implementing the remaining changes would be inappropriate at this 
stage in the Company’s strategic development:
Code Provision A.3.3: > Until June 2009, the Company was not 
compliant with the requirement to have a Senior Independent 
Director. In June 2009, General Sir Michael Wilkes was appointed 
as the Senior Independent Director. 
Code Provision B.1.6: > Notice periods for the Executive Directors 
are 24 months. The Company has discussed the Executive 
Directors’ employment contracts with external advisers and 
internally within the remuneration committee. After taking these 
views into consideration, the Company has decided, for  Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Overview

commercial reasons, to retain the existing Executive Director 
notice period structure because of their importance to the 
business at this stage in its development. We believe that this 
policy best protects the interests of our shareholders.
Code Provision C.3.1: > The Chairman of the Company is a 
member of, and chairs, the Audit Committee. The Board believes 
the Chairman is the most appropriate person to be a member of, 
and chair, the Audit Committee given his extensive financial 
experience. The Chairman is also considered by the Board to 
have maintained his independent status.
Board of Directors
Role of the Board
The Board recognises the importance of creating and delivering 
strong sustainable financial performance and long-term shareholder 
value. The Board is responsible for ensuring the effectiveness of the 
Company’s system of internal controls including managing and 
considering the commercial risks and financing needs, the disposal 
of businesses and assessing the most appropriate balance 
between acquisition-led growth and organic growth. Individual 
Directors evaluate and challenge the Company’s business strategy 
constantly to ensure they identify areas where improvements can 
be made or where new opportunities exist so that strategies remain 
appropriate and relevant to the Company’s business. In order to 
ensure the Company complies with its obligations as a company 
with a Premium Listing on the Main Market of the LSE, the Board 
also has responsibility for communications with shareholders, 
health and safety policy and review of the Company’s management 
and financial performance. Further details of compliance with these 
obligations are set out below.
Composition
The Board is currently comprised of seven Directors, five of whom 
are Non-Executive Directors. The Chairman and three of the 
Non-Executive Directors are deemed to be independent under the 
terms of the Combined Code. All of the Directors bring either 
extensive experience of the oil industry, or a broad range of 
business, commercial and corporate governance experience, to the 
Board. The Executive Directors have close involvement with the 
operations of the business through their operational roles. The 
Directors are aware of their responsibilities and feel able to raise any 
concerns at Board meetings which are minuted accurately in the 
Board meeting minutes. The Board is supported by a strong and 
experienced senior management team. The biographies of the 
Board are set out on page 47.
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Senior 
Independent Director
There is a clear division of responsibility between the roles of the 
Chairman, Michael Hibberd, and the Chief Executive Officer, 
Anthony Buckingham, to ensure an appropriate balance of 
responsibility and accountability. These responsibilities have been 
formalised in writing and approved by the Board. 
The Chairman’s role is to ensure the effective running of the Board 
in all aspects of its roles and setting its agenda. His other key 
responsibilities include leading the Board, ensuring effective 
communication with shareholders, ensuring that Board Committees 
function effectively within their terms of reference, ensuring 
constructive relations between all Directors and that all Directors 
are encouraged to participate fully in the activities and decision-
making process of the Board. The Chairman also ensures that the 
Directors receive accurate, timely and clear information with all 
Board and Committee meeting information being issued to 
members in advance. At each meeting there is an update on 
operational and financial performance including a review of the 
performance and future potential of all material assets. The 
Chairman’s other significant appointments are disclosed to the 
Board and may be found in the Directors’ biographies on page 47.
The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for managing the Group’s 
business, proposing and developing the Group’s strategy and 
overall commercial objectives in consultation with the Board and, as 
leader of the executive team, implementing the decisions of the 
Board and its Committees.  50
As part of the Company’s commitment to comply with the 
Combined Code, General Sir Michael Wilkes was elected as the 
Senior Independent Director with the chief responsibility of 
maintaining sufficient contact with major shareholders to help 
develop a balanced understanding of their issues and concerns. In 
this role General Sir Michael Wilkes is available to shareholders who 
have concerns that have not been, or cannot be resolved through 
discussion with the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or Chief 
Financial Officer or where such contact is inappropriate. The Senior 
Independent Director is also responsible for leading the 
Non-Executive Directors in reviewing the performance of the 
Chairman for the year. 
Board Balance and Independence
The Board comprises the following Directors:
Michael Hibberd Chairman and Non-Executive Director
Anthony Buckingham Chief Executive Officer
Paul Atherton Chief Financial Officer
Salim Macki Non-Executive Director
John McLeod Non-Executive Director  
Gregory Turnbull Non-Executive Director
General Sir Michael Wilkes Non-Executive Director and Senior
 Independent Director
The Board is satisfied that its composition will ensure that no 
individual or group of individuals will dominate the decision-making 
process and that there is a strong presence on the Board of both 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors. 
The Board considers that John McLeod, Salim Macki, General 
Sir Michael Wilkes and Michael Hibberd are independent in character 
and judgement and free from relationships or circumstances which 
may affect their judgement. The Board acknowledges that John 
McLeod does not meet the independence criteria set out in the 
Combined Code as he has served on the Board for more than nine 
years and was previously granted options. John McLeod’s 
performance as Board member and Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee was assessed by the other Directors as part of the 
Board’s evaluation process undertaken during the year. Following this 
exercise, the Board has satisfied itself that neither of the factors 
described above impact on John McLeod’s independence in 
character and judgement. His length of service on the Board 
enhances his ability to perform his duties effectively and helps 
maintain an appropriate balance between experienced Non-
Executive Directors and those more recently appointed to the Board. 
On appointment, the Chairman was also considered to be 
independent and continues to be so. 
Gregory Turnbull does not meet the independence criteria set out 
by the Combined Code as he is a partner of McCarthy Tétrault LLP, 
the Canadian legal advisers to the Company. 
In addition to the requirements of the Combined Code, the Board’s 
assessment of independence and effectiveness includes their total 
number of commitments, relationships with major suppliers or with 
charities receiving material support from the Company.
Albion Energy Limited (“Albion”), the Company’s largest shareholder 
and Anthony Buckingham entered into a relationship agreement 
with the Company on 28 March 2008 (the “Relationship 
Agreement”) as part of the process to list the Company on the Main 
Market in 2008. The purpose of the Relationship Agreement is to 
ensure that transactions and relationships between the Group, 
Albion and Anthony Buckingham are at arm’s length and on normal 
commercial terms. The Relationship Agreement prescribes that at 
all times, the Board shall comprise of a majority of Directors who 
are all independent of Anthony Buckingham. 
How the Board Operates
Board Meetings 
The Board met in formal meetings nine times during the year and 
also engaged informally in numerous ad-hoc information calls which 
were not minuted as properly called formal meetings. The Board will 
continue to meet sufficiently regularly to discharge its duties by way 
of formal Board meetings as well as through ad-hoc meetings as 
required. The Board intends to meet at least four times a year. A 
formal schedule detailing matters specifically reserved for its 
decision has been agreed. The attendance record of each Director 
at formal Board and committee meetings is shown in the table 
below. In addition to the formal meetings of the Board, the 
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer 
maintain frequent contact with the other Directors to discuss any 
issues of concern they may have relating to the Group or as regards 
their areas of responsibility and to keep them fully briefed on the 
Group’s operations and initiatives. Additionally, the Chairman and/or 
the Non-Executive Directors met and spoke regularly during the 
year, and on an ad-hoc basis, without the Executive Directors 
being present.
Committees
The Board has delegated some of its responsibilities to certain 
committees in line with recommendations of the Combined Code 
and to facilitate the business of the Company. These are the Audit, 
Remuneration, Nomination, Reserves and CSR Committees. The 
Reserves Committee was established in 2009 and met for the first 
time in January 2010. The CSR Committee was established in April 
2010. Further details of these committees and their activities can be 
found later in this report on pages 51 to 53 and also in the 
Remuneration Report on pages 55 to 61.
A table of attendance of members of the Board and the main Board 
Committees at meetings during the year is set out below:

1 Appointed to the Audit Committee in April 2009.
Given the size of the Company, the Board feels that it is in the 
shareholders best interests not to employ a Company Secretary at 
this time. The current Company Secretary is a corporate entity 
based in Jersey that deals with the normal statutory compliance for 
the Company. The Board and its committees are, therefore, 
serviced by the Company Secretary or its nominee. The other 
duties that would normally be carried out by the Company 
Secretary, such as the provision of information flows to the Board, 
are dealt with by either the Chairman or Chief Financial Officer or 
Corporate Governance Report continued Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Overview
51
Heritage Oil Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009
their nominee. In terms of corporate governance issues, the Board 
is advised by McCarthy Tétrault, a firm of registered foreign lawyers 
& solicitors in London. The Board monitors the provision of 
Company secretarial duties and takes any action as appropriate to 
ensure its requirements are met. The appointment or removal of the 
Company Secretary is a matter for the Board as a whole.
Independent Professional Advice
The Board ensures, in line with Board policy, that all Directors and 
Committees have access to independent professional advice 
whenever it is required and at the Company’s expense. 
Appointment of Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors have executed letters of appointment 
setting out their respective terms of appointment including the 
expected time commitment which has been agreed and confirmed 
with them. Further details can be found in the Remuneration Report 
on pages 55 to 61. 
Insurance Cover
As required by the Combined Code, the Company maintains 
Directors’ and Officers’ Liability insurance cover, in respect of any 
legal action taken against the Directors. This is reviewed annually.
Induction and Continuing Professional Development
The Board believes that the Directors possess a wealth of diverse 
experience and business skills. Non-Executive Directors are actively 
encouraged to take up opportunities for questioning, examining and 
reviewing the Group’s businesses and to undertake training 
applicable to their roles.
Upon joining the Board, if considered appropriate, a Director will 
participate in an induction programme which helps establish them 
in their role covering the principles and legal and regulatory duties 
required of them. This training is tailored to an individual’s needs, 
taking into account their qualifications and experience. In 
addition, meetings are arranged with senior management to enable 
Non-Executive Directors to develop a detailed understanding of the 
Company’s business and of its strategy, and the key risks and 
challenges the Company faces. 
All Directors have the opportunity to update their skills and 
knowledge on a regular basis, for example through further briefings 
on issues, including changes in law and regulation, corporate 
governance, financial reporting and operational matters. To build on 
the formal induction programme, Directors are encouraged to make 
site visits to the Group’s operations, and are offered access to 
company secretarial services or independent professional advice at 
the Company’s expense, should this be necessary for them to 
discharge their responsibilities.
Furthermore, Directors are in regular communication with senior 
executives through both formal and informal ad-hoc meetings, to 
ensure the regular exchange of knowledge and experience between 
management and Non-Executive Directors.
Board Assessment and Effectiveness
During the year the Chairman led a review and assessment of the 
Board and its effectiveness. This exercise, in which all of the 
Directors were involved, considered the processes around how the 
Board works, as described above; the effectiveness of Board 
Committees and their chairmen; and areas such as Board 
composition, dynamics and leadership.
The assessment concluded that the Board and its Committees 
remain effective in terms of operations, decision-making and 
leadership. During the year the Board has built on the review; in 
particular by reviewing the succession planning process and by 
making the changes described in the Induction and Continuing 
Professional Development part of this report.
Re-election
All Directors’ appointed other than by shareholders are subject to 
re-election by shareholders at the first Annual General Meeting 
(“AGM”) following their appointment. 
It is the Company’s policy that all Directors should retire and stand 
for re-election at least once every three years. Details of Directors 
retiring at the forthcoming AGM are shown in the Directors’ Report 
on page 62. 
Board Committees
As mentioned above, the Board has five committees, being the 
Audit, Remuneration, Nomination, Reserves and CSR Committees. 
The duties of these Committees are set out in formal terms of 
reference, approved by the Board, that are available on the 
Company’s website www.heritageoilplc.com. Membership of the 
committees was reviewed and confirmed during the year.

All members, including the Chairman, are independent Non-
Executive Directors. Other members of the Board may also be 
invited to attend as and when appropriate. The auditors are also 
invited to attend regularly.
The Chairman of the Company, Michael Hibberd, is a member of 
the Audit Committee which is not in line with the recommendations 
made in the Smith Guidance on the Combined Code. However, the 
Board continues to believe that his recent and relevant financial 
experience, including his experience on corporate financial matters 
is invaluable in supporting the Audit Committee to perform its role. 52
The Audit Committee engages in numerous ad-hoc discussions 
and meets formally at least twice a year to discharge its 
responsibilities which are set out in its Terms of Reference. The 
Audit Committee also oversees the Company’s relationship with its 
external auditors and reviews the effectiveness of the external audit 
process. The Audit Committee pre-approves all audit and non-audit 
services undertaken by the external auditor, to ensure 
independence of the external auditors is not impaired.
In fulfilling its responsibility to monitor the integrity of financial reports 
to shareholders, the Audit Committee reviews the accounting 
principles, policies and practices adopted in the preparation of public 
financial information and will examine documentation in relation to the 
Annual Report and annual financial report announcements. The 
ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving the interim and 
annual financial statements remains with the Board.
During the year the Audit Committee considered the following main 
items of business:
review of operations; >
review of the integrity of the financial statements and formal  >
announcements relating to the Group’s financial performance;
report of the external auditors, KPMG; >
review of the financial statements; >
update on internal controls; >
review of whistle-blowing policy; >
management representation letter and auditor independence; >
audit engagement letter;  >
2009 audit plan and key audit risks; >
review of the committee’s Terms of Reference; >
2010 budget; and >
potential asset sales and business combinations. >
At present there is no internal audit function established. The 
Committee reviewed the need for an internal audit function in 2009 
and again in March 2010 and concurred with the opinion of the 
Board, which maintains that the current control systems in place 
and management oversight are sufficient to highlight any areas of 
weaknesses in the financial reporting systems. The need for an 
internal audit function is kept under review at least annually.
The Terms of Reference of the Audit Committee were reviewed 
during the year, and part of that review involved consideration of 
matters considered to be good practice in other listed companies.

The Remuneration Committee engages in numerous ad-hoc 
discussions and meets formally at least once a year. The Terms of 
Reference of the Remuneration Committee comply fully with the 
requirements of the Combined Code. These were reviewed during 
the year using the Hay Group, and part of that review involved 
consideration of what was considered to be good practice in other 
listed companies.

or part of any meeting, as may be considered appropriate by the 
Chairman of the Committee.
The Nomination Committee engages in numerous ad-hoc 
discussions and meets formally at least once a year. The 
Nomination Committee ensures, amongst other things, that there is 
a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment of 
new directors. Recommendations are made objectively. The

in more areas to establish a CSR Committee to fulfil the duties above. 
The CSR Committee engages in numerous ad-hoc discussions and 
will formally meet at least once a year. External advisers may also be 
invited to attend meetings as and when required. 
Accountability and Audit
Audit Committee Report
Details of the Audit Committee and the Audit Committee Report 
were discussed on pages 51 to 52.
Internal Controls
The Audit Committee has responsibility for reviewing the 
effectiveness of the Company’s system of internal controls and risk 
management systems. The Board has taken into account the 
relevant provisions of the Combined Code in formulating the 
systems and procedures in operation in the Company. The Audit 
Committee considers the system to be effective. 
The Company’s system of internal controls is designed to manage, 
rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. The Board will 
continue to review and improve its system of internal controls. 
The Board recognises the need for effective internal controls and 
for evaluating and managing the risks of the Company. Such 
matters are brought to the attention of the Board at its formal Board 
meetings, ad-hoc discussions or via the whistle-blowing policy.
High level controls in operation include:
review of management accounts with comparison of actual  >
performance against prior periods and budget;
approval of orders, authorisation of invoices and two signatories  >
required to make a transfer from the principal bank accounts;
quarterly reconciliation of all control accounts; >
prior approval by the Board for major investments; and >
segregation of duties between relevant functions and  >
departments.
The Board is aware of the need to conduct regular risk 
assessments to identify any deficiencies in the controls currently 
operating over all aspects of the Company. A formal risk 
assessment is conducted periodically during the year on internal 
controls to cover material controls, both financial and operational, 
and risk management systems. 
The risk assessment and a review of the effectiveness of the 
Group’s system of internal controls are performed in accordance 
with the Turnbull guidance and they were in place for the year end 
review process.
Financial reporting procedures were reviewed as part of the 
process to become listed on the Main Market of the LSE and a 
Board memorandum was prepared. Having considered the 
findings, the Directors were able to confirm that the financial 
reporting procedures established provided them with a reasonable 
basis on which to make proper judgements on the financial position 
and prospects of the Company on an ongoing basis. However, one 
main weakness was noted, concerning accounting for complex 
transactions, although the Company seeks third party advice to 
mitigate this weakness.
The Directors recognise the need to maintain financial reporting 
procedures, to review them on an ongoing basis and to adapt them 
to changing circumstances and will use the Board memorandum as 
a basis for further developing the Board processes. 
Details of principal risks and uncertainties are discussed in the 
Financial Review on pages 34 to 37. 54
The Company has a whistle-blowing policy in place and information 
is available to all employees advising them that they can raise 
concerns in confidence about possible wrong doing by contacting 
the Chairman of the Audit Committee. In addition, whistle-blowing is 
an agenda item at Board and Audit Committee meetings with 
appropriate action taken as required.
Auditor Independence
The Audit Committee and Board recognise the importance of the 
independence and objectivity of the Group’s external auditors, 
KPMG Audit Plc, when performing their role in the Group’s 
reporting to shareholders. The external auditors are expected to 
provide the Audit Committee with information about policies and 
processes for maintaining independence and monitoring 
compliance with current regulatory requirements, including those 
regarding the rotation of audit partners and staff.
The overall performance, independence and objectivity of the 
auditors is reviewed regularly by the Audit Committee. The Audit 
Committee has a policy in place in respect of the provision of 
non-audit services to the Company by the external auditor. Fees 
billed by KPMG Audit Plc, the Company’s auditors and its 
associates, during 2008 and 2009, may be summarised as follows:

Going Concern
A statement on the Directors’ position regarding the Company as a 
going concern is contained in the Directors’ Report on page 64.
Shareholder Relations
The Chairman, with input from the Senior Independent Director, is 
responsible for ensuring effective communication of shareholders’ 
views to the Board as a whole and will update the rest of the Board 
accordingly. Board Members are expected to use their best 
endeavours to attend meetings with a broad range of shareholders 
or otherwise keep in touch with shareholder opinion and discuss 
strategy and governance issues with them as time progresses. In 
addition, the Company employs an investor relations specialist and 
an investor relations programme is in place for the Company to 
meet major shareholders and analysts. 
As part of the Company’s commitment to comply with the 
Combined Code, General Sir Michael Wilkes was elected as the 
Senior Independent Director with the chief responsibility of 
maintaining sufficient contact with major shareholders to help 
develop a balanced understanding of their issues and concerns. In 
this role General Sir Michael Wilkes is available to shareholders who 
have concerns that have not been, or cannot be resolved through 
discussion with the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or Chief 
Financial Officer or where such contact is inappropriate. 
Throughout 2009, Executive Directors and senior management met 
with institutional investors in London and across the UK as well as 
other European and North American cities. These roadshows, 
combined with the attendance of various Directors and/or senior 
management at several conferences, provided for comprehensive 
and engaging dialogue with shareholders. 
The Group issues its results and other news releases promptly and

Analysis of the Company’s shareholder base indicates that there 
has been a small change in the profile of those holding shares in 
Heritage in 2009. There has been an increase in shareholders 
who classify their investment style as growth offset by declines in 
hedge funds. These are shown on the following two graphs.

Remuneration Report
Remuneration Committee Chairman’s Introduction
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to present Heritage’s Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2009 for which we will be 
seeking approval from shareholders at our AGM in June. As you will see, we have enhanced the level of disclosure 
included in the Remuneration Report to reflect evolving best practice and to facilitate continued dialogue with our 
shareholders. 
The past year has been an exciting one for Heritage as we crystallised value with the disposal of our Omani interests 
and prepare to dispose of our Ugandan interests. We also experienced continued operational success with the 
discovery of the Miran West Field in Kurdistan. In addition, the past year saw a number of corporate governance 
developments in response to the global financial turmoil, with a particular emphasis on executive reward policies 
and practice, which the Committee has considered. 
Against this background, the Remuneration Committee has continued to monitor the executive reward policy first 
established during 2008, and its application, to ensure that both remain appropriate. As part of this process, the 
Remuneration Committee has:
reviewed the operation and structure of the annual bonus plan; >
decided to enhance the level of disclosure provided in the Remuneration Report;  >
had its performance and effectiveness assessed as part of the wider Board evaluation process described in the  >
corporate governance section of our annual report; and
considered the likely behavioural impact of the remuneration policy and, in particular, the short and long-term  >
incentive structures, on the risk taking attitude of senior executives. 
We believe that our executive reward policy remains appropriate and as a result have made no fundamental 
changes, other than those described above. 
As per last year’s Remuneration Report, salaries remained frozen during the year and no further awards of shares 
under the Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) were made to the Executive Directors. The Terms of the LTIP were not 
changed. Pension and benefit provisions also remained unchanged.
We will keep our policy under review throughout 2010 as our business evolves and new corporate governance 
developments occur. 
The rest of the report provides more detail on our remuneration arrangements. 
John McLeod
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
29 April 2010 56
Introduction
This report has been prepared with reference to the UK Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2008 (“the regulations”) and meets the relevant 
requirements of the Financial Services Authority’s Listing Rules. The 
report has, therefore, been divided into different parts for unaudited 
and audited information. 
In preparing this report, consideration has also been given to the 
Combined Code and the Guidelines of the Association of British 
Insurers on Executive Remuneration Policies and Practices. Advice 
has been sought from Hay Group which is a founder member of the 
Remuneration Consultants Group and is committed to upholding its 
principles.
A resolution to approve the report will be put to shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting on 17 June 2010. 
Remuneration Committee 
The members of the Remuneration Committee during the year were 
John McLeod (Chairman), General Sir Michael Wilkes and Salim 
Macki. The Committee met once during 2009 with all members 
in attendance. 
All members of the Remuneration Committee are considered by the 
Board to be independent as explained in the corporate governance 
section of the annual report on page 50. 
The Remuneration Committee’s main responsibilities are to:
set the remuneration policy for the Chairman, Executive Directors  >
and senior executives;
assess and determine total compensation packages available to  >
the Executive and Non-Executive Directors;
monitor the remuneration of senior management other than the  >
Executive Directors whose remuneration it sets; 
determine policy and scope for pension rights and any  >
compensation payments and ensure compliance with the 
Combined Code in this respect; and
make recommendations to the Board for its approval, and that of  >
shareholders, on the design of long-term incentive plans and 
make recommendations for the grant of awards to executives 
under such plans. 
In setting the remuneration policy and total compensation package 
levels for Executive Directors and other senior executives, the 
Remuneration Committee gives consideration to remuneration 
policy and levels for the wider employee population. In particular, 
the Remuneration Committee considers how pay levels in the wider 
employee population compare against the market and is mindful of 
the pay differentials between top executives and roles at different 
levels in the structure. 
The Remuneration Committee has clearly defined terms of 
reference which conform with the requirements of the Combined 
Code and are available on the Company’s website. 
Advice to the Remuneration Committee 
The Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer provide internal support to the Remuneration 
Committee and attend meetings at the Committee’s invitation 
except where matters associated with their own remuneration are 
being discussed. 
In addition, the Remuneration Committee has access to external 
advice as required. During the year, the Committee continued to 
receive independent advice from external executive reward 
consultants, the Hay Group, on matters under consideration by the 
Committee. In addition, the Hay Group facilitated the Board’s 
assessment process as described in the corporate governance 
section of the annual report and provided updates on best market 
practice. No other services were provided to the Company by the 
Hay Group during the year. 
Remuneration Committee Assessment 
As part of the overall Board assessment process described in the 
corporate governance section of the annual report, the operation, 
structure and performance of the Remuneration Committee and its 
members were assessed during the year. This process, which was 
facilitated by the Committee’s external advisers, the Hay Group, 
took into account the views of both member and non-member 
Directors of the Committee. 
The outcome of the review confirmed that the Remuneration 
Committee discharges its responsibilities effectively. 
Executive Reward Policy 
During the year, the Remuneration Committee has continued to 
monitor the executive reward policy and principles which were put 
in place in 2008 to ensure that they remain appropriate. These 
broad principles, which the Remuneration Committee believes 
remain appropriate in the current climate, are designed to ensure 
that the Company: 
has an executive reward framework to help drive future value  >
growth; 
retains and, when necessary, recruits management talent of the  >
required ability and experience;
provides overall levels of reward that are appropriate for the  >
Company given its Premium Listing in London, international 
operations and the global nature of the oil and gas industry; 
follows, insofar as possible, both UK as well as Canadian  >
standards of corporate governance in so far as that such 
standards support and enhance the Company’s ability to 
generate value for shareholders; and 
maintains a balance between fixed (base package and benefits)  >
and variable reward (short and long-term incentives) that is 
appropriate and motivates the right behaviours (see chart on 
page 57). 
It remains the Remuneration Committee’s opinion that, in light of the 
areas where the Company operates, the relatively small number of 
Executive Directors at the Company and the roles conducted by the 
Executive Directors that an upper quartile level of total reward is 
appropriate. However, upper quartile levels of reward are only 
available (mainly through participation in the LTIP) for truly 
exceptional levels of performance. 
Overall levels of reward are benchmarked against three relevant 
comparator groups:
UK Oil & Gas companies (excluding those significantly larger than  >
the Company); 
an international comparator group comprising companies of a  >
similar size and scale to Heritage; and
the FTSE 250.  >
Within this overall reward policy, the manner in which each 
component of executive reward is aligned to the overall business 
strategy is shown in the following table.

Balance Between Fixed and Performance-Related Reward 
The charts below show the balance between fixed (base package 
and benefits) and variable (bonus and long-term incentives) 
elements of reward for each of the Executive Directors. 
Components of Executive Directors’ Reward 
CEO 72% 28%
CFO 66% 34%
Fixed Reward Variable Reward
Fixed Reward includes base package and value of benefits 
(including pension).
Variable Reward includes 2009 bonus and the annualised fair value 
of long-term incentive awards (apportioned over the life of the LTIP).
Base Package
The table below shows the annual base packages of the Executive 
Directors during 2009. Following the introduction of the LTIP in 
2008, the Remuneration Committee implemented a two year base 
package freeze for the Executive Directors and, therefore, salaries 
did not increase in 2009. 
Name 2009 Base Package
Anthony Buckingham £675,000
Paul Atherton £500,000
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the salaries of the 
Executive Directors during 2010 and a 5% increase was granted 
effective 1 April 2010.
Annual Bonus 
The annual bonus, payable wholly in cash, has a maximum limit of 
300% of base package and is payable to Executive Directors solely 
for the achievement of corporate targets. There are no individual 
targets for Executive Directors. At other levels in the Company, 
targets which relate to performance in an individual’s geographical 
area of operation or function are utilised but, for any bonus to be 
paid out at all, a minimum level of Company performance must 
be achieved.
The Remuneration Committee recommends the level of annual 
bonuses paid to the Executive Directors. The level of annual 
bonuses is based on corporate targets. Based upon the 
achievements of the Company during the year, including the 
successful drilling campaigns in Uganda and Kurdistan, increase in 
the share price, sale of the Omani assets and potential sale of the 
Ugandan interests, the bonus awards for the Executive Directors in 
2009 is 150% of base package, reflecting another year of excellent 
performance. 
During the year the Company achieved its targets. Consequently it 
has been agreed that a payment of 150% of base package will be 
paid to the Executive Directors.
Long-term Incentives 
2008 Long Term Incentive Plan
The LTIP was approved by shareholders in June 2008. The main 
features of the awards to Executive Directors are:
one-off awards of performance shares reflecting the equivalent of  >
three years of award; 
a face value of 1,200% of base package for the Chief Executive  >
Officer and 800% of base package for the Chief Financial Officer, 
reflecting the equivalent of annual awards for three years;
the performance conditions, measured over the three year period  >
starting with the date of the award, are relative TSR versus a group 
of international oil companies and a requirement for the share price 
to increase by at least 20% between the date of the award and the 
end of the vesting period; 
none of the awards will vest unless comparative TSR performance  >
is close to the upper quartile level of the comparator group; and
there is an additional holding period of one year following the  >
vesting of the awards.  58
Awards vest according to the following schedule: 
   Proportion of Award Vesting
     Typical UK 
TSR Performance vs. comparator group of 18 companies Heritage practice
3rd place (the Upper Decile) and above  100% 100%
4th place   80% 100%
5th place (the Upper Quartile)    50% 100%
6th place   30% 85%
7th place   0% 70%
8th place   0% 55%
9th place    0% 40%
10th place (the Median)    0% 25%
Below 10th place   0% 0%
Long-term incentive award levels have been set with reference to 
the upper quartile of the Company’s comparator groups. However, 
the vesting schedule is designed to only deliver the whole value of 
the award for truly exceptional performance, at a standard higher 
than that which is normal for the UK. The additional performance 
condition, requiring the share price to increase by 20% or more, is 
also above and beyond what is common in both the UK 
and Canada. 
In the light of the performance conditions described above, the 
Remuneration Committee believes that the award levels, which 
reflect the equivalent of annual awards for three years, are 
appropriate for the Executive Directors because: 
a one-off award provides better alignment of the Executive  >
Directors with current and potential shareholders following the 
Company’s reorganisation and listing on the Main Market of the 
LSE than would annual rolling awards;
a one-off award encourages sustained performance over the first  >
three key years following the Company’s listing in London. Annual 
awards can have the effect of encouraging “staggered” or 
“delayed” performance, e.g. not maximising investments and 
performance as soon as possible in any given year so as to 
ensure that new awards benefit from any uplift such investments 
and performance will create. The Remuneration Committee 
believes that it is in the best interest of shareholders for maximum 
value to be accrued as soon as possible;
a one-off award covering three years of annual grant provides a  >
greater retentive effect than annual grants and ensures continuity 
in management following the Company’s listing in London; and
whilst the Remuneration Committee is keen to move to UK  >
standard annual grant patterns as soon as practicable, provided 
to do so is in the best interests of shareholders, providing a 
one-off award equivalent to three years of annual awards 
counterbalances the Remuneration Committee’s decision to 
remove annual vesting for long-term incentives, replacing it 
with a three year vesting period and an additional one year 
holding period.
The comparator group companies were selected on the basis of 
their size and scale of operations, market capitalisation and 
geographic spread. The original comparator group comprised the 
following companies:
Aminex plc Imperial Energy plc Premier Oil plc 
Bowleven plc JKX Oil and Gas plc SOCO International plc 
Dana Petroleum plc Mariner Energy Inc. Stone Energy Corp.
Dominion Resources  McMoran Exploration Swift Energy Co.
Inc.  Co.
Gulf Keystone  Melrose Resources Tullow Oil plc
Petroleum Ltd. plc
Hunting plc Oilexco Inc. Venture Production plc
It is not planned to make any further awards to existing members of 
the LTIP scheme before 2011, although awards may be made to 
new senior members of staff between 2009 and 2011. 
2008 Replacement Share Option Scheme
Heritage Oil Corporation (“HOC”) implemented The Heritage Oil 
Corporation Plan (“the Original Plan”) following approval by its 
shareholders in 2004 and granted options under the Original Plan to 
its Executive and Non-Executive Directors and other employees 
and consultants at that time. The grant of options included all the 
then current Executive and Non-Executive Board members and so 
excluded General Sir Michael Wilkes and Salim Macki. As a result of 
the Group reorganisation and subsequent listing on the Main 
Market of the LSE, all the Board members were entitled to retain 
their options under the Original Plan and exchange them for options 
to acquire ten Ordinary Shares of the Company for every one 
Common Share they held under option. The Original Plan was then 
cancelled and on 18 March 2008, the Company adopted The 
Heritage Oil Limited 2008 Replacement Share Option Scheme 
(“Replacement Scheme”) which is substantially in the same form as 
the Original Plan. The purpose of the Replacement Scheme is to 
act as a replacement to the Original Plan and to honour the options 
granted under it by granting holders the option to purchase 
Ordinary Shares. The Replacement Scheme is administered by the 
Board and no further options will be granted under it.
The maximum number of Ordinary Shares which may be issued under 
the Replacement Scheme was 24,545,340, being the equivalent 
number of shares required to replace the options granted under the 
Original Plan that were still in existence prior to their cancellation.
All options under the Replacement Scheme have now vested and 
the Company will not grant any further options under this scheme. 
Pensions 
Executive Directors receive pension contributions of an annual 
amount equal to 10% of their base package into a personal pension 
scheme nominated by the executive. 
Other Benefits 
The Company’s policy is to provide Executive Directors with private 
medical insurance, life insurance and school fees for dependents 
but no other benefits in kind which would be typical in the UK. In 
addition, both Executive Directors are entitled to allowances of 
£100,000 (Anthony Buckingham) and £77,500 (Paul Atherton) to 
cover their living expenses.

Shareholding Guidelines 
At present the Committee has not established formal Executive 
Director shareholding guidelines as, in the opinion of the 
Committee, these would be superfluous at this time. The Executive 
Directors hold a substantial number of shares in the Company and 
have interests in shares under various share incentive arrangements 
as shown in the table below:

1 The full vesting of 2008 LTIP and share options is assumed. Cost of exercise is 
£14,520,199 for Anthony Buckingham and £3,433,750 for Paul Atherton.
Service Agreements
The Executive Directors’ service agreements with the Company are 
for no fixed term. In normal circumstances, the agreements may be 
terminated by the Company giving no less than 24 months notice 
and the Director giving six months’ notice. These arrangements 
were in place during their time as Executive Directors of HOC and 
were inherited by the Company. The Board feels that these notice 
periods were appropriate to recruit and retain the Executive 
Directors. The Board recognises that these arrangements are not in 
line with current UK market practice. The Company has discussed 
the Executive Director employment contracts with external advisers 
and internally within the Remuneration Committee. After taking 
these views into consideration, the Company has decided, for 
commercial reasons, to retain the existing Executive Director notice 
period structure because of their importance to the business at this 
stage in its development. We believe that this policy protects the 
interests of our shareholders.

 Contract Term by Company by Director
Anthony  28 March Rolling 24 months 6 months
Buckingham 2008 Contract
Paul Atherton 28 March Rolling 24 months 6 months
 2008 Contract
In the event of a change of control of the Company, if the Executive 
Directors resign or the Company terminates their appointment 
within 24 months of such an event, they will each be entitled to an 
immediate payment in lieu of notice of a sum equivalent to three 
times their annual base package. In addition, they will be entitled to 
a payment of Cdn$75,000 in the event they are asked to resign 
from the Board of HOC in any event other than as a result of a 
change of control. The Company also may terminate the 
agreements and make payments in lieu of notice.
Currently the Executive Directors’ service contracts do not provide 
for mitigation in the event of early termination. The Executive 
Directors do not have service contracts with any Group subsidiary.
Non-Executive Directors 
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts but their 
terms are set out in a letter of appointment. Their terms of 
appointment may be terminated by each party giving three months 
notice in writing. Michael Hibberd and Gregory Turnbull will be 
entitled to a change of control bonus of Cdn$75,000 plus a pro-rata 
amount of their previous year’s bonus multiplied by a share price 
performance factor in the event that HOC changes control. 
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is a matter for the 
Chairman and the Executive members of the Board. The 
Company’s policy is to set levels for Non-Executive Directors’ 
remuneration so as to ensure that they are sufficient to attract, 
retain and motivate high quality directors. 
Non-Executive Directors’ annual basic fee levels for 2009 and 2010 
are set out below. Actual fees paid for the year ended 31 December 
2009 are shown in the Directors’ Emoluments table on page 60.

With the exception of General Sir Michael Wilkes and Salim Macki, 
all of the Non-Executive Directors will be entitled to a payment of 
Cdn$75,000 in the event they are asked to resign from the Board of 
HOC in any event other than as a result of a change of control. 
General Sir Michael Wilkes received a payment of £50,000 on 
joining the Board of the Company. No other Director received this 
form of payment on joining the Board of the Company.
During 2009, Michael Hibberd, Gregory Turnbull and John McLeod 
received fees of Cdn$22,500 per annum from HOC for acting as 
Directors of that company. From 2010, the annual fees paid by 
Heritage Oil Plc are reduced by the monthly fees paid by HOC.

Directors’ Report
Corporate Governance Statement
In accordance with the Financial Services Authority’s Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules (“DTR”) 7.2.1, the disclosures required by 
DTR 7.2.2R to DTR 7.2.7 may be found in the Corporate 
Governance Report on pages 48 to 54.
Results and Dividends 
The Group’s financial statements for the year ended 31 December 
2009 are set out on pages 68 to 98.
The proposed disposal of the Ugandan interests is expected to 
complete within the first half of 2010. After completion of the 
transaction, Heritage will have the financial flexibility to consider 
various options to create further shareholder value and will also 
consider returning a portion of the transaction proceeds to 
shareholders via a special dividend, which could be in the range of 
£0.75 to £1.00 per share. The Company has not declared or paid 
any other dividends since incorporation and the Company does not 
have any current intentions to pay further dividends in the 
foreseeable future. Future payments of dividends are expected to 
depend on the earnings and financial condition of the Company and 
such other factors as the Board of Directors of the Company 
consider appropriate.

Directors’ Indemnity Provisions
Under the Company’s Articles, Directors are indemnified out of the 
assets of the Company against any loss or liability incurred by 
reasons of having been a Director of the Company.
Share Capital
Capital Structure 
The Company has two classes of shares, namely the Ordinary 
Shares and the special voting share (the “Special Voting Share”). 
The Ordinary Shares and the Special Voting Share carry no right to 
fixed income. The Ordinary Shares have a right to one vote for every 
share at general meetings whilst the holders of Exchangeable 
Shares have rights through the Special Voting Share held by the 
trustee of the Voting and Exchange Trust to one vote at general 
meetings for every Exchangeable Share on the same basis as if 
they had exchanged them for Ordinary Shares. For clarity, the 
Voting and Exchange Trust is a Canadian Trust that holds the 
Special Voting Share for the benefit of the registered holders of the 
Exchangeable Shares pursuant to the terms of a Voting and 
Exchange Trust Agreement dated 27 February 2008 as amended 
24 April 2008. 
Details of how to vote and deadlines for exercising voting rights are 
set out in the Notice of AGM.
Subject to the Articles, any member may transfer certificated shares 
by an instrument of transfer in writing in any usual form or in any 
other form acceptable to the Directors. Directors may refuse to 
register any transfer of certificated shares which are not fully paid or 
where the register of transfer is not in the acceptable form.
The issued share capital of the Company and total voting rights of 
the Company as at 29 April 2010 are as follows:
284,842,830 Ordinary Shares of the Company are issued and  >
outstanding, which constitutes 98.9% of the total voting rights of 
the Company; and
3,024,108 Exchangeable Shares of HOC each carrying one voting  >
right in the Company, are issued and outstanding, which 
constitutes 1.1% of the total voting rights of the Company.
The Executive Directors’ interests in the Ordinary Shares, 
Exchangeable Shares, options granted under the employee share 
scheme and interests in the LTIP are set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on page 59.
Repurchase of Shares
As approved at the General Meeting held on 25 January 2010, the 
Company may make market purchases of its own shares. Any 
shares which have been so purchased may be held as treasury 
shares or cancelled immediately upon completion of the purchase.
The Company did not purchase any of its own shares during 2009 
or in 2010 up to 29 April 2010, being the date of this report.

Directors’ Report continued

Change of Control Agreements
The Company confirms that there are no significant agreements 
to which it is party that would take effect, alter or terminate upon 
a change of control following a takeover bid except those 
disclosed below: 
the Executive Directors’ service contracts contain certain  >
provisions in relation to change of control as disclosed in the 
Remuneration Report;
the LTIP rules contain a provision whereby in the event of a  >
change of control all awards will vest in their entirety subject to 
the achievement or otherwise of the performance conditions;
on 16 February 2007, HOC issued 1,650 $100,000 convertible  >
bonds at par to raise $165,000,000 by way of a private 
placement. Issue costs amounted to $6,979,268 resulting in net 
proceeds of $158,020,732. The bonds at par have a maturity of 
five years and one day and an annual coupon of 8.00%. The 
bondholders had the right to convert the bonds into Ordinary 
Shares at a price of $4.70 per share. As at 29 April 2010, 
$37,900,000 of bonds have converted, leaving 1,271 $100,000 
convertible bonds outstanding; and
bondholders have a put option requiring the Company to redeem  >
the bonds at par, plus accrued interest, in the event of a change 
of control of the Company, together with an additional cash 
payment of up to $19,700 on each $100,000 bond. The amount 
of additional payment depends upon the date of redemption and 
market value of the Company’s Ordinary Shares at the date of 
any change of control event.
Important Events Subsequent to the Year End
Events since the balance sheet date are summarised in note 25 to 
the financial statements on page 98.
Audit and Auditors 
Directors who held office at the date of approval of this Directors’ 
Report confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the Company’s Auditors are 
unaware; and each Director has taken all the steps that they ought 
to have taken as a Director to make themselves aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
Auditors are aware of that information.
Having reviewed the independence and effectiveness of the 
Auditors, the Audit Committee has recommended to the Board that 
the existing Auditors, KPMG Audit Plc be reappointed. KPMG Audit 
Plc has expressed their willingness to continue as Auditors. An 
ordinary resolution to reappoint KPMG Audit Plc as auditors of the 
Company and authorising the Directors to set their remuneration 
will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM. 
Financial Risks and Financial Instruments
Information on financial risk management, including credit and 
liquidity risks and information about financial instruments is set out 
in the financial review on pages 34 to 36 and the notes to the 
financial statements on pages 83 to 84 respectively.
Going Concern 
After making due enquiries, the Directors have made an informed 
judgement at the time of approving the Financial Statements, that 
there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. In making this assessment they have considered the Company 
and Group budgets, the cash flow forecasts and reviewed the 
availability of banking facilities. For this reason, the Directors continue 
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Financial 
Statements.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the financial statements for the Group in accordance with 
applicable Jersey law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law they are required 
to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by 
the European Union (“EU”) and applicable law.
The Group financial statements are required by law and IFRS as 
adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position of the 
Group and the performance for that period.
In preparing the financial statements the Directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply  >
them consistently;
present information, including accounting policies, in a  >
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific  >
requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions 
on the entity’s financial position and financial performance;
state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRS  >
as adopted by the EU; and
prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless,  >
having assessed the ability of the Company to continue as a 
going concern, it is inappropriate to presume the Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Group and enable them to ensure that its 
financial statements comply with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. 
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them for safeguarding the assets of the Group 
and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law, regulations and listing rule requirements, the 
Directors are also responsible for the preparation of a Directors’ 
Report, Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the statutory and audited information on the Company’s website. 
Jersey legislation and United Kingdom regulation, governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements, may differ 
from requirements in other jurisdictions.

We have audited the Group financial statements of Heritage Oil Plc for the year ended 31 December 2009 which comprise the 
consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement of 
changes in equity, consolidated cash flow statement and the related notes. These financial statements have been prepared under the 
accounting policies set out therein.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Article 110 of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, and 
in respect of reporting on the Corporate Governance Report, on terms that have been agreed. Our audit work has been undertaken so that 
we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and, in respect of 
reporting on the Corporate Governance Report, those matters that we have agreed to state to them in our report, and for no other 
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As described in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on page 64, the Company’s Directors are responsible for preparation of the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the 
European Union. 
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with the relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records or if we 
have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
In addition to our audit of the financial statements, the Directors have engaged us to review their Corporate Governance Statement as if the 
Company were required to comply with the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority applicable to companies incorporated in the 
UK in relation to those matters. We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine 
provisions of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance published in 2008 specified for our review by those rules, and we report if it 
does not. We are not required by the terms of our engagement to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all 
risks and controls, or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control 
procedures.
We read the Directors’ Report and other information accompanying the financial statements and consider the implications for our report if 
we become aware of any apparent misstatements within it.
Basis of Audit Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also 
includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, 
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to 
provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of 
information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by  >
the European Union, of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2009 and of its loss for the year then ended; and
the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.  > Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Overview

1 Reporting Entity
Heritage Oil Plc (the “Company”) was incorporated under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 (as amended) on 6 February 2008 as Heritage 
Oil Limited. The Company changed its name to Heritage Oil Plc on 18 June 2009. Its primary business activity is the exploration, 
development and production of petroleum and natural gas in Africa, the Middle East and Russia. The Company was established in order to 
implement a corporate reorganisation of Heritage Oil Corporation (“HOC”, the “Corporation”).
These consolidated financial statements include the results of the Company and all subsidiaries over which the Company exercises control. 
The Company together with its subsidiaries are referred to as the Group. The key subsidiaries consolidated within these financial 
statements include inter alia Heritage Oil Corporation, Heritage Oil & Gas Limited, Eagle Energy (Oman) Limited (disposed in 2009 (note 6)), 
Heritage Oil and Gas (U) Limited, Heritage Energy Middle East Limited, Heritage DRC Limited, Coatbridge Estates Limited, 
ChumpassNefteDobycha, Neftyanaya Geologicheskaya Kompaniya, Heritage Oil & Gas (Austria) GesmbH, Heritage Mali Block 7 Limited, 
Heritage Mali Block 11 Limited, Heritage Energy Holding GesmbH, Heritage Oil & Gas (Gibraltar) Limited, TISE‑Heritage Neftegaz, Begal Air 
Limited, Heritage International Holding GesmbH, Heritage Oil & Gas Holdings Limited, Eagle Drill Limited, Heritage Oil (Barbados) Limited, 
Heritage Oil & Gas (Switzerland) SA, Heritage Oil International Malta Limited, 1381890 Alberta ULC, Heritage Oil Cooperatief U.A., Heritage 
Oil Holdings Limited, Heritage International VOF, Heritage (International) Holding (Gibraltar) Limited, Heritage Tanzania Kimbiji‑ Latham 
Limited, Heritage Tanzania Kisangire Limited and Heritage Oil Tanzania Limited.
The financial statements were approved by the Board and authorised for issuance on 29 April 2010.
2 Significant Accounting Policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
a) Basis of Preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain 
financial assets and liabilities at fair value.
The Company’s consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency.
The Group had available cash of $208 million at 31 December 2009. Based on its current plans and knowledge, its projected capital 
expenditure and operating cash requirements, the Group has sufficient cash to finance its operations for more than 12 months from the 
date of this report. As for most oil and gas exploration companies, Heritage raises financing for its activities from time to time using a 
variety of sources. Sources of funding for future exploration and development programmes will be derived from inter alia disposal proceeds 
from the sale of assets, such as the sale of the Company’s holdings in Oman in 2009 and the proposed disposal of its 50% interests in 
Blocks 1 and 3A, Uganda (note 6), using its existing treasury resources, new credit facilities, reinvesting its funds from operations, farm‑ outs and, when considered appropriate, issuing debt and additional equity. Accordingly, the Group has a number of different sources of 
finance available and the Directors are confident that additional finance will be raised as and when needed. 
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts.
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the 
Operations Review of the Annual Report on pages 18 to 29. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows and liquidity position are 
described in the Financial Review on pages 30 to 37. In addition, note 3 to the financial statements includes the Group’s policies and 
processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management; and its exposure to foreign exchange risk, commodity price risk, credit 
risk and liquidity risk.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires 
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree 
of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are 
disclosed in note 4.
b) Change in Accounting Policies
(i) Presentation of Financial Statements
In 2009, the Group has applied IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements (revised 2007) which has introduced a number of terminology 
changes and has resulted in a number of changes in presentation and disclosure. The revised standard has had no impact on the reported 
results or financial position of the Group. Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Overview
77
Heritage Oil Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009
2 Significant Accounting Policies continued
(ii) Determination and Presentation of Operating Segments (Also see note 2d)
As of January 2009, the Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is provided to the 
Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), who is the Group’s chief operating decision maker. This change in accounting policy is due to the adoption 
of IFRS 8 Operating Segments. Previously operating segments were determined and presented in accordance with IAS 14 Segment 
Reporting. The new accounting policy in respect of segment operating disclosures is presented as follows. 
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur 
expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components. 
An operating segment’s operating results, for which discrete financial information is available, are reviewed regularly by the CEO and Chief 
Financial Officer (“CFO”) to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance. 
Segment results that are reported to the CEO and CFO include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be 
allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly corporate assets, corporate offices expenses and liabilities.
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets 
other than goodwill.
(iii) Borrowings
In 2009, the Company changed its accounting policy in relation to the recognition of equity or financial liabilities arising from the issue of 
convertible bonds. Previously the Company made the assessment of whether the conversion feature is a derivative liability or an equity 
instrument on initial recognition only and did not revisit that assessment, absent any actual change in the contractual terms. It is now the 
Company’s policy to reassess the classification during the life of the convertible bond and reclassify between liabilities and equity when 
appropriate. In particular, the Company now adopts a policy of reassessing the initial classification when there has been a change in the 
effective terms of the contract. It was the existence of the Company call option that resulted in derivative treatment for the conversion 
option in the convertible bond issued on 16 February 2007. Following the expiry of that option the Company has under this new policy 
reclassified the conversion option as an equity instrument from that date. The Company believes this new policy provides reliable and more 
relevant information as it bases the classification of such instruments on the terms that are currently operative. 
In accordance with the requirements of IAS 8 (Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors) the change has been 
made retrospectively and the comparatives have been restated accordingly.
As a result, the loss for continuing operations for the year ended 31 December 2008 has been restated to increase the previously reported 
net loss attributable to owners of the Company by $4.9 million to $46.2 million. These adjustments have been taken up in finance income 
(costs). In addition, non-current derivative financial liabilities were reduced by $25.8 million to nil at 31 December 2008 and the fair value of 
the conversion feature as at 16 February 2008 of $30.6 million was transferred to equity through the Statement of Changes in Equity. If the 
accounting policy had not changed then an additional loss of $63.5 million would have been recognised in the income statement for the year 
ended 31 December 2009 and a non-current derivative financial liability of $89.2 million would have been recognised in the balance sheet at 
31 December 2009. The change in accounting policy had no impact on the cash flow statement. No consolidated balance sheet as at 
1 January 2008 has been presented because the change in accounting policy had no impact at that date.
c) Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets and liabilities of all subsidiaries of the Company as at 31 December 2009 and 
2008 and the results of all subsidiaries for the years then ended.
Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) over which the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating 
policies, so as to obtain benefits from its activities, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The 
existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the 
Company controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Company. They 
are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases. 
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is 
measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus 
costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business 
combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. The excess of 
the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, 
the difference is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group entities (the Company and its subsidiaries) are 
eliminated. For the purposes of consolidation, the accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure 
consistency with the policies adopted by the Company. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued

2 Significant Accounting Policies continued
d) Segment Reporting
As of January 2009, the Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is provided to the 
CEO, who is the Group’s chief operating decision maker. This change in accounting policy is due to the adoption of IFRS 8 Operating 
Segments. Previously operating segments were determined and presented in accordance with IAS 14 Segment Reporting. The new 
accounting policy in respect of segment operating disclosures is presented as follows.
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur 
expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components. An operating segment’s 
operating results are reviewed regularly by the CEO and CFO to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and 
assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.
Segment results that are reported to the CEO and CFO include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be 
allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly corporate assets, corporate offices expenses and liabilities.
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets 
other than goodwill.
e) Joint Arrangements
The majority of exploration, development and production activities are conducted jointly with others under contractual arrangement and, 
accordingly, the Group only reflects its proportionate interest in such assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.
f) Exploration and Evaluation Expenditures
The Group applies a modified full cost method of accounting for exploration and evaluation (“E&E”) costs, having regard to the 
requirements of IFRS 6 “Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources”. Under the modified full cost method of accounting, costs of 
exploring for and evaluating oil and gas properties are capitalised on a licence or prospect basis and the resulting assets are tested for 
impairment by reference to appropriate cost pools. Such cost pools are based on geographic areas and are not larger than a segment. 
The Group had eight cost pools in 2009, (2008 – nine cost pools, including Oman) Uganda, Kurdistan, Russia, DRC, Pakistan, Malta, 
Mali and Tanzania.
E&E costs related to each licence/prospect are initially capitalised within “Intangible exploration assets”. Such E&E costs may include costs 
of licence acquisition, technical services and studies, seismic acquisition, exploration drilling and testing, the projected costs of retiring the 
assets (if any) and directly attributable general and administrative expenses, but do not include costs incurred prior to having obtained the 
legal rights to explore an area, which are expensed directly to the income statement as they are incurred.
Where the Company farms-in to licences and incurs costs in excess of its own share of licence costs as consideration, these costs are 
capitalised as its own share.
Tangible assets acquired for use in E&E activities are classified as property, plant and equipment; however, to the extent that such a 
tangible asset is consumed in developing an intangible E&E asset, the amount reflecting that consumption is recorded as part of the cost 
of the intangible asset.
Intangible E&E assets related to each exploration licence/prospect are not depreciated and are carried forward until the existence 
(or otherwise) of commercial reserves has been determined. The Group’s definition of commercial reserves for such purpose is proved and 
probable reserves on an entitlement basis.
Proved and probable reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological, geophysical 
and engineering data demonstrate with a specified degree of certainty (see below) to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs 
and which are considered commercially producible. There should be a 50% statistical probability that the actual quantity of recoverable 
reserves will be more than the amount estimated as proved and probable and a 50% statistical probability that it will be less. The 
equivalent statistical probabilities for the proven component of proved and probable reserves are 90% and 10%, respectively.
Such reserves may be considered commercially producible if management has the intention of developing and producing them and such 
intention is based upon:
 a reasonable assessment of the future economics of such production; >
 a reasonable expectation that there is a market for all or substantially all the expected hydrocarbon production; and >
 evidence that the necessary production, transmission and transportation facilities are available or can be made available. >
Furthermore:
(i) Reserves may only be considered proved and probable if producibility is supported by either actual production or a conclusive 
formation test. The area of reservoir considered proved includes (a) that portion delineated by drilling and defined by gas-oil and/or 
oil-water contacts, if any, or both, and (b) the immediately adjoining portions not yet drilled, but which can be reasonably judged as 
economically productive on the basis of available geophysical, geological and engineering data. In the absence of information on fluid 
contacts, the lowest known structural occurrence of hydrocarbons controls the lower proved limit of the reservoir. Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Overview
79
Heritage Oil Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009
2 Significant Accounting Policies continued
(ii) Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (such as fluid injection) are only 
included in the proved and probable classification when successful testing by a pilot project, the operation of an installed programme in 
the reservoir, or other reasonable evidence (such as, experience of the same techniques on similar reservoirs or reservoir simulation 
studies) provides support for the engineering analysis on which the project or programme was based.
If commercial reserves have been discovered, the related E&E assets are assessed for impairment on a cost pool basis as set out below 
and any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement. The carrying value, after any impairment loss, of the relevant E&E assets is 
then reclassified as development and production assets within property, plant and equipment.
E&E assets are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may exceed its recoverable 
amount. Such indicators include the point at which a determination is made as to whether or not commercial reserves exist. Where the 
E&E assets concerned fall within the scope of an established full cost pool, the E&E assets are tested for impairment together with all 
development and production assets associated with that cost pool, as a single cash generating unit. The aggregate carrying value is 
compared against the expected recoverable amount of the pool, generally by reference to the present value of the future net cash flows 
expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves. Where the E&E assets to be tested fall outside the scope of any 
established cost pool, there will generally be no commercial reserves and the E&E assets concerned will be written off in full.
g) Property, Plant and Equipment
i) Development and Production Assets
The Group had one interest at the development and production stage during the years covered by these financial statements; Russia. 
(2008 – Russia and Oman which was disposed in 2009 (note 6)).
Development and production assets are accumulated on a field-by-field basis and represent the cost of developing the commercial 
reserves discovered and bringing them into production, together with the E&E expenditures incurred in finding commercial reserves 
transferred from intangible E&E assets as outlined above, the projected cost of retiring the assets and directly attributable general and 
administrative expenses.
The net book values of producing assets are depleted on a field-by-field basis using the unit of production method by reference to the ratio 
of production in the year to the related proved plus probable reserves of the field, taking into account estimated future development 
expenditures necessary to bring those reserves into production.
An impairment test is performed whenever events and circumstances arising during the development or production phase indicate that the 
carrying value of a development or production asset may exceed its recoverable amount. The aggregate carrying value is compared against the 
expected recoverable amount of the cash generating unit, generally by reference to the present value of the future net cash flows expected to be 
derived from the production of commercial reserves. The cash generating unit applied for impairment test purposes is generally the field, except 
that a number of field interests may be grouped as a single cash generating unit where the cash flows generated by the fields are interdependent.
ii) Other Assets
Other property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. The assets’ useful lives and 
residual values are assessed on an annual basis. Furniture and fittings are depreciated using the reducing balance method at 20% per year.
Land is not subject to depreciation.
The corporate jet is depreciated over its expected useful life of 69 months. Depreciation is charged so as to write-off the cost, less 
estimated residual value of the corporate jet on a straight-line basis.
Corporate capital assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The building is depreciated on a straight-
line basis over 40 years with nil residual value. The land is not depreciated.
h) Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with 
original maturities of three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
i) Trade and Other Receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that 
the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
j) Inventories
Inventories consist of petroleum, condensate, liquid petroleum gas and materials that are recorded at the lower of weighted average cost 
and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials, direct labour, depletion and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing 
the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, 
less applicable variable selling expenses. Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where appropriate. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued

k) Investments
The Group classifies its investments in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through the income statement, and available-
for-sale financial assets. The classification depends on the purpose for which the investments were acquired. Management determines the 
classification of its investments at initial recognition. During the years covered by these financial statements the Group did not have any 
investments classified as “loans and receivables” or “held to maturity investments”.
i) Financial Assets at Fair Value Through the Income Statement
Financial assets held for trading are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement. A financial asset is 
classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short-term. Derivatives are classified as held for trading 
unless they are designated as hedges.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the “financial assets at fair value through the income statement” category are 
presented in the income statement within “Unrealised gain/(loss) on other financial assets” in the year in which they arise.
ii) Available-for-Sale Financial Assets
Available-for-sale financial assets, comprising principally marketable equity securities, are non-derivatives that are either designated in this 
category or not classified. They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 
12 months of the balance sheet date.
Changes in the fair value of monetary securities classified as available-for-sale (other than impairment losses and foreign exchange gains 
and losses which are recognised in the income statement) are recognised in equity. Upon sale of a security classified as available-for-sale, 
the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets 
is impaired. Measurement is assessed by reference to the fair value of the financial asset or group of financial assets.
l) Non‑Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets held for sale and stated at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value 
less costs to sell if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
Non-current assets (including those that are part of a disposal group) are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held for 
sale. Interest and other expenses attributable to the liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale continue to be recognised.
Non-current assets classified as held for sale and the assets of a disposal group classified as assets held for sale are presented separately, 
as current assets, from the other assets in the balance sheet. The liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented 
separately, as current liabilities, from other liabilities in the balance sheet.
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of 
operations that has been disposed of or is held for sale, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Classification as a 
discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, if earlier. When an 
operation is classified as a discontinued operation, from the comparative income statement is re-presented as if the operation had been 
discontinued from the start of the comparative period.
m) Trade and Other Payables
These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of the financial year which are unpaid.
n) Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption amount is recognised in the income statement 
over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Convertible bonds are separated into liability and derivative liability components (being the bondholders’ conversion option) and each 
component is recognised separately. On initial recognition, the fair value of the liability component of a convertible bond is determined 
using a market interest rate for an equivalent non convertible bond. This amount is recorded as a liability on an amortised cost basis using 
the effective interest method until extinguished on conversion or maturity of the bonds. The Company reassesses the classification during 
the life of the convertible bond and reclassifies between liabilities and equity when appropriate (note 2b(iii)).
Borrowings are removed from the balance sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired. The 
difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability that has been extinguished or transferred to another party and the 
consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in finance income or costs.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 
12 months after the balance sheet date. Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Overview

2 Significant Accounting Policies continued
o) Borrowing Costs
Borrowing costs incurred for the construction of any qualifying asset are capitalised during the period of time that is required to complete 
and prepare the asset for its intended use or sale. Other borrowing costs are expensed.
The capitalisation rate used to determine the amount of borrowing costs to be capitalised is the weighted average interest rate applicable to 
the Group’s outstanding borrowings during the year. For the year ended 31 December 2009, this was 12.10% (31 December 2008 – 12.01%).
p) Provisions
Asset Retirement Obligations
Provision is made for the estimated cost of any asset retirement obligations when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation 
as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been 
reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. Asset retirement obligation expense is capitalised in the 
relevant asset category unless it arises from the normal course of production activities.
Provisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the 
balance sheet date. The discount rate used to determine the present value reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the liability.
Subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation, the obligation is adjusted at the end of each year to reflect the 
passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation. The increase in the provision due to the passage 
of time is recognised as finance costs whereas changes in the estimated future cash flows are added to or deducted from the related asset 
in the current period.
q) Revenue Recognition
Revenue from the sale of petroleum and natural gas is recognised at the fair value received or receivable and is recorded when the 
significant risks and rewards of ownership of the product are transferred to the buyer. For sales of oil and gas this is usually when legal title 
passes to the external party which occurs on shipment of oil and gas to the buyer. Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis 
using the effective interest method.
r) Income Taxes
Current income tax is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement because it 
excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s current tax assets and liabilities are calculated using tax rates that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the balance sheet method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates 
(and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred 
income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable 
amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when the 
deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority.
s) Foreign Currency Translation
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries are measured using the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates (“the functional currency”). The Company’s consolidated financial 
statements are presented in US dollars, which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the respective functional currencies of Group entities using the exchange rates prevailing at 
the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation 
at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
The results and financial position of all the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries (none of which has a functional currency that is the 
currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the 
presentation currency as follows:
i) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
ii) income and expenses for each year are translated at average exchange rates (unless this is not a reasonable approximation of the 
cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the 
transactions); and
iii) all resulting exchange differences are recognised as either income or expense in a separate component of equity. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued
82
2 Significant Accounting Policies continued
Foreign currency loans and overdrafts are designated as, and are considered to be, hedges of the exchange rate exposure inherent in 
foreign currency net investments and, to the extent that the hedge is effective, exchange differences giving rise to changes in the carrying 
value of foreign currency loans are also recognised as income or expense directly in equity. All other exchange differences giving rise to 
changes in the carrying value of foreign currency loans and overdrafts are recognised in the income statement.
When a foreign operation is sold, a proportionate share of the cumulative exchange differences previously recognised in equity are 
recognised in the income statement, as part of the gain or loss on sale where applicable.
t) Share‑Based Compensation Plans
The Group applies the fair value method of accounting to all equity-classified share-based compensation arrangements for both 
employees and non-employees. Compensation costs of equity-classified awards to employees are measured at fair value of the awards at 
the time when the services are rendered at the grant date and recognised over the periods during which the employees become 
unconditionally entitled to the options. The compensation cost is charged to the income statement with a corresponding increase in equity. 
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest.
The compensation cost of equity-classified awards to non-employees is initially measured at fair value of the awards at the time when the 
services are rendered, and periodically remeasured to fair value until the non-employees’ performance is complete, and recognised over 
the periods during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The compensation cost is charged to income with 
a corresponding increase to share-based payment reserve. 
Upon the exercise of the award, consideration received is recognised in equity (notes 18 and 19).
u) Share Capital
Ordinary and Exchangeable Shares are classified as share capital. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or 
options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. 
If the Company reacquires its own equity instruments the cost is deducted from equity and the associated shares are cancelled.
v) Earnings per Share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of 
Ordinary Shares outstanding during the financial period. The rights of different classes of shares are the same and therefore economically 
equivalent. As such, Ordinary and Exchangeable Shares are treated as one class of shares for the earnings per share calculation.
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account the after income 
tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential Ordinary Shares and the weighted average number of 
shares assumed to have been issued for no consideration in relation to dilutive potential Ordinary Shares.
The if-converted method used in the calculation of diluted earnings per share assumes the conversion of convertible securities at the later 
of the beginning of the reported period or issuance date, if dilutive.
w) New Accounting Standards and Interpretations
Certain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for the year ended 31 December 2009. 
The Company’s assessment of the impact of these new standards and interpretations which have not been adopted is set out below.
i) IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: effective for accounting periods commencing 1 January 2013. Not yet endorsed for use in the EU. The 
expected impact is still being assessed by management, but is expected to only impact disclosures of the Group.
ii) IFRS 5 (Amendment), Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discounted Operations: requires that assets and liabilities of a subsidiary 
should be classified as held for sale if the Parent is committed to making a plan involving loss of control of the subsidiary, regardless of 
whether the entity will retain a non-controlling interest after the sale. Effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 
2010. It has not yet been endorsed for use in the EU. The expected impact is still being assessed by management, but is expected to 
only impact disclosures of the Group.
iii) IAS 17 (Amendment), Leases: amended to require classification of land and buildings leases based on an assessment of transfer of risks 
and rewards. Effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2010. It has not yet been endorsed for use in the EU. 
The expected impact is still being assessed by management, but is expected to only impact disclosures of the Group.
iv) IAS 1 (Amendment), Presentation of Financial Statements: amended to confirm that the classification of a convertible instrument is not 
affected by terms that allow its settlement, at any time, by the issuance of equity instruments at the option of the counterparty. Effective 
for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2010. The expected impact is still being assessed by management, but is 
expected to only impact disclosures of the Group.
The following amendments are assessed not to have any impact on the Company’s financial statements:
i) IFRS 3 (2008) Business Combinations: effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 July 2009. 
ii) IAS 27 (Amendment), Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements: effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 July 2009. 
iii) IFRS 1 (Revised), First time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards. Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Overview

iv) IAS 39 (Amendment) Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement – Eligible Hedged Items provides clarification where 
differences in practice exists on the designation of inflation as a hedged risk and the treatment of “one-sided” risks on hedged items. 
Effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 July 2009.
v) IFRS 2 (Amendment) Share Based Payments: amended to require subsidiary who receives employee services when another group 
entity or shareholder grants a cash-settled share-based payment to recognise that transaction in its own accounts. Effective for 
accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2010. Not yet endorsed for use in the EU.
vi) IAS 36 (Amendment), Impairment of Assets: amended to clarify that for the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to 
operating segments as defined in paragraph 5 of IFRS 8 Operating Segments, i.e. before aggregation. Effective for accounting periods 
commencing on or after 1 January 2010. Not yet endorsed for use in the EU. The expected impact is still being assessed by 
management, but is expected to only impact the disclosures of the Group.
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these amendments will have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements in 
the period of initial application.
3 Risk Management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks that arise as a result of its exploration, development, production, and financing 
activities. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise 
potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance.
a) Financial Risk Management
i) Foreign Exchange Risk
Foreign exchange risk arises when transactions and recognised assets and liabilities of the Group entity concerned are denominated in a 
currency that is not the Company’s functional currency. The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising 
from currency exposures to the US dollar.
There are no forward exchange rate contracts in place at, or subsequent to, 31 December 2009.
At 31 December 2009, if the Canadian dollar had strengthened/weakened by 10% against the US dollar with all other variables held 
constant, the loss for the year would have been $535,558 (31 December 2008 – $122,403) higher/(lower), mainly as a result of foreign 
exchange gains/losses on translation of Canadian dollar-denominated general and administrative expenses and cash in bank.
At 31 December 2009, if the Russian rouble had strengthened/weakened by 10% against the US dollar with all other variables held 
constant, the loss for the year would have been $(556,600) (31 December 2008 – $(513,633)) higher/(lower), mainly as a result of foreign 
exchange gains/losses on translation of Russian rouble-denominated cash in bank and monetary assets and liabilities.
At 31 December 2009, if the GB pound sterling had strengthened/weakened by 10% against the US dollar with all other variables held constant, 
the loss for the year would have been $2,309,160 (31 December 2008 – $605,907) higher/(lower), mainly as a result of GB pound sterling- 
denominated general and administrative expenses and foreign exchange gains/losses on translation of GB pound sterling-denominated 
long-term loan.
At 31 December 2009, if the Swiss franc had strengthened/weakened by 10% against the US dollar with all other variables held constant, 
the loss for the year would have been $(300,238) (31 December 2008 – $(299,806)) higher/(lower), mainly as a result of foreign exchange 
gains/losses on translation of Swiss franc-denominated cash at bank.
ii) Commodity Price Risk
The Company is exposed to commodity price risk to the extent that it sells its entitlement to petroleum, condensate and liquid petroleum 
gas production on a floating price basis. The Company may consider partly mitigating this risk in the future.
The table below summarises the impact of increases/decreases of the relevant oil/condensate/LPG benchmark on the Company’s loss for 
the year. The analysis is based on the assumption that commodity prices had increased/decreased by 5% with all other variables 
held constant:
 Year ended 31 December
      2009 2008 
      $ $
Brent light crude     70,037 191,850
     70,037 191,850 
The loss for the year would increase/decrease as a result of commodity revenues received. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued

3 Risk Management continued
iii) Interest Rate Risk
The Group had fixed rate long‑term debt and fixed rate convertible bonds in the years under review, therefore, it was not exposed to 
interest rate risk with respect to these fixed rate borrowings. In October 2007, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company received a 
long‑ term loan of $9,450,000 with a variable rate of LIBOR plus 1.6% (note 16). An increase/(decrease) of LIBOR by 1% would result in an 
increase/(decrease) of the Company’s loss for the year by $85,246 (31 December 2008 – $73,375).
iv) Credit Risk
All of the Company’s production from continuing operations was derived from Russia. In 2008 and 2009 sales were to a maximum of 
six customers.
Trade debtors of the Company are subject to internal credit review to minimise the risk of non‑ payment. The Company does not anticipate 
any default as it transacts with creditworthy counterparties. No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting years and management 
does not expect any losses from non‑ performance by these counterparties. 
The Company is also exposed to credit risk in relation to regular joint venture billings which are typically outstanding for one month and in 
relation to its cash balances held with the reputable banks.
v) Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not have sufficient funds to meet liabilities. Cash forecasts identifying liquidity requirements of the 
Group are produced quarterly. These are reviewed regularly to ensure sufficient funds exist to finance the Company’s current operational 
and investment cash flow requirements.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Company’s cash position on the basis of expected cash flow.
The Group had available cash of $208 million at 31 December 2009. Based on its current plans and knowledge, its projected capital 
expenditure and operating cash requirements, the Group has sufficient cash to finance its operations for more than 12 months from the 
date of this report. 
The Company’s financial liabilities consist of trade and other payables and borrowings. Trade and other payables are due within 12 months, 
and borrowings fall due as outlined in notes 15 and 16.
b) Capital Risk Management
The Company’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to 
provide returns for shareholders, benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. 
The Company monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is 
calculated as total borrowings (including “borrowings”, “trade and other payables”, “liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale” 
and “provisions” as shown in the consolidated balance sheet) less cash and cash equivalents. Total capital is calculated as “equity” as 
shown in the consolidated balance sheet plus net debt.
 As at 31 December
      2009 2008 
      $ $
Total borrowings     166,361,474 211,676,976
Less cash and cash equivalents (note 14)     (208,094,355) (90,620,385)

Total equity     389,662,669 189,620,544
Total capital     389,662,669 310,677, 135
Gearing ratio     0% 39%
This decrease in the gearing ratio during 2009 resulted primarily from an equity financing raised in 2009 (note 18).
4 Critical Accounting Estimates, Assumptions and Judgements
In the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies, which are described in note 2, management makes estimates and 
assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The 
estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
within the next financial year are discussed below:
a) Recoverability of Exploration and Evaluation Costs
Under the modified full cost method of accounting for E&E costs, certain costs are capitalised as intangible assets by reference to 
appropriate cost pools, and are assessed for impairment when circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may exceed its 
recoverable value. Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Overview
85
Heritage Oil Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009
4 Critical Accounting Estimates, Assumptions and Judgements continued
Such circumstances include, but are not limited to:
i)  the period for which the entity has the right to explore in the specific area has expired during the period, or will expire in the near future, 
and is not expected to be renewed;
ii)  substantive expenditure on further exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in the specific area is neither budgeted 
nor planned;
iii)  exploration for, and evaluation, of mineral resources in the specific area have not led to the discovery of commercially viable quantities 
of mineral resources and the entity has decided to discontinue such activities in the specific area; and
iv)  sufficient data exist to indicate that, although a development in the specific area is likely to proceed, the carrying amount of the 
exploration and evaluation asset is unlikely to be recovered in full from successful development or by sale.
This assessment involves judgement as to (i) the likely future commerciality of the asset and when such commerciality should be 
determined, and (ii) future revenues and costs pertaining to any wider cost pool with which the asset in question is associated, and (iii) the 
discount rate to be applied to such revenues and costs for the purpose of deriving a recoverable value. Note 10 discloses the carrying 
amounts of the Group’s E&E assets. Consequently, major uncertainties affect the recoverability of these costs which is dependent on the 
Group achieving commercial production or the sale of the assets. Note 23 discloses contingencies relating to title risks. The Company 
assessed whether these risks are contingencies or indicators of impairment and concluded that they are contingencies.
b) Reserve Estimates
Estimates of recoverable quantities of proved and probable reserves include assumptions regarding commodity prices, exchange rates, 
discount rates, production and transportation costs for future cash flows. It also requires interpretation of complex and difficult geological 
and geophysical models in order to make an assessment of the size, shape, depth, and quality of reservoirs and their anticipated 
recoveries. The economic, geological and technical factors used to estimate reserves may change from period to period. Changes in 
reported reserves can impact asset carrying values and the asset retirement obligation due to changes in expected future cash flows. 
Reserves are integral to the amount of depletion charged to the income statement and the calculation of inventory.
The level of estimated commercial reserves is also a key determinant in assessing whether the carrying value of any of the Group’s 
development and production assets has been impaired.
c) Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of the fair value of financial instruments. Fair values have been 
determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes based on the following methods:
i) Non-Derivative Financial Instruments
These comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings 
and trade and other payables. Non-derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value plus, for instruments not at fair value 
through the income statement, any directly attributable transaction costs.
Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the applicable market rate of 
interest at the reporting date.
ii) Derivatives
Derivatives are recognised initially at fair value; attributable transaction costs are recognised in the income statement when incurred. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value. Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and 
accounted for separately if the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract and the embedded derivative are not closely related, 
a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative, and the combined 
instrument is not measured at fair value through the income statement.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is based on their listed market prices, if available. If a listed market price is not available, 
then fair value is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the 
residual maturity of the contract using a risk-free interest rate (based on Government bonds).
5 Segment Information
The Group has a single class of business which is international exploration, development and production of petroleum oil and natural gas. 
The geographical areas are defined by the Company as operating segments in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments. The Group 
operates in a number of geographical areas based on location of operations and assets, being Russia, Uganda (discontinued), DRC, 
Kurdistan, Pakistan, Tanzania, Malta, Mali and Oman (discontinued). The Group’s reporting segments comprise each separate 
geographical area in which it operates. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued

6 Discontinued Operations
Uganda
On 18 December 2009, Heritage announced that the Company, and its subsidiary Heritage Oil & Gas Limited, had entered into a SPA, with 
Eni for the sale of its 50% interests in Blocks 1 and 3A in Uganda. On 17 January 2010, Tullow Uganda Limited exercised its right to 
pre-empt the sale of the Disposed Assets to Eni on the same terms and conditions as agreed in the SPA entered into between Heritage and 
Eni. The transaction was overwhelmingly approved by shareholders at the General Meeting on 25 January 2010.
In April 2010, Heritage announced that it had received a letter from the Ugandan Government stating that it supports Heritage’s sale and 
transfer of its Ugandan interests and that it will conclude its review of the transaction within eight weeks. Following this, Heritage expects to 
receive formal consent and to close the transaction shortly thereafter.
The results of the Uganda operations have been classified as discontinued operations. The segment was not classified as held for sale or 
discontinued operations at 31 December 2008 and the comparative income statement has been restated to show the discontinued 
operations separately from continuing operations. Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Overview

Oman
On 7 April 2009, the Company completed the sale of Eagle Energy, a wholly owned subsidiary of Heritage, to RAK Petroleum Oman 
Limited for $28 million, plus a working capital adjustment of $0.4 million. Eagle Energy held a 10% interest in Block 8, Oman. The segment 
was not classified as held for sale or discontinued operations at 31 December 2008 and the comparative income statement has been 
restated to show the discontinued operations separately from continuing operations.
The effective date of the transaction is 1 January 2009. The cash consideration of $28 million and a working capital adjustment of 
$0.4 million have been received. The Company acquired Eagle Energy, which had a 10% interest in Block 8 offshore Oman, in 1996. 
Block 8 contains the Bukha field which has been producing since 1994 and the West Bukha field which commenced production in 
February 2009.

8 Income Tax Expense
The Group is subject to income taxes in certain territories in which it owns licences. All of the Group’s operating activities are outside of 
Jersey. In Oman, the tax rate applicable to the Group’s operations is considered to be nil as in this jurisdiction the Group is subject to a 
production sharing agreement.
The Group has available tax deductions of $23,856,528 (31 December 2008 – $31,438,808) and tax losses of $125,768,090 
(31 December 2008 – $93,531,776), of which $80,639,778 expires from 2010 to 2029, and the remaining $45,128,312 (31 December 2008 
– $42,615,907) does not have an expiry period. No deferred tax assets have been recognised for the benefit of tax deductions and 
tax losses because realisation of the deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future is not sufficiently likely. Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Overview

Exercise of Third Party Back‑ in Rights
In April 2009, in accordance with the option outlined in the PSC in Kurdistan, the KRG nominated a third party participant in the Miran 
Block. The Company remains the operator with a 75% working interest in the Miran Block and has received the pro-rata share of 25% of  
all past work programme expenditures and the third party will be responsible for paying its share of future costs. The transaction was 
completed upon the receipt of approximately $6.7 million in costs incurred by the Group to 31 January 2009. No gain/loss resulted from 
this transaction and intangible exploration assets reduced by $6.7 million. The KRG and the Group have agreed to replace the agreement 
under which they had agreed in principle (subject to certain conditions which had not been satisfied) to jointly develop a refinery with an 
agreement under which the Group has agreed to make payments of up to $35 million from future oil and gas sales from the licence. Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Overview

The corporate office which represents the land and building category and the corporate jet serve as security for long-term loans (note 16).
The carrying value of the corporate jet was written down to $8,064,350 because of reduction of fair value of the corporate jet due to 
unfavourable economic conditions. This resulted in an impairment write-down of $2,933,374 recognised in the income statement during 
the year ended 31 December 2009. An impairment loss of $749,955 was incurred in 2008, which related to the write-down of a drilling rig.
The carrying value of the petroleum and natural gas interest in Oman was written down to its fair value, resulting in an impairment write-
down of $3,247,078 in 2008 due to a decline in oil and gas prices.

The investment in Afren Plc warrants is classified as held for trading. The investment in unlisted securities represents common shares in a 
private company, SeaDragon, which is classified as available-for-sale. The estimate of the fair value of the warrants is determined using the 
Black-Scholes model and relevant market inputs.
The Company owns 805,832 of the unlisted shares of SeaDragon, approximately 15% of the shares outstanding. At 31 December 2008, 
these shares were carried at a value of $4 per share, which were valued based on the most recent private placement of SeaDragon on 26 
October 2006.
At 30 June 2009, the carrying value of the investments in the shares of SeaDragon was written down to nil following the completion of a 
financial reorganisation by SeaDragon and the Company does not expect that the cost of the investment will be recoverable in the near 
future. This resulted in an impairment write-down of $2,352,825 (2008 – nil). Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued

have a maturity of five years and one day and an annual coupon of 8% payable semi-annually on 17 August and 17 February of each year. 
Bondholders have the right to convert the bonds into Ordinary Shares at a price of $4.70 per share at any time. The number of Ordinary 
Shares receivable on conversion of the bonds is fixed. The Company had the right to redeem, in whole or part, the bonds for cash at any 
time on or before 16 February 2008, at 150% of par value. This right was not exercised. 
The fair value of the host liability component of the bonds (net of issue costs) was estimated at $140,154,215 on 16 February 2007. The 
difference between the $165,000,000 due on maturity and the initial liability component is accreted using the effective interest rate method 
and is recorded as finance costs. As the Company call option meant that conversion feature could be settled in cash in accordance with 
IAS 32 the conversion was treated as a derivative liability. The fair value of this derivative liability (estimated using the Black-Scholes option 
pricing model) was $17,866,517 at 16 February 2007 and subsequent gains and losses have been recorded in finance income and costs 
up to the expiry of the Company call option on 17 February 2008. As a result of the expiry of this option, and hence the cash settlement 
feature, the Company has reassessed the classification of the conversion option and determined that it qualifies to be treated as equity 
under IAS 32, being an option to convert a fixed amount of cash for a fixed number of shares. Therefore, the fair value of the conversion 
option was reclassified to equity at that date.
Bondholders have a put option requiring the Company to redeem the bonds at par, plus accrued interest, in the event of a change of 
control of the Company or revocation or surrender of the Zapadno Chumpasskoye licence in Russia (the “contingent put option”). In the 
event of a change of control and redemption of the bonds or exercise of the conversion rights, a cash payment of up to $19,700 on each 
$100,000 bond will be made to a bondholder, the amount of which depends upon the date of redemption and market value of shares at 
the date of any change of control event. The contingent put option has been valued separately.
The fair value of the contingent put option has been estimated de minimis by the Company at 31 December 2009 (31 December 2008 
– de minimis).
During 2009, bondholders with $30.9 million of bonds gave notices of the exercise of 309 bonds. These bondholders received 6,574,456 
Ordinary Shares (note 18). As a result of this conversion, $28,207,021 was transferred to share capital from convertible bonds and accrued 
liabilities and $5,992,595 was transferred from the equity portion of convertible debt to share capital.
On 18 December 2009, the Company announced it had entered into a SPA for the sale of its 50% interests in Blocks 1 and 3A in Uganda 
(note 6). The Company also announced that it would consider returning a portion of the disposal proceeds to shareholders through a 
special dividend on completion of the proposed transaction. Under the terms and conditions of the bonds, the Company was restricted 
from making or declaring a dividend or making any other distributions to its shareholders which constitutes on a consolidated basis more 
than 30% of its earnings for the immediately preceding financial year.
In December 2009, the Company approached bondholders with the proposal to agree to remove this restriction and to make some other 
changes in the terms and condition of the bonds. In consideration the Company proposed to pay to those bondholders who vote on the 
proposal the sum of $2,000.00 per $100,000 of bonds held by such bondholders. The majority of bondholders voted in favour of this 
proposal at a meeting on 31 December 2009 and the restriction of making or declaring a dividend or making any other distributions to 
shareholders has been removed. On 15 January 2010, the Company paid $2,378,000 to the bondholders who voted. In accordance with 
IAS 39, this amendment to the terms and conditions of the bonds does not constitute a redemption and therefore this amount was offset 
against the convertible bonds liability and will be recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective 
interest method. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued

16 Borrowings continued
Long-Term Debt
In January 2005, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company received a sterling denominated loan of £4.5 million to refinance the 
acquisition of a corporate office. Interest on the loan was fixed at 6.515% for the first five years and is then variable at a rate of Bank of 
Scotland base rate plus 1.4%. The loan, which is secured on the property, is scheduled to be repaid by 240 instalments of capital and 
interest at monthly intervals, subject to a residual debt at the end of the term of the loan of $3.5 million (£1,860,000). The principal balance 
outstanding as at 31 December 2009 was $6,573,584 (£4.1million) (31 December 2008 – $6,155,882 (£4.2 million)).
In October 2007, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company received a loan of $9,450,000 to refinance the acquisition of the corporate jet. 
Interest on the loan is variable at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.6% The loan, which is secured on the corporate jet, is scheduled to be repaid by 
19 consecutive quarterly instalments of principal. Each instalment equals to $117,500 with the final instalment being $7,217,500. The 
Corporation provided a corporate guarantee to the lender. The additional security of $2,454,000 was paid to the bank on 19 January 2010 
to maintain the loan to value ratio specified in the loan agreement.
Fair Values
At 31 December 2009, the fair values of borrowings are approximately $115.3 million (31 December 2008 – $141.3 million) for the 
convertible bonds, $89.2 million (31 December 2008 – $25.8 million) for the equity/convertible element of the convertible bonds and 
$14.9 million (31 December 2008 – $14.9 million) for the long-term debt.
17 Provisions
The Group’s asset retirement obligation results from net ownership interests in petroleum and natural gas assets including well sites and 
gathering systems. The Group estimates the total undiscounted inflation-adjusted amount of cash flows required to settle its asset 
retirement obligation to be approximately $1,331,359, which is expected to be incurred in the period between 2012 and 2024. A cost pool 
specific discount rate, related to the liability, of 9% was used to calculate the fair value of the asset retirement obligation in Uganda and 
Russia (2008 – 9%) and 10% was used in Kurdistan in 2008 (2008 – 10%).

18 Share Capital
The Company was incorporated under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 (as amended) on 6 February 2008. The Company’s authorised 
share capital is an unlimited number of Ordinary Shares without par value. At incorporation, there was one Ordinary Share issued at $42. 
On 22 February 2008, a second Ordinary Share was issued at $41.
As part of the Reorganisation described in 2008 Annual Report, the Corporation split its stock such that each existing Common Share of 
the Corporation was exchanged for either ten Ordinary Shares or ten Exchangeable Shares. The Corporation was a US dollar functional 
currency entity as is the Company and therefore the balance of Share Capital was carried forward at its historical amount into the financial 
statements of the Company. The rights of different classes of shares are the same and therefore economically equivalent. As such, 
Ordinary and Exchangeable Shares were treated as one class of shares for loss per share calculation.
Information about movements in share capital issued before the Reorganisation is presented in the table overleaf on the after split basis, 
i.e. taking into account, the one for ten split. Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Overview

19 Reserves
A) Available‑ For‑ Sale Investments Revaluation Reserve
Changes in the fair value and exchange differences arising on translation of available-for-sale investments such as equities, classified as 
available-for-sale financial assets, are taken to the available-for-sale investments revaluation reserve (note 2k). Amounts are recognised in 
the income statement when the associated assets are sold or impaired.
B) Foreign Currency Translation Reserve
Exchange differences arising on translation of a foreign controlled entity are included in the foreign currency translation reserve (note 2s). 
The reserve will be recognised in the income statement when the net investment is disposed.
C) Share‑Based Payments Reserve
The share-based payments reserve (note 2t), is used to recognise the fair value of options and LTIP awards issued, but not exercised, 
to employees.
D) Equity Portion of Convertible Debt
The fair value of the conversion feature of the convertible bonds is classified as equity portion of convertible debt (note 2b(iii)) which is 
included in the reserves in the balance sheet. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued

20 Loss Per Share
The following table summarises the weighted average Ordinary and Exchangeable Shares used in calculating net earnings per share:
 Year ended 31 December
      2009 2008
Weighted average Ordinary and Exchangeable Shares
Basic     273,117,649 254,969,021
Diluted     289,643,434 256,257 ,622
The weighted average number of shares has been adjusted to reflect the effective one for 10 share split that took place as part of the 
corporate reorganisation described in note 18. The reconciling item between basic and diluted weighted average number of Ordinary 
Shares is the dilutive effect of share options and LTIP awards. A total of nil options (31 December 2008 – 22,232,010), nil shares relating to 
the LTIP (31 December 2008 – 4,926,429) and 27,042,553 of shares relating to the convertible bonds (31 December 2008 – 33,617,020) 
were excluded from the above calculation, as they were anti-dilutive. However, since the Company has made a loss in each year for the 
purposes of calculating diluted loss per share, all potential Ordinary Shares have been treated as anti-dilutive.

Share Options
The Company had a share option plan whereby certain directors, officers, employees and consultants of the Group have been granted 
options to purchase Ordinary Shares. Under the terms of the plan, options granted normally vest one third immediately and one third in 
each of the years following the date granted and have a life of five years.

Long Term Incentive Plan
On 19 June 2008, shareholders at the AGM of the Company approved the 2008 LTIP. Under the terms of the plan, the LTIP awards will be 
in the form of full-value shares (Performance Shares), subject to performance and time-vesting conditions. Eligible employees will normally 
be considered by the Remuneration Committee for an award once each year. Awards made to the Executive Directors of the Company 
under the LTIP are called First Awards. Participants in the First Award, however, will not be entitled to any further awards until the 2011 
financial year. Awards will normally be made during the period of 42 days following the announcement of year end or half-year financial 
results. Exceptionally, the First Awards under the plan on 19 June 2008, were permitted to be made within 42 days following approval of 
the LTIP at the June 2008 AGM.
The plan is intended to apply to Executive Directors and other employees in senior management or leadership roles. By exception, other 
higher performing and high potential employees may be considered for awards. Participants in the LTIP will not be entitled to any further 
awards under the 2008 Scheme.
The vesting of shares under award are subject to performance conditions agreed by the Remuneration Committee when the award is 
made. For the First Awards made in 2008 the performance conditions are the relative TSR (capital gain plus dividends) performance of 
the Company versus that of a comparator group of international oil companies and a requirement for the share price of the Company to 
have increased by 20% over the vesting period of three years. Furthermore is an additional holding period of one year following the 
awards vesting. Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Overview

Heritage Oil Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009
21 Share‑Based Payments continued
The Remuneration Committee, in consultation with executive reward consultants, approved grants of shares to Executive Directors, senior 
management and other employees in leadership roles under the LTIP. The maximum annual, individual award for participants who are not 
Executive Directors is 250% of base package (expressed as the “face value” of the shares). The First Award to Executive Directors is 
1,200% of base package for the CEO and 800% of base package for the CFO.
The First Awards vest after three years provided that the performance conditions are met. The awards granted to senior management and 
other employees in leadership roles are in three tranches that vest after three, four and five years respectively, provided that the 
performance condition is met at that time.
The awards will vest in line with the following schedule:
       Senior management 
       and other employees 
       in leadership 
      First Awards role awards

7th place and below    0% 100%
9th place (median)    0% 100%
10th place and below     0% 0%
TSR is measured in comparison to a peer group of 18 oil companies selected based on one of or a combination of size (market 
capitalisation, revenue, turnover, cash expenditure or a combination thereof), area of operations and country of domicile. The TSR 
measurement is conducted by independent consultants in discussion with the Remuneration Committee.
Since there are market-related conditions the awards of the shares under LTIP were fair valued using the Monte Carlo model which takes 
into account the market-based performance conditions which effectively estimate the number of shares expected to vest. No subsequent 
adjustment is made to the fair value charge for shares that do not vest in the event that these performance conditions are not met. 
Adjustments are, however, made for leavers. The fair value of the awards is recognised as an employee expense with the corresponding 
increase in equity. The total amount to be expensed is spread over the vesting period during which the employees become unconditionally 
entitled to the shares and options.
The table below summarises the main assumptions used to fair value the awards made under the above LTIP and the fair values of the 
shares granted.

2009 was $5,269,508 out of which $2,062,661 was capitalised.

2  In April 2009, in accordance with the option outlined in the PSC in Kurdistan, the KRG nominated a third party participant in the Miran Block. The Company remains the operator 
with a 75% working interest in the Miran Block and has received the pro-rata share of 25% of all past work programme expenditures and the third party will be responsible for 
paying its share of future costs. The KRG and the Group have agreed to replace the agreement under which they had agreed in principle (subject to certain conditions which 
had not been satisfied) to jointly develop a refinery with an agreement under which the Group has agreed to make payments of up to $35 million from future oil and gas sales 
from the licence.
The Company may have a potential residual obligation to satisfy any shortfall in officers’ and former officers’ secured real estate borrowings 
in the event of default, a shortfall on the proceeds from the disposal of the properties and the individuals being unable to repay the balance. 
The value of the residual obligation was estimated as insignificant.
In many of the countries in which the Group operates, land title systems are not developed to the extent found in many industrial countries 
and there may be no concept of registered title. Although the Group believes that it has title to its oil and gas properties, it cannot control or 
completely protect itself against the risk of title disputes or challenges. There can be no assurance that claims or challenges by third parties 
against the Group’s properties will not be asserted at a future date. 
The Group received a letter from the Iraq Ministry of Oil dated 17 December 2007 stating that the PSC signed with the KRG without the 
prior approval of the Iraqi Government is considered to be void by the Iraqi Government as they have stated it violates the “prevailing Iraqi 
law”. The Directors believe that the PSC is valid and effective pursuant to the applicable laws. 
In addition, the DRC work programme pursuant to the PSC cannot be commenced prior to the grant of a Presidential Decree from the 
DRC Government. There can be no assurance that final approval or ratification will ever be received in respect of the PSC or that the 
pre-agreed fiscal terms will not be re-negotiated at a later date by the DRC Government. The Directors are confident that the title will 
be confirmed.
Furthermore, the Group received a letter from the chairman of the Management Committee of the National Oil Company of Libya dated 
28 February 2008 stating that the Block 7 licence area in Malta lies within the Libyan continental shelf and a portion of this area has already 
been licenced to Sirte Oil Company. This letter also demands that the Group refrain from any activities over, or concerning, the Block 7 
licence area and asserts the Libyan Government’s right to invoke Libyan and international law to protect its rights in the Block 7 licence 
area. The Directors believe that the Libyan Government’s claims are unfounded.

25 Subsequent Events
On 18 December 2009, Heritage announced that the Company, and its subsidiary Heritage Oil & Gas Limited, had entered into a SPA, with 
Eni for the sale of its 50% interests in Blocks 1 and 3A in Uganda. On 17 January 2010, Tullow Uganda Limited exercised its right to 
pre-empt the sale of the Disposed Assets to Eni on the same terms and conditions as agreed in the SPA entered into between Heritage 
and Eni. The transaction was overwhelmingly approved by shareholders at the General Meeting on 25 January 2010.
In April 2010, Heritage announced that it had received a letter from the Ugandan Government stating that it supports Heritage’s sale and 
transfer of its Ugandan interests and that it will conclude its review of the transaction within eight weeks. Following this, Heritage expects to 
receive formal consent and to close the transaction shortly thereafter. Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Overview

”
Our ﬁnancial performance this year is much improved with the Company reaching 
proﬁtability in the second half of the year, resulting from an outstanding 53% revenue 
growth. Our cash position has also strengthened and margins have been 
substantially improved.
“
Chairman’s statement
Geoff McMillan
I am pleased to present the results for the past ﬁnancial year, a year 
of signiﬁcant achievements for Maelor. Under the leadership of our 
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, Tim Wright, the new management team has 
worked to transform the Company into a proﬁtable business with 
a focus on late stage specialist hospital medicines.
In my statement in the 2005–06 annual report I noted that for 
Maelor to accelerate its growth we needed to succeed in marketing 
core products in our own right and in partnering non-core products. 
In the year ended March 2007 we achieved both of these objectives 
with a threefold increase in sales of Volplex and the exploitation 
of our micelle technology in partnership with Plethora Solutions 
Holdings plc (Plethora). In addition, we have further expanded 
our portfolio of critical care products with the addition of AquiHex 
and ISOplex.
Our ﬁnancial performance this year is much improved with the 
Company reaching break-even in the second half of the year, resulting 
from an outstanding 53% revenue growth. Our cash position has 
also strengthened and margins have been substantially improved.
Acquisition
Since the year end, we have delivered a transforming, earnings 
enhancing acquisition, which has made us proﬁtable and built a strong 
platform for growth. Acorus is a successful specialist pharmaceuticals 
and medical devices company, which we acquired for a total 
consideration of £13.0m. The initial cash consideration was satisﬁed 
by the issue to institutional investors of 80,000,000 new ordinary 
shares of 10p each, which raised £8.0m and was oversubscribed.
Acorus is signiﬁcantly proﬁtable and growing with a portfolio 
of assets primarily focused in critical care and neurology. It was 
established in 2000 and has been built as a virtual company; thus 
ensuring the speed and success of our integration process to date.
_1_MAE_front.indd   4 03/08/2007   09:59:54  Maelor plc annual report and ﬁnancial statements 2007 05
Outlook
Trading since the period end is in line with expectations 
and the integration of Acorus is on schedule.
The existing business is now performing well. The acquisition of Acorus, 
with its portfolio of marketed products, will make us signiﬁcantly 
proﬁtable creating a strong platform upon which to grow the business 
both organically and through further acquisitions. The Board would 
like to thank the Maelor team for its efforts and achievements during 
the year and it looks to the future with conﬁdence.

Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s review
Tim Wright
This year has been transformational for Maelor. In line with our new strategy 
developed in 2005/6 we have focused the Company on late stage and launched 
products, managed the business to proﬁtability in the second half of the year and 
completed the acquisition of Acorus, thereby creating a substantial specialist hospital 
medicines business which is proﬁtable and cash generative.
”
“
In my report last year we outlined our strategy to transform 
Maelor into a specialist hospital medicines business, focused 
initially in critical care. We identiﬁed the importance of focusing 
on late stage products, thereby reducing the risk and expense 
of early stage development as well as leveraging our non-critical 
care portfolio through efﬁcient partnerships.
I am pleased to report that the implementation of this plan is 
progressing well and has been signiﬁcantly accelerated following 
the recently announced, transforming acquisition of Acorus, 
creating a strong and proﬁtable enlarged Company.
Separating out the recent acquisition of Acorus, which was completed 
after the year end, I am also pleased to report that the underlying 
Maelor business has performed well over the year and in particular 
has delivered a strong and proﬁtable second half.
Building a specialist hospital medicines business
A signiﬁcant contributor to this performance has been the successful 
re-acquisition and re-launch of Volplex, a product Maelor originally 
developed and licensed. Used in operating theatres and wards to 
maintain blood volume, Volplex competes primarily with one other 
long established product.
We have succeeded in trebling sales of Volplex since March 2006 
and Moving Annual Total (MAT) market share has grown from 12% 
to 20%. We have recruited an experienced Commercial Manager 
and with substantial room for further market share growth, the 
management team is conﬁdent that Maelor can continue to win 
new customers and further grow sales of Volplex.
During the year we announced the late stage development of ISOplex 
and AquiHex, both products which will be used in critical care settings. 
ISOplex, in common with Volplex will be used in situations where an 
increase in blood volume is required. ISOplex has been designed to 
mimic natural blood plasma, particularly in the balance of electrolytes. 
The use of these ‘isotonic’ formulations is an area of signiﬁcant interest 
amongst critical care clinicians. Given our experience and existing data 
in this sector it is anticipated that development will be relatively rapid 
and inexpensive for a pharmaceutical product. Development has 
continued to progress on schedule and regulatory approval remains 
to be forecast for the end of 2008.
AquiHex is a 2% aqueous formulation of chlorhexidine, an antibacterial 
product commonly used prior to surgical incision or insertion of 
intravenous (IV) lines. To date all products of this type are alcohol based 
and therefore present problems in settings where ﬂammability is of concern, 
such as in operating theatres. Use of alcohol based products is also 
not recommended when using certain IV lines as it can make them 
brittle. AquiHex is being supplied as a ‘special’ ahead of registration, 
which is currently forecast for late 2009.
_1_MAE_front.indd   6 03/08/2007   10:00:40  Maelor plc annual report and ﬁnancial statements 2007 07
In the middle of the year we succeeded in gaining approval to supply 
unlicensed medicines. Generally known as ‘specials’ these products 
can be requested by physicians for use in patients where there is a 
speciﬁc requirement which is presently unmet by any medicine licensed 
in the UK. In addition to establishing closer relationships with the 
critical care community this strategy will enable Maelor to gauge demand 
for products and where this demand is sufﬁcient, progress these products 
to licence in the UK. We have recently gained distribution rights to a 
selection of ﬂuid and volume replacement products from Germany 
which we also make available as part of this service.
Leverage non-critical care portfolio through 
efﬁcient partnerships
We will continue to select strong partners to commercialise the 
heritage portfolio of products and technologies that do not ﬁt directly 
with the Company’s hospital specialist strategy, in particular our 
catheter ﬂushing solutions OptiFlo and ContiSol and our proprietary 
early stage micelle nanotechnology.
OptiFlo, the UK brand of catheter ﬂushing solutions distributed by 
Bard Limited, continues to perform well, with sales up 6% versus 
2005/6, and remains the UK market leader with a market share 
of 54%.

Leverage non-critical care portfolio through 
efﬁcient partnerships continued
Included in the ﬁrst half of the year is an initial payment following 
the licensing of our proprietary micelle nanotechnology, micelle 
lidocaine. The partnership with Plethora, a specialist urology company, 
is progressing well and the product has successfully passed through the 
ﬁrst stage of its pre-clinical development programme. Under the terms 
of the agreement Plethora is responsible for product development and 
distribution and Maelor is entitled to milestone and royalty payments. 
The micelle lidocaine technology will be incorporated into Plethora’s 
ongoing product development programme for the treatment of 
interstitial cystitis and painful bladder syndrome. These distressing 
conditions are estimated to afﬂict up to two million women in 
the United States and Europe.
Financial summary
Financial results for the year ended 31 March 2007 have been 
delivered ahead of expectations.
Turnover for the year to 31 March 2007 was £2.84m (2006: £1.86m), 
an increase of 53% over prior year. This signiﬁcant increase can be 
attributed to the management team’s continued focus on growing 
Volplex, the sales growth of OptiFlo as well as an initial payment 
received for our micelle lidocaine nanotechnology.
Gross margins increased from last year by almost 8% to 48% 
as a result of further efﬁciencies in manufacturing and supply.
The Group’s operating loss for the year reduced signiﬁcantly to £0.07m 
from £0.61m in 2006, including the achievement of a £0.02m 
operating proﬁt in the second half of the year. The improvement was 
driven by the sales growth, the initial licensing payment and careful 
cost control.
Group cash balances, net of debt, at 31 March 2007 were £1.43m 
compared with £1.10m last year. At the end of the year we sold 
our ofﬁce building and relocated to a modern leasehold property on 
Chester Business Park. Proceeds from the sale of the building enabled 
the bank mortgage to be cleared leaving the Company debt free at 
the year end. Since the year end we have negotiated a £2.0m bank 
facility for further business expansion.
Acquisition of Acorus Therapeutics Limited
In line with the Company’s strategy, we successfully completed 
a deal post year end to acquire privately owned Acorus for a total 
consideration of approximately £13.0m, comprising £7.0m in cash, 
10,000,000 ordinary shares at 10p each and loan notes of £4.9m, 
contingent on achievement of certain sales milestones.
The deal was funded by an oversubscribed placing of 80,000,000 
10p ordinary shares issued at 10p each and was completed on 
10 May 2007. It is a transforming move for Maelor, with the enlarged 
Group becoming proﬁtable and cash generative.
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s review continued
Trading since the period end is in line with expectations and the integration of Acorus is, 
as anticipated, proceeding smoothly. The enlarged business provides us with a platform 
for further growth both organically and through further acquisitions.
”
“
_1_MAE_front.indd   8 03/08/2007   10:00:42  Maelor plc annual report and ﬁnancial statements 2007 09
Acorus is a particularly synergistic acquisition. The product range 
is complementary to Maelor’s with the same customers, distribution 
channels and regulatory systems and processes. The integration 
process is progressing well and on schedule.
Outlook
Our vision remains to build a new force in specialist hospital medicine, 
leveraging our expertise in both pharmaceuticals and medical devices. 
We have re-focused the business, taken it to proﬁtability in the second 
half and in Acorus made a synergistic, transformational acquisition. 
With a strong team in place, Maelor is well positioned to drive 
growth organically and through acquisition.

Principal risks and uncertainties
These are outlined in the corporate governance section on page 16.
Key performance indicators
All of the Company’s key performance indicators (KPIs) showed an improvement on last year. Turnover was up 53% on the prior year to £2.84m 
(2006: £1.86m) and operating loss was down to £0.07m (2006: £0.61m). The cash balance, net of debt, increased to £1.43m (2006: £1.10m) 
and gross margin improved to 48% (2006: 40%).
Events since the end of the year
On 8 May 2007 the Company awarded options to selected Directors and employees over 9,375,063 10p ordinary shares at an exercise price 
of 10p per share, in accordance with the Maelor plc 2007 Enterprise Management Incentive (EMI) and Unapproved Share Option Plan.
On 10 May 2007 the Company completed the acquisition of the entire issued share capital of privately owned Acorus Therapeutics Limited. 
The acquisition price was satisﬁed by a cash payment of £7.0m, the issue of 10,000,000 Company shares at a price of 10p per share and 
the issue to the vendors of £4.9m unsecured, subordinated loan notes, contingent on Acorus achieving certain sales targets. The initial cash 
consideration was funded through the placing of 80,000,000 new 10p ordinary shares in the Company, issued at 10p per share. 
Auditor
The Directors, having been notiﬁed of the cessation of the partnership known as Baker Tilly, resolved that Baker Tilly UK Audit LLP be 
appointed as successor auditor with effect from 1 April 2007, in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1989, Section 26(5). 
Baker Tilly UK Audit LLP has indicated its willingness to continue in ofﬁce. A resolution for its re-appointment is to be proposed at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Statement as to disclosure of information to auditor
The Directors who were in ofﬁce on the date of approval of these ﬁnancial statements have conﬁrmed, as far as they are aware, that there 
is no relevant audit information of which the auditor is unaware. Each of the Directors has conﬁrmed that they have taken all the steps 
that they ought to have taken as Directors in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that it 
has been communicated to the auditor.

Compliance with the Combined Code
The rules of the Alternative Investment Market (AiM) do not compel the Company to comply with the Combined Code (the Code). 
Nevertheless, the Company fully endorses both the spirit and principles of the Code and seeks to comply wherever possible, whilst taking 
account of both its own size and its resources. Precisely how the Company has applied these principles is set out in the following statement.
Board of Directors
The Board meets at regular intervals, normally no less than nine times a year. The Company is committed to maintaining a balance  
of Executive and Non-executive Directors and the Board consists of six members, three are Executive Directors, the remaining three, 
one of whom is Chairman, are Independent Non-executive Directors. The Board believes that, given its size and complexity, it is not 
appropriate to specify a Senior Independent Director.
All Non-executive Directors are members of the Audit, AiM Compliance and Remuneration Committees. Their biographies on page 10 
illustrate their relevant corporate and industry experience.
Given the Company’s limited resources and manpower, there is no separate Nominations Committee. However, any new appointments 
at Board level are considered and approved by the full Board. A detailed introduction to the activities of the Company is given to any new 
appointee who is also provided with any appropriate training deemed necessary. The Company Secretary, to whom all Directors have full 
access, attends all Board and Committee meetings.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee, chaired by J H Gregory, who took over from P Murray on 4 May 2007, meets at least twice a year. The Finance Director 
is generally in attendance at those meetings and also acts as secretary to the Committee. An invitation is extended to the auditor to attend 
meetings of the Committee in order to discuss related matters. On a formal basis, the Committee reviews with the auditor those reports 
to be issued by the auditor to the Directors.
The Audit Committee also undertakes a formal assessment of the auditor’s independence each year which includes:
 a review of the non-audit services provided to the Group and related fees;
  discussion with the auditor of a written report detailing all relationships with the Company and any other parties that could affect 
independence or the perception of independence;
  a review of the auditor’s own procedures for ensuring the independence of the audit ﬁrm and partners and staff involved in the audit, 
including the regular rotation of the audit partner; and
 obtaining written conﬁrmation from the auditor that, in its professional judgement, it is independent.
An analysis of the fees payable to the external audit ﬁrm in respect of both audit and non-audit services during the year is set out in Note 3 
to the ﬁnancial statements.
corporate governance
_MAE_back.indd   4 03/08/2007   09:59:30  Maelor plc annual report and ﬁnancial statements 2007 15
AiM Compliance Committee
The Company has an obligation to comply with the London Stock Exchange Rules for Companies. Rule 31 requires Maelor to:
 have in place sufﬁcient procedures, resources and controls to enable its compliance with the AiM Rules for Companies (rules);
 seek advice from its nominated adviser regarding its compliance with these rules whenever appropriate and take that advice into account;
  provide its nominated adviser with any information it requests in order for that nominated adviser to carry out its responsibilities under 
these rules and the AiM Rules for Nominated Advisers;
 ensure that each of its Directors accepts full responsibility, collectively and individually, for its compliance with these rules; and
  ensure that each Director discloses without delay all information which it needs in order to comply with rule 17 insofar as that information 
is known to the Director or could with reasonable diligence be ascertained by the Director.
In order to ensure that these obligations are being discharged, the Board has established a committee of the Board (the AiM Compliance 
Committee), chaired by H G McMillan, the Non-executive Chairman of the Company.
Having reviewed relevant Board papers and met with the Company’s Executive Board and the nominated adviser to ensure that such is the 
case, the AiM Compliance Committee is satisﬁed that the Company’s obligations under AiM rule 31 have been satisﬁed during the period 
under review.
Internal control
At the present time, given the aforementioned limitations imposed by manpower and resources, there is no internal audit function. The Board 
is responsible for the Company’s system of internal control, which is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives; it can therefore only provide a reasonable and not an absolute assurance against material misstatements or losses.
Proper brieﬁng of all Directors at Board meetings is considered an important issue, and all Board papers are distributed in advance of those 
meetings; meetings are either adjourned or decisions deferred on occasions when the Board seeks the provision of further information upon 
which to base its decisions. There also exists a formal schedule of matters speciﬁcally reserved for decisions by the Board.
During the year the Directors have reviewed and are satisﬁed with the adequacy of the Group’s internal ﬁnancial controls. These controls 
include the following:
 a comprehensive annual budgetary process, reviewed and approved by the Board; and
  the monitoring of actual results against budget, no greater than at monthly intervals, together with the revisiting of forecasts whenever 
it is deemed appropriate.
Using the guidance on internal controls contained in the Combined Code as a benchmark, the Group continues to develop its review 
procedures of all other aspects of internal control, including operational and compliance issues and risk management.

Principal risks and uncertainties
Maelor’s business is inﬂuenced by a range of factors, some of which may be beyond the control of the Group and its Board. The risk factors 
set out below are regularly reviewed by the Board in the course of operating its business and are considered carefully. 
There may be other risks which the Group is not aware of, which are not deemed to be material but turn out to be material.
  Adverse information about one or more of Maelor’s products is received by the Group’s customer base, with a negative impact 
on demand for its products.
In the event of the Group becoming aware of any information relating to severe unexpected effects of any of Maelor’s products, it would 
immediately take steps to fully investigate these. In accordance with the responsibilities placed upon the Group by the Medicines and Healthcare 
products Regulatory Agency, Maelor would immediately notify its customers and/or withdraw those products from sale, as appropriate. Where 
these were proven to be false or ill-founded, Maelor would consider issuing information to its customers communicating the facts to them. 
 Maelor experiences a signiﬁcant increase in the cost of producing its product.
In the event of a signiﬁcant increase in the cost of producing one or more of its products Maelor would seek alternative sources of supply 
at the earliest opportunity to mitigate the impact on its proﬁtability.
 The Group is unable to fulﬁl its commitments to supply its products, with adverse consequences for its customers.
Maelor has obligations under some of its key contracts to guarantee the supply of its products. The Group safeguards its ability to meet these 
obligations, by closely managing its relationships with its suppliers, as well as continuously reviewing its stock levels to ensure that these are 
adequate, while at the same time properly controlled.
 A product liability or similar lawsuit is issued against Maelor, resulting in substantial ﬁnancial penalties.
Maelor is conﬁdent that the robustness of the clinical trials process prior to the launch of its products minimises the risk of claims against 
the Group as a result of its products. The Group also continuously reviews the production quality of its products, to ensure that this is consistently 
high. Were a claim to be lodged against the Group in respect of its products, Maelor believes that its product liability insurance would 
indemnify it in the majority of cases. 
Communication with shareholders
The Board has a strong commitment to the maintenance of good investor relations and seeks, wherever possible, to build a relationship 
of mutual understanding with both its institutional and private investors.
Corporate social responsibility
Maelor takes its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) seriously and continues to recycle as much of its waste as possible.
Going concern
The Board believes that Maelor has sufﬁcient working capital to see the Company through to proﬁt. The Board will continue to monitor the 
progress of the acquisition, development and launch of new products and the ﬁnancial position in order to ensure that the Group continues 
to have sufﬁcient funding to continue in business. For this reason, the Board continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
ﬁnancial statements. 
corporate governance continued
_MAE_back.indd   6 03/08/2007   09:59:31  Maelor plc annual report and ﬁnancial statements 2007 17
As well as complying as far as possible with the provisions of the Combined Code as disclosed in the Company’s corporate governance 
statement, the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to Directors’ remuneration as described below.
The level and composition of Directors’ remuneration
The Board believes that it does not pay more than is necessary to attract and retain Directors needed to run the Company successfully.
Statement of remuneration policy
The Remuneration Committee, consisting of the three Non-executive Directors and chaired by P Murray, who took over from J H Gregory on 
4 May 2007, meets at least once a year (or more frequently as required). The Committee is responsible for the remuneration of the Executive Directors, 
including their beneﬁts in kind, terms of employment and share options; the Executive Directors also consult the Committee in relation to the 
remuneration of senior employees and staff share option schemes. It takes account of remuneration paid to the Directors and senior employees 
of other companies of a similar size and comparable industry sector in the UK, and the relative performance of such companies, to ensure that 
the remuneration packages offered are competitive and designed to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and senior employees. 
The remuneration of the Non-executive Directors is determined by the Board as a whole, based on outside advice and review of current 
practices in other companies. The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and Company Secretary (who also acts as secretary to the Committee) are both 
normally in attendance, except when their own remuneration is under discussion.
Full details of the remuneration packages of individual Directors and information on share options, pensions and other beneﬁts 
are set out below.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that law the Directors have elected to 
prepare the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable law). The ﬁnancial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company 
and the Group and of the proﬁt or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those ﬁnancial statements, the Directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
  state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the ﬁnancial statements; and
  prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue 
in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position 
of the Company and to enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities. The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and ﬁnancial information included on the 
Company’s website, www.maelor.plc.uk.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions. 
statement of Directors’ responsibilities
_MAE_back.indd   9 03/08/2007   09:59:31 20 Maelor plc annual report and ﬁnancial statements 2007
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements on pages 21 to 39.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report 
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company 
and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent 
with the ﬁnancial statements.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the 
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other 
transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the annual report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited ﬁnancial statements. 
This other information comprises only the Highlights, Product Portfolio, the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s Review, 
the Corporate Governance Report, the Directors’ Report and the Board’s Remuneration Report. We consider the implications for our report 
if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the ﬁnancial statements. Our responsibilities do not 
extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements. It also includes 
an assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements, and of 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide 
us with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused 
by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information 
in the ﬁnancial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion: 
  the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, of the 
state of the Group and Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2007 and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended and have been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
 the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements.

1 Accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Group 
and Company’s ﬁnancial statements.
Basis of preparation
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under the historical cost accounting 
rules, modiﬁed to include the revaluation of freehold property.
Basis of consolidation
The ﬁnancial statements of the Group consolidate the ﬁnancial statements of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings, whose ﬁnancial 
statements were also made up to 31 March 2007.
On 5 November 1997, as part of a Group reconstruction, the Company became the holding Company of Maelor Pharmaceuticals Limited. 
The combination was accounted for by the merger method of accounting as set out in FRS 6 “Mergers and Acquisitions” and Schedule 4(A) of 
the Companies Act 1985, on the basis that it met the criteria set out in paragraph 13 of that Standard with respect to Group reconstructions.
In the Company’s ﬁnancial statements, investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost, less any provision for diminution in the value 
of these.
Under Section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own proﬁt and loss account.
Turnover
Turnover represents the amount charged or chargeable in respect of the provision of, and in relation to, the development of healthcare 
products, goods and services, all of which fall within the Group’s ordinary activities, stated net of value added tax.
For pharmaceuticals products, turnover is recognised on dispatch of goods to the customer.
For medical devices, turnover is represented by (1) recognition on dispatch of goods from the manufacturer to the distributor and 
(2) a share of the gross margin, which is recognised on dispatch of goods to the ﬁnal customer.
Licence fees
Amounts received in respect of licence fee down payments are amortised on a straight line basis over the length of the licence period unless, 
at the balance sheet date, there is a potential for them to be refunded, in which case they are treated as deferred income and not credited 
to revenue.
Depreciation of tangible ﬁxed assets
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost or valuation less the estimated residual value of tangible ﬁxed assets by equal instalments over 
their estimated useful economic lives as follows:
Plant and machinery 20% – 25% per annum
Fixtures, ﬁttings and equipment 25% – 50% per annum
Freehold property 2% per annum
Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Leases and hire purchase contracts
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to income as incurred.

1 Accounting policies continued
Research and development (R&D)
Expenditure on R&D incurred during the year is classiﬁed as an operating cost and charged against proﬁts.
Share-based payments
In accordance with FRS 20 “Share-based Payments”, the fair value of equity-settled share-based payments to employees is determined at 
the date of grant and is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period based on the Group’s estimate of share options that will 
eventually vest. In the case of options granted, fair value is measured by a binomial pricing model. Further details are set out in Note 19b.
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based upon the result for the year and takes into account deferred taxation.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where 
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the 
balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the Group’s taxable proﬁts and its results as stated in the ﬁnancial statements.
Deferred tax is recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses on revaluations where at the balance sheet date there 
is an agreement to sell the asset.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are expected to reverse, 
based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured 
on a discounted basis.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
The Group has surrendered its R&D tax losses for the appropriate R&D tax refund (see Note 8).
Cash and liquid resources
Cash, for the purpose of the cash ﬂow statement, comprises cash in hand and deposits payable on demand, less overdrafts payable 
on demand.
Liquid resources are current asset investments which are disposable without curtailing or disrupting the business and are either readily 
convertible into known amounts of cash at or close to their carrying values or traded in an active market. Liquid resources comprise term 
deposits of less than one year (other than cash), government securities and investments in money market managed funds. 
Post retirement beneﬁts
The Group operates a deﬁned contribution pension scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in 
an independently administered fund. The amount charged against proﬁts represents the contributions payable to the scheme in respect 
of the ﬁnancial year.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling and recorded at rates of exchange approximating to those ruling at the date 
of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities are translated at rates ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences are taken to the proﬁt 
and loss account.
Grants
Revenue based grants are credited to the proﬁt and loss account in the year of receipt. Capital based grants are amortised over the estimated 
useful lives of the assets to which they relate.

of the use of common services.

Notes
1.   A member entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting may appoint a proxy (who need not be a member of the 
Company) to attend and, on a poll, to vote on his or her behalf. In order to be valid an appointment of proxy must be returned 
by one of the following methods:
   in hard copy form by post, by courier or by hand to Capita Registrars, The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham,  
Kent BR3 4TU; or
   in the case of CREST members, by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service in accordance with the procedures 
set out below;
 and in each case must be received by the Company not less than 48 hours before the time of the meeting.
  CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so by 
utilising the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members, and those 
CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), 
who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment made by means of CREST to be valid, 
the appropriate CREST message (a CREST Proxy Instruction) must be properly authenticated in accordance with CRESTCo’s speciﬁcations 
and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of 
whether it relates to the appointment of a proxy or to an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must, 
in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID RA10) by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy 
appointments speciﬁed in the notice of meeting. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by 
the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message 
by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances 
set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertiﬁcated Securities Regulations 2001. CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors 
or voting service providers should note that CRESTCo does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. 
Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility 
of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed 
a voting service provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to 
ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, 
where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual 
concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
2.  A form of proxy is enclosed for use by shareholders and, if appropriate, must be deposited with the Company’s registrars, Capita Registrars, 
The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU not less than 48 hours before the time of the Annual General Meeting. 
Appointment of a proxy does not preclude a shareholder from attending the Annual General Meeting and voting in person.
3.  Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertiﬁcated Securities Regulations 2001, in order to be able to attend and vote at the Annual 
General Meeting or any adjourned meeting, (and also for the purposes of calculating how many votes a person may cast), a person 
must have his/her name entered on the register of members of the Company by 1.00pm on 3 September 2007 (or 1.00pm on the 
date two days before any adjourned meeting). Changes to entries on the register of members after this time shall be disregarded 
in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.
4.  Copies of the Directors’ service contracts with the Company and the register of interests of the Directors and their families in the share 
capital of the Company are available for inspection at the registered ofﬁce of the Company during usual business hours (Saturdays, 
Sundays and public holidays excepted) and will be available at the place of the Annual General Meeting from 15 minutes prior to and 
during the Annual General Meeting.

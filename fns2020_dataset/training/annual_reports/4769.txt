Dignity_AR08_Front IFC_1-22 tp.qxd 7/4/09 09:24 Page 1 Crematoria represent 17 per cent of the
Group’s revenues and arise from cremation
services and the sale of memorials and burial
plots at the Group’s crematoria and cemeteries. 
We are the largest single operator of crematoria
in Britain. We operate 25 crematoria in England
and Scotland and carried out 39,600 cremations
in 2008 representing 7 per cent of estimated
total deaths in Britain.
Pre-arranged funeral plans represent 
5 per cent of the Group’s revenues. Income
represents amounts to cover the costs of
marketing and administering the sale of plans.
Pre-arranged funeral plans allow people to
plan and pay for their funeral in advance. 
The Group has a strong market presence in
the provision of pre-arranged funeral plans
with 204,000 unfulﬁlled funeral plans as at 
26 December 2008. Dignity works with 
a number of reputable afﬁnity partners.
Funeral services represent 78 per cent of the
Group’s revenues and relate to the provision 
of funerals and ancillary items such as memorials
and ﬂoral tributes. We operate a network of 544
funeral locations throughout the United Kingdom
trading under established local trading names. 
In 2008, the Group conducted 68,700 funerals,
which represents approximately 12 per cent 
of estimated total deaths in Britain. During 
the period, the Group acquired 9 new 
funeral locations.

Dignity_AR08_Front IFC_1-22 tp.qxd 7/4/09 09:25 Page 3 Results
I am delighted to present my ﬁrst annual report as
Chairman of the Group.
Underlying earnings per share (which excludes proﬁt on
sale of ﬁxed assets and exceptional tax items) increased
14 per cent to 38.2 pence per share (2007: 33.4 pence
per share). Basic earnings per share were 38.8 pence per
share (2007: 34.4 pence per share), an increase of 
13 per cent.
This is another strong performance by the Group and is
the result of maintaining our focus on the same strategy
that has served this business so well in recent years,
namely that we plan to grow the proﬁtability of our
business by:
• Operating in a traditional market where people use 
our services based on our reputation and through
recommendations, where we believe our continued
commitment to excellent service for our clients 
will generate a high level of referral and organic 
revenue growth;
• Continuing to control our costs;
• Selective acquisitions of additional funeral locations; 
• National marketing, principally through afﬁnity partners,
of pre-arranged funeral plans; and
• Developing, managing or acquiring additional crematoria
where possible.
Dividends
The Board has proposed that a ﬁnal dividend of 7.34
pence per Ordinary Share should be paid from proﬁts
generated in 2008. This will be paid on 26 June 2009 to
members on the register at close of business on 29 May
2009, provided shareholder consent is obtained at the
Annual General Meeting on 5 June 2009.
This will follow an interim dividend of 3.66 pence per
Ordinary Share, which was paid in October 2008.
These dividends represent a 10 per cent increase year 
on year, a rate that has been maintained since ﬂotation 
in 2004.
Changes to the Board
A number of changes were made to the composition 
of the Board since the last Annual Report.
Richard Connell retired as Chairman. Richard guided the
Group through two very successful periods of its history.
Firstly during its private equity ownership and more recently
as a public company. I would like to thank him, on behalf
of the Board, for his contribution and wish him well with
his numerous other business interests.
Mike McCollum, the previous Finance Director, was
appointed Chief Executive. Mike has over 13 years within
the business and has made a signiﬁcant contribution in
guiding the Group through all its signiﬁcant changes since
the management buy out. I am sure that he will be an
outstanding Chief Executive.
Steve Whittern has succeeded Mike as Finance Director.
Steve was previously the Group’s Financial Controller and
has been with the Group for ten years in various roles
within the ﬁnance team.
As well as these changes to the Executive Directors, at the
beginning of 2009 we also appointed two additional Non-
Executive Directors, Ishbel Macpherson and Alan McWalter.
Their biographies on page 19 demonstrate their extensive
experience and they are welcome additions to the Board.
Ishbel and Alan’s appointments also give the necessary
balance to the Board, required by the Combined Code,
given our responsibilities as a constituent member of the
FTSE 250.
Our people
I know from my time as Chief Executive that our people
are a tremendous asset to the Group. Their dedication to
doing the best possible job, be it directly with families, or
supporting operational staff, is at the heart of this business
and I thank them for their individual contributions.
Outlook for 2009
All three business areas continue to perform well in the
ﬁrst quarter of 2009 and the outlook for the Group
remains positive for the year ahead.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
“This performance is a result 
of maintaining our focus on the 
same strategy that has served 
this business so well.”
Peter Hindley, Chairman
Dignity_AR08_Front IFC_1-22 tp.qxd 7/4/09 09:25 Page 4 Introduction
I would like to begin my ﬁrst overview as Chief Executive,
by recognising the tremendous contribution Peter Hindley
made during his 17 years as Chief Executive of this business.
I am delighted that Peter agreed to become Non-Executive
Chairman, as this will allow the Group to continue to beneﬁt
from his vast experience of the industry in the coming
years. This experience was clearly recognised by our major
shareholders, who were consulted and supported Peter’s
transition to Chairman. 
Delivering proﬁtable growth 
Underlying operating proﬁts (which excludes proﬁt on 
sale of ﬁxed assets) increased 9 per cent to £52.1 million
(2007: £47.6 million). Operating proﬁts increased 12 per
cent to £53.2 million (2007: £47.7 million).
This strong performance reﬂects good growth in our core
operations, together with beneﬁts from acquisitions made
in the period. 
This solid operational performance continues to be
underpinned by our funding strategy, which helps to
improve returns to our shareholders.
Building value for shareholders 
The Group continues to be very cash generative. 
I believe that the Group makes the best use of that cash
for the beneﬁt of its shareholders, by using it for three
main purposes, in addition to the traditional payment 
of dividends.
First, the business generates sufﬁcient cash to fund
continued programmes of renewal and improvement to 
its infrastructure. This helps our staff to provide the best
possible service. For many years now, we have invested
signiﬁcantly in improving our locations and maintaining 
a modern ﬂeet of hearses, limousines and other vehicles. 
Second, the stability of our cash ﬂows enables us to
maintain an efﬁcient balance sheet with long term ﬁxed
rate debt. Importantly, the principal of this debt amortises
over its life and is scheduled to be fully repaid by 2031.
Third, we have historically been able to ﬁnance acquisitions
of funeral locations from internally generated cash ﬂows.
These acquisitions deliver good incremental shareholder
value from the outset.
Valuing our people
The business continues to grow thanks to the dedication
of all our staff. Irrespective of their role within the business,
they are focused on delivering client service excellence.
Another successful year has allowed the Group to make
discretionary payments totalling £1.3 million to permanent
members of staff not covered by any bonus scheme, an
increase of 8 per cent over that paid in the previous period.
In addition, we continue to maintain our ﬁnal salary pension
scheme, keeping it open to new employees. The scheme
continues to show a healthy surplus on an accounting
basis and the most recent actuarial valuation, as at 5 April
2008, also showed the scheme to be fully funded.
Building on our reputation, relationships 
and responsibilities
Our strategy has been consistent for many years and has
proved to be very effective. At its core is the service we
provide to our customers. We help bereaved people at a
sad time by providing a compassionate service whether
through our funeral businesses, our crematoria, or our 
pre-arranged funeral plan business. The result of this focus
is that over 70 per cent of our business is generated by
previous experience, recommendation and reputation.
We continue to work on improving our already very high
levels of service.
05 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S OVERVIEW
“This strong performance reﬂects 
good growth in our core operations,
together with beneﬁts from acquisitions
made in the period.”
Mike McCollum, Chief Executive
Dignity_AR08_Front IFC_1-22 tp.qxd 7/4/09 09:25 Page 5 Introduction
The Group’s operations are managed across three main
areas; funeral services, crematoria and pre-arranged
funeral plans, which respectively represent 78 per cent, 
17 per cent and 5 per cent of the Group’s revenues.
Funeral services revenues relate to the provision of
funerals and ancillary items, such as memorials and 
ﬂoral tributes. Crematoria revenues arise from cremation
services and the sale of memorials and burial plots at the
Group’s crematoria and cemeteries. Pre-arranged funeral
plan income represents amounts to cover the costs of
marketing and administering the sale of plans.
Ofﬁce for National Statistics data
Some of the Group’s key performance indicators rely 
on the total number of estimated deaths for each period. 
This information is obtained from the Ofﬁce of National
Statistics (ONS).
In 2007, the ONS changed their reporting systems.
Consequently, there is possibly a lack of comparability
between 2007 and 2008 estimated deaths. Nonetheless,
the ﬁgures continue to give a good general background 
to the Group’s performance.
The initial publication of recorded total estimated deaths
in Britain for 2008 was 553,000 (2007: 553,000).
Historically the ONS has updated these estimates from
time to time. As in previous years, the Group does not
restate any of its key performance indicators when these
ﬁgures are restated in the following year.
Funeral services
Overview
The Group operates a network of 544 (2007: 540) funeral
locations throughout the United Kingdom, trading under
local established names. During the period, the Group
conducted 68,700 funerals (2007: 66,500). Approximately
1 per cent of these funerals were conducted in Northern
Ireland. Excluding Northern Ireland, these funerals represent
approximately 12.3 per cent (2007: 12.0 per cent) of total
estimated deaths in Britain.
Developments
Underlying operating proﬁts were £46.3 million (2007:
£42.1 million), an increase of 10 per cent. This reﬂects
good growth in our core portfolio arising from increased
spend per funeral and continued cost control, together
with the incremental beneﬁts from acquisitions made in
2008 and acquisitions made in 2007 having a full year
effect for the ﬁrst time.
Reported operating proﬁts were £47.4 million (2007:
£42.2 million), an increase of 12 per cent. The difference
between statutory amounts and underlying amounts is
represented by proﬁt on sale of ﬁxed assets of £1.1 million
(2007: £0.1 million).
The vast majority of our funeral locations comprise 
those owned and operated by the Group for many years.
These locations have continued to perform well and have
beneﬁted from the continued investment in our funeral
locations and ﬂeet, with a total of approximately £6.9
million being invested in the period. This investment has
resulted in the acquisition of a further 31 new hearses and
limousines, 99 other vehicles and the refurbishment of
approximately one ﬁfth of our property portfolio.

RESPONSIBILITIES
The Group provides direct support to employees through both in-house training at centres such as this one 
at Middleton & Wood in Wigan and external training courses. It operates in a traditional market where people
use our services based on previous experience, recommendation and reputation. Consequently, maintaining
high quality and consistent delivery of client service excellence is of key importance to the Group’s continued
success and lies at the very heart of our strategy for growth.
We carry out close monitoring of survey results and provide regular training and detailed procedures to ensure
our managers have the knowledge to embed Group policies at a local level and we empower them to make
decisions and respond appropriately to clients needs.

Leigh, Lancashire.
Dignity_AR08_Front IFC_1-22 tp.qxd 7/4/09 09:25 Page 7 The operating results also demonstrate our high level of
client service, which has been supported for another year
by our client survey results. Approximately 89 per cent 
of responding families would deﬁnitely recommend our
services and a further 9 per cent would probably do so.
These statistics speak volumes about the quality of service
provided by our staff to the families we help at their 
time of need.
Sometimes, changing demographics or market conditions
in local areas mean that individual funeral locations can
become unproﬁtable. The Group has closed ﬁve (2007:
two) such locations in the period. 
Acquisition spend has again been higher than average
annual spend since ﬂotation in the period, with £16.3
million invested in acquiring nine funeral locations in 
the United Kingdom, including six funeral locations 
in Northern Ireland.
Each of these acquisitions met the Group’s criteria of
being larger than average, long-established businesses
that ﬁt well within the Group’s existing network. The Group
will also continue to acquire businesses that meet the
Group’s stringent acquisition criteria. No acquisitions 
have been completed since the end of 2008.
The funeral business is built on the reputation of each 
of our funeral locations. Consequently, client service 
will continue to be a key priority in 2009 and the 
coming years.
Crematoria
Overview
The Group operates 25 crematoria and performed 39,600
cremations (2007: 38,900) in the period. This represents
7.2 per cent (2007: 7.0 per cent) of deaths in Britain and
reﬂects the Group’s position as the largest single operator
of crematoria in Britain.
Developments
Revenues of £29.2 million (2007: £25.7 million) have
resulted in operating proﬁts of £14.6 million (2007: 
£14.0 million), an increase of 4 per cent. This reﬂects 
a consistent performance by the division, which has
experienced some cost pressures during the period, such
as an increase in utility prices and some anticipated
operating losses at the start of the Rotherham contract.
During the period, the Group has acquired two crematoria
from private operators and started to develop and operate
the crematorium in Rotherham on behalf of Rotherham
Metropolitan Borough Council. The site was initially closed
for two days a week to allow redevelopment work to begin.
During this period, the site was loss making. However,
work is nearing a close, the site is open ﬁve days a week
and became proﬁtable in December.
In addition, the Group acquired the property interest in
ﬁve crematoria. At present, the sites are leased to a third
party not connected to the Group. Three of these locations
were fully operational at the year end with a further one
having since become operational and the ﬁfth one expected
to become operational in the second quarter of 2009. 
The leases expire by 2039, at which point the Group 
will take over operational control of the locations. These
properties are not counted within the 25 reported
crematoria that we operate.
70% 
Over 70 per cent of our business is
generated by previous experience,
recommendation and reputation.
25 locations
The Group is the largest private
operator of crematoria, with 
25 locations serving families 
across Britain.

RESPONSIBILITIES
The Group continues to seek opportunities to build valuable relationships with local authorities to manage 
their crematoria and cemeteries using our established knowledge and expertise, stability and depth of
resources. As the largest single operator of crematoria in the UK, Dignity has a proven track record and
infrastructure to deliver these vital added-value services to the community.
In 2008, Dignity was appointed by Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council to upgrade and operate their
crematorium and nine cemeteries across the borough. This innovative Public Private Partnership concession 
is the ﬁrst of its kind in the UK and will include a £3.5 million investment by Dignity in the refurbishment 
and improvement of facilities.
Above: Adrian Barbour, Regional Manager and Clare Chisholm, Liaison Ofﬁcer, Rotherham Crematorium.
Dignity_AR08_Front IFC_1-22 tp.qxd 7/4/09 09:25 Page 9 The Group has spent £0.8 million improving the 
facilities at its operational locations.
The Group continues to look at opportunities to work 
with local authorities. In addition, the Group is, in
conjunction with the developer of the ﬁve sites recently
acquired, evaluating a number of locations for potential
new build crematoria. 
Pre-arranged funeral plans
Overview
The Group continues to have a strong market presence 
in this area. Unfulﬁlled pre-arranged funeral plans were
204,000 at the end of the period (2007: 197,300). 
These plans represent future incremental business for 
the funeral division, as the Group expects to perform 
the majority of these funerals.
Developments
The Group has continued to work hard at developing 
its portfolio of afﬁnity partners and has formed a number 
of new partnerships in the period with organisations in the
retail and ﬁnancial services arena. This activity has been
complemented by continued development and marketing
of plans endorsed by the actor Christopher Timothy,
together with good sales via our funeral locations.
The Group is in discussion with a number of new potential
partners with tests planned for 2009.
Central overheads
Overview
Head ofﬁce costs relate to central services that are not
speciﬁcally attributed to a particular operational division.
These include the provision of IT, ﬁnance, personnel and
Directors’ emoluments. In addition and consistent with
previous periods, the Group records the costs of incentive
bonus arrangements, such as Long Term Incentive 
Plans (LTIPs) and annual performance bonuses, which 
are provided to over 50 managers working across 
the business.
Developments
Costs in the period were £11.3 million (2007: £10.9
million), an increase of 4 per cent. This year on year increase
principally reﬂects the additional cost of bonuses paid to
the operational managers of the business.

RESPONSIBILITIES
Dignity continues to have a strong market presence in pre-arranged funeral plans. Good progress has been
made in developing plan sales, with two substantial new partnerships launched in 2008. We have also seen
continued growth in the sales of our Dignity Funeral Plan, endorsed by the actor Christopher Timothy, and 
in sales through our IFA channel. Developing further marketing and distribution relationships with reputable
afﬁnity partners is a key part of the growth plan in our Pre-Arrangement business.
We have substantially invested in our client services team, ensuring that our training, coaching and
development programme reﬂects ongoing product training, telephone skills and the delivery of excellent
customer service to our clients at all times.

Dignity_AR08_Front IFC_1-22 tp.qxd 7/4/09 09:25 Page 11 Introduction
The Dignity Group is committed to integrating corporate
and social responsibility into all areas of our business. 
We recognise the importance of balancing the needs of 
our customers, our shareholders, our employees and the
communities in which we work. This is central to the service
we provide to our clients and is reﬂected in our business
policies and procedures. The Group also believes in creating
the appropriate culture for our staff, who are the most
important asset of the business. We aim to achieve our
business objectives in a caring and responsible manner,
recognising the economic, social and environmental 
impact of our activities.
Richard Portman, Corporate Services Director, is accountable
for corporate and social responsibility and under this remit
identiﬁes key issues and reports these to his fellow 
Board members.
In our communities
Making a difference to the local communities we serve
is at the heart of everything we do. The staff at Dignity are
extremely committed to this ethos and support hundreds 
of local activities every year. From organising fundraising
events for national charities to helping out village fêtes, our
employees donate a large amount of their time to helping
good causes and charities. By listening to and understanding
the needs of local communities our staff are able to
respond by providing help where it is really needed.
For example, our funeral directors in Surrey and Berkshire
offer the use of their mini-bus to provide transport for local
community groups and care homes. D J Evans Forse & Co
in Cardiff helped to raise £10,000 to replace a school 
mini-bus that had been destroyed in an arson attack.
Mason and Gerald Martin in Hartlepool donated a new
memorial to eight soldiers who had been killed in World
War Two and buried in France so that their families could 
pay their respects in their hometown. Dignity’s Easter Egg
challenge is still going strong with staff across the United
Kingdom donating chocolate gifts to those less fortunate
than themselves. 
At Dignity, we believe in supporting our staff every step of
the way, providing advice and practical support for those
who want to give something back to their local community.
Supporting charities
In addition to our commitment to local communities,
staff at Dignity raise thousands of pounds each year for
national and local charities of their choosing.
In 2008, the staff at Dignity raised over £26,000 for the
staff elected charity – Help the Hospices – a sum which was
matched by the Group. Help the Hospices is the national
membership charity for the hospice movement, supporting
over 240 local hospices in their vital work caring for people
with terminal illness. Dignity will continue to support this
worthwhile cause in 2009.
There were many fund raising initiatives held nationwide
during the year including memorial services, tea parties,
picnics and barbecues whilst some employees raised money
by abseiling, white water rafting and bungee jumping. 
The heroes of our armed services were commemorated 
in November with window dressings and numerous poppy
appeals raising much-needed funds for the Royal British
Legion. Several funeral locations raised money for Breast
Cancer Campaign’s ‘Wear It Pink’ awareness day and at

staff at Dignity raise thousands of pounds each year for
national and local charities. In 2008, the staff at Dignity
raised over £26,000 for the staff elected charity – Help the

Dignity_AR08_Front IFC_1-22 tp.qxd  7/4/09  09:25  Page 13 the end of September there were various coffee mornings
held in aid of Macmillan and the fabulous work they do.
Our four charity fairground organs continued to be a vital
aid in fundraising activities and in 2008 almost £10,000
was raised for a variety of national and local charities.
Environment
As in previous years, our business continues to have a
low environmental impact and its activities are not expected
to give rise to any signiﬁcant environmental risk over the
next twelve months.
Maintaining the quality of the environment in which 
we all live is an important concern for Dignity. All areas 
of the business operate in accordance with the Group’s
environmental policy. We recognise the impact of our
operations on local surroundings and our aim is to 
reduce this impact and operate in an environmentally
friendly manner.
At our cofﬁn manufacturing facility in East Yorkshire all
wood waste from the manufacture of cofﬁns is used to 
heat the factory. A signiﬁcant and increasing proportion 
of packaging, which cofﬁns are packed in for transit to our
funeral locations, is now returned to the factory for re-use. 
As this is done when the next delivery is made there is no
increase in the use of vehicles or emissions to achieve this.
All raw materials used in the manufacture of our cofﬁns 
are sourced from well-managed and sustainable sources,
73 per cent of whom have FSC (Forest Stewardship Council)
accreditation. We are currently seeking FSC accreditation
for our veneered cofﬁns, which account for 23 per cent of
demand. Due to inconsistencies in supply-chain sources it
is difﬁcult to achieve accreditation for our oak cofﬁns, which
comprise 4 per cent of our manufacturing output.
All promotional literature developed by the pre-arranged
funeral plan division is printed on paper with FSC Mixed
Sources accreditation with up to 70 per cent of marketing
literature printed on recycled material.
The Group and its employees undertake to act whenever
necessary to meet or exceed the standards of current
environmental legislation and continue to review the
policies, systems and services to this end. All waste
generated is properly disposed of in accordance with
current legislation and steps are taken to recycle waste
wherever this is practical. 
A recycling mission statement was developed and circulated
to all premises in 2008.
Health and Safety
Effective heath and safety management is critical to
the Group and a key priority of the Directors. Its operations
are conducted at all times in such a way as to ensure, as
far as is reasonably practical, the health, safety and welfare
of all its employees and all persons who may be attending
its premises.
Dignity is committed to the prevention of accidents and
regularly reviews and updates procedures and training 
to ensure that staff minimise any risks associated with 
their role.

MINIMISING OUR IMPACT
ON THE ENVIRONMENT
We recognise the impact of our operations on local
surroundings and our aim is to reduce this and operate 
in an environmentally friendly manner. At our head ofﬁce

14 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008
Dignity_AR08_Front IFC_1-22 tp.qxd 7/4/09 09:25 Page 14 The Group has a full-time Health and Safety Consultant
who is dedicated to these issues and is supported by 
two Health and Safety Managers, both of whom have
completed NEBOSH (National Examination Board in
Occupational Safety and Health) General Certiﬁcate
Training. The manufacturing facility also has its own 
Health and Safety Manager. 
In 2008, Dignity instigated a Health and Safety training
programme ranging from a one-day introduction course 
to the four-day IOSH (Institution of Occupational Safety and
Health) course. During the year, approximately half of the
Group’s 36 Funeral Service Managers were trained to IOSH
Managing Safely Certiﬁcate standard and 50 per cent of
junior managers have been trained to Level 2 Health and
Safety Certiﬁcate standard. There are now approximately 
90 co-ordinators embedded into the business and there are
plans for further members of staff to take the IOSH course
in 2009 including Operations Director, Andrew Davies and
Corporate Services Director, Richard Portman. 
The Group has also continued with its staff vaccination
programme and plans to conclude this in 2009. During the
next twelve months Dignity will also publish its Health and
Safety manual and distribute this to all premises.
Supporting our staff
Our employees are critical to the continued success of
Dignity. We are committed to high standards of employment
practice and aim to encourage and develop employees.
The Group provides direct support to employees through
both in-house training and external training courses.
External training includes both relevant job training and
tutoring for professional qualiﬁcations. These professional
qualiﬁcations include the NAFD (National Association of
Funeral Directors) Diploma and Membership of the BIE
(British Institute of Embalmers). In addition, the Group has
ﬁve members of staff who are accredited NAFD tutors and
three BIE training specialists.
The Group provides additional support to staff development
through its Welfare Trust, which provides funds for
professional training and hardship grants. The Trust has
approximately £1.6 million available for future use.
Dignity publishes a quarterly in-house magazine, ‘Dignity
Express’, which is supplemented by monthly news bulletins
to keep all employees informed of what is happening in 
the Group. ‘Dignity Express’ is also circulated to the Group’s
retired employees. News, useful information and background
on the Group is also available to staff via a dedicated
employee website which was re-launched in 2008.

“Underlying earnings per share 
increased 14 per cent to 38.2 pence 
per share.”
Steve Whittern, Finance Director
Introduction
The market conditions in which the Group operates and 
its trading performance during the 52 week period ended
26 December 2008 are described in the Chairman’s
Statement, the Chief Executive’s Overview and the 
Business Review. 
Financial highlights

Interim dividend (pence) 3.66 3.33 10
Final dividend (pence) 6.67 6.06 10
*Underlying amounts exclude proﬁt on sale of ﬁxed assets and 
exceptional tax items.
The Board has proposed a dividend of 7.34 pence per
Ordinary Share as a ﬁnal distribution of proﬁts relating 
to 2008 to be paid in 2009. This brings the total dividend 
in respect of 2008 to 11 pence per share, an increase 
of 10 per cent.
Capital structure and ﬁnancing
The Group’s principal source of long term debt ﬁnancing 
is the Class A and B Secured Notes, rated A and BBB
respectively.
The Board considers that maintaining a leveraged balance
sheet is appropriate for the Group, given the highly stable
and predictable nature of its cash ﬂows. This predictability
is matched in the Secured Notes. The principal and interest
on the Secured Notes amortise fully over their life and are
completely repaid by 2031. The interest rate is ﬁxed for
the life of the Secured Notes and interest is calculated 
on the outstanding principal.
This has the beneﬁt of maximising shareholder returns,
whilst leaving sufﬁcient ﬂexibility to invest in the growth 
of the business.
At the end of November 2008, the Group borrowed 
£7.4 million to help fund the acquisition of the freehold 
or long leasehold interests in ﬁve crematoria properties.
The Group also has the facility to draw down a further 
£2.6 million in 2009 once the two locations under
construction are complete. 
This is a ﬁve-year facility with all interest cash paid. 
The principal is repayable in one amount at the end 
of the facility. The interest rate on this facility is ﬁxed 
at approximately 5.6 per cent on the ﬁrst tranche and 
is capped at approximately 5.6 per cent on the 
second tranche.
Outstanding net debt as at 26 December 2008 was:

Net amounts owing on Class A and B 
Secured Notes per ﬁnancial statements (263.0) (267.0)

Secured Notes (paid 31 December) (9.7) (9.9)
Cash and cash equivalents 46.7 52.6
Net debt (249.3) (241.5)
The Group’s ﬁnance expense substantially consists of 
the interest on the Class A and B Secured Notes and
ancillary instruments. The net ﬁnance charge in the 
period relating to these instruments was £19.9 million
(2007: £20.1 million). 
Other ongoing ﬁnance costs incurred in the period
amounted to £0.9 million (2007: £0.8 million), including
the unwinding of discounts on the Group’s provisions and
other ﬁnancial liabilities. This amount also includes the
very small amount of interest incurred on the crematoria
acquisition facility in the last month of the period.
16 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008
Dignity_AR08_Front IFC_1-22 tp.qxd 7/4/09 09:25 Page 16 Interest receivable on bank deposits was £2.3 million
(2007: £2.7 million). These receipts are a direct reﬂection
of the Bank of England Base Rate, which averaged
approximately 4.7 per cent (2007: 5.5 per cent) in the
period. Given the current low Bank of England Base Rate,
the Group is likely to receive less interest on its substantial
cash deposits in 2009 and is exploring ways to more
effectively generate returns from its cash balances.
Net ﬁnance income of £0.7 million (2007: £0.7 million)
was recognised in respect of the Group’s pension scheme
in accordance with IAS 19.
Underlying proﬁt after tax
The Board believes that, whilst statutory reporting
measures provide a useful indication of the ﬁnancial
performance of the Group, additional insight is gained 
by excluding certain non-recurring or non-trading
transactions. Accordingly, the following information 
is presented to aid understanding of the performance 
of the Group:
52 week period 52 week period

Weighted average number of Ordinary 
Shares in issue during the period (million) 63.4 62.8
Underlying EPS (pence) 38.2p 33.4p
Increase in underlying EPS (per cent) 14%
Earnings per share
The Group’s earnings were £24.6 million (2007: £21.6
million). Basic earnings per share were 38.8 pence per
share (2007: 34.4 pence per share).
However, the Group’s reported earnings include a 
£0.4 million one off charge for taxation described later in 
this review and £1.1 million proﬁt on sale of ﬁxed assets.
Consequently, the Group’s underlying proﬁt after tax was 
£24.2 million (2007: £21.0 million), giving underlying
earnings per share of 38.2 pence per share (2007: 
33.4 pence per share), an increase of 14 per cent.
This increase demonstrates the strong operating
performance combined with the beneﬁcial leveraging 
effect of the Secured Notes. 
The average number of shares increased year on year as 
a result of the 2005 LTIP scheme maturing in the period.
Cash ﬂow and cash balances
Cash generated from operations was £62.3 million (2007:
£57.5 million), demonstrating the cash generative nature 
of the business and further improvements in working
capital management.
Acquisition activity in the period was strong, with £31.5
million (2007: £16.6 million) being spent on funeral and
crematoria acquisitions. As described above, £7.4 million
of this amount was funded by way of a new loan facility.
Capital expenditure increased year on year, with £8.0 million
(2007: £8.3 million) being spent on replacing older vehicles
in the Group’s ﬂeet, in line with a planned replacement
programme, and improvements to the Group’s premises
and plant. A further £1.1 million (2007: £0.2 million) was
spent on branch relocations and £2.1 million (2007: £nil
million) was spent on Rotherham and other crematoria
property developments. This capital expenditure was offset
by disposal proceeds of £2.5 million (2007: £0.9 million). 
The Group also paid dividends totalling £6.5 million (2007:
£5.9 million) in the period. 
Cash balances at the end of the period were £46.7 million.
£12.4 million represents amounts legally set aside to fund
the Group’s liabilities to Class A and B Secured Noteholders.
This payment was made on 31 December 2008, which
falls in the Group’s 2009 ﬁnancial year as it reports on a
52 week basis rather than on a calendar year. These funds
do not qualify as cash or cash equivalents for the purposes
of IAS 7, Cash Flow Statements. Accordingly, £10.0 million
has been reported within the cash ﬂow statement as
‘Payments to restricted bank accounts for ﬁnance charges’
and £2.4 million has been reported as ‘Payments to
restricted bank accounts for repayment of borrowings’.

FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
18 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008
£1.5 million (2007: £1.5 million) represents amounts
received as Recoveries from the pre-arranged funeral plan
trusts. These amounts are legally required, under the terms
of the Group’s securitisation, to be retained in a separate
bank account for one year following receipt and do not
therefore meet the deﬁnition of cash for cash ﬂow
reporting purposes.
£10.9 million of the remainder has been set aside for
acquisitions and developments. Approximately £1.0 million
has been spent on Rotherham since the balance sheet
date. £10.8 million has also been set aside for future
corporation tax and dividend payments. However, these
funds could be used for further acquisitions if suitable
opportunities arose, with statutory payments being funded
out of future operating cash ﬂows.
Full details and analysis of the Group’s cash balances are
included in note 15 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
Pensions
During the period, the Group’s pension scheme had a
formal actuarial valuation, as required once every three
years. This reported that the scheme was fully funded on
an ongoing basis. As a consequence of the valuation, the
Group has agreed the rate of employer contributions for
the next three years, which is anticipated to result in a
similar cash obligation in 2009 as that experienced in 2008.
The balance sheet shows a surplus of £13.2 million before
deferred tax (2007: £6.8 million). This signiﬁcant increase
year on year is principally a result of the changes in
assumptions based on increased gilt yields experienced 
in the market.
Taxation
As anticipated last year, legislation was passed during 
the period amending the Industrial Buildings Allowances
regime. This change resulted in an exceptional charge 
of £0.4 million in the period.
Furthermore, the rate of Corporation Tax was reduced 
to 28 per cent with effect from April 2008. This change
resulted in the Group’s effective tax rate reducing to 
29.5 per cent in the period. As the 28 per cent rate will 
be effective for the whole of 2009, the Group’s effective 
tax rate for 2009 is anticipated to be 29 per cent.
Key performance indicators
The Group uses a number of performance indicators to
both manage the business and ensure that the Group’s
strategy and objectives are being delivered.

reﬂected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable,
it can give no assurance that these expectations will prove

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
The Directors present their report and the audited
consolidated ﬁnancial statements for Dignity plc and 
its subsidiaries for the 52 week period ended 26
December 2008.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual
Report, the Report on Directors’ Remuneration and the
ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare ﬁnancial
statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that law the
Directors have prepared the Group ﬁnancial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. 
The Directors have prepared the parent company ﬁnancial
statements in accordance with United Kingdom generally
accepted accounting practice (UK accounting standards
and applicable laws and regulations). The ﬁnancial
statements are required by law to give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group
and of the proﬁt or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing those ﬁnancial statements the Directors are
required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• State that the ﬁnancial statements comply with IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union; and
• Prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern
basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
Group will continue in business, in which case there
should be supporting assumptions or qualiﬁcations 
as necessary.
The Directors are also required by the Disclosure and
Transparency Rules of the Financial Services Authority 
to include a management report containing a fair review 
of the business and a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties facing the Group and Company.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper
accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy
at any time the ﬁnancial position of the Company and the
Group and to enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial
statements and the Report on Directors Remuneration
comply with the Companies Act 1985 (for periods
commencing on or after 6 April 2008, the Companies 
Act 2006) and, as regards the Group ﬁnancial statements
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible
for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Directors’ statement pursuant to the Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are
listed on page 22 of the Annual Report, conﬁrm that, 
to the best of each person’s knowledge and belief:
• The ﬁnancial statements, prepared in accordance with
IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of
the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position and proﬁt of the
Group and Company; and
• The Directors’ report contained in the Annual Report
includes a fair review of the development and performance
of the business and the position of the Company and
Group, together with a description of the principal risks
and uncertainties that they face.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and
integrity of the Group website www.dignityfuneralsplc.co.uk.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and
dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may differ from
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Principal activities and business review
The principal activity of the Group is the provision of
funeral services including funeral directing, crematoria
operation and the marketing and administration of 
pre-arranged funeral plans. The principal activity 
of the Company is that of a holding company. 
The principal activities and key performance indicators 
of the Group are also described on pages 16 to 18 of 
the Financial Review. A review of the development of the
business in 2008, events affecting the Group since the 
end of the ﬁnancial year and likely future developments
are referred to in the Business Review, which is incorporated
into this Directors’ Report by reference. The review of
business activities in the Business Review and Financial
Review are in line with the requirements of the Companies
Act 2006.
Principal risks and uncertainties
Operational and ﬁnancial risks are considered in the
Business Review and the Financial Review.
The Group’s principal operational risks are a signiﬁcant
reduction in the death rate and nationwide adverse
publicity, which could affect the Group’s market share.
However, the proﬁle of deaths has historically followed 
a similar proﬁle to that predicted by the ONS, giving the
Group the ability to plan its business accordingly. Adverse
publicity is addressed by ensuring appropriate policies 
and procedures are in place designed to ensure client
service excellence. 
An assessment of the Group’s exposure to ﬁnancial risks
and a description of how these risks are managed are
included in note 2 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
Share capital
The issued share capital of Dignity plc at 26 December
2008 consists of 63,484,135 Ordinary Shares of 9 pence
each. All the Ordinary Shares carry the same rights and
obligations. There are no other class or type of share in issue.
During the period the Group issued 243,164 Ordinary
Shares of 9 pence each. 242,636 Ordinary Shares of 9
pence each were issued to satisfy Long Term Incentive
Plan share awards vesting in the period and 528 shares
were issued to satisfy options exercised under the Save 
As You Earn Scheme. The Long Term Incentive Plan
awards were made in 2005 and the SAYE options were
granted in 2007.
Dignity_AR08_Front IFC_1-22 tp.qxd 7/4/09 09:26 Page 20 21 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008
A special resolution passed at the last Annual General
Meeting on 6 June 2008 gives Dignity plc the authority 
to purchase up to 3,162,048 Ordinary Shares of 9 pence
each at not less than nominal value and not more than 
5 per cent above the average middle market quotation for
the preceding 5 business days. At the same meeting the
Company was also given authority to allot Ordinary Shares
up to an aggregate nominal value of £1,138,337 of which
up to £284,584 may be for cash. These authorities will
expire at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting
on 5 June 2009. It is the intention of the Directors to seek
renewal of these authorities at that Annual General Meeting.
Results
The results for the period are set out in the Consolidated
Income Statement on page 36. Group proﬁt before tax
amounted to £35.4 million (2007: £30.2 million). 
Dividends
An interim dividend of 3.66 pence per share was paid on
31 October 2008. The Board has proposed a ﬁnal dividend 
of 7.34 pence per share, which, subject to approval at the
Annual General Meeting, will be paid on 26 June 2009 
to shareholders on the register at close of business on 
29 May 2009. This makes a total of 11 pence per share 
for the period.
Payments policy
The Group has no formal code or standard that deals
speciﬁcally with the payment of suppliers. However, the
Group’s policy on the payment of all creditors is to ensure
that the terms of payment as speciﬁed by, and agreed
with, the supplier are not exceeded, provided all trading
terms and conditions have been complied with. The
average creditor payment period for the Group was 31
days (2007: 31 days). The Company has no trade creditors. 
Substantial shareholdings 
As at 10 March 2009, the Company had been notiﬁed of
the following interests of 3 per cent or more of the issued 
share capital:
Key contractual arrangements
The Directors consider there to be one key contractual
arrangement in relation to the supply and maintenance 
of cremators. This company is responsible for supplying
and installing the cremator abatement equipment. If this
company ceased to trade, the Group may have difﬁculties
in installing the necessary equipment by the end of 2012.
Employment policies
During the period the Group has maintained its obligations
to develop and improve arrangements aimed at involving
employees in its affairs. Methods of communication used
include an in-house newsletter, an employee website,
bulletins and management brieﬁngs. This is discussed in
more detail in the Corporate and Social Responsibility
Report on pages 12 to 15. 
Employment policies are designed to provide equal
opportunities irrespective of age, sexuality, colour, ethnic 
or national origin, religion, nationality, sex or marital status.
Full consideration is given to the employment, training and
career development of disabled persons, subject only to
their aptitudes and abilities. The Group endeavours to treat
disabled persons equally with others.
Directors and their interests
Details of the Directors of the Company who served 
during the period are shown in the Report on Directors’
Remuneration on page 26. In accordance with the Articles
of Association, at the Annual General Meeting, Peter
Hindley and Andrew Davies retire as Directors of the
Company and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election
at the Annual General Meeting on 5 June 2009. Steve
Whittern was appointed Finance Director on 29 December
2008 and Ishbel Macpherson and Alan McWalter were
appointed to the Board on 12 January 2009 as 
Non-Executive Directors for a ﬁxed term. All three will seek
election at the Annual General Meeting on 5 June 2009.
During the period, the Company maintained liability
insurance for its Directors and Ofﬁcers. The Directors 
of each of the Company’s subsidiaries, have the beneﬁt 
of an indemnity provision in the Company’s Articles of
Association. The indemnity provision, which is a qualifying
third-party indemnity provision as deﬁned by section 234
of the Companies Act 2006, was in force throughout the
period and is currently in force.

Dignity_AR08_Front IFC_1-22 tp.qxd 7/4/09 09:26 Page 21 The takeover directive
The Group has one class of share capital, Ordinary Shares.
All of the shares rank pari passu. There are no special
control rights in relation to the Group’s shares. The rules
governing the appointment and replacement of Board
members and changes to the Articles of Association accord
with usual English company law provisions. The Board has
authority to purchase its own shares and is seeking renewal
of that power at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting
within the limits set out in the notice of that meeting. There
are no signiﬁcant agreements to which the Group is party
which take effect, alter or terminate in the event of change
of control of the Group.
Health and safety policy
The Group’s operations are designed at all times in such 
a way as to ensure, so far as reasonably practical, the 
health, safety and welfare of all of our employees and all
other persons who may be attending our premises. This is
discussed in the Corporate and Social Responsibility Report
on pages 12 to 15.
Environmental policy
Maintaining the quality of the environment in which we all
live is an important concern for the Group. This is discussed
in the Corporate and Social Responsibility Report on 
pages 12 to 15.
Donations
The Group made charitable donations amounting to 
£0.1 million (2007: £0.1 million) during the period. 
There were no political donations. Further information 
can be found on pages 12 to 14.
Going concern
The Directors have formed a judgment at the time of
approving the ﬁnancial statements that both the Company
and the Group have adequate resources available to continue
operating in the foreseeable future. For this reason, the
going concern basis continues to be adopted in preparing
the ﬁnancial statements.
Post balance sheet events
There have been no post balance sheet events.
Auditors
A resolution for the reappointment of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP will be proposed at the
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

(b) the management report, which is incorporated into the
directors’ report, includes a fair review of the development

DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED
Dignity_AR08_Front IFC_1-22 tp.qxd 7/4/09 09:26 Page 22 This report sets out the remuneration policy operated by the Group in respect of the Executive Directors, together
with disclosures on all Directors’ remuneration. The auditors are required to report on the ‘auditable’ part of this
report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with
the Companies Act 2006.
The Board has reviewed the Group’s compliance with the 2006 Combined Code (‘the Code’) on remuneration related
matters and has followed the Code in the preparation of the report of the Remuneration Committee. It is the opinion
of the Board that the Group complied with all remuneration related aspects of the Code during the period, except
that the annual bonus awarded to the former Chief Executive was pensionable. He was not however a member of the
Group pension scheme and maintained his own personal pension scheme. As a consequence there was no impact on
the Group’s pension scheme.
Unaudited information
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing policy on remuneration for Executive Directors and senior
management and for determining specific remuneration packages for each of the Executive Directors.
Bill Forrester chairs the Remuneration Committee and its other members are James Newman and the newly appointed
independent Non–Executive Directors, Ishbel Macpherson and Alan McWalter. Richard Connell, who retired as Chairman
of the Company and retired from the Board at the end of 2008, served as a member of the Committee during the
year. The Code requires that a Group of the size of Dignity plc has a Remuneration Committee with a minimum of
two members. The Remuneration Committee members have no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders,
in matters to be decided, no potential conflicts of interests arising from cross directorships and no day–to–day
involvement in running the business.
The Chief Executive attends Remuneration Committee meetings when required and the Company Secretary attended
meetings when required as Secretary to the Remuneration Committee. No Executive Director takes part in discussions
relating to their own remuneration and benefits.
The Remuneration Committee is formally constituted with written terms of reference. A copy of the terms of
reference is available for inspection on the Group’s investor website www.dignityfuneralsplc.co.uk. The Committee met
four times during 2008. At those meetings basic salaries of Executive Directors and senior managers were reviewed,
the targets and quantum of annual performance related bonuses for Directors were also agreed, as were options
granted under the Group’s Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). The meetings also approved the payment of the 2007
performance related bonus and the vesting of the shares awarded under the LTIP scheme in 2005. A further meeting
was also held in March 2009 to approve the payment of the performance related bonus for 2008, LTIP awards and
bonus targets for 2009.
In the 2007 Report on Directors’ Remuneration it was noted that in future, following the Group’s out performance
since flotation and subsequent admission to the FTSE 250, the Committee intended to set elements of the Executive
Directors’ Remuneration package by reference to the constituent companies of the bottom half of the FTSE 250. In
2008, the Committee retained the external benefit consultants, Hewitt New Bridge Street, to complete a review of the
Executive Directors’ remuneration. In discussions with the Committee, and in consultation with Hewitt New Bridge Street,
it was decided that a ‘Comparator Group’ would be defined consisting of all companies in the Consumer Goods and
Consumer Services Sector of the FTSE 250 filtered to exclude companies deriving more than 50% of their turnover
from overseas or having a market capitalisation in excess of £1.4 billion. This gave a group of 32 companies with an
average market capitalisation of £628 million at November 2008 as the Comparator Group. At that date Dignity had 
a market capitalisation of £473 million and an enterprise value (including net debt) of £710 million. The bottom half
of the FTSE 250 was also used as a reference point for the benchmarking process.
Remuneration policy
The objective of the remuneration policy is to provide remuneration packages to each Executive Director that will:
• Align rewards with the interests of shareholders;
• Motivate and encourage superior performance;
• Allow the Group to retain the talent needed to execute its business strategy; and
• Enable the Group to be competitive when recruiting appropriately skilled and experienced management.
The Remuneration Committee believes that this policy will retain and develop further the Group’s entrepreneurial
culture, whilst also focusing executive remuneration on performance which the Committee believes will best serve
shareholders’ interests. It is therefore the aim of the Remuneration Committee to encourage and reward superior
performance by Executive Directors with that performance being based on strong financial performance and returns
to shareholders. This is achieved by weighting the overall remuneration package towards achievement of that
performance. Only 31 per cent of each Executive Directors’ total remuneration package (ignoring benefits and pension
contributions) is accounted for by basic salary, assuming a full annual bonus is achieved and a maximum conditional
award under the LTIP is made.
REPORT ON DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
for the 52 week period ended 26 December 2008
23 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008
MAC_RF63831_01 tp 8/4/09 14:32 Page 23 The Remuneration Committee will continue to review all aspects of the policy on an annual basis to ensure that
rewards continue to be in line with the Group’s objectives and shareholders’ interests.
Basic salary
When determining the basic salary of the Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee takes into consideration:
• The levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills, in organisations of
broadly similar size and complexity;
• The performance of the individual Executive Director;
• The individual Executive Director’s experience and responsibilities; and
• Pay and conditions throughout the Group.
No significant changes were made to the Executive Directors’ basic salaries during the period. Changes have been
proposed for 2009, based on the review completed by Hewitt New Bridge Street (see above).
It was clear from Hewitt New Bridge Street’s analysis that the Company’s basic salary levels no longer reflected the
Comparator Group and there was a need to ensure that the Company continues to offer competitive salaries in order
to attract and reward superior performance. The Committee therefore recommended and the Board approved, an
increase in basic salaries to be in line with the lower quartile of the Comparator Group and FTSE 250. Details of the
changes, which were effective from 1 January 2009, are:
2008 2009
Name £’000 £’000
Mike McCollum 275 440
Andrew Davies 200 250
Richard Portman 150 200
Steve Whittern 88 150
Total 713 1,040
Peter Hindley 350 150
The salary reviews also reflect the change in responsibility of Mike McCollum from Finance Director to Chief Executive,
the appointment of Steve Whittern to the Board as Finance Director and Peter Hindley moving from Chief Executive to
Non–Executive Chairman.
Annual performance related bonus
The targets for the year, which are based on the achievement of set earnings per share targets, are reviewed and set
annually by the Committee to ensure that they are appropriate to the current market conditions and remain challenging.
They are ratified by the full Board. The targets are designed to enhance shareholder value.
The maximum bonus attainable for 2008 by Executive Directors is 100 per cent of basic salary. A bonus of 70 per cent
is attainable for meeting the first earnings per share target set by the Committee and a further bonus of 30 per cent
may be earned by achieving a second and more demanding earnings per share target. The increase in underlying
earnings per share during the period was 14 per cent and the bonus percentage earned by the Executive Directors 
in the period was 100 per cent.
No other bonuses of any description were paid in the period to Executive Directors.
No changes have been proposed to the Annual Performance Related Bonus by Hewitt New Bridge Street. This will
continue to be based on demanding earnings per share targets with a maximum bonus equal to 100 per cent of base
salary. The scheme is in line with the market median for the bottom half of the FTSE 250 and the lower quartile of
the Comparator Group.
Share incentives
Shareholders approved the current discretionary share incentive plan, the LTIP , on 31 March 2004 prior to the Company’s
admission to the London Stock Exchange on 8 April 2004. If existing LTIPs were to be amended or if there was a new
LTIP Scheme, approval would be sought from the shareholders.
All Executive Directors and other employees are entitled to be considered for the grant of conditional share awards
under the LTIP . Under the rules, the maximum annual award that can be made to an individual is 125 per cent of
salary. All four Executive Directors serving at the start of the year, were granted conditional share awards during 2008
equivalent to the maximum award. The Committee deemed this award appropriate, as in previous years, mindful of
the need to encourage superior performance from the Executive Directors and ensure that a significant proportion of
their total remuneration is linked to the performance of the Group. This award is in addition to those granted in all
years from 2004 to 2007. Richard Portman, prior to his appointment to the Board, received a conditional share award
in 2006 equal to 100 per cent of his salary. Steve Whittern received an award equal to 100 per cent of his salary in
2006 and awards of 4,000 shares in each of the years 2007 and 2008, prior to his appointment to the Board on 
29 December 2008. Total awards made to the Executive Directors under the scheme are shown on pages 28 and 29.
REPORT ON DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION CONTINUED
for the 52 week period ended 26 December 2008
24 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008
MAC_RF63831_01 tp 8/4/09 14:32 Page 24 Eligible Executives are awarded rights, in the form of nil cost conditional share awards, to acquire a maximum
number of shares at the beginning of a three year period, a proportion of which they will be entitled to receive at the
end of that period depending on the extent to which the performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee
at the time the allocation is made, are satisfied.
The Remuneration Committee selected comparative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) as the performance condition for
LTIP awards as it ensures that the Group outperforms the FTSE 350 Index over the measurement period in delivering
shareholder value, before the Eligible Executives are entitled to receive any of their awards. The constituent
companies of the FTSE 350 Index, at the time the awards are made, were selected as a benchmark as there are no
directly comparable quoted companies in the United Kingdom and the ‘enterprise value’ of the Group (debt plus
equity) also are a comparable value to FTSE 350 companies. The Remuneration Committee will calculate the TSR in
accordance with the rules of the scheme and ratify the calculation prior to the release of any award. Performance
conditions under the LTIP are not subject to re–testing.
The percentage of the conditional share award exercisable or vesting is calculated as follows:
• Ranked in the top quintile: 100 per cent of the total award;
• Ranked at median: 40 per cent of the total award;
• Ranked below median: zero; and
• Ranked between median and top quintile: straight–line apportionment.
In addition and irrespective of the TSR performance target, no award will vest unless, in the opinion of the
Remuneration Committee, the underlying financial performance of the Group has been satisfactory over the
measurement period.
The graph shows the Group’s TSR compared to the FTSE 350. This gives a broad indication of the likelihood of any
conditional award vesting.
On 14 April 2008 the conditional share awards made in 2005 under the LTIP became capable of vesting. The TSR of
the Group over the measurement period was compared to that of the constituent companies of the FTSE 350 at the
time the awards were made. The performance of the Group was found to be in the top quintile. On that basis the
Remuneration Committee, mindful also of the continued strong performance of the Group, recommended that the
entire 2005 share award vest. Shares were issued to Mike McCollum and Andrew Davies on 14 April 2008 and sold 
in their entirety the following day by the Group’s brokers. Peter Hindley’s shares vested to the Trustees of the LTIP ,
Lloyds TSB Offshore Trust Company Limited on 14 April 2008. They were issued to Peter Hindley on 29 August 2008
and sold by the Company’s brokers in two tranches on 4 September 2008 and 11 September 2008.
The total conditional awards held by each Director are shown on pages 28 and 29 in the section of the Remuneration
Committee’s Report that is subject to audit.
In accordance with the ABI guidelines, the Group can issue a maximum of 10 per cent of its issued share capital in 
a rolling ten year period to employees under all share plans. In addition, of this 10 per cent, the Company can only
issue 5 per cent to satisfy awards under discretionary or executive plans. At the period end, conditional awards under
the LTIP Scheme to Executive Directors and senior managers amount to 1.19 per cent of the current issued share
capital. If the awards in 2004 and 2005, that have vested, are included, that percentage is 2.15 per cent. The total,
including SAYE options granted in both the 2004 and 2007 Schemes, is 3.63 per cent.

MAC_RF63831_01 tp 8/4/09 14:32 Page 25 The Committee, having noted comments from some Institutional Shareholders and the observations made in the
report from Hewitt New Bridge Street, recommended to the Board of Directors that the following amendments are
made to the current discretionary share incentive plan (the ‘LTIP’) when it is to be readopted at the Annual General
Meeting on 5 June 2009:
(i) The percentage of shares exercisable or vesting for a median ranking will be reduced to 25 per cent from 40 per cent;
(ii) A ranking of performance in the top quartile rather than the top quintile will receive a 100 per cent award of the
shares exercisable or vesting; and
(iii) The time period over which the share price is considered for calculating total shareholder return will be increased
from an average over a 3 day period to an average of 28 days.
Pensions
The Group provided Peter Hindley with a contribution to his personal pension plan of 10 per cent of his salary and
bonus payable during 2008. As this is a personal pension plan, any pension contributions paid on a bonus do not
affect the Group’s pension scheme. Such payments ceased when he became Non–Executive Chairman at the start of
2009. Mike McCollum and Richard Portman are members of the Group’s pension scheme into which the Group
contributed 10.5 per cent of salary (details are set out within the audited section of this report on pages 27 and 28).
The Group makes no pension contributions for Andrew Davies or Steve Whittern. No Non–Executive Directors receive
any pension contributions. Hewitt New Bridge Street have not proposed any changes to the pension arrangements of
Executive Directors.
Benefits in kind
Benefits included the following elements: provision of a company car or allowance; fuel; landline telephone at each
Executive Director’s home residence; and a mobile telephone; together with a pre–arranged funeral plan in accordance
with any scheme established by the Group in respect of the funeral of the Executive Director or his wife. All Executive
Directors received all of their benefits in kind. As part of their review, Hewitt New Bridge Street, have not proposed
any changes to the benefits provided to Executive Directors.
Non–Executive Directors’ fees
The Board determines the fees of the Non–Executive Directors. It is based upon recommendations from the Chairman
and Chief Executive (or, in the case of the Chairman, based on recommendations from the Remuneration Committee
and the Chief Executive). The level of fees of the Non–Executive Directors reflects the time commitment and
responsibility of their respective roles. Their fees are set by reference to the constituent companies of the bottom 
half of the FTSE 250.
Service contracts
Details of the service contracts with all Executive Directors and letters of appointment with Non–Executive Directors
are as follows:
Unexpired term of contract
Name Contract date Notice period or letter of approval
Mike McCollum 1 April 2004 12 months Rolling Contract
Andrew Davies 1 April 2004 12 months Rolling Contract
Richard Portman 1 November 2006 12 months Rolling Contract
Steve Whittern 1 January 2009 12 months Rolling Contract
Peter Hindley 1 January 2009 3 months 24 months
James Newman 31 March 2008 3 months 15 months
Bill Forrester 31 March 2008 3 months 15 months
Ishbel Macpherson 12 January 2009 3 months 23 months
Alan McWalter 12 January 2009 3 months 23 months
There are no special provisions in service contracts of employees or Directors relating to cessation of employment or
change of control. The policy on termination is that the Group does not make payments beyond its contractual
obligations, which do not include any payment from the takeover or liquidation of the Group. In addition, the
Remuneration Committee ensures that there have been no unjustified payments for failure.
Under the Company’s Articles of Association, one third of the Directors are required to submit themselves for
re–election every year.
No Executive Directors hold a Non–Executive position with any other company. However, the Group encourages one

On behalf of the Board
Bill Forrester
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
12 March 2009
29 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008
MAC_RF63831_01 tp 8/4/09 14:32 Page 29 Introduction
The Board is committed to high standards of corporate governance in order to achieve its objectives and meet the
necessary standards of accountability and integrity. In accordance with the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority Dignity plc is required to state whether it has complied with the relevant provisions set out in Section 1 of
the 2006 Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the Code) and, where the provisions have not been complied
with, to provide an explanation. Dignity plc is also required to explain how it has applied the principles set out in the
Code. The following paragraphs, together with the Audit Committee Report on pages 32 and 33 and the Report on
Directors’ Remuneration on pages 23 to 29 provide a description of how the main and supporting principles of the
Code have been applied within Dignity plc during 2008.
The Group has complied with all provisions of the Code during 2008, with the exception of:
• The annual bonus awarded to Peter Hindley, formerly the Chief Executive and now the Non–Executive Chairman, was
pensionable. He is, however, not a member of the Group pension scheme and maintains his own personal pension
scheme. As a consequence there is no impact on the Group pension schemes (Code schedule A, note 6).
Following the period end, on 29 December 2008 Peter Hindley was appointed Chairman upon relinquishing his
responsibilities as Chief Executive and the retirement of the then Chairman Richard Connell. This is contrary to
provision A.2.2. of the Code. However, as suggested by the Code, this appointment was only made after consultation
with major shareholders of the Group. The Board felt it was important to retain the skills and knowledge of Peter
Hindley, given he is both a prominent and influential figure in the funeral industry. Peter Hindley is not regarded as
independent under provision A.3.1. of the Code.
Narrative statement
The Code establishes nine principles of good governance, which are split into four areas as outlined below:
1. The Board
The Group is controlled through the Board of Directors that meets regularly throughout the year. Informal meetings
are held between individual Directors as required. The Board has adopted a formal schedule of matters reserved to it
which was formerly reviewed and updated in January 2009.
The Board is responsible for:
• Overall management of the Group;
• Setting and reviewing the strategy of the Group;
• Approval of major capital expenditure and acquisition projects, and consideration of significant financial matters;
• Monitoring the exposure to key business risks; and
• Setting annual budgets and reviewing progress towards achievement of these budgets.
All Directors are provided with the necessary papers in advance of the meetings to permit them to make informed
decisions at those meetings. The Board also considers employee issues and key appointments, including the role of
Company Secretary.
At the start of 2008, the Board comprised four Executive Directors, two Non–Executive Directors and the Non–Executive
Chairman. Following the Group’s admission to the FTSE 350, the Group embarked on a process of identifying a
further two non–executives during 2008, which led to the appointment of Ishbel Macpherson and Alan McWalter on
12 January 2009, thus ensuring compliance with the Code and to provide additional experience and expertise to the
Board. There are now the same number of independent Non–Executive Directors and Executive Directors. The Board
considers that four Executive Directors are sufficient to manage a Company of this size and organisational structure.
There is a clear division of responsibility between the Non–Executive Chairman and the Chief Executive so as to give
no individual, unfettered powers of decision making. The Chairman is responsible for:
• Ensuring the Board functions in all aspects of its role;
• Facilitating the effective contribution of the Non–Executive Directors and ensuring constructive relations between
Executive and Non–Executive Directors;
• Setting the agenda so all relevant issues are discussed; and
• Ensuring effective communication with stakeholders and acting as the public face of the Group.
The Chief Executive is responsible for:
• Operational management and control of the Group on a day–to–day basis;
• Formulating and proposing strategy to the Board; and
• Implementing the strategy and policies adopted by the Board.
DIRECTORS’ STATEMENT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
30 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008
MAC_RF63831_01 tp 8/4/09 14:32 Page 30 There are four independent Non–Executive Directors, Bill Forrester, Ishbel Macpherson, Alan McWalter, and James
Newman. James Newman is the appointed Senior Independent Director of the Group. Biographical details, including
committee membership, appear on page 19. The Chairman and the Non–Executive Directors have formally confirmed
to the Board, mindful of their other commitments they have, that they will have sufficient time to devote to their
responsibilities as Directors of the Group.
Bill Forrester, Ishbel Macpherson, Alan McWalter, and James Newman are independent of management, as defined by
the Code.
All Directors are able to take independent professional advice on the furtherance of their duties if necessary. They also
have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary, who is also the Corporate Services Director and,
where it is considered appropriate and necessary, training is made available to Directors. All Directors receive annual
training and updates on the duties and responsibilities of being a Director of a listed company. This covers legal,
accounting and tax matters as required. The Company maintains appropriate insurance cover in respect of any legal
action against its Directors. The level of cover is currently £50 million.
All Directors, in accordance with the Code, submit themselves for re–election at least once every three years. In
addition any Director appointed in the year must submit himself or herself for election at the next Annual General
Meeting. As a consequence Steve Whittern, Ishbel Macpherson and Alan McWalter will be submitted for election at the
forthcoming Annual General Meeting in June 2009.
The Board has established a Remuneration Committee, an Audit Committee and a Nomination Committee, all of which
operate within defined terms of reference. The specific terms of reference for all the Committees may be obtained
from the Company Secretary at the Registered Office and they are also available for inspection on the Group’s investor
website www.dignityfuneralsplc.co.uk. All Committees are provided with sufficient resources to undertake their duties.
Those attending and the frequency of Board and Committee meetings held during the year was as follows:
Audit Remuneration Nomination
Main Board(i) Committee Committee Committee
Number of meetings 7 3 4 3
Richard Connell 7 2 4 3
Andrew Davies 7 0 0 0

Mike McCollum 6 3(ii) 00

Richard Portman 7 3(iii) 3(iii) 2(iii)
Steve Whittern 0 3(iv) 00
(i) Only full Board meetings have been included in the attendance analysis. 18 further meetings were held with a quorum of Directors to approve
announcements, documents or the issue of shares under the LTIP and SAYE.
(ii) In attendance by invitation of the respective Committee.
(iii) Richard Portman attended Committee meetings in his capacity as Company Secretary.
(iv) Steve Whittern attended the Audit Committee in his previous capacity as Financial Controller.
When Directors are unable to attend a meeting, they are advised of the matters to be discussed and given an
opportunity to make their views known to the Chairman prior to the meeting. A process exists whereby such views will
be included in the minutes of the meeting if necessary.
A process exists whereby the Non–Executive Directors can meet without the Executive Directors being present.
Three such meetings were held during 2008.
During the year the Board again undertook a formal and rigorous evaluation of its own performance and that of its
Committees by way of the issue of a detailed questionnaire to all Directors. This was then followed by a detailed review
of the responses, by the Directors, and identification of any actions arising. The Non–Executive Directors, led by the
Senior Independent Director, are responsible for the performance evaluation of the Chairman. The Board was satisfied
that its performance and that of its individual Directors and Committees was of the appropriate standard. Full
evaluations will be completed again during 2009.
The Company Secretary, Richard Portman, is responsible for the preparation and distribution of all agendas, minutes
and related Board and Committee papers. As Corporate Services Director, he attends the Board meetings in his
capacity as a Director of the Company but also acts as Secretary to those meetings. He attends the Committee
meetings in his capacity as Company Secretary and also as Secretary of those Committees when requested to do so
by the Chairman of that Committee. He is also responsible for ensuring all Board procedures are followed and for
advising the Board on corporate governance matters.
31 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008
MAC_RF63831_01 tp 8/4/09 14:32 Page 31 2. Directors’ remuneration
The Remuneration Committee, chaired by Bill Forrester, determines and agrees with the Board, within formal terms of
reference, the framework and policy of Directors’ and senior management’s remuneration and its cost to the Group.
The Committee met four times during 2008. The Committee measures the performance of the Executive Directors as
a prelude to recommending and approving their annual remuneration, bonus awards and awards of share options to
the Board for final determination.
The Committee members during 2008 were the independent Non–Executive Directors, Bill Forrester and James Newman
and the former Chairman of the Board, Richard Connell. The two new independent Non–Executive Directors have been
appointed to serve on this Committee thus ensuring the Committee is fully independent. The Code requires a Committee
of at least two members. The Chief Executive, also attends the meetings by invitation of the Committee. No Director
or senior manager is involved in any decisions with regard to their own remuneration.
The Executive Directors recommend the remuneration of Non–Executive Directors and recommendations take into
account role, responsibilities and time commitment in the fulfilment of those duties. The Non–Executive Directors are
not eligible for pensions and do not participate in the Group’s bonus or share schemes. The Committee has considered
the remuneration of senior management immediately below Board level during the year. It concluded that their
remuneration was commensurate with their various duties and in line with market rates.
3. Accountability and audit 
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee in 2008 comprised the two independent Non–Executive Directors and the former Chairman of the
Board, Richard Connell. James Newman, who is a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales,
is considered to have recent and relevant financial experience to chair this Committee. The two new independent
Non–Executive Directors have been appointed to serve on this Committee thus ensuring the Committee is fully independent.
Its membership is restricted to Non–Executive Directors. The Committee has specific written terms of reference that
explain its authority and duties. The Committee has met three times during 2008 and again in March 2009. The external
auditors, the Chief Executive and the Finance Director have attended all the meetings by invitation. The external auditors
and the internal audit function also have the right to discrete private audiences with the Audit Committee or its Chairman
if either party requires or requests them. Two such meetings were held during 2008 between the Chairman and the
external auditors. The new Chairman of the Board is not a member of the Audit Committee.
The Committee reviews the Group’s Annual Report and Interim Report before submission to the Board. It keeps under
review the Group’s accounting policies, financial controls and internal control and risk management systems. It also
evaluates, on a regular basis, the work of the internal audit function and reviews its effectiveness. The Committee also
reviews matters brought to its attention both internally and by the external auditors. The Committee reports all
findings to the Board.
A formal process, established via the Audit Committee, exists by which employees of the Group may, in confidence,
raise concerns about possible improprieties in financial reporting or other matters. This ensures arrangements are in
place for the proportionate and independent investigation of such matters and appropriate follow–up action.
The Committee also keeps under review the relationship with the external auditors, including their terms of
engagement, independence, objectivity and effectiveness. The Committee reviews the remuneration received by the
external auditors for non–audit work, which ongoing principally relates to taxation advice. Where considered necessary
the Committee approves such work. The external auditors have confirmed their audit independence in writing to the
Committee. The Committee also retains responsibility for the appointment and removal of the external auditors.
Reporting responsibilities
The Board is required to present a balanced and understandable assessment of the Group’s position and prospects,
not only in the Directors’ Report and Accounts but also in the Chairman’s Statement (page 4), the Chief Executive’s
Overview (page 5), the Business Review (pages 6 to 10), the Financial Review (pages 16 to 18), Interim Reports,
Interim Management Statements and in price sensitive announcements. The Group will release its Annual Information
Update by 3 April 2009. A summary of the Directors’ responsibilities for the financial statements is set out on 
page 20.
Going concern
The Directors regularly receive and review management accounts, cash balances, forecasts and the annual budget.
After careful consideration, and mindful of the current market conditions, the Directors confirm they are satisfied that
the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The Directors formally
considered this matter at the Board meeting held on 5 March 2009. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going
concern basis for preparing the accounts.
Internal control
The Board recognises it is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control, which is designed to manage rather
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can provide only reasonable, and not absolute,
assurance against material misstatement or loss. A formal process of identifying, evaluating and managing the
DIRECTORS’ STATEMENT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED
32 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008
MAC_RF63831_01 tp 8/4/09 14:32 Page 32 significant risks faced by the Group exists. This process was in place at the date of approval of the Annual Report and
is, in accordance with Turnbull guidance (as revised in 2005), within the Code.
Internal controls are formally reviewed on an ongoing basis. Internal Audit completes a programme of work each year
that provides assurance that the internal controls they have tested are working effectively and also propose improvements
where appropriate and necessary. Coupled with this, the bi–annual review of the Risk Register provides a further formal
review mechanism for considering and reviewing internal controls. All such work is reported to and monitored by the
Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee on behalf of the Board, as part of an ongoing process, has formally reviewed and continues to
keep under review the effectiveness of the Group’s systems of internal controls, including financial, operational and
compliance controls and risk management systems. The Audit Committee reviews risk management annually and
receives reports from executive management regarding weaknesses in internal control, any losses arising out of
weaknesses in internal control and progress in implementing revised procedures to improve and enhance internal
control. There have been no reports of system weaknesses that have resulted or would have resulted in a material
misstatement or loss.
The key procedures, which operated throughout the period, are as follows:
• Financial reporting – The Group has a comprehensive system of internal budgeting and forecasting. Monthly actual
results analysed by operating division are reported to the Board and significant variances to budget are investigated
with revised forecasts prepared as necessary. Operational management receives comprehensive management
accounts covering their areas of responsibility;
• Financial controls – The Executive Directors have defined appropriate and necessary financial controls and procedures
to be employed by operational management. Key controls over major business risks include reviews against budgets
and forecasts, review against key performance indicators and exception reporting;
• Quality and integrity of personnel – One of the Group’s core values is integrity. This is regarded as vital to the
maintenance of the Group’s system of internal financial control. The Directors have put in place an organisation
structure appropriate to the size and complexity of the Group with defined lines of responsibility and delegation of
authority where the Board considers it necessary;
• Internal audit – The Group has a dedicated Internal Audit team, which reports to the Chief Executive. It coordinates
the completion of self–assessment reports by operational management that assists in highlighting areas of control
weakness or exposure. Internal audit reviews are completed on such areas together with selected areas of the head
office function and any area where an Executive Director requests a review. During 2008 (as in 2007), there were
quarterly meetings between the Head of Internal Audit, the Executive Directors and the Financial Controller to
formally review and discuss Internal Audit’s work programme and findings. In addition, regular meetings between
Internal Audit and the external auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , were held during the year to discuss and plan
audit work and to ensure a coordinated approach. The Head of Internal Audit reports to the Audit Committee at
every meeting of that Committee;
• Procedures – The Group has established and documented processes and procedures covering most parts of its
operations, both client facing and in support departments. These provide clear guidance on the correct or most
appropriate course of action in various circumstances. Procedures are supplemented by training where needs have
been identified. Both Internal Audit and a comprehensive management structure monitor the adherence to such
processes and procedures. A comprehensive review of procedures and training commenced during 2008 and will
continue during 2009; and 
• Risk assessment – Management has responsibility for the identification and evaluation of significant risks that might
arise in their area of responsibility together with the design of suitable internal controls. The Executive Directors
and the wider management team continually assess the risks. A Risk Register is maintained, which is formally
presented to and reviewed by the Audit Committee twice a year.
Nomination Committee
Richard Connell, the former Chairman, chaired the Nomination Committee during 2008, which met on three
occasions during the year. The other members of the Committee during the year were James Newman and Bill
Forrester, two of the Non–Executive Directors. The two new independent Non–Executive Directors have also been
appointed to serve on this Committee. Peter Hindley, the newly appointed Non–Executive Chairman, has been
appointed Chairman of this Committee in 2009.
The Committee regularly reviews and makes recommendations to the Board on the structure, size and composition 
of the Board and the senior management team. It is also responsible for identifying and nominating for the approval
of the Board, replacement or additional Directors and members of the senior management team. The Committee
formally considers succession planning annually under the written terms of reference. During 2008, after careful
consideration, it proposed to the full Board that Mike McCollum be promoted from Finance Director to Chief Executive
and Steve Whittern be appointed Finance Director.
33 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008
MAC_RF63831_01 tp 8/4/09 14:32 Page 33 4. Relations with shareholders
The Group encourages two–way communication with both its institutional and private shareholders and responds
promptly to any queries received either verbally or in writing.
The Chief Executive and Finance Director have regular meetings with institutional investors, fund managers and
analysts to discuss information made public by the Group. Where appropriate or if requested, such meetings could
include either or both of the Chairman and the Senior Independent Director or be without any Executive Directors
present. The Chairman discusses governance and strategy matters with the major shareholders. During 2008 the
Chairman, the Chief Executive and, when required the Senior Independent Director, consulted with the Group’s major
shareholders regarding the appointment of Peter Hindley as Chairman and the promotion of Mike McCollum to
Chief Executive from Finance Director.
The Group has and will arrange visits to its facilities, if requested by a shareholder, where it will not disrupt normal
operational activity.
Each year every shareholder receives a full Annual Report and Accounts and an Interim Report at the half year.
The Group has a separate investor relations website, www.dignityfuneralsplc.co.uk, upon which users can access the
latest financial and corporate news and information. The Company Secretary is also available to answer general
investor queries.
The Board regards the Annual General Meeting as an opportunity to communicate directly with all shareholders.
At least 20 working days notice will be given of the Annual General Meeting at which all Directors and Committee
Chairmen plan to be present and available to answer questions.

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Dignity plc for the 52 week period ended 26 December 2008 which
comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the
Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense and the related notes. These consolidated financial statements
have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Dignity plc for the 52 week period ended
26 December 2008 and on the information in the Report on Directors’ Remuneration that is described as having been audited.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the consolidated financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the consolidated financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been
prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985
and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any
other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior
consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the
consolidated financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of
the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent
with the consolidated financial statements. The information given in the Directors’ Report includes that specific information
presented in the Business Review and Financial Review that is cross referred from the Business Review section of the
Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our
audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Directors’ Statement on Corporate Governance reflects the company’s compliance with the nine provisions
of the Combined Code (2006) specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if
it does not. We are not required to consider whether the board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or
form an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited consolidated
financial statements. The other information comprises the Directors’ Report, the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s
Overview, the Business Review, the Financial Review, the Corporate and Social Responsibility Report, the unaudited section of
the Report on Directors’ Remuneration, the Directors’ Statement on Corporate Governance and all of the other information
listed on the contents page. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements
or material inconsistencies with the consolidated financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the
directors in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate
to the group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the consolidated financial statements are free
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated
the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the consolidated financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• The consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European
Union, of the state of the group’s affairs as at 26 December 2008 and of its profit and cash flows for the 52 week period
then ended;
• The consolidated financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article
4 of the IAS Regulation; and
• The information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements.

CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOW STATEMENT
for the 52 week period ended 26 December 2008
MAC_RF63831_01 tp 8/4/09 14:32 Page 38 1 Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all periods presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
European law requires that the Group’s consolidated financial statements for the 52 week period ended 26 December
2008 are prepared in accordance with all applicable International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’), as adopted
by the European Union. These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, International Financial
Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) interpretations (as issued by the International Accounting Standards
Board) and those parts of the Companies Act 1985/2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historic cost convention, as modified by the
revaluation of land and buildings, share–based payments, pensions, and financial assets and liabilities at fair value
through the income statement.
Preparation of financial statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. This will
also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Basis of consolidation
The financial statements are presented in the form of Group financial statements. The Group financial statements
consolidate the accounts of the Company and the entities controlled by the Company (including all of its subsidiary
entities) after eliminating internal transactions. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the
financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain economic benefits from its activities.
The Group owns a 50 per cent shareholding in Kenyon Repatriations Limited (formerly K C H Repatriations Limited).
The financial results are excluded from the Group, as the Directors do not exercise significant influence over the
operating and financial policies of Kenyon Repatriations Limited. All transactions with Kenyon Repatriations Limited
are at market value on an arms length basis.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items, by their nature, are not indicative of the underlying operating performance of the Group.
Exceptional items are material to the results for the period and are of a non–recurring nature and are therefore
presented separately.
Pre–arranged funeral plan trusts
The three pre–arranged funeral plan trusts were not consolidated during the period as they were not controlled by the
Group. Specifically, Article 60 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) order 2001 requires
a majority of the managing trustees to be independent of the Group. Furthermore, the Group did not direct their
financial and operating policies, nor did it have substantially all of the risks and rewards of their ownership.
Acquisition or disposal of subsidiary undertakings
Results of subsidiary undertakings acquired during the period are included from the effective date of control using
the acquisition method of accounting. The separable net assets, both tangible and intangible, of newly acquired
subsidiary undertakings are incorporated into the financial statements on the basis of the fair value to the Group as
at the effective date of control.
Revenue
Revenue from funeral operations comprises the amount recoverable from customers for the provision of funerals, income
from crematoria and other services, to the extent that those services have been performed or the goods supplied.
Income from memorial sales is recognised at the point of sale, to the extent that the goods have been supplied.
Costs of maintaining memorials are recognised as incurred.
The accounting policies for recognising turnover for pre–arranged funeral plans are stated below.
The Group pays certain disbursements such as crematoria fees, burial plots, ministers’ fees and doctors’ fees on
behalf of its clients. These amounts are recovered as part of the invoicing process. However, these amounts are not
included within net revenues as they are simply passed on to the customer at cost.
The Group views the United Kingdom as one geographical segment, given each local business exhibits similar long
term characteristics.
All amounts are exclusive of VAT .

MAC_RF63831_01 tp 8/4/09 14:32 Page 39 1 Accounting policies (continued)
Pre–arranged funeral plans
Trust plans
The Group markets and sells pre–arranged funeral plans, monies received from selling funeral plans being held and
controlled by independent pre–arranged funeral plan trusts (‘the Trusts’). The responsibility for the ultimate performance
of funerals is allocated to funeral directors, who are selected by the beneficiary of the plan and some of whom are
not owned by the Group.
The Group receives monies from the Trusts in respect of the following transactions:
• A marketing and administration fee in respect of each plan sold. The marketing element is refundable in the event
that the plan is subsequently cancelled. A provision is made for cancellations, where material, to cover the estimated
marketing element refundable to the Trusts. Marketing and administration fees are included in Group revenue when
the related plan is sold; and
• Further contributions are also received from the Trusts in return for the provision of general ongoing administrative
services supplied to the Trusts. These contributions are included in Group revenue for the period to which they relate.
All costs in respect of the marketing and administration of the pre–arranged funeral plans are expensed in the Group
income statement as incurred.
From time to time, the Group receives monies from certain of the Trusts, in line with the relevant Trust’s deed, which
have been assessed by the trustees as not required to ensure the Trust has sufficient assets to meet its future liabilities
in respect of current members (‘Recoveries’). All Recoveries are recognised as other operating income in the period in
which the trustees approve their payment.
The Group makes payments on behalf of the Trusts relating to the ongoing overheads of the Trusts, refunds to members
of the Trusts in event of cancellation, and the payments made to funeral directors when the funeral is ultimately
performed. All such payments are reimbursed in full by the Trusts on demand, in accordance with the terms of the
relevant Trust’s deed.
Neither the sales value of plans nor the costs of providing funerals are recognised in the financial statements of the
Group when a pre–arranged funeral plan is sold.
Each Dignity marketing company contractually guarantees with the customer of a pre–arranged funeral plan that 
(i) if the customer chooses to cancel their selected funeral plan, a full refund will be made to the customer of all
monies paid in respect thereof (less in certain cases an administration fee payable to the relevant Dignity marketing
company); (ii) the funeral director’s services (as selected by the customer) will be provided regardless of price rises 
in the future; and (iii) for certain plans sold, specific disbursements will be provided regardless of price rises in 
the future.
Insurance plans
Previously marketed propositions
The Group is the named beneficiary on a number of life assurance products sold by an insurance company in
consideration for which the Group has committed to performing the funeral (including some disbursements) of the
plan holder at no further charge. Marketing of these policies has now ceased.
In the event of death of the policyholder, the Group makes an agreed payment to the nominated funeral director and
a debtor is recognised. At this time a commission fee is recognised as turnover. All monies are reclaimed in full from
the life insurance company.
Actively marketed propositions
The Group is the named beneficiary on a number of life assurance products sold by third party insurance companies,
in consideration for which the Group has committed to performing the funeral (including some disbursements) of the
plan holder at no further charge.
A commission is paid when the policy is charged to the Group. As this commission is fully refundable if the Group
does not perform the funeral for any reason, it is carried as a debtor and expensed when the funeral is performed.
Share–based payments
The Group issues equity settled share–based payments to certain employees. A fair value for the equity settled share
awards is measured at the date of grant. Management measures the fair value using the valuation technique that they
consider to be the most appropriate to value each class of award, which include Black–Scholes calculations and
Monte Carlo simulations. The valuations take into account factors such as non–transferability, exercise restrictions and
behavioural considerations.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
for the 52 week period ended 26 December 2008
MAC_RF63831_01 tp 8/4/09 14:32 Page 40 An expense is recognised to spread the fair value of each award over the vesting period on a straight–line basis, after
allowing for an estimate of the share awards that will eventually vest. The estimate of the level of vesting is reviewed
at least annually, with any impact on the cumulative charge being recognised immediately.
Earnings per Ordinary Share
Basic Earnings per Ordinary Share (‘EPS’) is calculated by dividing the profit on ordinary activities after taxation by
the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing profit on
ordinary activities after taxation by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period increased by
the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares (primarily share options). Underlying Earnings per Ordinary Share
is calculated by dividing the underlying profit after tax by the weighted average number of shares in issue during
the period.
Intangible assets – goodwill
Goodwill, which represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration for subsidiaries and other businesses over
the fair values of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed, is capitalised and stated at historical cost less
provisions for impairment.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The business and subsidiaries
acquired are generally combined with existing operations in the year of acquisition, or the year thereafter and are
therefore only considered to be separate cash–generating units during this time.
Intangible assets – trade names 
Intangible trade names are recognised as assets at the fair value of the consideration paid to acquire them and are
carried at historical cost less provisions for amortisation and impairment. When acquired as part of a business
combination the fair value is calculated by reference to the estimated incremental cash flows expected to arise by
virtue of the trade name being well–established.
Amortisation is provided from the date of acquisition so as to write–off the asset on a straight–line basis over the term
of its useful life. Where there are indicators that a trade name has an indefinite life then these assets are not amortised
but are subject to annual impairment reviews. The factors that indicate an indefinite life of trade names acquired
include the fact that the Group is a significant operator in a well–established market with inelastic demand, the
conservative nature of the UK funeral industry that acts as a barrier to entry for new trade names, and the Group’s
track record for actively monitoring and relocating trade names to combat shifting demographics. In addition, when
allocating a useful life to acquired trade names, the following matters are considered:
• The strength of the trade name in its local environment which is assessed by reference to relative market share and
anticipated profitability;
• The likelihood that market based factors could truncate a trade name’s life such as competition and shifting
demographics and the Group’s ability to combat these;
• The length of time, prior to acquisition, for which trade has been conducted under the name acquired; and
• The likely support the Group will give to the name in its local environment through marketing and promotion,
maintaining community awareness etc.
The useful lives of all capitalised trade names are considered to be indefinite and are reviewed on an annual basis.
Intangible assets – non–compete contracts
Non–compete contracts arising from business combinations are capitalised at the fair value, which is calculated as the
present value of any consideration paid discounted at the Group’s cost of capital.
All costs are amortised over the term of the relevant agreement on a straight–line basis.
Intangible assets – software
Where computer software is not an integral part of a related item of computer hardware, the software is treated as an
intangible asset. Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of costs incurred to acquire and
bring into use the specific software.
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s development of computer systems (including web–sites)
is recognised if and only if the costs are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software
products, controlled by the Group and it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group. All other
costs incurred in research or development are expensed as incurred. Capitalised costs will include, where appropriate,
directly attributable payroll costs and a portion of direct overheads. Costs recognised as assets are amortised over
their estimated useful lives (three to eight years).

Intangible assets – use of third party brand
On 8 January 2007, the Group acquired the remaining 25 per cent voting share capital of Advance Planning Limited
for consideration of £2.0 million. As part of this arrangement, the Group obtained a 10–year marketing commitment
from Age Concern Enterprises Limited, the previous minority shareholder, giving rights to use the Age Concern brand
for the next ten years. The value of this right has been recognised as a separate intangible asset.
This asset is being amortised over twenty years on a straight–line basis, recognising that each year’s additional
marketing activity generates incremental revenues and profits to the Group for at least the following twenty years.
Investment property
Assets are recorded in the balance sheet at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Costs include, where appropriate, cost of acquiring the property and costs incurred in bringing each asset to its present
condition. Depreciation is charged over the expected useful lives using the straight–line method. Valuations are
performed internally on an annual basis. An independent external valuation will be obtained every five years.
Property, plant and equipment 
Assets are recorded in the balance sheet at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Cost includes, where appropriate, directly attributable costs incurred in bringing each asset to its present location and
condition.
Depreciation is charged (excluding freehold land and assets in the course of construction) so as to write off the cost
of assets to their residual value, over their expected useful lives using the straight–line method. The bases and annual
depreciation rates in use for the various classes of assets are as follows:
Freehold and long leasehold buildings 2% – 10% 
Short leasehold buildings Over term of lease
Motor vehicles 11% – 20%
Computers 20% 
Other plant and equipment 5% – 33% 
Fixtures and fittings 15%
Freehold land is not depreciated on the basis that land has an unlimited life. Where the historical cost of land and
buildings cannot be split, the Directors have estimated that the historical cost attributable to land is one third of the
original cost of acquiring the land and buildings. This estimate is regularly reviewed.
Major renovations of the Group’s trading premises and crematory re–linings are depreciated over the remaining life of
the related asset or to the estimated date of the next major renovation or cremator re–lining, whichever is sooner.
Asset lives and residual values for each class of asset are reviewed annually.
Repairs and renewals
All repairs and renewals are charged to the income statement unless they represent an enhancement to the
original asset.
Property, plant and equipment held under leases
When assets are financed by leasing agreements, where the risks and rewards are substantially transferred to the
Group, the assets are treated as if they had been purchased outright and the corresponding liability to the lessor is
included as an obligation under finance leases. Depreciation on leased assets is charged to the income statement on
the same basis as owned assets. Leasing payments are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements and the
interest is charged to the income statement so as to achieve a constant rate on the outstanding lease obligation.
All other leases are ‘operating leases’ and the relevant annual rentals are charged to the income statement.
Impairment of assets
The carrying values of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment in periods
where events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Assets that have 
an indefinite useful life (e.g. goodwill) are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Where an asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable
amount of the cash–generating unit to which the asset belongs. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs
to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future discounted cash flows of the cash–generating
unit are estimated, based on latest budgets for the following year and an annual growth rate of UK GDP in subsequent
years. These cash flows are discounted at rates that management estimate to be the risk affected average cost of capital
for the particular segment and compared to the carrying value of the relevant asset. Any impairment in the value of an
asset below its carrying value is charged to the income statement within operating profit. A reversal of an impairment
loss is recognised in the income statement to the extent that the original loss was recognised.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
for the 52 week period ended 26 December 2008
MAC_RF63831_01 tp 8/4/09 14:32 Page 42 Inventories
Inventories, which comprise funeral supplies and monumental masonry, are stated at the lower of cost and fair value
less costs to sell. Cost includes all directly attributable costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location
and condition. Fair value less costs to sell is based on estimated selling price less any further costs expected to be
incurred in completion and sale.
Taxation
The tax charge for the period includes the charge for tax currently payable and deferred tax. The current tax charge
represents the estimated amount due that arises from the operations of the Group in the period and after making
adjustments to estimates in respect of prior years.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, except where the
temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of
other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised where the carrying value of an asset is greater than its associated tax basis or
where the carrying value of a liability is less than its associated tax basis. Deferred tax is provided for any differences
that exist between the tax base and accounting base of intangibles arising from a business combination that does not
involve the acquisition of a subsidiary.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available
evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future
reversal of the deductible temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are
expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted, by the balance
sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a non–discounted basis.
Pensions
The cost of defined contribution retirement schemes is charged as an expense as the costs become payable.
Any difference between the payments and the charge is recognised as a short term asset or liability.
For defined benefit retirement schemes, the cost of providing the benefits is determined using the projected unit
credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent the benefits are vested, and otherwise are amortised on a
straight line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. The current service cost and the recognised
element of any past service cost are presented within operating profit. The expected return on plan assets less the
interest arising on the pension liabilities is presented within net finance charges. Actuarial gains and losses are
recognised in full in the period in which they occur, outside of the income statement and presented in the
consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.
The expected return on plan assets reflects the estimate made by management of the long term yields that will arise
from the specific assets held within the pension plan. The retirement benefit net asset recognised in the balance sheet
represents the fair value of any relevant scheme assets net of the present value of the defined benefit obligation as
adjusted for unrecognised past service cost. The discount rate applied in arriving at the present value represents
yields on high quality corporate bonds in a similar economic environment with lives similar to the maturity of the
pension liabilities.
The rate of return is determined by identifying an appropriate rate of return for each class of asset held in conjunction
with the Group’s professional advisor.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Company or the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result
of a past event, where it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and
where a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions (other than deferred tax) are discounted where the present value of the provision is materially different to
the undiscounted value. The unwinding of discounts is included within net interest payable and similar charges.

Dividends
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the
period in which they are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recorded in the financial
statements when paid.
Foreign currency 
Foreign currency transactions recognised in the income statement are translated into Sterling at the exchange rate 
on the date the transaction took place.
Financial instruments 
Borrowings
All borrowings are stated at the fair value of consideration received after deduction of transaction costs. The transaction
costs and interest payable on debt finance are charged to the income statement, as finance costs, on a constant–yield
basis over the term of the borrowings, or over a shorter period where it is more likely than not that the lender will
require earlier repayment using the effective interest method.
Early termination costs on borrowings
Premiums and discounts arising on the early repayment of borrowings are written–off to the income statement as
incurred.
Interest rate swaps
The Group currently uses several types of financial instruments as part of an overall interest rate risk management
strategy. It does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest rate risk associated with net debt
is managed by using a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings and financial liabilities. The cash flows 
from, and losses arising on terminations of, these contracts are recognised as cash flows from operating activities.
See note 16(d) for further information.
Trade receivables
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
A provision for impairment is established based on historical experience. When a trade receivable is not collectable 
it is written off against the allowance account.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting 
all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct
transaction costs.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits.
Critical accounting estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make estimates and
assumptions in certain circumstances that affect reported amounts. The most sensitive estimates affecting the
financial statements are in the areas of assessing the recoverability of receivables and post–retirement benefits.
Provision for doubtful trade receivables
Provision is made against accounts that in the estimation of management may be impaired. Within each division,
assessment is made of the recoverability of trade receivables based on a range of factors including the age of the
receivable and the type of services provided. The provision is assessed monthly against actual experience of
irrecoverable accounts and adjusted if appropriate.
The Group held a provision for impairment of trade receivables at the balance sheet date of £3.3 million 
(2007: £2.5 million).
Pensions
The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme that is accounted for using methods that rely on actuarial
assumptions to estimate costs and liabilities for inclusion in the financial statements. These actuarial assumptions
include discount rates, assumed rates of return, salary increases and mortality rates.
While management believes that the actuarial assumptions are appropriate, any significant changes to those used would
affect the balance sheet and income statement. The Group considers that the most significant assumptions are the
discount rate and the expected return on plan assets.

The assets of the employee share trust are held by a separate limited company, of which the directors consider that
Dignity plc has de facto control. In accordance with UITF 38, Accounting for ESOP Trusts and the substance of the
transaction, the trust’s assets and liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet within share capital and
reserves.
Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2008
IFRIC 11, IFRS 2, Group and treasury transactions. This provides guidance on whether share–based payments
involving treasury shares or involving group entities (for example, options over a parent’s shares) should be accounted
for as equity–settled or cash–settled share–based payments in the stand–alone accounts of the parent and Group
companies. There is no impact as accounting policies are in compliance.
Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2008 but not relevant 
The following interpretations to published standards are mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2008 but they are not relevant to the Group’s operations:
IFRIC 12, Service concession arrangements.
IFRIC 13, Customer loyalty programs
Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been
early adopted
The following interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for accounting periods
beginning on or after 26 December 2008 or later periods but which the Group has not early adopted:
IFRS 2 (Amendment), Share–based payment (effective from 1 January 2009). The amendment to the standard is still
subject to endorsement by the European Union (EU). It deals with vesting conditions and cancellations. It clarifies
that vesting conditions are service conditions and performance conditions only. The Group will apply IFRS 2
(Amendment) from 1 January 2009, subject to endorsement by the EU. It is not expected to have an impact on 
the Group’s financial statements.
IFRS 3 (Amendment), Business combinations. The revision to this standard amends the way business combinations
are accounted for. This revision is effective for all business combinations on or after 1 July 2009.
IFRS 5 (Amendment), Non–current assets held–for–sale and discontinued operations (and consequential amendment 
to IFRS 1, First–time adoption) (effective from 1 July 2009). The amendment to the standard is still subject to
endorsement by the EU. The amendment clarifies that all of a subsidiary’s assets and liabilities are classified as 
held for sale if a partial disposal sale plan results in loss of control. The Group will apply the IFRS 5 (Amendment)
prospectively to all partial disposals of subsidiaries from 1 January 2010, subject to endorsement by the EU. It is 
not expected to have an impact on the Group’s financial statements.
IFRS 8, Operating segments. This standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009
and introduces new rules on the disclosure of operating results by business segment.
IAS 1 (Revised), Presentation of financial statements (effective from 1 January 2009). The standard is still subject to
endorsement by the EU. The revised standard will prohibit the presentation of items of income and expenses (that is,
non–owner changes in equity) in the statement of changes in equity, requiring non–owner changes in equity to be
presented separately from owner changes in equity. The Group will apply IAS 1 (Revised) from 1 January 2009,
subject to endorsement by the EU.
IAS 23 (Amendment), Borrowing costs. The amendment to the standard is still subject to endorsement by the EU.
It requires an entity to capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production
of a qualifying asset (one that takes a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale) as part of the cost of
that asset. The option of immediately expensing those borrowing costs will be removed. The Group will apply IAS 23
(Amended) from 1 January 2009, subject to endorsement by the EU. This is not expected to have an impact on
the Group.
IAS 32 (Amendment), Financial instruments: presentation and IAS 1, Presentation of financial statements. This
amendment is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 and introduced new rules on how
certain financial instruments should be classified as equity. This is not expected to have an impact on the Group.
IAS 36 (Amendment), Impairment of assets (effective from 1 January 2009). The amendment to the standard is still
subject to endorsement by the EU. Where fair value less costs to sell is calculated on the basis of discounted cash
flows, disclosures equivalent to those for value–in–use calculation should be made. The Group will apply the IAS 36
(Amendment) and provide the required disclosure where applicable for impairment tests from 1 January 2009,
subject to endorsement by the EU.

MAC_RF63831_01 tp 8/4/09 14:32 Page 45 1 Accounting policies (continued)
IAS 38 (Amendment), Intangible assets, (effective from 1 January 2009). The amendment is part of the IASB’s annual
improvements project published in May 2008. The amendment to the standard is still subject to endorsement by the
EU. A prepayment may only be recognised in the event that payment has been made in advance of obtaining right of
access to goods or receipt of services. This is not expected to have an impact on the Group.
IAS 39 (Amendment), Financial instruments: recognition and measurement and IFRS 7, Financial instruments:
disclosures on the reclassification of financial assets. This amendment is effective for accounting periods beginning
on or after 1 July 2008 and allow the reclassification of certain financial assets previously classified as held for
trading or available for sale to another category under limited circumstances. Various disclosures are required where
a reclassification has been made. This is not expected to have an impact on the Group.
IAS 40 (Amendment), Investment property (and consequential amendments to IAS 16) (effective from 1 January
2009). The amendment is part of the IASB’s annual improvements project published in May 2008. The Group will
apply IAS 40 (Amendment) from 1 January 2009. This is not expected to have an impact on the Group’s financial
statements.
IFRIC 14, IAS 19, The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction. IFRIC 14
provides guidance on assessing the limit in IAS 19 on the amount of the surplus that can be recognised as an asset.
It also explains how the pension asset or liability may be affected by a statutory or contractual minimum funding
requirement. The Group will apply IFRC 14 from 1 January 2009, subject to endorsement by the EU. This is not
expected to have an impact on the Group’s financial statements.
Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and not relevant for the
Group’s operations 
The following interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for the Group’s accounting
periods beginning on or after 26 December 2008 or later periods but are not relevant for the Group’s operations:
IFRS 1 (Amendment), First time adoption of IFRS, and IAS 27, Consolidated and separate financial statements,
(effective from 1 January 2009). The amended standard is still subject to endorsement by the EU.
IAS 16 (Amendment), Property, plant and equipment (and consequential amendment to IAS 7, Statement of cash
flows) (effective from 1 January 2009). The amendment is part of the IASB’s annual improvements project published
in May 2008. Entities whose ordinary activities comprise renting and subsequently selling assets present proceeds
from the sale of those assets as revenue and should transfer the carrying amount of the asset to inventories when the
asset becomes held for sale. A consequential amendment to IAS 7 states that cash flows arising from purchase, rental
and sale of those assets are classified as cash flows from operating activities.
IAS 20 (Amendment), Accounting for government grants and disclosure of government assistance (effective from 
1 January 2009). The benefit of a below–market rate government loan is measured as the difference between the
carrying amount in accordance with IAS 39, Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement, and the proceeds
received with the benefit accounted for in accordance with IAS 20.
IAS 27 (Amendment), Consolidated and separate financial statements. This standard requires all transactions with
non–controlling interests to be recorded in equity if there is no change in control. This amendment is effective for
accounting periods on or after 1 July 2009.
IAS 29 (Amendment), Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies (effective from 1 January 2009). The amendment
is part of the IASB’s annual improvements project published in May 2008. The guidance has been amended to reflect
the fact that a number of assets and liabilities are measured at fair value rather than historical cost.
IAS 31 (Amendment), Interests in joint ventures, (and consequential amendments to IAS 32 and IFRS 7) (effective
from 1 January 2009). The amendment is part of the IASB’s annual improvements project published in May 2008.
Where an investment in joint venture is accounted for in accordance with IAS 39, only certain rather than all disclosure
requirements in IAS 31 need to be made in addition to disclosures required by IAS 32, Financial instruments:
Presentation, and IFRS 7 Financial instruments: disclosures.
IAS 39 (Amendment), Financial instruments: recognition and measurement of eligible hedged items. This amendment
makes two significant changes. It prohibits designating inflation as a hedgeable component of a fixed rate debt. It also
prohibits including time value in the one–sided hedged risk when designating options as hedges. This amendment is
effective for accounting periods on or after 1 July 2009.
IAS 41 (Amendment), Agriculture (effective from 1 January 2009). The amendment is part of the IASB’s annual
improvements project published in May 2008. It requires the use of a market–based discount rate where fair value
calculations are based on discounted cash flows and the removal of the prohibition on taking into account biological
transformation when calculating fair value.

MAC_RF63831_01 tp 8/4/09 14:32 Page 46 IFRIC 15, Agreements for construction of real estates. This interpretation clarifies which standard (IAS 18, Revenue,
or IAS 11, Construction contracts) should be applied to particular transactions and is likely to mean that IAS 18 will
be applied to a wider range of transactions. This amendment is effective for accounting periods on or after 1 January
2009.
IFRIC 16, Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation. This interpretation clarifies the following in respect of net
investment hedging; Net investment hedging relates to differences in functional currency, not presentation currency
and Hedging instruments may be held anywhere in the Group. This amendment is effective for accounting periods on
or after 1 October 2008.
IFRIC 17, Distributions of non–cash assets to owners. This interpretation clarifies how an entity should measure
distributions of assets, other than cash, when it pays dividends to its owners. This amendment is effective for
accounting periods on or after 1 July 2009.
IFRIC 18, (Interpretation), Transfers of assets from customers, (effective from 1 July 2009). This interpretation clarifies
the accounting for arrangements where an item of property, plant and equipment, which is provided by the customer,
is used to provide an ongoing service. This is particularly relevant to the utility sector with the provision of the service
being that of, for example, gas or electricity. The interpretation applies prospectively to transfers of assets from
customers received on or after 1 July 2009.
2 Financial risk management
The Group finances its operations by a mixture of shareholders’ funds and Secured Notes, with other bank borrowings
available if required. This approach seeks to minimise financing costs and generate optimum shareholder value through
efficient leveraging of the Group’s balance sheet, which is made possible by the stable and predictable cash generative
nature of the business.
It is not the Group policy to actively trade in derivatives.
Market risk
Currency risk
All the Group’s financial assets and liabilities are denominated in Sterling. The Group purchases minimal amounts
from overseas. Accordingly, exposure to currency fluctuations are not significant and therefore not actively managed.
Interest rate risk and other price risk
The Group’s main borrowings consist of Class A and B Secured Notes, which are at fixed interest rates, resulting in a
predetermined repayment profile. The fair value of these financial instruments is based on underlying gilt prices and
yield spreads based on the market’s current view of the risk profile of the Secured Notes. Consequently, the fair value
of these instruments will fluctuate. Fair values are not relevant to the Group unless it was to change its funding strategy
and repay the Secured Notes early.
During the period, the Group obtained a £10 million crematoria acquisition facility (‘the Crematoria Acquisition Facility’).
£7.4 million was drawn on 24 November 2008 (‘the First Tranche’). The First Tranche carries interest at 5.59 per cent
per annum. Any remaining funds drawn will carry interest at a rate relative to three month LIBOR, with such rate
being capped at 5.59 per cent. Consequently, the Group carries no interest rate risk on this facility. The Crematoria
Acquisition Facility is repayable in one bullet payment in five years time.
The Group has significant cash balances that are held by institutions rated at least A–1 by Standard and Poors. These
balances earn interest by reference to the Bank of England base rate. If base rates reduced by one per cent at the
beginning of 2009 then the Group would receive £0.1 million less interest income on an annualised basis for each
£10 million held.
None of the Group’s other financial liabilities or financial assets carry any significant interest rate risk.
Credit risk
Trade receivables are the main source of credit risk to the Group. However, this risk is minimised as much as possible
through well–established credit control procedures. Quantitative disclosures regarding the aging of these receivables
are included in note 21(c).
Liquidity risk
The Group manages its liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient cash reserves, committed undrawn borrowing facilities
and regular monitoring and forecasting of cash balances. In addition, the Group is required under the terms of its
secured borrowings to maintain a precisely defined EBITDA to total debt service ratio of at least 1.5:1. This ratio was
determined when raising the debt as being sufficient to ensure all borrowings could be repaid. At 26 December 2008
the actual ratio was 2.55:1 (2007: 2.31:1).
47 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008
Group Accounts
MAC_RF63831_01 tp 8/4/09 14:32 Page 47 2 Financial risk management (continued)
Capital risk management
The Group’s objective under managing capital is to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in
order to provide returns for shareholders, repay holders of Class A and B Secured Notes and benefit other shareholders.
It also aims to reduce its cost of capital by maintaining an optimal capital structure.
In order to achieve these expectations, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return
capital to shareholders, issue new shares or issue further Class A and B Secured Notes.
During the period, the Group achieved its covenants under the terms of the Group’s secured borrowings 
(see ‘Liquidity risk’ above).
3 Revenue and segmental analysis
As described in the Business Review and Financial Review, the Group is organised into three main business segments:
funeral services, crematoria and pre–arranged funeral plans.
Funeral services represent the sale of funerals and memorials at the time of need.
Crematoria represent the performance of cremations at the time of need, together with the sale of memorials at the
time of need and in advance.
Pre–arranged funeral plans represent the revenue from the sale of funerals in advance to customers wishing to make
their own funeral arrangements, and the marketing and administration costs associated with making such sales.
Substantially all Group revenue is derived from, and substantially all of the Group’s net assets are located in, the
United Kingdom and Channel Islands. Overseas transactions are not material.
The revenue and operating profit (which includes Recoveries within pre–arranged funeral plans of £1.5 million in both
periods), by segment, was as follows:

The taxation charge in the period is higher (2007: lower) than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK 
(28.5 per cent). The differences are explained below:

Exceptional adjustment for change in industrial building allowances 0.4 –
Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 0.4 0.2
Total taxation 10.8 8.6
Under IFRS the tax rate is higher (2007: lower) than the standard UK tax rate of 28.5 per cent due to combination 
of the impact of disallowable trading expenses and expenditure on the Group’s premises that does not attract any
deductions for tax purposes, and the one off exceptional charge relating to the change in industrial building allowances.
In June 2007, legislation was passed confirming that the rate of Corporation Tax would reduce from 30 per cent to
28 per cent from 1 April 2008. As a result, the standard UK tax rate for 2008 is 28.5 per cent.
This had the effect of reducing the Group’s effective tax rate (excluding the non–recurring adjustment) to 29.5 per cent
in 2008, compared to 30 per cent in the previous period.
Further legislation was enacted on 21 July 2008 in respect of industrial building allowances. This has resulted in a
one off charge to the Consolidated Income Statement of £0.4 million.
The Group anticipates its effective tax rate will transition to 29 per cent in the 2009 financial period and beyond
following these legislative changes.

A final dividend of 7.34 pence per share, in respect of 2008, has been proposed by the Board. This will be paid on 
26 June 2009 provided approval is gained from shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 5 June 2009 and will
be paid to shareholders on the register at close of business on 29 May 2009.
8 Earnings per share
The calculation of basic earnings per Ordinary Share has been based on the profit for the relevant period.
For diluted earnings per Ordinary Share, the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue is adjusted to
assume conversion of all dilutive potential Ordinary Shares.
The Group has two classes of potentially dilutive Ordinary Shares being those share options granted to employees
under the Group’s SAYE Scheme and the contingently issueable shares under the Group’s LTIP Schemes. At the
balance sheet date, the performance criteria for the vesting of the awards under the LTIP Schemes had not been met
and these contingently issueable shares have been excluded from the diluted EPS calculations.
The Board believes that profit on ordinary activities before exceptional items, profit on sale of fixed assets and after
taxation is a useful indication of the Group’s performance, as it excludes significant non–recurring items. This
reporting measure is defined as ‘Underlying profit after taxation’ in the Financial Review.
Accordingly, the Board believes that earnings per share calculated by reference to this underlying profit after taxation
is also a useful indicator of financial performance.

Impairment tests for goodwill and other intangible assets
As described in note 1, goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite life are subject to annual impairment
tests in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of Assets.
For the purpose of impairment testing, the goodwill and other intangibles are allocated to the Group’s cash
generating units (‘CGUs’) according to business segment. The segmental allocation is shown below:
Amortisation of £0.2 million (2007: £0.7 million) is included within administrative expenses in the income statement.

24.7 119.6 144.3
The recoverable amount of a CGU is based on a value–in–use calculation. However, the assets allocated to head office
are tested for impairment by reference to the Group as a whole.
The value–in–use calculations use cash flow projections based on the latest annual budgets approved by management.
Key assumptions used to produce the annual budget are the estimated UK death rates (based on historical death rates
supplied by ONS), anticipated market share (based on actual experience) and anticipated price increases. Cash flows
beyond the initial 12 month period are extrapolated using the historic UK GDP growth rate. The cash flows are
discounted at a pre–tax rate of 9.2 per cent (2007: 9.2 per cent). This rate is used to analyse each CGU because 
they are each funded in a similar way. Given the stability and predictability of the industry, cash flows for the following
20 years have been taken into account.
On the basis of the above, the review indicated that no impairment arose in any segment (2007: £nil).

thirty to nine hundred years.
(b) Deferred commissions
The Group is the named beneficiary on a number of life assurance products sold by third party insurance companies.
A commission is paid when the policy is charged to the Group. As this commission is fully refundable if the Group
does not perform the funeral for any reason, it is carried as a debtor and expensed when the funeral is performed.

On 21 February 2006, Dignity Finance PLC issued £45,550,000 Class A Secured Notes (the ‘Further A notes’) and

The Further A notes carry interest at 6.31 per cent, payable half yearly in arrears. The Further A notes are repayable
in instalments ending in December 2023. The transaction costs incurred on issue of the Further A notes totalled 
£1.9 million. The Further B notes carry interest at 8.151 per cent, payable half yearly in arrears. The Further B notes
are repayable in instalments ending in December 2030. The transaction costs incurred on issue of the Further B
notes totalled £1.8 million. The principal outstanding on the Secured Notes and related issue costs have been
presented on a net basis in the table above. Both the Further A notes and the Further B notes are secured by first
ranking security in respect of the undertakings and assets of Dignity (2002) Limited and its subsidiaries.
At 26 December 2008, £39.4 million (2007: £40.7 million) of the principal of the Further A notes and £32.5 million

(d) Other financial liabilities
On 20 December 2002, Dignity (2002) Limited entered into contracts to swap the floating rate interest on a bank loan
into fixed rate. Contractually, these swaps were not effective until 30 April 2003.
On 11 April 2003, as described in note 16(a), the Group issued Secured Notes at a fixed rate of interest. These notes
replaced the bank loan. Consequently, the swaps were no longer required as the Group had no interest rate risk on the
Secured Notes. As a result, the Group entered into further contracts on 11 April 2003 to swap fixed rate interest into
floating in order to offset the original swaps and eliminate any interest rate risk in this regard.
As a result of interest rate movements between these two dates, the combined effect of all the contracts was that the
Group makes fixed and determinable bi–annual payments on a notional principal amount.
These swap agreements were entered into under one ISDA master agreement. This master agreement forces the
swaps to be viewed and settled on a net basis only; a position that cannot be altered without the written consent of
both parties.
Accordingly, the overall transaction represents a financial liability. The fair value represents the discounted net present
value of future cash flows. Further, as these contracts related to the raising of the Secured Notes, the liability has
been accounted for as a transaction cost of the Class A and B Secured Notes and is being amortised in accordance
with IAS 39.
(e) Crematoria acquisition facility
During the period, the Group obtained a £10 million crematoria acquisition facility (‘the Crematoria Acquisition Facility’).
£7.4 million was drawn on 24 November 2008 (‘the First Tranche’). The First Tranche carries interest at 5.59 per cent
per annum. Any remaining funds drawn will carry interest at a rate relative to three month LIBOR, with such rate being
capped at 5.59 per cent. Consequently, the Group carries no interest rate risk on this facility. The Crematoria Acquisition
Facility is repayable in one bullet payment in five years time. There is no pricing risk unless the Group chooses to
repay the facility within the first two years of draw down.
The transaction costs incurred on the Crematoria Acquisition Facility were £0.2 million. The principal outstanding on
the Crematoria Acquisition Facility and related issue costs have been presented on a net basis in the table above.
At 26 December 2008, £7.4 million of the principal was outstanding. At 26 December 2008, £0.2 million of the
transaction costs remained unamortised.

The non–cancellable operating leases principally relate to leasehold land and buildings.
Of the total operating lease payments charged to trading expenses, £0.1 million (2007: £0.1 million) are in respect of
contingent rentals. The contingent rentals are based on the revenues generated at the specific locations.
Sublease payments received in the year amount to £0.6 million (2007: £0.6 million). Total future sublease payments
receivable relating to operating leases amount to £0.6 million (2007: £0.5 million).
In addition, the Group has operating lease commitments with rentals determined in relation to sales. It is not possible
to quantify future rentals payable under such leases.

(a) Dilapidations
The provision for dilapidations covers the costs of repair to leased premises occupied by the Group in respect of
which a dilapidations notification has been received, and properties where a dilapidation obligation exists but for
which no notification has been received.
It is anticipated that the element of provision relating to dilapidation notices served, £0.4 million (2007: £0.4 million),
will be incurred in the following financial year, and the element relating to dilapidation obligations where no notice has
been served will be utilised over the terms of the relevant property leases, the majority of which is expected to be by
31 December 2017.
(b) Asbestos rectification
In May 2004, the Control of Asbestos at Work regulations came into effect. This introduces an explicit duty to manage
asbestos in all non–domestic properties. Those who have responsibility for the maintenance and/or repair of the
premises are similarly responsible for the control of asbestos. Therefore, where the Group has entered into leases
with a ‘tenant–repairing’ clause, it is also responsible for the control of asbestos.
The provision includes the expected rectification costs of properties not yet surveyed for asbestos plus the estimated
costs of surveying these properties. It is anticipated that the provision will be utilised by the end of 2009.

(c) Onerous contracts
The Group has provided for the discounted future costs of certain contracts to which the Group is legally bound.
These contracts relate to vacant leasehold properties and other contracts from which no economic benefit is derived.
The provision will be utilised over the term of the contracts and it is anticipated that it will be fully utilised after 
seven years.
Included within the provision is an amount of £0.2 million (2007: £0.2 million) relating to the expected costs of ongoing
rent reviews, the outcomes of which have been based on recent experience of similar reviews on other properties.
(d) Cancellation provision
As described in note 1, the Group receives monies from certain pre–arranged funeral plan Trusts in respect of the
marketing of pre–arranged funeral plans, which are refundable to the trust in the event of cancellation.
The provision covers the expected cost of such cancellations anticipated to occur in future years relating to plans
sold before the balance sheet date and is anticipated to be utilised over the next three years.

Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using a tax rate of 28 per cent

No deferred tax asset is recognised in respect of losses within the Group amounting to £4.1 million net at 28 per cent
(2007: £4.1 million net at 28 per cent). Based on the current debt structure of the Group and the nature of these
losses, the Directors do not consider that taxable profits will arise in the relevant company from which the future
reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Elements of these deferred tax balances may be payable/recoverable within one year. However, the Directors consider
that it is not possible to quantify the amount because the level of uncertainty in the timing of events and have
therefore classified the whole balance as due after more than one year.
The deferred income tax charged to equity during the period was as follows:

Fair values of non–derivative financial assets and financial liabilities
Where market values are not available, fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been calculated by
discounting expected future cash flows at relevant interest rates. The carrying values of short term borrowings
approximate to book value.
Trade receivables are held net of impairment.

(c) Trade receivables 
As at 26 December 2008, £6.9 million of the gross trade receivables (2007: £7.0 million) were past due and partially
impaired. A provision for impairment is established based on historical experience. The amount of the provision, as at
26 December 2008, was £3.3 million (2007: £2.5 million). The individually impaired receivables principally relate to
monies owing for funerals performed by the funeral services division. The aging of these receivables is as follows:

£40.0 million of the amount above is a liquidity facility relating to the Class A and B Secured Notes. This facility may
only be used to repay interest and principal on the Secured Notes in the event of insufficient cash to service these
instruments. The facility is subject to annual renewal. However, if the bank providing the facility does not renew it, then
the provider is required to place £40.0 million in a bank account, which the Group may access as if it represented a
borrowing facility on the same terms.
The remaining £5.0 million facility was renewed in April 2008 for a further five years. Both these facilities incur
commitment fees at market rates.

Potential issues of Ordinary Shares 
Certain employees hold options to subscribe for shares in the Company under an approved Save As You Earn (SAYE)
Scheme started in 2007. In addition, Executive Directors and senior management hold options to subscribe for shares
in the Company under Long Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) awarded in 2006, 2007 and 2008.
The total number of outstanding shares subject to options (excluding lapses), the periods in which they were granted
and the periods in which they may be exercised are given below:

LTIP Schemes
The LTIP Scheme was introduced after the flotation of the Group in 2004. Under the LTIP Scheme, the remuneration
committee can grant options over shares in the Company to employees of the Group. Awards under the LTIP Scheme
are generally reserved for Executive Directors and senior management. The Company has made annual grants since
April 2004. Options granted under the LTIP Scheme will become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of
grant, subject to the conditions described on pages 24 and 25. Exercise of an option is subject to continued employment
unless an individual ceases to be an employee by reason of death, illness, redundancy or other similar circumstances.
Options were valued using the Monte Carlo option pricing model. Performance conditions were included in the fair
value calculations. The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows:
18 March 27 March 23 March 13 April
Grant date 2008 2007 2006 2005
Share price at grant date £7.62 £6.68 £4.78 £3.40

Possibility of ceasing employment before vesting 0% 0% 0% 0%
Fair value per option £4.13 £3.62 £2.67 £1.94
The expected volatility is calculated by reference to historical volatility over the last three years. The expected life is
the average expected period to exercise. The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero–coupon UK government bonds
of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
During the period nil options (2007: 6,194) under the 2004 LTIP Scheme, nil options (2007: 20,991) under the 
2005 LTIP Scheme, nil options (2007: 31,727) under the 2006 LTIP Scheme, 2,522 options (2007: 2,000) under the
2007 LTIP Scheme, and 1,770 under the 2008 LTIP scheme were forfeited. 242,610 options were exercised under the
2005 LTIP Scheme during the period. The share price of the options exercised during the period was £7.45.
The charge to the income statement in the period in respect of the LTIP Schemes was £0.7 million (2007: £0.6 million).
All of which are equity based settled.

During 2008, the Group acquired the operational interest of nine funeral locations and two crematoria. These acquisitions
were either acquisitions of trade and assets or acquisitions of the entire share capital of a limited company.
Included in the above is the acquisition of the entire issued share capital of Mercia Crematoria Limited (whose name
was subsequently changed to Dignity Crematoria Limited), which included £9.6 million of investment properties and
£3.2 million assets held in the course of construction.
All these acquisitions have been accounted for under the acquisition method. None were individually material and
consequently have been aggregated.
All intangible assets were recognised at their respective fair values. The residual excess over the net assets acquired is
recognised as goodwill. This represents the value to the Group of the funeral locations.
The fair value adjustments contain some provisional amounts, which will be finalised in 2009. These adjustments
reflect the recognition of trade names and associated deferred taxation and adjustments to reflect the fair value of
other working capital.
The businesses acquired have their assets and liabilities amalgamated within the existing business structure and as
such, it is impractical to determine, without undue expense and delay due to the immaterial size of each, the post
acquisition results.
It is also not possible to quantify the results of these businesses prior to acquisition as it represents confidential
information relating to the vendors, which the Directors do not have authority to disclose.

Defined benefit plans
In 2005 the Group operated two defined benefit plans in the UK. On 6 April 2006 the Dignity 1972 Pension Scheme
was merged into the Dignity Pension and Assurance Scheme. A full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 6 April
2008. The valuation results of the merged scheme were updated to 31 December 2008 by a qualified independent
Actuary.
For 2008 the employer’s contribution rate payable was 5.5 per cent of Pensionable Salaries plus £39,750 per month
(2007: 5.5 per cent of Pensionable Salaries plus £39,750 per month). The total monetary contribution paid by the
employer for 2008 was £1.2 million (2007: £1.2 million).
The principal assumptions used by the actuary were:

29 Other commitments
Dignity Pre–Arrangement Limited, Dignity Securities Limited and Advance Planning Limited are fellow members of
the Dignity Group in the United Kingdom. These companies have sold pre–arranged funeral plans to their clients in 
the past. All monies from these sales are held and controlled by three independent Trusts, being the National Funeral
Trust, the Dignity Limited Trust Fund and the Trust for Age Concern Funeral Plans respectively. Full details of the
transactions can be found in the financial statements of these companies, which are available from Plantsbrook House,
94 The Parade, Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, B72 1PH.
The Group has given commitments to certain of these clients to perform their funeral. The cost of the performance 
of these funerals will be paid out of the funds held in the Trusts.
It is the view of the Directors that none of these commitments are onerous to the Group.
As described in note 26 and elsewhere in this annual report, the Group acquired two partly constructed crematoria as
part of an acquisition of the entire issued share capital of a company. As a consequence, the Group has contractual
commitments to incur a maximum of £2.3 million to complete the construction of these crematoria.
30 Contingent liabilities
(a) Securitisation
On 11 April 2003, the Group refinanced its debt by way of a whole business securitisation. Furthermore on 21 February
2006 further Secured Notes were issued on identical terms. As a result, the following guarantees and charges were
granted to BNY Corporate Trustee Services Limited in its capacity as Security Trustee in the securitisation:
• The Dignity (2002) Group have granted the Security Trustee fixed and floating charges over the assets and
undertakings of the Dignity (2002) Group;
• Dignity plc has granted the Security Trustee, with full title guarantee a first fixed charge over the shares (and any
monies receivable in respect of the shares) which it holds in Dignity (2004) Limited;
• Dignity (2004) Limited has granted the Security Trustee, with full title guarantee a first fixed charge over the shares
(and any monies receivable in respect of the shares) which it holds in Dignity Holdings No.2 Limited and Dignity
(2002) Limited;
• Dignity Holdings No. 2 Limited has granted the Security Trustee, with full title guarantee a first fixed charge over the
shares (and any monies receivable in respect of the shares) which it holds in Dignity Holdings Limited;
71 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008
Group Accounts
MAC_RF63831_01 tp 8/4/09 14:32 Page 71 30 Contingent liabilities (continued)
• Dignity Holdings Limited has granted the Security Trustee, with full title guarantee a first fixed charge over the shares
(and any monies receivable in respect of the shares) which it holds in Dignity Mezzco Limited;
• Dignity Holdings Limited has also assigned to the Security Trustee by way of security with full title guarantee, its right
title and interest in the loans (both interest and non interest bearing) to Dignity Mezzco Limited;
• Dignity Mezzco Limited has also assigned to the Security Trustee by way of security with full title guarantee, its right
title and interest in the loan to Dignity (2002) Limited.
At 26 December 2008, the amount outstanding in relation to these borrowings was £278.8 million (2007: £284.2 million).
(b) Contingent consideration 
On 28 August 2007, the Group acquired the trade and assets of seven funeral locations. As part of this acquisition
there is a contingent consideration clause, payable during 2009. The maximum amount payable in accordance with
this clause is £1.8 million. However, at 26 December 2008 and 28 December 2007, no provision has been recognised
in respect of this clause as the Board do not believe that any further consideration will be payable, based on
information currently available.
(c) Crematoria acquisition facility
On 24 November 2008, the Group obtained a £10 million loan facility from the National Westminster Bank plc 
(‘Nat West’). £7.4 million was drawn on the same day. As a consequence of the legal structure of this facility:
• Dignity plc has granted Nat West, with full title guarantee a first fixed charge over the shares (and any monies
receivable in respect of the shares) which it holds in Dignity (2008) Limited;
• Dignity (2008) Limited has granted Nat West, with full title guarantee a first fixed charge over the shares (and any
monies receivable in respect of the shares) which it holds in Dignity Crematoria Limited;
• Dignity (2008) Limited and Dignity Crematoria Limited have granted Nat West fixed and floating charges over the
assets and undertakings of each of Dignity (2008) Limited and Dignity Crematoria Limited; and
• Dignity plc have acted as guarantor in the event that Dignity (2008) Limited fails to pay interest due on the facility.
In the opinion of the Directors no liability is likely to crystallise in respect of these guarantees.
At 26 December 2008, the amount outstanding in relation to these borrowings was £7.4 million (2007: £nil million).
31 Related party transactions
The ultimate controlling party of the Group is Dignity plc.
Pre–arrangement trusts 
During the period the Group entered into transactions with the Trusts associated with the pre–arranged funeral plan
businesses. The nature of the relationship with the Trusts is set out in the accounting polices. Transactions represent:
• Expenses paid by the Group on behalf of the respective Trusts;
• Transfers of funds in relation to payments in respect of deaths and cancellations of existing members;
• The recovery of marketing and administration expenses in relation to plans sold net of cancellations; and
• The payment of realised surpluses generated by the Trust funds as and when the trustees sanction such payments.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
for the 52 week period ended 26 December 2008
MAC_RF63831_01 tp 8/4/09 14:32 Page 72 We have audited the parent company financial statements of Dignity plc for the 52 week period ended 26 December
2008 which comprise the Balance Sheet and the related notes. These parent company financial statements have been
prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the Report on
Directors’ Remuneration that is described as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the consolidated financial statements of Dignity plc for the 52 week period ended 
26 December 2008.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Report on Directors’ Remuneration and the parent
company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial statements and the part of the Report on Directors’
Remuneration to be audited in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the company’s
members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not,
in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this
report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view and
whether the parent company financial statements and the part of the Report on Directors’ Remuneration to be audited
have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion
the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the parent company financial statements. The information
given in the Directors’ Report includes that specific information presented in the Business Review and Financial Review
that is cross referred from the Business Review section of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding
directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited
consolidated financial statements. The other information comprises the Directors’ Report, the Chairman’s Statement,
the Chief Executive’s Overview, the Business Review, the Financial Review, the Corporate and Social Responsibility Report,
the unaudited section of the Report on Directors’ Remuneration, the Directors’ Statement on Corporate Governance
and all of the other information listed on the contents page. We consider the implications for our report if we become
aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the consolidated financial statements. Our
responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the parent company financial statements and the part of the Report on Directors’ Remuneration to 
be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the
preparation of the parent company financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to
the company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the parent company financial statements
and the part of the Report on Directors’ Remuneration to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether
caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the parent company financial statements and the part of the Report on Directors’
Remuneration to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• The parent company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state of the company’s affairs as at 26 December 2008;
• The parent company financial statements and the part of the Report on Directors’ Remuneration to be audited have
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
• The information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the parent company financial statements.

MAC_RF63831_01 tp 8/4/09 14:32 Page 74 C1 Principal accounting policies
Basis of preparation
These financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, as modified by
the revaluation of share–based payments and in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable United Kingdom
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). A summary of the principal accounting
policies, which have been consistently applied, is set out below.
In accordance with the concession granted under section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the profit and loss account
of the Company has not been separately presented in the financial statements.
In the current period, the Company’s financial statements have been prepared for the 52 week period ended 
26 December 2008. For the comparative period, the Company’s financial statements have been prepared for the 
52 week period ended 28 December 2007.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in FRS 1, Cash Flow Statements and has not prepared
a cash flow statement as the Company is included in the consolidated financial statements of Dignity plc, which
include a cash flow statement.
Furthermore, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption provided within FRS 8, Related Party Transactions,
not to disclose transactions with subsidiary undertakings, 90 per cent or more of whose voting rights are controlled
within the Group.
Furthermore, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption provided within FRS 29, Financial Instruments and
Disclosures, not to disclose details of any financial instruments held.
Implementation of UITF 44
During 2007, the Group adopted UITF 44 in respect of share option schemes, which required a prior year adjustment
to the Company’s financial statements. As a result, the charge for such schemes is recognised in a subsidiary of the
Company. The Company’s financial statements now reflect the cost of the scheme as an increase in the cost of
investment in the subsidiary.
Fixed assets investments
Fixed asset investments are stated at historical cost, less any provision for impairment.
Impairment of fixed assets
The carrying values of fixed assets are reviewed for impairment in periods where events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable or at the end of the first full financial year following the
recognition. Any impairment in the value of fixed assets below depreciated historical cost is charged to the profit and
loss account within operating profit. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the profit and loss account to
the extent that the original loss was recognised.
Employee share schemes
The Company operates two employee share schemes: The Save As You Earn Scheme (‘SAYE’) and Long Term Incentive
Plan Scheme (‘LTIP’).
The expected fair value of the share options awarded under the LTIP scheme are charged to the profit and loss account
over the period in which the right to the options is earned. The fair value is calculated by reference to the market
value of the shares at the date on which the options are awarded reduced by any consideration payable by the
relevant employee.
Details of Directors’ remuneration can be found in the Report on Directors’ Remuneration on pages 23 to 29.
Taxation including deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance
sheet date, except that deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that they are regarded as more likely
than not to be recoverable. Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
Employee share trust 
The assets of the employee share trust are held by a separate limited company, of which the directors consider that
Dignity plc has de facto control. In accordance with UITF 38, Accounting for ESOP Trusts and the substance of the
transaction, the trust’s assets and liabilities are recognised in the Company’s balance sheet within share capital
and reserves.

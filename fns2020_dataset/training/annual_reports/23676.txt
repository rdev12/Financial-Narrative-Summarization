Business Review
Chairman’s Statement
I am delighted to report such excellent results for the Group. In my 
report last year I said we believed the challenging market and economic 
conditions experienced in 2008 would continue throughout 2009. 
To a large extent, 2009 unfolded in line with this premise. Financial 
markets stabilised after worldwide Government backed rescues of 
troubled banks combined with unprecedented injections of liquidity 
into financial markets by several Central Banks through the policy 
of quantitative easing. 
Risk appetite, almost non-existent at the end of 2008 and early in 
2009, has somewhat returned as a result, although it has remained 
volatile throughout 2009 and indeed into the early months of this 
year, as investor sentiment remains highly sensitive to further 
shocks, such as Sovereign default risk.
Against this backdrop the Group has begun to deliver impressive 
growth in income and profitability. I said last year that our strategy 
would enable us to take advantage of opportunities as they arose,  
to continue to recruit quality people and to invest in new income 
streams. The Group has been able to progress this strategy in 2009 
and completed two significant investments in the development of  
the fixed income agency business and the large-cap equity business. 
Both these investments add significant potential for the Group to 
grow further in the future.
As I write, financial and economic conditions remain challenging 
with the additional uncertainty presented by the political agendas 
surrounding the elections in both the UK and the US in 2010.  
We do, however, see some signs that risk appetite is continuing  
to improve gradually. We are hopeful that politicians and policy 
makers in general can maintain and encourage a stable and consistent 
macro environment, specifically with regard to inflation, interest 
rates, taxation and regulation, conducive to continued growth in 
activity across all areas of the economy.
B o a r d 	C h a n g e s
I am pleased to announce that we have made further progress in 
strengthening the Group’s Board. Andrew Westenberger was appointed 
as Group Finance Director on 8 April 2009; Chris Chambers joined 
as a Non-Executive Director on 3 November 2009 and Roger Perkin 
joined as a Non-Executive Director on 27 January 2010. All three 
have made valuable contributions to the management of the Group. 
Roger Perkin replaced Nick Irens who resigned on 31 December 
2009 as Chairman of the Audit committee. Andrew Umbers also 
resigned from the Board on 3 February 2010. We wish them both 
well and thank them for their significant contributions to the success 
of the Group over the past few years. As well as these Group Board 
changes, a new Chief Executive Officer for Williams de Broë Limited, 
Philip Howell, joined the Group in March 2010.  
As ever, a key decision for us is how to reward (both to retain and 
motivate) the key people for the future success of the Group. Accordingly, 
the Group has put in place new long term partnership equity plans, 
both for the Group Executives and senior employees within our operating 
divisions. These plans were designed after extensive consultation with 
our major shareholders and were approved at an EGM on 22 January 
2010. During the year we have continued to recruit very high calibre 
people and will continue to do so. Our staff have managed our business 
in a very impressive way and once again I thank them all for their 
professionalism and their commitment. 
O u t l o o k
In summary, I believe the Group remains better placed than ever to face 
the challenges ahead and deliver continued growth to our shareholders.

Chief Executive’s Report
01 Business Review 02 Management and Governance 03 Financial Statements
R e s u l t s 
After the extraordinarily difficult business environment of 2008, 
2009 presented no less a challenging period. Equity market volumes 
continued to decline, whilst corporate fund raising activity continued 
for much of the year at the depressed levels seen in 2008, albeit 
beginning to tentatively recover in the second half of 2009. It is 
therefore very satisfying to report a return to profitability for the year.
Group statutory profit before tax for the year increased substantially 
to £11.1m (2008: £12.7m loss). Group adjusted operating profit improved 
similarly to £20.8m for the period (2008: £2.7m loss). Adjusted 
diluted earnings per share was 7.83p (2008: 1.17p) with statutory 
diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 3.87p 
(2008: 5.18p loss).
These results were achieved through a diversified mix of income 
which totalled £129.4m (2008: £63.9m) and a continued discipline 
on costs.
Group full year dividend is up 24% year on year to 2.50p, more 
than covered by adjusted and statutory earnings.
The Group has retained its Balance Sheet strength and strong liquidity 
position with year end cash and cash equivalents up £5.9m to £109.5m.
 
Both principal operating businesses, Investment Banking (Evolution 
Securities Limited) and Private Clients (Williams de Broë Limited) 
traded profitably during 2009 with Investment Banking reporting a 
significant improvement in adjusted operating profit to £18.5m for 
2009 (2008: £5.4m loss).
The results for 2009 reflect the transformation of the Group, 
achieved over the last three years. The business mix is radically 
different today in terms of both the quality and breadth of income 
streams within the Group as shown below.
The graphs below put into context how these results have been 
achieved against a backdrop of a very challenging business 
environment and, in particular, illustrates how our strategy to 
diversify the business mix has begun to deliver results.
Although rising equity market levels have clearly helped the performance 
of the Private Client business in the year, through increased 
management fee levels, the continued low level of small-cap fund 
raising and low equity market volumes have not prevented a record 
level of income for the Group as a whole.
The graph above illustrates how the Group’s total income is no 
longer dependent on the levels of AIM market fund raising activity.
Prior to the transformation of the Group’s business mix such difficult 
market conditions would have continued to have had a detrimental 
impact on the Group’s overall income and profitability.

Chief Executive’s Report (continued)
2 0 0 9 	S t r a t e g i c 	D e v e l o p m e nt s
Our strategy for some time has been to achieve sustainable earnings 
growth by diversifying our business base and building recurring 
revenue streams. The Group has a long track record of acquiring 
financial assets and businesses at reasonable prices to create shareholder 
value. The Group was well placed going into the downturn in 
financial markets: 
> The Group had already begun to diversify its revenue mix towards 
recurring fee income through the acquisition of Williams de Broë 
Limited; and
> The Group took early and decisive action to adjust its cost base 
and preserve balance sheet strength and liquidity.
As a result of the Group being well positioned going into and through 
the downturn relative to many peers, we were able to complete three 
significant business initiatives in the space of nine months:
 
> The acquisition of the investment management team of Singer 
& Friedlander Investment Management Limited (“SFIM”) has 
brought over £1billion of new assets under management; 
> The development of our fixed income agency business within 
Evolution Securities Limited which has significantly expanded the 
range of products the Group covers and the number of institutional 
clients the Group services; and
> The build out of a large-cap Pan-European equity research and 
sales business resulted in net hires of 56 people within the business 
during the year.
The Group’s focus in 2009 has been on these three key initiatives, 
while continuing to develop the Group’s other businesses in accordance 
with the strategic aims and core principles, namely: 
Financial Strength
> Underpinned by a disciplined approach to investment;
> Focus on an agency model; and
> High Balance Sheet liquidity.
Partnership Culture
> Proper alignment and reward sharing between employees and 
shareholders; and
> Long-term view focused on relationships not transactions.
The Group has stayed true to these values throughout the downturn 
of 2008 and 2009, both in growing our existing businesses and in 
developing new ones.
The Group aims to maintain a high cash generation and low fixed cost 
agency model to deliver high margin and low risk returns. 
The heart of the Group’s business is building long term client 
relationships and developing a true partnership culture. The Evolution Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 9

Private Clients activities comprises Williams de Broë Limited, one 
of the UK’s leading and fastest growing retail investment managers, 
WDB Capital Limited, the investment manager to WDB Capital 
UK Equity Fund Limited, and WDB Assetmaster Management Company 
Limited, the investment manger of our multi manager collectives.
Williams de Broë Limited continues to increase in significance to the 
Group, both in terms of current performance, and in terms of business 
development momentum it is now displaying. Organic growth over 
the last five years, together with the successful integration in 2009 of 
the new teams in Edinburgh and from Singer & Friedlander Investment 
Management Limited in London, has created a market leading business 
of scale in its sector. 
The Private Client business performed robustly in 2009 despite the 
uncertain market conditions. Total net income for the year of £42.4m 
was up 23% on the prior period (2008: £34.5m). Recurring management 
fee income of £24.4m (2008: £17.4m) accounted for 58% of total net 
income, compared with 50% in the comparative period. Transactional 
volumes increased 47% to 167,000 (2008: 114,000) driving transactional 
income to £17.0m in the year (2008: £14.1m). Adjusted operating 
profit increased by 14% to £4.1m (2008: £3.6m), with a strong 
performance in the second half of 2009 as new teams started to 
register and margin improvement initiative began to deliver. 
Growth in assets under management remained a core focus within 
Williams de Broë Limited during 2009. At 31 December 2009, total 
assets under management reached a record level of £5.2bn, an 
increase of 37% from £3.8bn at the end of 2008. This represents an 
excellent performance for a period that saw the recruitment of no new 
investment managers or acquisitions of businesses, whilst management 
focused on completing the integration of the prior year. Headcount 
remained largely unchanged during the year at 268 (2008: 260). Net 
fund sales were achieved solely from organic growth. Net fund inflows 
of £322m (2008: £550m) were achieved by our discretionary sales 
team together with our investment managers. 
With a heritage dating back to 1869, Williams de Broë Limited has 
always prided itself on the quality of its people and the service it 
gives to clients. Its reputation has been founded on the following 
core values:
> Personal service – we have a personal service driven culture and 
our ethos is to maintain investment managers dedicated to our 
individual client’s needs;
> Bespoke by nature – we tailor our services to fulfil our individual 
client’s specific investment objectives and risk criteria; 
> Sound investment process – we maintain a significant resource in 
our investment process and have a strong focus to achieve 
investment excellence;
> True independence – we select “best of breed” investments, which are 
appropriate for our clients, without conflicts of interest. We also 
develop close relationships with our professional intermediary 
partners; and 
> Quality business infrastructure, back office and compliance departments. 
In summary, 2009 represents a year of significant achievement for 
Williams de Broë Limited with the successful integration of new 
teams in London and Edinburgh combining with organic sales 
momentum across the business to deliver sound investment 
performance and record results.
Whilst management initiatives to improve operating margins are 
now beginning to deliver, we have also ensured that there has been a 
commensurate investment in new systems and governance processes 
to anticipate the increased demands of our current growth ambitions.
The potent combination of a high quality team of investment professionals, 
a differentiated product, a respected brand and a highly scalable 
infrastructure together with sound financial strength of the Group 
has firmly positioned Williams de Broë Limited as an engine for 
significant further growth in the short and medium term.

Business Review
Chief Executive’s Report (continued)
I nv e s t m e nt	B a n k i n g
2009 saw a significant expansion to our Investment Banking division. 
Overall headcount grew significantly from 125 to 220 (up 76%) as a 
result of our two key business initiatives: the significant expansion of 
the agency fixed income team and; the significant large-cap equities 
team. The business was able to instigate these transforming initiatives 
for modest upfront investment in the midst of the continued market 
upheavals experienced in the early part of 2009.
As a result of these initiatives the Investment Banking division 
produced a record level of income in the period of £87.0m (2008: 
£29.7m), nearly three times (up 193%) from the level of income 
achieved in 2008. As a result adjusted operating profit increased 
£23.9m to £18.5m from a loss of £5.4m in 2008. 
All areas of the business contributed to this significant growth in  
the period, however, the main drivers were our agency equities and 
fixed income businesses. Equity sales commission income of £23.2m 
recorded a £9.9m (up 74%) increase on the prior year (2008: £13.3m) 
and fixed income commission of £35.3m recorded a £28.2m (up 
397%) increase on the prior year (2008 £7.1m). Our equity market 
making team achieved income of £13.0m compared with £0.1m in 
the prior period an increase of £12.9m. Corporate finance achieved 
income of £15.5m (2008: £9.2m), up £6.3m (up 68%) through the 
successful raising of £451m for our corporate clients (2008: £157m). 
Equities 
2009 was a transformational year for our equities business, our 
existing UK mid market equities platform was repositioned to 
include increased coverage of UK and Pan-European large-cap 
equities. We made significant hires across the equities platform, 
increasing the client facing staff by 108% over the year. 
Research
The strength and quality of our research lies at the heart of our equities 
offering and we now cover 312 companies compared with 176 in the 
prior year (up 77%). In 2009, we expanded our research coverage to 
include: Banks, Beverages, Consumers and Food Producers, Economics 
and Strategy, Food Retail, General Financials, Income Service, 
Luxury Goods, Pharmaceuticals and Biotech, Property, Support 
Services, Telecoms and Tobacco. We have also added more resource 
to our existing sector strengths in Aerospace, Industrials and Engineering, 
Mining, Oils, Travel and Leisure, Utilities and Growth companies. 
Our research team now has significant coverage of UK and Pan-European 
large-cap and UK mid and growth companies. The build-out of our 
research team is now largely complete, although we anticipate some 
selective hires in the current year, particularly where we can emphasise 
our key strengths of industry knowledge, sector expertise and research 
experience. As a result of the investment made in research through 
2009, we have experienced a significant re-rating of our research 
product from our institutional clients through the second half of 
2009 and into the current year. We are confident that this 
momentum will continue.  
Sales and trading
Our clients have an increasing requirement for high quality sales, 
sales trading and trading services. 2009 saw the transformation of 
our offering, our new colleagues have increased the strength and 
capability of our distribution strengths and execution services. 
During the second half of 2009, we began to experience the income 
opportunity that is available to our new platform, notwithstanding, 
the well documented concerns over market volumes and market 
values in 2009. We have added to our mid and small-cap UK trading 
expertise by now providing market making and distribution in the 
Euro Stoxx 300, and through our algorithmic trading functionality 
we have access to a large number of different pools of liquidity both 
light and dark, on behalf of our clients, in addition to all primary 
exchanges enabling us to offer our clients a first class execution 
capability. We have established offices in New York, Boston and 
Madrid in the second half of 2009 and continue to grow our distribution 
expertise at the local level, and although only 10 months into our 
expansion plans, we continue to see growing evidence and validation 
from our clients that the product offering is of the highest quality. 
During 2009, income within our equities business grew by £22.8m 
to £36.2m, an increase of 170%, and the number of institutional 
clients’ accounts grew by 89 to 597 an increase of 18%.
Fixed Income 
During 2009, our fixed income business saw significant upgrades in 
headcount and quality of product. The business was able to recruit a 
range of high quality specialists, with wide ranging experience and 
track records of providing their clients with well priced liquidity. 
Strategically, we have set out to develop our fixed income service to

Corporate Finance
Equity corporate finance and corporate broking
In 2009, we successfully completed 20 (2008: 9) placings on behalf 
of our clients, raising £451m (2008: £157m), which together with 
other advisory fees and retainers generated income of £15.5m up 
68% in the year (2008: £9.2m). Overall retained corporate clients 
grew from 70 to 76 during the course of 2009, and our efforts on the 
AIM market were recognised by Growth Company Investor Magazine  
(as voted by Directors of public companies) who voted Evolution 
Securities Limited, No. 1 AIM advisor for 2009.
Debt capital markets
Strategically, the core offering of strength in distribution was complemented 
during 2009 by the recruitment of key professionals in both Debt 
Advisory and Debt Capital Markets teams. It is already clear that 
there is a real requirement for corporates to look at a range of financing 
alternatives including Investment Grade and Non-Investment Grade 
bonds as well as private placement strategies, as traditional lending 
channels have become less obvious. The team are currently working 
on a range of mandates for potential transactions in 2010, enhancing 
upon the global distribution strengths that have been built during the 
year, and providing depth and clarity on pricing to our corporate clients.
In 2010, we will further recruit into our corporate finance division to 
continue the momentum of growth in new corporate client capture, 
but also to make sure that the coverage of our significantly expanded 
equities and fixed income business is suitably aligned with the strengths 
required in our corporate finance department.
I nv e s t m e nt 	B a n k i n g 	–	O u t l o o k
Evolution Securities Limited has made significant progress in 2009, 
both quantitatively and qualitatively, and we intend to continue to 
build on that growth in 2010. The distribution strengths that have 
been established in both equities and fixed income securities have 
been remarkable. A key opportunity is to marry these strengths with 
our capital markets services in both equity and debt, allowing us to 
find new and innovative financing solutions for our clients in a 
changing financing environment.
G r o u p 	–	O u t l o o k
The core of the Group strategy since early 2007 has been principally 
based around risk avoidance, combined with tight control of costs and 
a highly liquid and unencumbered Balance Sheet. This allowed the 
Group to capture significant optionality at the end of 2008 and into 
the beginning of 2009, in both the Investment Banking and Private 
Clients businesses. Already in 2009 we are beginning to see the returns 
and momentum that these actions have produced. A key part of our 
strategy is to continue to increase our strategic risk appetite within 
the parameters that we have laid out in this report, in order to continue 
to develop our recurring revenue and profit potential, and to drive 
further shareholder returns.
We note the regulatory dislocation beginning within the Investment 
Banking sector and the inevitable exit of capital deployed, and continue 
to see opportunities for increasing our risk appetite and potential 
returns. Our emphasis on agency skills, wherever possible, and a 
partnership structure achieved through shared future equity returns, 
allows flexibility of remuneration to play a key role in the retention 
of our talent and the attraction of new partners. In the future this 
should be at the core of further real and sustained growth.
The Group is very well positioned, and aims to continue to develop 
the strong momentum in revenue and profit growth in 2009 from all 
our activities. Although there is much uncertainty in global markets 
which provides challenges to short term trading, this only goes to 
underpin the long-term stability that the markets require to operate 
more effectively, and in fact reflects an underestimation of the global 
economic recovery and the beneficial impact of the robust nature of 
the capitalist model.
We look forward to further opportunities for growth in 2010, and I 
would like to thank all our employees for the extraordinary efforts  
to deliver the transformations to the Group over the course of 2009.

The Group returned to profitability in 2009 with statutory operating profit of £11.1m, increasing by £28.4m from the £17.3m loss reported in 
2008. Adjusted operating profit
1
 (the Group’s principal performance measure) also increased significantly to £20.8m.
The increase in profitability was principally due to the Investment Banking division generating a much improved performance, resulting 
in its adjusted operating profit growing to £18.5m (2008: £5.4m loss).

 An explanation of the adjusted basis performance measurement, details of the adjusted items and reconciliation between adjusted earnings and statutory earnings is given on pages

Group results
T o t a l	I n c o m e
Total Group income for the year more than doubled to £129.4m 
reflecting record levels in both divisions. Investment Banking 
income grew by 193% to £87.0m, as a result of strong growth across 
all areas of its business, in particular the institutional markets 
businesses (equities and fixed income). Private Client income grew 
by 23% to £42.4m, as a result of continued strong growth in assets 
under management (“AUM”), up 37% to £5.2 billion.
O p e r a t i n g 	E x p e n s e s
Adjusted operating expenses in 2009 were £108.6m (2008: £66.6m) 
made up as follows:
Core operating costs increased by 33% to £67.6m (2008: £50.8m). 
This was driven by the expansion of headcount in the year. Average 
front office headcount increased by 32% in the year with total 
average headcount increasing by 25% to 457.
Core operating costs per front office head have marginally increased 
to £258,000 per annum from 2008. The Group continues to manage 
its core operating cost base very carefully.

Performance costs include all short-term incentive remuneration, 
inclusive of employers national insurance and the cost of those share 
options arising from the deferral of elements of annual bonus into 
Evolution Group shares (2009: £1.0m, 2008: £nil). Performance 
costs increased by 159% in the period to £41.0m (2008: £15.8m),  
in line with increased revenue and profitability levels.
F i n a n c i n g
Net finance income declined to £0.3m in 2009 from £4.6m in 2008 
as a result of lower interest rates impacting the income the Group 
received from its excess cash balances.
T a x a t i o n
The Group’s statutory tax charge was £1.9m, equivalent to 17% of 
statutory profit before tax of £11.1m. The tax charge in 2009 is lower 
than the UK tax rate of 28% primarily due to deferred tax on options 
arising from the movement in the Group’s share price more than offsetting 
the impact of disallowable expenses. The Group’s continuing utilisation 
of its historic tax losses means that no material corporation tax is payable.
B a l a n c e 	S h e e t
The Group’s Balance Sheet remains strong. The Group continues to carry 
capital significantly in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements.
N o n 	C u r r e nt 	A s s e t s
Non current assets increased in the period due to the inclusion  
of investments in associates following disposals of majority stakes  
in Evolution Securities China Limited and WDB Capital UK 
Equity Fund.
Other non-current assets declined by £2.1m in the year from £30.8m 
to £28.7m, primarily as a result of the release of deferred tax assets 
upon the exercise of employee share options during the period.
W o r k i n g 	C a p i t a l
The Group had negative working capital at 31 December 2009 compared 
to a small positive amount at the end of 2008. The increase in working 
capital of £5.5m over the year from investment banking institutional 
market activities (trading portfolio and trading counterparty balances) 
was more than offset by the negative working capital impact of higher 
staff performance incentive accruals as at 31 December 2009 compared 
to 31 December 2008.
T r a d i n g	P o s i t i o n s
Net trading portfolio assets increased by £9.6m in the year. 
This reflects more normalised levels of risk appetite on equity small 
and mid-cap market making books, with inventory levels severely 
cut at the end of 2008 during the dislocation in financial markets.
The average net trading positions during 2009 were £6.7m  
(2008: £11.2m).
N e t 	C o u nt e r p a r t y 	R e c e i v a b l e s
Working capital resulting from the Group’s public markets activities 
continues to be carefully managed and average working capital 
balances during 2009 were £30.4m (2008: £33.8m). 
Cash balances remain strong with cash and cash equivalents of 
£109.5m at the end of 2009, an increase of £5.9m (2008: £103.6m). 
The Group maintains its policy of maintaining a highly liquid 
Balance Sheet at all times. Cash balances at 31 December 2009 
represent 80% of shareholder funds (2008: 70%) and are held in call 
or overnight cash deposits.
C a s h 	F l o w
The Group generated net positive cash flow of £6.1m in 2009  
(2008: £1.8m). This resulted from very strong growth in cash from 
operating activities of £33.8m (2008: £15.6m) due to the increased 
level of operating profitability and positive inflows from working 
capital reductions.
Capital expenditure on fixed assets and intangibles of £2.7m 
remained at similarly low levels to 2008 (2008: £2.3m).
Net cash out flows from financing activities increased significantly 
during 2009 to £25.2m (2008: £5.7m). This resulted from a significant 
increase in the purchase of Group shares (on behalf of the Employee 
Share Trust) to satisfy outstanding employee share option awards.
This was based on the Group’s decision to fully hedge all outstanding 
employee share options during the year. This was achieved via the 
purchase of 16 million shares during the period at a cost of £23.7m.

Business Review
Financial Review (continued)
A d j u s t e d 	B a s i s 	E x p l a n a t i o n
The Group has historically measured performance on an ‘Adjusted 
Basis’, as it has considered this to be a better reflection of the underlying 
performance of the Group’s businesses. In addition to being the basis 
of performance criteria against which incentive awards were measured, 
adjusted measures such as ‘Adjusted Operating Profit’ and ‘Adjusted 
EPS’ have been followed by research analysts covering the Group.
Items of income and expense falling in the categories explained in 
more detail on this page are excluded from the Group’s results on an 
adjusted basis.
Whilst such items have continued to represent a material impact on 
the Group’s results, the Board has considered it appropriate to disclose 
their impact and focus its financial review of the year on ‘Adjusted 
Basis’ figures where appropriate. In particular, the Group’s principal 
performance measure, ‘Adjusted Operating Profit’ (which excludes 
the net loss on available-for-sale financial instruments, various expense 
items not considered part of the ongoing business profitability and 
the cost of share options), is used as the basis for discussion of the 
Group and divisional performance for 2009.
The total impact of adjusted items on the Group’s results is steadily 
declining and accordingly the Board anticipates altering its principal 
performance measure to Statutory Operating Profit from 2010 onwards.
O p e r a t i n g 	E x p e n s e s
Expense items excluded from adjusted results have fallen principally 
into three categories:
> Charge for share options granted.
 This relates to the income statement costs of share options granted 
to employees. This charge peaked in the years 2006, 2007 and 2008 
and primarily resulted from the options granted to key employees 
in the period 2003 to 2008. The incidence of such option grants 
has declined significantly and going forward the Group’s key long- 
term equity incentive component of performance pay will be achieved 
through the new partnership equity plans (see Directors Remuneration 
Report, page 36). A £1.0m charge relating to deferred bonuses is 
included in the adjusted basis results as an operating expense in 2009.
> Private Client integration and take on costs associated with 
material acquisitions such as Williams de Broë Limited, Singer 
and Friedlander and the Edinburgh team within the Private 
Client business. 
> Non recurring costs, which for 2009 comprise the settlement 
of a dispute with HMRC concerning potential tax obligations  
of certain legacy employees. The prior year comparative figure 
relates to redundancy costs.  
The table above summarises the calculation of adjusted basis EPS.

Private Clients adjusted operating profit increased by 14% to £4.1m 
(2008: £3.6m). The operating profit margin improved to 12% in the 
second half of 2009 from 6% in the first half, resulting in a 10% full 
year margin, in line with 2008.
Total income grew by 23% to £42.4m for the year, primarily due to a 
40% increase in management fees to £24.4m (2008: £17.4m). This was 
driven by continued strong growth in assets under management (up 37% 
to £5.2bn from £3.8bn) which resulted from net new fund sales of 
£322m (2008: £550m) and increases in equity market valuations (25% 
increase in FTSE All-share and 13% in FTSE APCIMS – Balanced). 
Transactional income increased by 21% to £17.0m in 2009 (2008 
£14.1m), continuing the recovery from the second half of 2008.
Segregated interest income was significantly lower in 2009 at £1.0m 
(2008: £3.0m) as a result of the sharp and prolonged decline in interest 
rates during the year.
Operating expenses in 2009 were £38.3m (2008: £30.9m), made up  
as follows:
Core operating costs increased by 21% to £30.3m (2008: £25.0m). 
This was driven by the increase in average headcount throughout the 
year and transactional related costs.
The reduction in core operating costs per average front office 
headcount reflects continued cost control within the business and 2008 
costs incurred on the integration of the Singer and Friedlander and 
Edinburgh teams. 
Performance costs increased to £8.0m from £5.9m in 2008, a 36% 
increase. This was as a result of increased formulaic payments driven by 
higher revenues and profitability, together with integration linked costs 
associated with the Singer & Friedlander acquisition.

generated a profit of £18.5m (2008: £5.4m loss). Total income increased 
by 193% to £87.0m (2008: £29.7m) with all businesses, corporate finance, 
equities and fixed income contributing to the significant increase. 
Corporate finance income increased by 68% to £15.5m (2008: £9.2m), 
largely due to some recovery of corporate activity levels in the second 
half of 2009.
Equity sales commissions increased by 74% in 2009 to a record level  
of £23.2m (2008: £13.3m), primarily as a result of the expansion into 
large-cap and Pan-European equity coverage during the year. 
Commissions earned steadily increased throughout the second half of 
2009 as we integrated the new hires across research, trading and sales. 
Commissions continue to increase as we gain market share, with first 
quarter 2010 rates approximately 15% above second half 2009 levels, 
despite continued declines in market wide volumes.   
Market making income increased to £13.0m for 2009 (2008: £0.1m) as 
equity markets recovered some equilibrium after the dislocation experienced 
in 2008. The partial return of liquidity on small and mid cap stocks, 
almost totally absent towards the end of 2008 and beginning of 2009, 
has enabled more normalised levels of income to be earned.
Fixed income revenues increased substantially in 2009 to £35.3m 
(2008: £7.1m), reflecting two key factors:
1. Most significantly, the increase in the breadth of product offering  
and the range of clients we service increased dramatically during the 
year. This was achieved through the recruitment initiative beginning 
at the end of 2008 and continuing to date; and
2. The withdrawal of capital by major investment banks in the early 
part of 2009 resulted in significant widening of spreads across fixed 
income and credit products. As stability has gradually returned  
to financial markets spreads have narrowed, in particular within 
investment grade instruments, although not to levels witnessed 
prior to the credit downturn.
Operating expenses in 2009 were £68.5m (2008: £35.1m), made up 
as follows:
Core operating costs increased by 43% to £38.1m (2008: £26.6m). 
This was driven by the increase in average headcount throughout the 
year and transactional related costs.
The overall increase in average core operating costs per front office 
employee is a result of: an increased proportion of more experienced 
staff earning higher salaries, partially offset by improved utilisation of 
the businesses infrastructure platform, including increased occupancy 
of existing office space, from the increased headcount.
Performance costs increased to £30.4m in the year (2008: £8.5m) as  
a result of higher performance incentive payments in line with the 
improvement in revenues and profitability, together with the integration 
linked costs associated with the build out of the large-cap and Pan-
European equities business.

The Group’s other activities consist of the central support costs not 
recovered from the operating businesses.
Other activities encompass Parent Company and central costs, 
including the cost of the Group Board, in addition to central support 
functions (principally finance) which are not directly recharged to 
the operating divisions.

In light of these results the Board declares a final dividend of 1.70p per share, 
up 34% from the prior year final dividend of 1.27p. This reflects the Board’s 
ongoing commitment to a progressive dividend policy. The dividend 
is payable on 18 May 2010 to shareholders on the register at 16 April 2010.

P r i n c i p a l 	R i s k s 	a n d 	U n c e r t a i nt i e s
Details of the key risks facing the Group and the controls that have 
been put in place to mitigate them can be found below. 
Reputational risk
Reputational risk is the risk of damage to the Group’s image as a 
result of the inability to retain and generate business due to adverse 
public opinion. The Board has established policies and procedures 
that provide direction on managing reputational risk focusing on 
reducing loss of confidence amongst existing and potential stakeholders.
Market risk
The Group, through ESL, holds positions in equities which are 
subject to price fluctuation. There is therefore a risk that ESL will 
suffer a loss in the event of a significant market correction. Positions 
are subject to limits which are independently monitored by the risk 
department. 
Retention of key staff
The retention of and the ability to attract new staff with the right 
capabilities and experience is central to the success of the Group’s 
operations. The Group mitigates the risk of loss of key staff through 
its employment policies and remuneration and reward framework. 
The Group supports the principles set out in the FSA’s code of best 
practice on remuneration policies issued in February 2009. In 
January 2010 shareholders approved the introduction of new long 
term incentive arrangements designed to further align the interests 
of key employees with those of shareholders, and to encourage 
medium to long term commitment of senior staff. 
Major infrastructure incident 
There is a risk that an incident the Group is involved in, directly or 
indirectly, could cause possible damage to the Group’s or key vendor’s 
infrastructure, which in turn would also affect the Group’s reputation 
or cause financial loss. The Group has controls in place, including 
business continuity and disaster recovery plans to maintain the integrity 
and efficiency of its systems, while ensuring the sustainability of 
operations despite a significant disruption.  
Information security
The focus on data privacy in the marketplace continues to gain greater 
attention as the number and frequency of data privacy related events 
increases. The FSA issued guidance on how customer personal data 
should be safeguarded in April 2008. The Group is currently finalising 
an internal audit of its data security arrangements to provide a risk 
based, independent assessment of management controls. This includes 
a review of current policies, procedures and technical and administrative 
controls designed to safeguard personal data.   
Financial crime
This is the risk that the Group suffers a loss from fraud. This could 
be through the deliberate over-riding of internal controls, through 
an external party successfully overcoming the Group’s controls  
(e.g. through identity theft) or as a result of the Group’s remuneration 
and reward strategy. Firms may be at greater risk of financial crime 
due to the current economic stresses at the individual and corporate 
level. The Group believes that it has sufficient controls in place to 
mitigate the risk of financial crime including reviews of the current 
controls in place throughout the Group to ensure controls are robust 
and to determine where improvements can be made through 
Compliance, Risk and where appropriate Internal Audit. The Evolution Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 23
Regulatory risk
The Group’s principal business subsidiaries are all regulated entities. 
There is always a risk of regulatory action given the markets in which 
the Group operates including its Private Clients division which is 
expanding its client base and where the FSA is demonstrating an 
increasing focus on the fair treatment of customers, staff training and 
corporate governance arrangements. Furthermore, the increasing 
focus of regulators on all aspects of financial services companies’ 
activities represents an ongoing risk to all the Group’s businesses.
   
The Audit Committee considered whether there had been any material 
failings or weaknesses in the internal controls of the Group. Following 
the FSA ARROW visit in September 2008, the governance and 
committee structures below Board level have been further enhanced. 
In Williams de Broë there is continued focus on treating customers 
fairly (“TCF”) and ensuring that suitability of our investment products 
to our clients can be continuously demonstrated. This has included 
significant investment in processes and technology during the year. 
Risk management policies – financial risk management
The risk management framework that exists within the Group is 
detailed in note 3 to the Financial Statements. The Group Board  
is responsible for approving all risk management policies and for 
determining the overall risk appetite for the Group. The Group’s 
Directors have delegated to a sub-committee, the Risk Committee, 
the responsibility for setting the risk management policies applied by 
the Group and its subsidiaries. The purpose of the Risk Committee 
is to monitor and assess all types of risk within the Group and to 
ensure that internal controls are properly established so that the 
Group’s risk exposure is commensurate with the wishes of the Board. 
In addition, the Risk Committee tracks external market events and 
tries to evaluate their impact on the Group. The Risk Committee 
meets regularly and is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer. The Risk 
Department has day-to-day responsibility for monitoring, mitigating 
and reporting risks within the Group and for escalating issues to 
senior management. The Risk Department follows the guidelines 
laid down by the Credit Policy, the Credit Limit Book, the Trading 
Policy Statement and the Operational Risk Policy as approved by 
the Group Board, the Audit Committee and the Risk Committee. 
The Treasury Department is responsible for hedging foreign exchange 
risk and for managing liquidity. The Group Board receives a monthly 
risk report detailing market and credit risk exposures, operational 
risk incidents and losses and key risk indicators. 
Capital adequacy and liquidity risk
Details regarding the Group’s capital adequacy can be found in  
its Pillar 3 disclosures at www.evgplc.com/Reports-Presentations. 
The Group has a strong and liquid Balance Sheet with no debt and  
a significant excess of capital.
C h a r i t a b l e 	D o n a t i o n s
During the year, the Group made charitable donations of £10,520 
(2008: £10,121). The Group’s general policy with respect to charitable 
donations is to donate to causes that are suggested by the Group’s 
employees, particularly where such staff are taking part in fundraising 
events. The Group does not set a pre-determined level of charitable 
donations, retaining the flexibility to respond accordingly to staff 
participation in charitable events. The amount donated included the 
following payments: £5,000 to ACE Africa, £1,500 to the Institute 
of Cancer Research, £1,000 to each of the following: the NSPCC, 
the Grundisburg Ward of the Ipswich Hospital and Parkinson’s 
Disease Society. The remaining balance was made up of de minimis 
amounts donated to various other charities.

Directors’ Report (continued)
C r e d i t o r s ’ 	P a y m e nt	P o l i c y
It is the Group’s policy to agree appropriate terms and conditions  
for its transactions with suppliers by means ranging from standard 
terms and conditions to individually negotiated contracts. Suppliers 
are paid according to agreed terms and conditions, provided that 
the supplier meets those terms and conditions. The accounts payable 
function for the Group and Company is carried out by a Group 
Company, Evolution Group Services Limited. Average trade creditor 
days for the Group as at the year end was 34 days (2008: 27 days).
E m p l o y e e s
The average and actual number of employees, including Directors, 
employed by the Group and their remuneration is disclosed in note 
10 to the Financial Statements, with key management compensation 
disclosed in note 35 to the Financial Statements.
E m p l o y m e nt 	P o l i c i e s
The Group aims to create a partnership culture across all subsidiaries 
by maintaining a commitment to establishing appropriate forums 
for employees to be involved in decision making across the business, 
by communicating changes in an appropriate manner and by 
establishing appropriate reward frameworks that enable employees 
to benefit in the overall success of the Company. The introduction  
of new long term incentive arrangements for senior employees linked 
to the value creation in the subsidiary in which an individual works 
will support the ongoing development of this culture and mindset. 
In addition, all employees are offered the opportunity to participate 
in equity ownership through the Employees’ Share Ownership Plan 
(“ESOP”) which allows every employee to purchase up to £1,500 
worth of the Company’s shares per annum on a tax efficient basis. 
The Group supports the principles set out in the FSA’s code of best 
practice on remuneration policies.
The extent to which our success of creating the desired partnership 
culture is measured by labour turnover and stability index (the %  
of employees who were employed at the start of the year against the 
end of the year). Labour turnover reduced from 22.2% in 2008 to 
19.7% in 2009. Our aim is to maintain turnover at the 20% level. 
Our stability index increased from 80% in 2008 to 82% in 2009 and 
as part of embedding the partnership culture throughout the Group, 
our aim is to see this increase in 2010. The average length of service 
across the Group is three years which we also hope to increase as 
our culture begins to promote the long term retention of employees.
All employees are subject to ongoing performance reviews to drive 
employee productivity throughout the year. Regular assessment 
provides an opportunity to ensure employee engagement is maximised 
with two way feedback on issues and ideas.  In sourcing the right 
candidates for the Company, full and fair consideration is given to 
applications for employment that are made to the Group by disabled 
persons, it endeavours to continue the employment of and arrange 
appropriate training for, any of our employees who have become 
disabled during their period of employment with us or otherwise 
will provide the training and career development and promotion  
of disabled persons we employ as needs require. 
It is Group policy that no employee or applicant for employment 
receives less favourable treatment (including training and development, 
recruitment and promotion) by the Group or any other employee, on 
the grounds of sex, marital status, race, colour, nationality, ethnic origin, 
sexual orientation, political opinion, religion, age or disability. It is 
policy that persons in or applying for employment are not disadvantaged 
by conditions, management attitudes, behaviour or requirements that 
cannot be justified. There are established whistle blowing procedures 
for individuals to report suspected breaches of law or regulations or 
other improprieties.
S u b s t a nt i a l 	S h a r e h o l d i n g s
As at 19 March 2010 (being a date not more than one month prior

Details of the changes in authorised and issued share capital during 
the year of the Company are set out in note 29 to the Financial Statements. 
In 2009 the Group made market purchases of its own shares only for 
the purpose of acquiring shares for The Evolution Group Plc Employees’ 
Share Trust (the “Trust”) to settle outstanding awards under its share 
based incentive plans. The Group did not purchase any of its own 
shares for cancellation in 2009 or up to the date of this report.

Subject to authorisation by shareholder resolution, the Company may 
purchase its own shares, in accordance with the relevant legislation. 
The minimum price which must be paid for such shares is £0.50 and 
the maximum price payable is 105% of the average middle market 
quotations for the five business days preceding the purchase. At the 
Annual General Meeting held on 19 May 2009, members approved 
the Company’s authority to make market purchases on the London 
Stock Exchange of up to 22,400,000 ordinary shares of 1p each 
(“Shares”) of the Company (2008: 22,300,000), representing less 
than 10%, (2008: 9.97%) of the issued share capital of the Company 
at 2 April 2009.   The Evolution Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 25
The authority given by members at the last Annual General 
Meeting for the Company to purchase its own shares expires on  
31 August 2010 or, if earlier, at the next Annual General Meeting  
at which a similar resolution will be proposed under the Companies 
Act 2006. The Directors believe that it is in the best interests of  
the Company for the authority to be renewed at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting for a period which shall expire at the end 
of 15 months from the date of the meeting or, if earlier, at the next 
Annual General Meeting. Accordingly, it is intended to propose,  
as Special Business, at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting,  
a Special Resolution to renew the Directors’ existing authority to 
purchase shares of the Company, which shall be limited to 10% 
(2008: 9.97%) of the issued share capital of 232,114,263 at 25 March 
2010 or 23,200,000 (2008: 22,400,000) shares.

the expiration of his term of office. The office of Director shall be 
vacated if (not being an Executive Director whose contract precludes 
resignation) he resigns, becomes bankrupt, has a receiving order 
made against him, he becomes of unsound mind, if he is absent from 
meetings of the Directors for six months without leave, if he is removed 
or becomes prohibited from being a Director or if he is requested in 
writing by all the other Directors to resign his office. The business of

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Financial Statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial Statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared 
the Group and Parent Company Financial Statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union. The Financial Statements are required by 
law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company 
and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
The Directors consider that in preparing the Group’s Financial 
Statements on pages 42 to 74 that they have:
> selected suitable accounting policies and applied them 
consistently;
> made judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
> stated that the Financial Statements comply with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union; and
> prepared the Financial Statements on the going concern basis, 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue 
in business, in which case there should be supporting assumptions 
or qualifications as necessary. 
The Directors are also required by the Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules of the Financial Services Authority to include a management 
report containing a fair review of the business and a description of 
the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group and Company.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records 
that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that 
the Financial Statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
Financial Statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the 
Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in  
the Biography section of this report, are set out on pages 20 to 21 
confirm that to the best of their knowledge:
> the Company and the Group Financial Statements, which have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and results of the Group and the Company; and
> the Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the Group 
and the Company, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that it faces.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the Group website, www.evgplc.com. Legislation in the UK governing 
the preparation and dissemination of Financial Statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

United Kingdom company law (Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006) 
requires each Director to make an individual statement regarding 
the disclosure of information to the auditors. The statement must 
confirm that as at the date of this report and as far as the Director is 
aware there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s 
auditors are unaware; and that the Director has taken all the steps 
he ought to have taken in order to make himself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are 
aware of that information. A Director is deemed to have taken all 
the steps necessary that he ought to have taken if he has made such 
enquiries of his fellow Directors and of the Company’s auditors for 
that purpose, and taken such other steps, if any, for that purpose as 
are required by his duty as a Director of the Company to exercise 
due care, skill and diligence. All of the Directors of the Company as 
at the date of this report have provided such a statement to the Company. 
The Company’s auditors have been advised that confirmation has 
been given and should be interpreted in accordance with the 
provisions of Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006. The Evolution Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 27

The Group has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) as 
auditors of the Parent Company and all material subsidiaries since 
2001. During the year the Audit Committee reviewed the cost 
effectiveness, objectivity and independence of the auditors in the 
light of assurances received relating to their internal quality and 
control procedures, the promptness and accuracy of their work and 
other services obtained from their firm. The Audit Committee as a 
matter of principle will not award non-audit work to the auditors 
unless it is satisfied, following enquiry, that the provision of such 
services would not prejudice the independence and objectivity of the 
audit. The auditors disclosed the level of fees received in respect of 
the various services provided by their firm in addition to audit during 
2009. They confirmed to the Audit Committee that they did not believe 
that the level of non-audit fees had affected their independence.  
The Audit Committee is responsible for implementing a policy for 
the engagement of the external auditors to supply non-audit services. 
The most appropriate advisers are used for non-audit work taking 
account of the need to maintain independence. The Group does not 
maintain a policy of regular fixed-term rotation of auditors.
In addition to their statutory audit responsibilities, the Group will 
typically use the auditors for other work that they are well placed to 
undertake in that role. This includes areas such as: regulatory reviews 
and other ancillary audit work; work in respect of acquisitions and 
disposals; and tax compliance. 
Several firms are considered for other work, including the auditors 
in some instances. In such cases due consideration is given to the 
impact of the assignment on the independence of the auditors and  
to their qualifications to carry out the role.
The Board were satisfied that PwC had sufficient controls in place 
to guard against any possible conflicts of interest and to ensure the 
objectivity and independence of the audit. PwC were chosen in the 
interests of cost effectiveness, efficiency and timeliness.
Having given consideration to the extra work undertaken by the 
auditors, and after careful discussion with the responsible partner in 
PwC and the Executive Directors, the Audit Committee is satisfied 
as to the independence of the statutory auditors.
Because of this review, the Audit Committee recommended to the 
Board that the auditors be re-elected and a resolution to re-appoint 
them as the Company’s auditors will be proposed at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting.
PwC have indicated their willingness to continue in office, and 
pursuant to section 485 of the Companies Act 2006, an ordinary 
resolution re-appointing them as auditors and authorising the 
Directors to determine their remuneration will be proposed at the 
2010 Annual General Meeting.

Corporate Governance
C o m b i n e d 	C o d e	
The Board of Directors (“the Board”) support the principles of good 
corporate governance and the code of best practice laid down by the 
Combined Code issued in June 2008 (“the Code”). The Directors 
consider that the Group has been in compliance with the provisions 
set out in Section 1 of the Code on corporate governance, save for 
compliance with Schedule A due to the absence of a performance 
bonus ceiling in the operation of the Group’s remuneration policy. 
This exception is explained in more detail in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 33 to 40. 
The Group does not appoint Non-Executive Directors for a specified 
term as required by provision A7.2 of the Combined Code. 
Following successful completion of one year’s service, however, the 
Group may terminate their contracts by two months’ notice in 
writing. Additionally the current policy of the Board is that Non-
Executive Directors should not serve more than nine years if it is 
determined that this would prejudice their independence.  
The manner in which the Company has applied the principles of 
good governance set out in the Combined Code is outlined below 
and in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 33 to 40.
D i r e c t o r s
At the year end, the Board comprised three Executive and five  
Non-Executive Directors. Biographies of all Directors as at the  
date of this report are set out on pages 20 to 21.    
The Non-Executive Directors are Martin Gray, the Non-Executive 
Chairman, Lord MacLaurin, the Senior Independent Director, 
Peter Gibbs, Mark Nicholls, Chris Chambers and Roger Perkin.  
All are independent in character and judgement as set out in the 
Code as they have no relationships and there are no circumstances 
which are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, each Director’s 
judgement. The Non-Executive Directors bring a wealth of experience 
to the Board. In particular their complementary skills include legal 
and accounting, asset management and corporate finance, demonstrable 
leadership and experience at the highest level and practical 
experience of the current regulatory and market environment.  
There is a formal schedule of matters reserved for decision by  
the Board, which is reviewed annually and otherwise as required. 
This was last updated in October 2009. The Board is responsible  
for the overall strategy of the Group, acquisitions and divestments, 
major capital projects, financial, budgetary, material risk and 
regulatory compliance matters, corporate governance and the 
employment of senior employees.  
The following table identifies the scheduled number of Board 
meetings and Committee meetings held during the year to 31

The Remuneration Committee also held 8 procedural meetings at 
relatively short notice attended by Martin Gray and Peter Gibbs. 
The number of meetings also reflects the work of the Committee in 
the period leading up to the introduction of the partnership equity 
awards schemes in 2010 being the Group Joint Share Options Plan 
(“JSOP”) and subsidiary company Growth Share Options Plan 
(“GSOP”).

3. Nicholas Irens availability was impacted by periods of ill health and prior 
commitments.
4. Mark Nicholls was unable to attend 2 of the 10 substantive Remuneration

The terms of the Directors’ service agreements and letters of 
appointment are summarised in the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
on pages 33 to 40. In accordance with the Code, all Directors are 
subject to election by shareholders at the first Annual General 
Meeting of shareholders after their appointment. Thereafter, all 
Directors are subject to retirement by rotation and re-election at 
least every three years.   
R e t i r e m e nt 	b y 	R o t a t i o n
The Board has agreed that all Directors will submit themselves for 
re-election at this and subsequent Annual General Meetings. Both 
Chris Chambers and Roger Perkin will retire and seek election at 
this AGM given that this is the first AGM following their appointments. 
Resolutions proposing the election and re-election of all Directors 
are set out in the Notice of Annual General Meeting.  
The Chairman confirms, and in respect of the Chairman, the 
Senior Independent Director confirms, that all the Directors whether 
seeking election, re-election or otherwise and following appropriate 
formal enhanced performance evaluation continue to perform 
effectively and demonstrate commitment to their positions.  The Evolution Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 29

In accordance with the Code, there is a clear division of responsibilities 
set out in writing and agreed by the Board between the running of 
the Board by the Chairman and the responsibility for running the 
Group by the Chief Executive. The Chairman, Martin Gray, is 
responsible for the leadership and conduct of the Board and for 
ensuring the Directors receive accurate, timely and clear information, 
and the effective contribution of Non-Executive Directors.   
The Chief Executive, Alex Snow, is responsible for the day-to-day 
and strategic management of the Group’s activities. He is ultimately 
responsible for the operating plans and budgets for the businesses, 
monitoring business performance and ensuring these are reported 
on to the Board. The Board believes that these arrangements facilitate 
the effective management of the Group and provide a strong control 
environment as no individual has unfettered powers of decision.
Lord MacLaurin, the Senior Independent Director, is available  
to shareholders if they have concerns where contact through the 
normal channels is deemed inappropriate.
A statement of the Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the 
accounts is set out in the Directors’ Report on pages 22 to 27. 
The Group has taken out appropriate insurance cover in respect  
of legal action against its Directors and Officers. In addition to 
insurance cover for Directors and Officers’ liability, the Group has 
arranged insurance cover in respect of professional indemnity and 
corporate crime, employers’ liability, and public and products 
liability.
I n f o r m a t i o n 	a n d 	P r of e s s i o n a l 	D e v e l o p m e nt
As stated above, the Chairman is responsible for ensuring that Directors 
receive accurate, timely and clear information. The Company 
Secretary is responsible for advising the Board, through the 
Chairman, on all corporate governance matters and is responsible 
to the Board for ensuring that Board procedures are complied with. 
During the year, the Board introduced a formal and detailed 
Corporate Governance Framework (“Framework”) across the 
Group. The Framework sets out the Group’s practices in those 
matters covered by the Code and relevant laws and regulations and 
sets out those matters reserved to and delegated from the Group’s 
Boards and Committees. All Directors have access to the advice  
and services of the Company Secretary and there are procedures  
in place for taking independent professional advice to ensure that 
individual Directors and the Board Committees are provided with 
sufficient resources to undertake their duties, at the Group’s expense  
if required.   
New Directors are provided with the opportunity to undertake a 
thorough induction on joining the Board commensurate with their 
existing knowledge and understanding of the business of the Group. 
Training needs are monitored and addressed as part of the annual 
performance evaluation process detailed below.
R e v i e w 	of	I nt e r n a l 	C o nt r o l s 	
The Board is responsible for identifying, evaluating and managing 
the significant risks faced by the Group to safeguard shareholders’ 
investments and the Group’s assets. The Board acknowledges that  
it is responsible for the Group’s system of internal controls and for 
setting the control framework including financial, operational and 
compliance controls and risk management systems, and for reviewing 
the effectiveness of these systems. The principal risks and uncertainties 
section on page 22 to 23 and the Financial Instruments and Risk 
Management Framework detailed in note 3 to the Financial Statements 
describe the key risks facing the Group and how they are mitigated.
The system of internal control, which includes the Group’s public 
reporting processes, is designed to manage rather than eliminate the 
risk of failure to achieve business objectives. Therefore, this can only 
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The Board, through the Audit Committee, reviews the effectiveness 
of the system of internal control. In March 2010, the Audit Committee 
considered the progress made during the year and assessed the 
status of the Group’s system of internal controls. In evaluating the 
effectiveness of the internal control framework, the Audit Committee 
considered how risks are identified, monitored, mitigated and 
reported throughout the Group.
The Audit Committee reviewed the key risks facing the Group and 
the controls that have been put in place to mitigate them.  Changes 
to the risk environment were highlighted, as were improvements to 
the control structure: most notably in the continued restructuring 
and upgrading of the compliance and risk functions, the strengthening 
of our corporate governance framework and enhanced procedures, 
systems and reporting around suitability and new business processes. 
In accordance with the Combined Code, during the year the Audit 
Committee has considered the continued need for an internal audit 
function and whether this function should be internally or externally 
facilitated. The Audit Committee has determined that the needs of 
the Group would be best served by retaining the current arrangements 
of having an internal audit function that is externally facilitated 
whilst providing increased focus on the areas to be audited. 
The Audit Committee observed that during the year the internal 
control framework including controls relevant to financial reporting 
and the preparation of the Financial Statements continued to 
provide reasonable assurance that appropriate internal controls are 
in place or are further strengthened where it was identified that 
potential risks or weaker controls existed.

Management and Governance
Corporate Governance (continued)
The Audit Committee considered whether there had been any 
material failings or weaknesses in the internal controls of the Group. 
The Audit Committee reported that risks are adequately managed 
and mitigated through the system of internal controls and that there 
were no material failings or weaknesses in the Group’s internal 
control system during the period under review. The Board, therefore, 
confirms that throughout the year ended 31 December 2009 and up 
to the approval date of the Financial Statements, there has been an 
on-going process of identifying, evaluating and managing the 
significant risks faced by the Group and that the Group has 
complied with the Turnbull Committee’s guidance for Directors. 
The Audit Committee is also responsible for reviewing external 
financial reporting. The Committee reports to the Board on the 
Group’s full year and half year results, having examined the 
accounting policies on which they are based and ensures compliance 
with relevant accounting standards and legislation. 
P e r f o r m a n c e
The Board conducts a formal and rigorous annual evaluation of 
individual Directors, its own performance and that of its Committees 
and for 2009 has further improved its processes in this regard through 
defined and consistent individual Director evaluations. The Board 
annually considers whether it might be appropriate to engage a 
third party to conduct its performance evaluations and, whilst it is 
considering the Walker recommendations, in this regard has concluded 
that for the current year the structure provides sufficient scrutiny to 
meet the needs of the Group. The Board strives to continue to meet 
corporate governance best practice and efforts continue to be made 
to ensure the correct balance of information flow up to the Group 
Board. In its 2009 evaluation of performance, the Board recognised 
the need to continue to evolve and improve its own performance to 
meet the expectations of regulators and to meet best practice.  
The Individual Performance evaluation is conducted through the 
provision of a defined set of qualitative and quantitative assessment 
questions supported by comments from the appraisers. Appraisals 
were conducted for all the Directors during January to March 2010 
in respect of their performance in 2009. The Chairman confirms 
that all the Directors whether seeking election and re-election or 
otherwise continue to perform effectively and demonstrate 
commitment to their positions. 
In addition to the individual performance appraisals, the Board 
considers its overall performance as a body and the performance  
of its Committees. Each member of the Board completes a detailed 
‘Board Effectiveness’ questionnaire following the year end. 
Recognising the need for governance standards to continue to  
evolve and improve to meet the expectations of regulators and the 
Board, the Board was considered to be performing effectively 
throughout this process and no significant issues were raised.
Committee performance
Committee performance is reviewed as follows:
> The Audit and Remuneration Committees are subject to review 
by their own members. Each member completes a questionnaire 
to assess the effectiveness of the relevant Committee. The results 
for the 2009 annual review are collated by the Company Secretary 
and reviewed by the relevant Committee. The Chairman of the 
relevant Committee is responsible for leading a discussion on the 
results at the subsequent Board meeting. Both Committees are 
considered to be working effectively; 
> The Nomination Committee is subject to review by its own 
members and is considered to be working effectively.
The following committees deal with the specific aspects of the 
Group’s affairs:
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is comprised of three independent Non-Executive 
Directors. Nicholas Irens acted as Chairman of the Audit Committee 
until his resignation on 31 December 2009, with Lord MacLaurin and 
Mark Nicholls as members. Roger Perkin was appointed Chairman of 
the Audit Committee upon joining the Company as a Non-Executive 
Director on 27 January 2010. Roger Perkin, as a Chartered Accountant 
with recent and relevant financial experience gained with Ernst & 
Young LLP, was considered by the Nomination Committee to be 
appropriate for the role of Chairman of the Audit Committee. 
The Group’s external and internal auditors and the Executive Directors 
may attend Committee meetings by invitation. The Committee may 
request discussions with the external auditors following Audit Committee 
meetings. The discussions take place without Executive Directors being 
present, to ensure that there are no unresolved issues of concern.
The Terms of Reference for the Committee comply with the Combined 
Code and are available for inspection at the Company’s registered 
office and at the Annual General Meeting. A summary of these 
Terms is on the Group’s website: www.evgplc.com.  
The Audit Committee has primary responsibility for reviewing the 
external auditor’s independence, objectivity and the effectiveness of 
the audit process taking into consideration relevant UK professional 
and regulatory requirements; developing and implementing policy 
on the engagement of the external auditors to supply non-audit 
services and reporting to the Board and, identifying any matters 
which require action or improvement; considering the major findings 
of any internal investigations and management’s response; and 
monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the internal audit function. 
It is responsible for reviewing the 2009 Preliminary announcement, 
Annual Report, the Interim Results and announcement, Interim 
Management Statements and reports from the external auditors.    The Evolution Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 31
The Committee recommended to the Board for shareholder approval 
the re-appointment, remuneration and terms of engagement of the 
auditors during 2009. Through their review of the balance of audit 
and non-audit work performed and fees paid to PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP, the Committee concluded that auditors’ independence has 
been maintained throughout 2009 and the audit process was effective. 
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises five Non-Executive 
Directors all of whom are considered to be independent. Peter Gibbs 
has served as its Chairman since 29 May 2008. Lord MacLaurin 
continues to make a valuable contribution to the work of the Committee. 
Martin Gray, and Mark Nicholls were also members of the Committee 
during 2009 whilst Chris Chambers joined the Committee on 19 
November 2009. Nick Irens ceased to be a member of the Committee 
upon his retirement from the Board on 31 December 2009. 
The Remuneration Committee met ten times on substantive 
business during 2009 as part of the continuing review of the Group’s 
remuneration and reward structure. There were an additional eight 
meetings reflecting the procedural requirements of the Committee 
in its role of approving the grant and exercise of share awards below 
Board level. The number of meetings also reflected the consideration 
and adoption of new partnership equity arrangements, being the 
introduction of the “Partnership Equity Plans” ( Joint Share 
Ownership Plan for Executives of the Company and Growth Share 
Option Plans for senior employees of Evolution Securities Limited 
and Williams de Broë Limited). Further details of the partnership 
equity plans can be found on page 36 of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report. The Executive Directors attend certain parts of meetings  
of the Remuneration Committee by invitation but do not attend 
discussions on their own remuneration.  
The Terms of Reference for the Committee comply with the Combined 
Code and are available for inspection at the Company’s registered 
office and at the Annual General Meeting. These were updated in 
October 2009 principally to make reference to the need to consider, 
where appropriate, the principles set out in the FSA’s Code of 
practice on remuneration policies and to extend the remit of the 
Committee to recommending and monitoring the level and structure 
of remuneration for all employees. A summary of these Terms is also 
on the Group’s website: www.evgplc.com. 
The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee reports the 
Committee’s findings to the Board at the following Board meeting.  
Further details of how these responsibilities are executed and the 
Group’s policies on remuneration, service contracts and share 
options are given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 
33 to 40. 
Details of professional advice received on remuneration issues can 
be found in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 33 to 40.
Nomination Committee
The Committee includes Martin Gray as Chairman who is joined 
by Lord MacLaurin, and Mark Nicholls. Nick Irens left the Committee 
following his retirement from the Board on 31 December 2009.  
The Terms of Reference for the Committee comply with the 
Combined Code and are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office and at the Annual General Meeting. A summary  
of these Terms are on the Group’s website: www.evgplc.com.   
The Nomination Committee is responsible for all elements of the 
nomination process for the Executive and Non-Executive Directors 
of the Company. 
The Chairman of the Nomination Committee reports the 
Committee’s determinations to the Board at the following Board 
meeting and is available to report to shareholders at each Annual 
General Meeting.  
During the year, the Nomination Committee discussed succession 
planning for the Board. The Nomination Committee follows a process 
for nominating candidates for Board appointments which involves 
considering the structure, size and composition of the existing Board, 
determining a description of the role and capabilities required, 
drawing up a shortlist of candidates, holding a series of one-to-one 
meetings between the candidates and Non-Executive Directors, and 
then candidates meeting with all members of the Board. In 2009 the 
Committee used external consultants to assist with the search for 
both Executive and Non-Executive Directors. Future appointments 
will follow a similar process, with consideration given to whether 
external advertising or external advice is required.
The terms of appointment of Non-Executive Directors are detailed 
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 36 to 37. The terms 
of appointment and time commitments of Non-Executive Directors 
are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office.

ESG issues will be considered by the Board through the Risk Committee 
to identify, assess and manage the significant risks and opportunities 
affecting the Group’s long and short-term value arising from its 
handling of ESG matters, as well as opportunities to enhance value 
that may arise from an appropriate response. It has processes in place 
to identify and mitigate all material risks to the short and long-term 
value of the Group, and is always seeking to enhance value by wholly 
reasonable means. The Board has identified no ESG related risks 
that may significantly affect the Group’s short or long-term value.

Management and Governance
Directors’ Remmuneration Report
The Board has delegated to the Remuneration Committee the 
determination of Executive Directors’ remuneration. The constitution 
and operation of the Committee comply with the Best Practice 
Provisions on Directors’ remuneration in the Combined Code.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006 and schedule 8 to the large and medium-sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, the Listing 
Rules of the UK Listing Authority and the Combined Code. It describes 
how the Board has applied the principles of good governance relating 
to Directors’ remuneration, and where it does not comply and why 
this is the case. The Directors’ Remuneration Report will be submitted 
to the forthcoming Annual General Meeting for approval.
M e m b e r s 	of	t h e	R e m u n e r a t i o n 	C o m m i t t e e
The Remuneration Committee consists only of independent Non-
Executive Directors. Peter Gibbs served as Chairman throughout 
the year. The Committee members are Martin Gray, Lord MacLaurin, 
Mark Nicholls and Chris Chambers who joined the Committee  
on 19 November 2009 following his appointment to the Board on  
3 November 2009. 
The Board considers that all members of the Committee are 
independent within the meaning of the Combined Code as 
explained in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 28  
to 32. 
A d v i c e 	t o 	t h e	C o m m i t t e e
During the year, the Committee has received advice on executive 
remuneration from its external remuneration advisers Deloitte  
LLP who were appointed by the Committee in September 2008.  
In addition, it received advice from its lawyers, Jones Day, and 
internally from its Human Resources Department. Deloitte LLP 
may from time to time provide additional services to the Group as 
may be considered appropriate including financial, regulatory and 
risk management services. No individual is involved in the 
determination of his or her own remuneration. 
R e m u n e r a t i o n 	 P o l i c y
The Committee is responsible for ensuring that the Company’s 
Executive Directors and senior executives are fairly, but responsibly, 
rewarded for their individual contributions to the Company’s overall 
performance. It exercises this responsibility through consideration of 
all bonus, salary and incentive awards including reviews of the structure 
of remuneration within operating subsidiaries. The Committee 
considers Executive Director recommendations for senior executives 
whose bonus and incentive awards are wholly discretionary along 
with non revenue earning areas of the business including risk and 
compliance. The Committee also considers ad hoc remuneration 
matters in line with its Terms of Reference throughout the year.  
The Executive Directors are responsible for bringing remuneration 
matters to the attention of the Remuneration Committee.
For all employees throughout the Group, the overriding aim is to 
develop and implement a remuneration policy which attracts, retains 
and motivates individuals of the highest calibre to grow the value  
of the Group and maximise returns to shareholders. During 2009 
particular focus has been placed on reviewing remuneration policies 
and practices across the Group to ensure they are in line with the 
Company’s risk and control framework. As a result, a deferral element 
of 25% was introduced to all bonus awards for 2009 above £100,000. 
The Committee takes the view that the same philosophy applied to 
employees of the Group generally should also apply to Executive 
Directors who are essential to the effective and successful leadership 
and management of the Group. 
The Group operates in the highly competitive financial services market, 
which places a heavy emphasis on exceptional rewards for exceptional 
performance. An overriding objective is to ensure that the approach 
to remuneration is simple and clear. The Board does not support 
reward for executives when this is not justified by performance. 
All reward structures in place across the Group reflect our culture 
and values of encouraging high individual effort to achieve individual 
and corporate performance targets. We endeavour to ensure that 
our businesses are conducted in a manner that achieves the highest 
standards of compliance and we adopt a zero tolerance policy for 
non compliance. This policy is reflected in our reward structure.
Consistent with this philosophy, the Group’s reward structure aims 
to motivate executives in the short to medium-term while also linking 
remuneration to the long-term performance of the Group; deliver fully 
market competitive levels of total compensation to recognise personal 
performance as well as the individual’s contribution to Group 
performance, judged on the basis of profit levels and profit growth; 
support sustained growth in shareholder value over the medium and 
long-term by aligning the interests of Executive Directors with those 
of shareholders through performance related awards reflecting the 
performance of the Group; provide long-term incentive opportunity 
that acts as a retention mechanism; ensure that remuneration does 
not encourage excessive risk taking by aligning rewards to the delivery 
of sound risk management systems and controls; and deliver 
proportionate rewards to Executive Directors having regard to 
remuneration arrangements of senior Group employees.  
In determining Directors’ remuneration, the Committee considers 
returns to shareholders as measured by profit and earnings performance 
both in absolute terms and against budget. The quality of profit 
performance is also considered in the context of market conditions 
and whether it is broadly based across all divisions or derived more 
narrowly. Other considerations are comparable market remuneration 
data, the experience and performance of individual Directors, their 
areas of responsibility and remuneration levels throughout the Group.

Management and Governance
Directors’ Remmuneration Report (continued)
A high proportion of potential total remuneration is related to 
performance designed to motivate Executive Directors to enhance 
the value of the Group. It is the view of the Committee that appropriate 
and sufficient risk and control measures are currently in place and 
are supported by our approach to reward. Medium and long-term 
incentives are delivered in the form of The Evolution Group Plc 
options and share awards. 
The Committee intends that the broad tenets of remuneration policy 
will continue to support the objectives of the Group but will keep it 
under review and will strive to balance the views of major shareholders 
and the needs of the Group. In particular, the Committee recognises 
the need to ensure that the senior executives who lead the success of 
the Group must be incentivised and retained in challenging market 
conditions.
T h e 	C o m p o n e nt s	of	R e m u n e r a t i o n
O v e r v i e w
The remuneration packages of Executive Directors currently comprise 
three elements: basic salary and benefits in kind, annual discretionary 
performance related bonus, and medium to long-term incentive 
plans. As indicated above, the Board has conducted a review of the 
remuneration and reward structure across the Group including that 
of Executive Directors to ensure the spirit of the FSA guidance on 
remuneration is carefully considered in setting remuneration strategy 
for the Group. The current structure is geared towards meeting the 
needs of the Group in the medium-term, in order to continue to be 
able to recruit, reward and motivate staff at all levels to maximise 
the earnings potential of the Group and to further align the interests 
of Directors and senior staff with those of our shareholders.     
1. Fixed remuneration – basic salary and benefits
The fixed component of Executive Directors’ remuneration comprises 
basic salary and benefits in kind. A salary cap was implemented in 
2002 for all employees throughout the Group of £100,000, which 
remained in place throughout 2009. We will keep the salary cap 
under review, mindful of the FSA’s commentary around the risk 
profile that this may encourage. At this time, the Group continues  
to believe that this cap provides invaluable support to its subsidiaries 
to enable them to effectively manage their fixed cost base. This 
supports a performance culture based on medium term equity 
participation that is aligned with shareholders’ interests. We are 
confident that this approach does not undermine our compliance 
and risk priorities.   
At the year end 30% (2008: 21%) of employees were paid the salary 
cap of £100,000. The average salary for all employees was £60,188 
(2008: £55,674). The following benefits in kind are provided to 
Executive Directors: medical cover; life assurance; critical illness 
and permanent health insurance; and a car allowance. No pension 
provision is provided by the Group save for a salary sacrifice pension 
scheme where the Company contributes the National Insurance costs 
it would otherwise have saved. No Director has joined this scheme.  
Based on information provided by our retained remuneration 
consultants, the basic salary of £100,000, together with the benefits 
in kind, continues to represent one of the lowest levels of fixed 
remuneration in comparable companies, particularly given the 
absence of a pension provision. This accords with the Group’s 
overall philosophy of remuneration having as low an element of 
fixed or non-performance related pay as possible. 
2. Performance-related remuneration
As part of the remuneration and reward review, changes have 
recently been and will continue to be developed in respect of the 
remuneration and reward structure for Executive Directors. 
The calculation of Executive Director bonuses will, subject to the 
discretion of the Committee, reflect performance measured against 
each Director’s performance objectives across financial, strategic 
and development targets. In respect of 2009 the performance of 
Executive Directors and resulting performance bonuses were measured 
across a number of targets including profit performance and return 
on capital employed, assets under management, income diversification, 
integration of new assets and where appropriate, the share price and 
profit performance of the Group. 
In recognition of the need to further align the interests of Directors 
with those of shareholders and recognising guidelines issued by the 
FSA, and to ensure consistency of approach throughout the Group, 
a three year deferral element of 25% has been introduced for 
Executive Directors on bonus awards above £100,000, to ensure a 
material element is linked to future performance. The deferral will 
be by way of the grant of conditional share awards under the Evolution 
Group PLC 2002 Share Option Scheme, subject to the achievement 
of performance conditions set at the start of each year and continuing 
to operate within the risk and compliance framework of the Group.
These changes to the remuneration strategy reflect the strategic 
direction of the Group and are a response to wider regulatory 
concerns in the industry that remuneration does not encourage 
excessive risk taking. 
The concept of a bonus ceiling does not naturally align with the Group’s 
remuneration philosophy. To set a ceiling on the level of bonuses 
within the current profit levels would seriously prejudice the ability 
of the Group to attract, retain and motivate many of its senior 
employees whose contribution to profits within an organisation such 
as this are vital and may be much greater than in other businesses. 
This would therefore be counter productive to the objective to retain 
senior management in order to improve sustainable profit performance.  
The Committee acknowledges that the consequence of this is that 
the scheme does not comply with Schedule A of the Combined Code. 
The current and prospective bonus schemes are designed to generate 
and reward behaviours which drive the creation of long-term 
shareholder value and support our risk and compliance framework. 
The emphasis on annual bonus payments, which are not capped on 
an individual basis but only by reference to the profit pool made 
available, allows the Group to keep fixed cost remuneration low 
while at the same time remaining competitive.  The Evolution Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 35
As part of the 2009 changes to the remuneration and reward 
framework, Executive Directors of the Company, and its two 
principal operating subsidiaries (Evolution Securities Limited and 
Williams de Broë Limited) may receive additional rewards for 
exceptional performance. Historically this has been linked to 
achieving NIBBIT (net income before bonus interest and tax) targets 
but will be amended to statutory profit before tax targets for 2010 
onwards. The 2009 pool for the Executive Board was accrued on 
the basis of adjusted NIBBIT (adjusted net income before bonus, 
interest and tax) exceeding budget by more than 10% on the 
relevant business units. For all profits above this level, 10% was 
added to a pool for distribution subject to the return on capital 
employed being above the cost of capital of the Group or relevant 
subsidiary. The Remuneration Committee exercised their discretion 
in determining awards from this pool to Executive Directors of  
the Group. The Group CEO provided recommendations to the 
Remuneration Committee for the allocation of the pool for each 
subsidiary Director. Awards from this pool were subject to a 25% 
deferral on the same terms as the bonus awards detailed above.
3. Medium to long-term incentive plans 
The third element of reward for the Executive Directors is the medium 
to long-term incentive plans which are forward looking in nature.  
In years of relatively poor profit performance when bonuses might 
be reduced, share based awards encourage continuity of service, 
help to drive improved profit performance and align the interests of 
Directors with shareholders. The level of share-based awards is not 
subject to a maximum multiple of salary due to the low salary cap 
for Executive Directors relative to other similar sized companies. 
There are currently two plans which have been used to offer medium 
and long-term incentives to Executive Directors as follows:
Performance Share Plan
Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 25 May 2006 
approved the 2006 Performance Share Plan (“PSP”). It had been 
designed to reward significant value creation by Executive Directors 
and management and was intended to further align the interests of 
shareholders, executives and staff. The awards were therefore designed 
to reflect the future performance of the Group. The PSP made 
available a pool of the Company’s ordinary shares (“Shares”) split 
between Executive Directors and other staff. Entitlements to the 
Shares that are the subject of the awards were subject to the achievement 
of specified share price growth conditions from a base share price of 
£1.42 per share, within a three year period from 1 April 2006 and 
to continued employment. The performance condition would be satisfied 
in respect of one third of the Shares if the average share price over 
any period of 60 continuous days within the three year period 
(“Measurement Period”) equals or exceeded £2.13 (50% above the 
base price) and in respect of the remaining two thirds if the share 
price doubled to £2.84 within the Measurement Period. At the time  
of the approval of the PSP, the Board believed these targets to be 
sufficiently stretching in the context both of the prevailing economic 
environment and the prospects of the Group based on past performance 
and reported strategy. The Board determined not to reduce the 
performance targets as far as they relate to Executive Directors.
During 2009, performance conditions for awards under this plan 
were not met and therefore awards under this plan to Executive 
Directors have lapsed in full and will not vest.  
The 2002 Executive Share Incentive Scheme (“2002 ESIS”)
Shares may be awarded to Executive Directors under the 2002 
Executive Share Incentive Scheme, approved by shareholders on  
10 October 2002.  
During 2009, awards over 2,000,000 shares were made to Alex Snow 
on 19 May 2009 as part of the 2009 incentive agreements agreed for 
him at the 2009 Annual General Meeting. These awards will vest in 
May 2011 subject to achievement of performance conditions including 
continued employment up to the date of grant of call rights and 
achievement of detailed qualitative and quantitative performance criteria 
over two years as set out in the 2009 Notice of AGM. On 8 April 2009 
Alex Snow also received awards over 175,179 shares as a bonus deferral 
from 2008. Also on 8 April 2009 awards over 103,810 shares were 
made to Andrew Umbers in respect of his 2008 bonus deferral and 
150,000 to Andrew Westenberger as part of his joining arrangements. 
All awards were granted for nil consideration with an exercise price 
of 1p per share. The awards granted on 8 April 2009 are subject to 
continued employment and achievement of certain qualitative 
performance criteria. Subject to these being achieved, call rights will 
be granted in April 2012 whereupon the shares will become immediately 
exercisable. Subject to Andrew Westenberger remaining an employee 
of the Group two further awards are to be recommended for approval 
by the remuneration committee and, if approved, would be awarded 
in satisfaction of commitments made to him as part of his joining 
package over 200,000 shares in 2010 and 250,000 shares in 2011. 
The awards will vest on 8 April 2013 and 8 April 2014 respectively. 
Award levels have been determined in the light of the impact on 
shareholders’ dilution. At the year end the dilution (as defined by  
the guidelines of the Association of British Insurers) arising from the 
Group’s discretionary schemes was 10.2% (2008: 9.7%) taking into 
account own shares purchased by the Group’s employee trust to satisfy 
outstanding awards. This level of dilution reflects our undertaking 
to keep dilution capped at 12% as detailed at the time of the adoption 
of the Performance Share Plan at the 2006 Annual General Meeting. 
The Remuneration Committee keeps the levels of dilution under 
regular review. The Group has an ongoing programme of purchasing 
shares in the market to satisfy awards under its share schemes, should 
the Group purchase the outstanding but unvested shares under its 
2001 share scheme through market purchases the dilution would 
revert to under 10%.

Directors’ Remmuneration Report (continued)
The Remuneration Committee is aware that the Executive Share 
Incentive Scheme operates unusually in two main respects: there  
are no annual limits on award levels and the vesting of awards are 
phased over two, three or four years. The Committee believes this 
flexibility allows remuneration to be structured in a simple and yet 
highly effective way, and which also aligns the interests of Executive 
Directors with those of shareholders. 
L o n g- t e r m 	P a r t n e r s h i p 	E q u i t y 	P l a n s	
The Remuneration Committee has considered incentive schemes 
which aim to create the right combination of meaningful incentive 
and shareholder alignment within a business in which short-term 
decisions and performance are critical to medium-term and long-
term growth whilst reflecting the partnership culture the Executives 
are building and embedding throughout the Group. As a result, new 
long term partnership equity plans were approved by shareholders 
at a General Meeting held on 22nd January 2010. For Executive 
Directors of Evolution Group Plc and employees of the Group, a 
Joint Share Ownership Plan (“JSOP”) has been introduced, with  
a Growth Share Ownership Plan (“GSOP”) at subsidiary level.  
It is intended that Executive Directors and senior employees will be 
invited to participate in these plans on or after 25 March 2010.  
The key feature of both plans is that individuals are required to 
purchase a capital interest thereby having personal capital at risk. 
The partner shares are designed to return value over the medium  
to long term (3 to 5 years minimum) resulting from the creation of 
shareholder value at both the operating subsidiary and Group level. 
Value realisation is subject to significant hurdle rates, ongoing 
service conditions and a series of performance conditions, including 
Return on Capital Employed, Statutory Profit Before Tax and 
Earnings per Share.

Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the Evolution Group 
Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”). The SIP is an HMRC approved plan 
open to all UK permanent employees. Eligible employees may 
contribute up to £125 each month and the trustee of the plan uses 
the money to buy partnership shares on their behalf. The Company 
issues an equivalent number of matching shares, with the equivalent 
cost met by the employing company. Partnership and matching shares 
are eligible for dividends and dividend shares are acquired on 
receipt of the relevant paid amounts. 
Details of the Executive Directors’ share interests under this plan 
are given in the table below:

The Combined Code recommends that a one-year notice period 
or contract terms be set as an objective for Executive Directors. 
The Remuneration Committee’s policy is that service contracts 
should not have a notice period exceeding 12 months and should 
not contain a liquidated damages clause in the event of termination. 
All Executive Directors have service contracts without fixed terms 
and with notice periods of 12 months or less. The principal terms in 
these contracts are as set out below. The Directors’ service contracts 
and letters of engagement for Non-Executive Directors will be 
available for inspection at the Company’s Annual General Meeting.

N o n - E x e c u t i v e 	D i r e c t o r s	
Non-Executive Directors do not hold service contracts but letters of 
appointment. The Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment 
are each for an initial term of one year with two months’ notice. 
Non-Executive Directors are subject to the process of re-appointment 
on a rolling basis at the time of the Annual General Meeting. Non-
Executive Directors receive a fee for their services to the Board. The 
Chairman and Executive Directors set fee levels for Non-Executive 
Directors, excluding the Chairman. The other Non-Executive Directors 
set the fee for the Chairman. The Non-Executive Directors are not 
involved in the discussions to determine their own remuneration. 
Additionally the current policy of the Board is that Non-Executive 
Directors should not serve more than nine years if it is determined 
that this would prejudice their independence. The current expected 
time commitment of Non-Executive Directors other than the Chairman 
is 20 days per annum. The Chairman commits on average two days 
per week to the Company. The Evolution Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 37
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in the Group’s annual 
bonus arrangements or long-term incentive arrangements. Fees cease 
to be payable immediately upon termination of any appointments 
for any reason and no compensation is payable in respect of such 
termination.
The overall fee for Non-Executive Directors is a £60,000 basic fee 
plus £15,000 for chairing a Committee and in respect of the Senior 
Non-Executive Director. The fee for Martin Gray during the year 
was £125,000. The Board believe these fee levels are appropriate 
and reflect the experience brought by the Non-Executive Directors, 
the time commitment they give, and the contribution they make.
The below graph shows the TSR against that of the FTSE 250 and 
the FTSE small cap index (excluding Investment Trusts). TSR is 
calculated assuming dividends are reinvested on receipt.
In the opinion of the Directors, the FTSE 250 index is the most 
appropriate index against which the total shareholder return of the 
Group should be measured as at 31 December 2009, as the Group 
was a constituent of that index from March 2009 to the year end. 
The Group’s growth strategy and commitment to improving 
shareholder value seeks to ensure that the Group is part of the FTSE 
250. For context only, in the period shown in the graph above, the 
Group was listed on the AIM market from December 1999 up until 
its move to the Full List of the London Stock Exchange in June 2003, 
when it became a constituent of the FTSE small cap index. Thereafter, 
the Group’s shares then joined the FTSE 250 index in March 2004 
and left the FTSE 250 index in June 2005 when they returned to the 
FTSE small cap index. The Group rejoined the FTSE 250 index in 
March 2009.

The Committee does not consider corporate performance on ESG issues 
when setting the remuneration of Executive Directors as given the 
profile and operations of the Group it does not believe that consideration 
of these matters is likely to have a material impact on such remuneration. 
However, the Board does consider the major risks to the Group when 
setting quantitative and qualitative performance objectives of the 
Executive Directors and performance against those objectives does 
have a direct bearing on the level of remuneration, including 
bonuses and share awards provided to those Directors.

Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of The Evolution Group Plc 
We have audited the Consolidated Financial Statements of The 
Evolution Group Plc for the year ended 31 December 2009 which 
comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the 
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the related notes. The 
financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. 
R e s p e c t i v e 	r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s 	of 	 D i r e c t o r s 	a n d	a u d i t o r s	
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities set out on page 26, the directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and for 
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility 
is to audit the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only 
for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter  
3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose.  
We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility 
for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is 
shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed 
by our prior consent in writing.
S c o p e 	of 	t h e	a u d i t	o f	t h e	F i n a n c i a l 	S t a t e m e nt s 	
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the Financial Statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the Financial Statements are free from material misstatement, 
whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates 
made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the Financial 
Statements.
O p i n i o n 	o n	F i n a n c i a l 	S t a t e m e nt s 	
In our opinion the Consolidated Financial Statements: 
>  give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 
31 December 2009 and of its profit and cash flows for the year 
then ended; 
>  have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union; and 
>  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the lAS Regulation.

In our opinion:
> the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial 
year for which the Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared 
is consistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements; and
>  the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement

Notes to the Financial Statements
1. Accounting Policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these 
Financial Statements are set out below. Except as explained below, these 
policies have been consistently applied to the years presented. 
Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted 
by the European Union (“EU”) and IFRIC interpretations and with those 
parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under 
IFRS. The Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical 
cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale financial 
assets, and financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative 
instruments) at fair value through the profit or loss. 
The Evolution Group Plc is a UK listed holding company for financial 
services companies. The Company is a public limited company incorporated 
and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of its registered office is: 
9th floor, 100 Wood Street, London, EC2V 7AN.
A summary of the Group accounting policies is set out below, together with 
an explanation of where changes have been made to previous policies on the 
adoption of new accounting standards in the year.
Changes in presentation
The presentation of trade and other receivables and trade and other payables 
as at 31 December 2008 has been changed to reflect the correct netting of 
certain balances aggregating £14.5 million with the same counterparties 
where the netting criteria are met in accordance with the Group’s accounting 
policies.
Significant accounting policies
Basis of consolidation
The Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements comprise the Financial 
Statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings. 
a) Investments in subsidiary undertakings
Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) over which the 
Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally 
accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The 
existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable 
or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls 
another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which 
control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date 
that control ceases. A list of subsidiaries held by the Group and Company is 
disclosed in note 6 of the parent Company accounts. 
All intra Group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation 
and consistent accounting policies are used throughout the Group for the 
purpose of consolidation.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of 
businesses and subsidiaries. The cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair 
value of the identifiable assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities 
or contingent liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, together 
with any costs directly related to the acquisition. The excess of the cost of 
an acquisition over the Group’s share of the fair value of the identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill. 
If the cost of the acquisition is less than the fair value of the Group’s share of 
the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary 
acquired, the difference is recognised immediately in the Consolidated 
Income Statement.
b) Transactions with minority interests 
The Group applies a policy of treating transactions with minority interests 
as transactions with parties external to the Group. Disposals to minority 
interests result in gains and losses for the Group that are recorded in the 
Consolidated Income Statement. Purchases from minority interests result 
in goodwill, being the difference between any consideration paid and the 
relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary.
c) Associates 
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but 
not control, over the financial and operating policies and in which the Group 
generally has between 20% and 50% voting power. The Group accounts for 
associates using the equity method. Under this method, the Consolidated 
Financial Statements show the Group’s share of the total recognised gains 
and losses of associates and their net assets, from the date that significant 
influence or joint control commences until the date they cease. Any premium 
over net asset value paid to acquire an interest in an associate is recognised as 
goodwill, within the same line as the underlying investment. 
Discontinued operations and disposal groups held-for-sale
When the Group is committed to dispose of a business segment that 
represents a separate major line of business, and it is intended that such a 
disposal will be completed within one year of the decision to sell, it classifies 
such a business segment as a discontinued operation. The assets of disposal 
groups are presented separately from other assets on the Balance Sheet and 
the liabilities of disposal groups are presented separately from other liabilities 
on the Balance Sheet. The assets and liabilities of the disposal groups 
classified as held-for-sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and 
fair value less costs to sell. The comparative Balance Sheet is not restated. 
The post-tax result of the discontinued operation is shown as a single amount 
on the face of the Income Statement, with a restatement of the comparative 
period. In determining the post-tax result of the discontinued operation only 
those central costs that will be eliminated on disposal are allocated to the 
discontinued operation.
On 1 April 2009 the Company announced the completion of an investment 
in ESCL by First Eastern Financial Holdings Limited. As a result of this 
transaction the Group’s interest in ESCL has fallen to 48.5%. Prior to the 
completion of this transaction in 2009 the Group consolidated ESCL and 
presented it as a discontinued operation. From 1 April 2009 ESCL and its 
subsidiary have been deconsolidated and are accounted for by the equity 
method of accounting.
Income recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of consideration received or receivable for 
the sale of services in the ordinary course of the Groups activities. Revenue 
is recognised when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, and it is 
probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow 
into the Group.
a) Fee and commission income
Fee and commission income includes transaction income, commission 
income, trail commission, placing commission, retainer income, initial 
commission and fees from asset management activities (including interest 
income on private client assets), net of payaway to Independent Financial 
Advisers, introducers and self-employed half commission persons. 
Initial commissions received from clients are capitalised in the Balance 
Sheet, as deferred income and amortised over the average holding period 
of five years, being the relevant period in which the relationship between 
the commission earned and the assets under management to which such 
commissions relate is believed to exist.
Fees and commissions are recognised in the Income Statement when the 
related services are performed and all legal conditions have been satisfied, 
and when considered recoverable. The Evolution Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 48
1. Accounting Policies (continued)
b) Fee and commission expenses 
Fee and commission expenses include amounts paid to other third parties in 
connection with corporate finance fee income such as introduction fees. Costs 
incurred in the normal course of executing commission transactions across 
our exchanges and settling through recognised networks are also included.
 
c) Trading income
Trading income from market making and principal trading activities 
comprises all gains and losses from changes in the fair value of financial assets 
and liabilities held for trading, together with any related dividend income 
on positions held. Costs incurred in the normal course of executing trading 
transactions across our exchanges and settling through recognised networks 
are included within other administrative expenses.
Trading income also includes derivative contracts relating to equity options 
and warrants received in lieu of corporate finance fees.
d) Other income
Other income includes fees for probate valuations, foreign exchange gains 
and losses resulting from the re-translation and settlement of foreign currency 
transactions, commitment fees and bridging loan fees and interest on facilities 
offered to corporate clients and any dividend income on available-for-sale 
financial assets. Interest income on segregated client money accounts which 
relates to Evolution Securities Limited is included within this category.
Operating leases
Rentals applicable to operating leases where substantially all the benefits and 
risk of ownership remain with the lessor are charged to the Income Statement 
on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Lease incentives are credited to the Income Statement and spread over the 
life of the lease.
Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal 
reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating 
decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources, making strategic 
decisions and assessing the performance of operating segments, has been 
identified as the Group Board of Directors.
Foreign currency translation
(a) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the Financial Statements of each of the Group’s entities are 
measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
the entity operates (the ‘functional currency’). The Consolidated Financial 
Statements of the Group are presented in Sterling, which is the Company’s 
functional and the Group’s presentation currency.
(b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency 
using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign 
exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions 
and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Income 
Statement.
Translation differences on non-monetary items, such as equities held at fair 
value through profit or loss, are reported as part of their fair value gain or 
loss. Translation differences on non-monetary items such as equities classified 
as available-for-sale financial assets are included in the fair value reserve  
in equity. 
(c) Group companies
The results and financial position of all the Group entities that have a 
functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated 
into the presentation currency as follows:
•  assets and liabilities for each Balance Sheet presented are translated at the 
closing rate at the date of that Balance Sheet;
•  income and expenses for each Income Statement are translated at average 
exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the 
cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which 
case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the 
transactions); and
•  all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component 
in equity which is fair value and other reserves.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign 
entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at 
the closing rate.
Finance income and expense
Interest income and expense for all interest-bearing financial instruments, 
except for those classified as held for trading or designated at fair value 
through profit or loss, are recognised within ‘finance income’ and ‘finance 
expense’ in the Income Statement using the effective interest method.
Goodwill
The cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the identifiable 
assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities or contingent liabilities 
incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, together with any costs directly 
related to the acquisition. The excess of the cost of an acquisition over 
the Group’s share of the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is stated at 
cost less accumulated impairment losses, which are charged to the Income 
Statement.
Intangible assets
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
accumulated impairment losses, if any. The following are the main categories 
of other intangible assets:
Intangible assets with a finite useful life
a)  Brands: Purchased brands are capitalised at cost less amortisation on 
a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives and impairment. 
Expenditure incurred to develop or maintain brands internally is 
recognised as an expense in the period incurred.
b)  Distribution channels and customer relationships: Purchased distribution 
channels and customer relationships are capitalised at cost less 
amortisation on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  
and impairment.
c)  Computer software: Acquired computer software licenses are stated at cost, 
including those costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific 
software, less amortisation on a straight line basis over their estimated 
useful lives and impairment. 
The following useful lives have been determined for intangible assets:
Computer software 2 to 3 years
Customer relations 5 years
Brand 5 years
Distribution channels 5 years

Notes to the Financial Statements (continued) The Evolution Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 49
01 Business Review 02 Management and Governance 03 Financial Statements
Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) Licence
Costs associated with the acquisition of the US Broker Dealer, Evolution 
Securities US Inc (ESUS), are deemed to relate to the FINRA licence only. 
The licence is deemed to have an indefinite life, based on the continuing 
FINRA membership having no fixed life, and consequently is not being 
amortised. 
Financial Services Authority (“FSA”) Regulatory Status
Costs associated with the acquisition of WDB Capital Limited and WDB 
Asset Management Limited, are deemed to relate to its FSA regulatory 
status. The regulatory status is deemed to have an indefinite life, based on 
continuing FSA membership having no fixed life, and consequently is not 
being amortised. 
Property, plant and equipment
All property, plant and equipment (“PPE”) is shown at cost less depreciation 
and impairment. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the 
acquisition of the item. Depreciation on PPE is calculated using the straight-
line basis to allocate the cost of each asset to its residual value over its 
estimated useful life, as follows:
Computers and similar equipment 3 to 5 years
Fixtures, fittings, and other equipment  
(including leasehold improvements) 3 to 5 years
Major renovations are depreciated over the remaining useful life of the 
related asset or to the date of the next major renovation, whichever is sooner.
Impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and PPE
Goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are 
not subject to amortisation or depreciation and are tested annually for 
impairment. Other intangibles and PPE are assessed at the reporting date 
or whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable. The impairment review comprises a 
comparison of the carrying amount of the asset with its recoverable amount 
of the asset or cash generating unit (for goodwill and intangible assets with 
an indefinite useful life). The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s 
or cash generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. An 
impairment loss is recognised in the Income Statement in the period in  
which it occurs for the amount by which the asset’s or cash generating  
unit’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The assets’ residual 
values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if necessary at each  
Balance Sheet date.
Financial assets and liabilities
The Group classifies its financial assets and liabilities as trading portfolio 
assets and liabilities, available-for-sale financial assets, derivative financial 
instruments, stock borrowing and lending, trade and other receivables, 
cash and cash equivalents, and trade and other payables. The classification 
depends on the purpose for which the assets and liabilities were acquired. 
Management determines the classification of its investments at initial 
recognition and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date.
Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs 
for all financial assets not carried at fair value through the profit or loss. 
Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially 
recognised at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed in the Income 
Statement. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive 
cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where the Group has 
transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. Financial 
liabilities are derecognised when they are extinguished, that is, when the 
obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires.
The Group has financial assets and financial liabilities that offset to a net 
amount when presented in the Financial Statements. This arises when the 
Group transacts with central clearing counterparties that it does not hold a 
direct membership with, and is therefore contractually obliged to settle any 
outstanding financial assets or liabilities on a net basis. In all other cases the 
Group presents its financial assets and financial liabilities on a gross basis as 
per its standard terms and conditions. 
Trading portfolio assets and liabilities
Financial assets and liabilities are classified as held for trading if acquired 
principally for the purpose of selling in the short-term or if so designated by 
management. Purchases and sales of investments are recognised on trade 
date, being the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are either designated in this category or 
are not classified in any other category. Available-for-sale financial assets 
are those intended to be held for an indefinite period of time, which may be 
sold in response to needs for liquidity or changes in interest rates, exchange 
rates or equity prices. They are initially recognised at fair value and are 
subsequently held at fair value. A significant or prolonged decline in the 
fair value of the security below its cost is also evidence that the assets are 
impaired. If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale financial assets, 
the cumulative loss – measured as the difference between the acquisition 
cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial 
asset previously recognised in profit or loss – is removed from equity and 
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. Impairment losses 
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement on equity instruments are 
not reversed through the Consolidated Income Statement unless the related 
asset is subsequently disposed of at a gain to the impaired valuation. Gains 
and losses arising from changes in fair values are included as a separate 
component of equity within fair value and other reserves until sale or  
when impaired.
Measurement of trading portfolio assets and liabilities and  
available-for-sale financial assets 
For trading portfolio assets and liabilities and available-for-sale financial 
assets that are quoted in active markets, fair values are determined by 
reference to the current quoted bid/offer price, with trading portfolio assets 
marked to the bid price and trading portfolio liabilities marked at the 
offer price. Where independent prices are not available, fair values may be 
determined using valuation techniques with reference to observable market 
data. These may include comparison to similar instruments where market 
observable prices exist, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models 
such as Black-Scholes and other valuation techniques commonly used by 
market participants.
The Group makes an assessment at each Balance Sheet date as to whether 
there is any objective evidence of impairment. In the case of equity 
investments classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline 
in the fair value of the security below its cost is evidence that the asset is 
impaired in which case the cumulative loss (measured as the difference 
between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment 
loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the Income Statement) is 
removed from equity and recognised in the Income Statement. 
Derivative financial instruments 
Derivatives are initially accounted for and measured at fair value on the date 
a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently measured at fair value. 
The gain or loss on re-measurement is taken to the Income Statement within 
trading income. All derivatives are included in assets when their fair value 
is positive and liabilities when their fair value is negative, unless there is the 
legal ability and intention to settle net.  The Evolution Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 50
1. Accounting Policies (continued)
The regular way purchase or sale of held for trading financial assets is 
recognised using trade date accounting. A regular way purchase or sale 
is a purchase or sale of a financial asset under a contract whose terms 
require delivery of the asset within the time frames established generally 
by regulation or convention in the marketplace concerned. Purchases or 
sales that do not fall within the regular way classification (generally beyond 
three days settlement) are treated as derivatives in the period between the 
trade date and the settlement date, i.e. as a forward purchase or sale of 
security. The contract value (i.e. the trade date receivable or payable) of such 
transactions is not recorded on the Balance Sheet, but the change in fair value 
is recognised on the Balance Sheet and Income Statement within trading 
income in the intervening period between the trade date and settlement date.
Stock borrowing and lending
The Group enters into stock borrowing and lending arrangements with 
certain institutions on a collateralised basis with securities or cash advanced 
or received as collateral. The transfer of securities to institutions is not 
reflected on the Balance Sheet. Where cash collateral is advanced or received, 
an asset or liability is recorded at the amount of cash collateral advanced or 
received. Securities borrowed are recognised on the Balance Sheet and are 
recorded as a trading liability and measured at fair value. Fees charged in the 
course of borrowing are recorded on an accruals basis and included within 
other operating expenses. Interest received or paid on collateral is included 
within finance income or expense. 
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables (which include counterparty receivables) are 
recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision 
for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective 
evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according 
to the original terms of the receivables. Evidence that an impairment of 
the asset may be required includes ageing of the debt beyond 180 days, 
persistent lack of communication and internal awareness of third party 
trading difficulties. The amount of the provision is the difference between 
the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash 
flows, discounted at the effective interest rate. The amount of the provision is 
recognised in the Income Statement within operating expenses.
Cash and cash equivalents
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents include 
cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, and other short-term highly 
liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and 
which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Such investments 
are normally those with original maturities of three months or less and bank 
overdrafts.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables (which includes counterparty payables) are 
recognised initially at fair value, which is the agreed market price at the time 
goods or services are provided and are subsequently recorded at amortised 
cost using the effective interest rate. The Group accrues for all goods and 
services consumed but as yet unbilled at amounts representing management’s 
best estimate of fair value.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised for present obligations arising as consequences of 
past events where it is probable that a transfer of economic benefit will be 
necessary to settle the obligation and it can be reliably estimated. 
Provisions for dilapidation on leasehold premises are recognised as a liability 
over the period to the next break clause within the lease and discounted to 
fair value at an effective interest rate over the period of the property lease. 
The accrual is based on expected costs to be incurred at the end of the lease 
period to bring the building back into a suitable state discounted to the net 
present value using an effective discount rate that reliably calculates the 
present value of the future obligation. Where a leases break clause is shorter 
than 1 year and the Group expects to exercise the break clause the provision 
is transferred from the provision account with the Balance Sheet to current 
liabilities – trade and other payables. 
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be 
confirmed only by uncertain future events or present obligations where the 
transfer of economic benefit is uncertain or cannot be reliably measured. 
Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the Financial Statements, 
however, they are disclosed unless considered remote.
Employee benefits
(a) Pension obligations
The Group does not offer any Group pension schemes. However, the Group 
does make defined contributions to employees’ approved personal pension 
plans, and the costs of these are charged to the Income Statement when they 
are incurred.
(b) Share-based plans
The Group’s management awards high-performing employees bonuses in 
the form of equity-settled share-based payments, from time to time, on a 
discretionary basis. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant. Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes 
pricing model or, in the case of awards of call rights, which have an exercise 
price of 1p per ordinary share, the fair value is based on the market value 
at the time of grant discounted by the dividend yield over the expected life. 
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based 
payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based 
on the Group’s estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest. 
The options are generally subject to a three year service vesting condition, 
and their fair value is recognised as an employee benefit expense with a 
corresponding increase in retained earnings within equity over the vesting 
period. The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction 
costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when 
the options are exercised. 
(c) Employees’ Share Ownership Plan (“ESOP”)
The ESOP allows every employee to purchase up to £1,500 worth of the 
Group’s shares per annum on a tax efficient basis. These are purchased 
on a monthly basis and held in trust and are matched by shares issued by 
the Company on a one-for-one basis. Employees are entitled to receive 
the matching shares after a period of 3 years employment. The cost of the 
matching shares is charged to the Income Statement on a straight line basis 
over the 3 year period. Where an individual’s employment is terminated with 
the Company prior to completing the 3 year period, the life to date charge is 
reversed from the Income Statement. 
Current and deferred taxes
Current taxes are computed on a basis of the tax laws enacted or substantially 
enacted at the Balance Sheet date in the countries where the Group’s 
subsidiaries operate and generate income. 
Deferred taxes are computed using the liability method, on temporary 
differences between the bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in financial statements. The deferred tax is not accounted for if it 
arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other 
than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profit nor loss. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences 
and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
taxable profits will be available against which tax losses or deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised. 
Financial Statements
Notes to the Financial Statements (continued) The Evolution Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 51
01 Business Review 02 Management and Governance 03 Financial Statements
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences 
arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to 
control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except when 
it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in 
equity, in which case the deferred tax is dealt with in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity.
The Group is entitled to a tax deduction for amounts treated as compensation 
on exercise of certain employee share options under UK tax rules. As 
explained under “Share-based plans” above, a compensation expense is 
recorded in the Group’s Income Statement over the period from the grant 
date to the vesting date of the relevant options. As there is a temporary 
difference between the accounting and tax bases, a deferred tax asset is 
recorded. The deferred tax asset arising is calculated by comparing the 
estimated amount of tax deduction to be obtained in the future (based on 
the Company’s share price at the Balance Sheet date) with the cumulative 
amount of the compensation expense recorded in the Income Statement.  
If the amount of estimated future tax deduction exceeds the cumulative 
amount of the remuneration expense, at the statutory tax rate, the excess  
is recorded directly in equity, against retained earnings. 
Share capital
a) Share issue costs
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. 
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options 
are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds, net of tax.
b) Treasury shares
Where the Group purchases its own equity share capital (treasury shares),  
the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs 
(net of taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s share 
holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. 
c) Trust shares
The Group’s Employee Benefit Trust (“the Trust”) uses funds provided by 
the Group to meet the Group’s obligations under the employee share option 
schemes in place. All shares acquired by the Trust are purchased on the 
open market. The consideration paid, including any directly attributable 
incremental costs (net of taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the 
Company’s holders.
d) Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Group’s shareholders is recognised in equity in 
the Financial Statements in the period in which the dividends are paid. Final 
dividends are recognised at the date they are approved by shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting.
Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable 
to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
in issue during the period, excluding those held in The Evolution Group Plc 
Employees’ Share Trust which are treated as cancelled. For diluted earnings 
per share, the weighted number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to 
assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares and option costs 
not yet charged to the Income Statement. However, in accordance with 
IAS 33, potential ordinary shares are only considered dilutive when their 
conversion would decrease the profit per share or increase the loss per share 
from continuing operations attributable to the equity holders. Therefore 
shares that may be considered dilutive while positive earnings are being 
reported may not be dilutive while losses are incurred.
Changes in accounting policies and disclosures
a) New and amended standards adopted by the Group
The Group has adopted the following new and amended IFRS’s  
as of 1 January 2009:
•  IFRS 7, ‘Financial instruments – Disclosures’ (amendment) – effective 
1 January 2009. The amendment requires enhanced disclosures about 
fair value measurement and liquidity risk. In particular the amendment 
requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of a fair value 
measurement hierarchy;
•  IFRS 8, ‘Operating segments’ – effective 1 January 2009. The standard 
requires a ‘management approach’ under which segmental information 
is presented using the same method as that adopted for internal reporting 
purposes. The presentation of segmental information in note 4 has been 
prepared using this method; 
•  IAS 23 (amendment), ‘Borrowing costs’ – effective 1 January 2009. 
The amendment requires borrowing costs directly attributable to 
the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset to be 
capitalised. The option of immediately expensing those borrowing costs 
will be removed. This has not had a material impact on the Group; 
•  IAS 1 (revised), ‘Presentation of financial statements’ – effective 1 January 
2009. The revised standard prohibits the presentation of items of income 
and expenses in the statement of changes in equity, requiring ‘non owner 
changes in equity’ to be presented separately from owner changes in equity 
in a statement of comprehensive income. As the change in accounting 
policy only impacts presentation aspects, there is no impact on earnings 
per share; and
•  IFRS 2 (amendment), ‘Share-based payment’ – effective 1 January 2009. 
This amendment clarifies that vesting conditions are service conditions 
and performance conditions only. Other features of share based payments 
are not vesting conditions. This amendment has not had a material impact 
on the Group. 
b)  Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are  
not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group
The following standards, interpretations and amendments to existing 
standards have been published and are mandatory for the Group’s accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010 or later periods, but the Group 
has not early adopted them:
•  IFRIC 17, ‘Distribution of non-cash assets to owners’ is required to be 
adopted for the Group for the financial year ending 31 December 2010. 
This interpretation provides guidance on accounting arrangements 
whereby an entity distributes non-cash assets to shareholders whether as 
a distribution of reserves or as dividends. IFRS 5 has also been amended 
to require that assets are classified as held for distribution only when they 
are available for distribution in their present condition and the distribution 
is highly probable. This is not expected to have a material impact on the 
Group; 
•  IAS 27 (revised), ‘Consolidated and separate financial statements’ is 
required to be adopted for the Group for the financial year ending 
31 December 2010. The revised standard requires the effects of all 
transactions with non-controlling interests to be recorded in equity if there 
is no change in control, and these transactions will no longer result in 
goodwill or gains and losses. The standard also specifies the accounting 
when control is lost. Any remaining interest in equity is re-measured to fair 
value, and a gain or loss is reconginsed in profit or loss. The Group will 
apply IAS27 (revised) prospectively to all business combinations from 1 
January 2010, subject to endorsement by the EU;
•  IFRS 3 (revised), ‘Business combinations’ is required to be adopted 
for the Group for the financial year ending 31 December 2010. The 
revised standard results in changes to the acquisition method of business 
combinations. The Group expects that this revision will impact the 
accounting for business combinations;  The Evolution Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 52
1. Accounting Policies (continued)
b)  Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are  
not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group (continued)
•  IFRS 5 (amendment), ‘Non-current assets held-for-sale and discontinued 
operations’ is required to be adopted for the Group for the financial 
year ending 31 December 2010. The amendment clarifies that all of a 
subsidiary’s assets and liabilities as held-for-sale if a partial disposal will 
result in loss of control. This is not expected to have a significant impact  
on the Group; 
•  IAS 1 (amendment), ‘Presentation of financial assets’ is required to be 
adopted for the Group for the financial year ending 31 December 2010. 
The amendment provides clarification that the potential settlement 
of a liability by the issue of equity is not relevant to its classification as 
current or non current. By amending the definition of current liability, the 
amendment permits a liability to be classified as non-current (provided 
that the entity has an unconditional right to defer settlement by transfer 
of cash or other assets for at least 12 months after the accounting period) 
notwithstanding the fact that the Group could be required by the 
counterparty to settle in shares at any time. This is not expected to have  
a material impact on the Group; 
•  IAS 38 (amendment), ‘Intangible assets’ is required to be adopted for the 
Group for the financial year ending 31 December 2010. The amendment 
defines a prepayment as being recognised only if payment has been made 
in advance of receiving the right to goods or receipt of services. The Group 
is assessing the implications of this change but currently does not expect it 
to have a material impact; and 
•  IFRS 2 (amendments), ‘Group cash-settled share-based payment 
transaction’ is required to be adopted for the Group for the financial 
year ending 31 December 2010. In addition to incorporating IFRIC 8, 
‘Scope of IFRS 2 and IFRIC 11’, ‘IFRS 2 – Group and treasury share 
transactions’ the amendments expand on the guidance in IFRIC 11 to 
address the classification of group arrangements that were not covered by 
that interpretation. The new guidance is not expected to have a material 
impact on the Group or Company’s Financial Statements.
2. Critical Estimates and Judgements
The preparation of the Financial Statements requires the use of estimates 
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at 
the date of the Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues 
and expenses during the year. Although these estimates are based on 
management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results 
ultimately may differ from those estimates. The areas involving a higher 
degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates 
are significant to the Financial Statements are disclosed below.
Intangible assets and goodwill impairment
Goodwill and other intangible assets, such as customer relationships and 
distribution channels, are tested for impairment based on the higher of value-
in-use or fair values less costs to sell. The calculations require management’s 
assumptions and estimates of future cash flows and discount rates. 
Based on the outcomes of the above prescribed analysis the Group believes 
the remaining carrying values of its intangible assets are held at appropriate 
levels and do not require impairment.
However, even if the pre-tax discount rates used by management had 
been 5% higher than management’s estimates the Group would not have 
recognised an impairment against goodwill. 
Income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes. Judgement is required in determining 
the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available in the future 
against which deferred tax assets can be utilised.
Based on forecasts the Group expects to recover its deferred tax assets within 
the next three years. Further details of the deferred tax assets and its expected 
recovery can be found in note 18 to the Financial Statements. 
If the Group’s forecast were 10% higher or lower then the Group would still 
expect to recover its deferred tax assets within the next three years.
3. Financial Instruments and Risk Management
Through its normal operations, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, 
the most significant of which are market, credit, and operational risks. The 
Group has limited exposure to foreign exchange risk. Its strong cash and cash 
equivalents position also ensures that it has low liquidity risk. 
Risk Management Framework
The Group Board is responsible for approving all risk management policies 
and for determining the overall risk appetite for the Group. 
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing the Group’s internal 
control and risk management systems. 
Risk Committee
The Group’s Directors have delegated to a sub-committee, the Risk 
Committee, the responsibility for setting the risk management policies 
applied by the Group and its subsidiaries. 
The purpose of the Risk Committee is to monitor and assess all types of risk 
within the Group and to ensure that internal controls are properly established 
so that the Group’s risk exposure is commensurate with the wishes of the 
Board. In addition, the Risk Committee tracks external market events and 
tries to evaluate their impact on the Group. The Risk Committee meets at 
least monthly and is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer.
Risk Department
The Risk Department has day-to-day responsibility for monitoring, 
mitigating and reporting risks within the Group and for escalating issues to 
senior management. The Risk Department follows the guidelines laid down 
by the Credit Policy, the Credit Limit Book, the Trading Policy Statement 
and the Operational Risk Policy as approved by the Group Board, the 
Audit Committee and the Risk Committee. The Treasury Department is 
responsible for hedging foreign exchange risk and for managing liquidity. 
Risk Reporting
The Group Board receives a monthly risk report detailing market and credit 
risk exposures, operational risk incidents and losses and key risk indicators. 
In addition, the Risk Committee discusses significant exposures and reviews 
limit breaches or requests for temporary limit increases.
(a) Management of Market Risk
Market risk management seeks to identify and control the potential loss 
in value of Group assets arising from changes in market prices. The 
principal risk for the Group is an adverse change in equity prices. The Risk 
Department’s role is to independently monitor, control and report this risk. 
It is important for senior management to be aware of the possible capital 
implications of an adverse movement in prices. Stress tests provide an 
indication of the potential size of losses that could arise in extreme conditions. 
The stress tests approved by the Risk Committee are historical scenarios 
that show the profit and loss that would occur if the historic changes were 
to be repeated. These stress test results are calculated in near real-time and 
the end-of-day results are reviewed by the Risk Committee and the Board 
of Directors. This stress test is used to determine whether the Group holds 
enough capital under Pillar 2 of the Capital Requirements Directive.
Financial Statements
Notes to the Financial Statements (continued) The Evolution Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 53
01 Business Review 02 Management and Governance 03 Financial Statements
Equity Price Risk
The Group is exposed to equity market risk in respect of its equity holdings. 
These comprise of: (i) available-for-sale financial assets, (ii) trading portfolio 
assets and liabilities that result from market making, and (iii) derivatives. In 
conjunction with stress tests outlined above, a sensitivity analysis has been 
performed on the Group’s exposure to equity risk. The analysis is based on 
the assumption that underlying equity prices had an increase/decrease of 
10% with all other variables held constant at the year end. The results as 
outlined below are only representative of the impact that is observed at the 
year end, and not of the impact that was observed during the year, which 
occurs due to a varying portfolio throughout the year.
i) Available-for-sale financial assets
The Board continues to review the performance of existing available-for-sale 
financial assets in the Group’s portfolio and realises these investments when 
deemed appropriate. 
For available-for-sale financial assets, a 10% increase/decrease in equity 
prices would result in an increase/decrease respectively in equity reserves  
of £0.2m (2008: £0.1m).
ii) Trading portfolio assets and liabilities that result from market making
The Risk Department monitors the market risk limits as laid down in the 
Trading Policy Statement. An automated system notifies the department 
whenever a limit is breached and the Risk Department then have a discussion 
with the trader before notifying senior management as to how the breach 
will be resolved. The whole process is logged and is fully auditable so that it is 
possible, for example, to analyse limit breach patterns or limit utilisation.
A 10% increase/decrease in equity prices on trading portfolio assets would 
increase/decrease profit in the Income Statement by £1.3m (2008: £0.5m). A 
10% increase/decrease in equity prices on trading portfolio liabilities would 
decrease/increase profit in the Income Statement by £0.3m (2008: £0.4m) 
respectively.
iii) Derivatives
Management of market risk in respect of derivatives is through active 
involvement of senior management under the supervision of the Board  
of Directors.
The Group will occasionally use derivatives to hedge its trading portfolio. 
All such positions are discussed with senior management and independently 
monitored by the Risk Department. 
Additionally, non-regular way trades at the period end give rise to derivative 
forward contracts as a result of the change in market value from the contract 
(trade) date to 31 December 2009.
On 31 March 2009 the Group’s interest in WDB Capital UK Equity Fund 
Limited fell below 50%. Prior to then the Group consolidated CFD’s held 
within the Fund. From 31 March 2009 the Fund has been accounted for as 
an associate, and as such the Group is indirectly exposed to derivative price 
movements within the Fund. 
The impact of a 10% increase in equity prices on derivatives would increase 
profit in the Income Statement by less than £0.2m (2008: £0.1m). The impact 
of a 10% decrease in equity prices on derivatives would decrease profit in the 
Income Statement by less than £0.2m (2008: £0.1m). 
Foreign Exchange Risk
The following table summarises the Group’s currency exposure arising from 
unmatched monetary assets or liabilities not denominated in the Group’s 
functional currency: 
 2009 2008
 £m £m
Net assets/(liabilities)
Euros (1.6) 0.1
US Dollar 1.9 0.6
Hong Kong Dollar – 0.7
Swiss Franc 0.1 0.2
Other currencies 0.2 0.2
 0.6 1.8
The Group’s activities are primarily denominated in Sterling. The majority 
of transactions denominated in a foreign currency that would expose the 
Group to currency risk are economically hedged immediately, normally in 
the spot market. The Group does not enter into forward exchange contracts 
for hedging anticipated transactions.
Based on the Group’s year end net assets dominated in non-Sterling 
currencies the impact of a 10% strengthening or weakening in Sterling 
against major currencies would result in a gain or loss of £0.1m (2008: 
£0.2m).
On 31 March 2009 the Group’s interest in WDB Capital UK Equity Fund 
Limited fell below 50%, prior to then the Group was also exposed to foreign 
exchange movements within the Fund. From 31 March 2009 the Fund 
has been accounted for as an associate, and as such the Group is indirectly 
exposed to foreign exchange movements within the Fund. 
Interest Rate Risk
The Group has interest bearing assets in mainly cash and cash equivalents. 
The Group has a policy of maintaining excess funds in cash and short term 
deposits and is exposed to short term interest rate risk. At the year end, all of 
the Group’s excess funds were invested in cash and short term deposits. The 
Group does not use any derivatives to hedge interest rate risk.
If LIBOR market interest rates had been 100 basis points higher/lower 
throughout 2009 with all other variables held constant, profit for the year 
would have been £0.1m (2008: £1.0m) higher and £0.1m (2008: £1.0m) 
lower respectively.
Management Fee Risk
The Group’s management fee income within its Private Client business is 
exposed to market risk where management fee income is determined by 
reference to client portfolio values. If financial asset prices that drive the 
portfolio values had been 5% higher/lower during the period, management 
fee income would have been £1.3m (2008: £0.9m) higher and £1.3m (2008: 
£0.9m) lower respectively.
(b) Management of Credit Risk
The Group has exposure to credit risk, which is the risk that a counterparty 
will cause a financial loss for the Group by failing to discharge an obligation. 
Credit risk exposure is generated primarily from the settlement risk on 
equities and fixed income. This is principally the risk that counterparty fails 
to settle a trade thereby forcing the Group to close out the trade at a possible 
loss. It is important to note that the potential loss is not the value of the trade, 
but the difference between the prices at which the trade was executed and the 
current price. This is termed the mark-to-market value. The longest dated 
transactions are limited to trade date plus twenty five business days. The 
Group is also exposed to credit risk on outstanding receivables, exposure to 
this risk is managed by taking into account financial position, past experience 
and other factors for customers.  The Evolution Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 54
3. Financial Instruments and Risk Management (continued)
Credit Risk Control
Counterparty receivables represent monies due from institutional trading counterparts. The Risk Department undertakes a credit review of all new accounts 
and periodically reviews all existing counterparties. As part of the review, each counterparty is assigned a credit limit according to the guidelines in the Credit 
Limit Book. Limits are based on either the amount of assets under management or risk assessments from a third party provider. Where data is not available 
the limit is based on the net assets and profitability of the counterparty. New accounts cannot begin to trade until the credit review has been completed and 
the counterparty assessed as credit worthy. 
The table below summarises the credit quality of the Group’s financial assets by third party credit ratings (if available):
    2009 2008
    % %
AAA-A Rated    71 67
Un-Rated Private Client Custodian and Prime Brokers    1 4
Un-Rated Investment Banking Institutional Clients    20 13
Un-Rated    8 16
    100 100
The ratings noted have been derived using source information from Standard & Poor and Moody’s. All financial assets over an “A Rated” rating are 
consolidated under the “AAA-A Rated” category and include as cash and cash equivalents, trade receivable and counterparties. Where an asset is Un-Rated, 
that is, there is no recognised external rating applicable to the asset, we have created sub-divisions to further distinguish the asset classes. Under the asset 
classes “Un-Rated Investment Banking Institutional Clients” and “Un-Rated Private Client Custodian and Prime Brokers” the majority of these balances 
relate to clients which are Un-Rated entities owned by rated institutions, however as the Group transacts with the underlying entities these balances have been 
classified as “Un-Rated”. All “Un-Rated” assets have undergone a thorough credit review and have been allocated internal ratings based on this review.
Each day the Risk Department prepares a counterparty exposure report that shows all credit risk exposures, potential future exposures and limits. Credit 
limit breaches are annotated and investigated. The Risk Committee reviews all credit limit breaches and authorises mitigating action when deemed necessary. 
The Group has £99.5m of its cash balance deposited with a single AA-Rated UK Bank. However there are no significant concentrations of credit risk with 
un-rated counterparties. All items classified as neither past due nor impaired, following the credit reviews described above, are considered to be recoverable 
and therefore of a credit quality that do not require impairment.
The following table of financial assets analyses amounts due by ageing:

(c) Fair Value Estimation
Effective 1 January 2009, the Group adopted the amendment to IFRS 7 for the financial instruments that are measured on the Balance Sheet at fair value. 
This requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy:
 •  Level 1 –  Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
 •  Level 2 –  Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly as prices or indirectly derived 
from prices;
 •  Level 3 –  Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The following table presents the Group’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at 31 December 2009: 
   Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total
Assets   £m £m £m £m
Available-for-sale financial assets   1.7 – – 1.7
Trading portfolio assets   13.2 0.1 – 13.3
Total assets   14.9 0.1 – 15.0
   Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total
Liabilities   £m £m £m £m
Trading portfolio liabilities    2.9 – – 2.9
Total liabilities   2.9 – – 2.9
There have been no changes in level 3 instruments for the year ended 31 December 2009.
The carrying values of assets and liabilities not held at fair value (cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, counterparty receivables, other receivables,  
and trade and other payables) are not significantly different from fair value.
(d) Management of Liquidity Risk
The Group seeks to manage liquidity risk, by maintaining a mixture of cash and short term deposits to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs 
and to invest cash assets safely and profitably. As part of this process the Group has been diversifying its deposits to ensure that it is not exposed to undue risk 
caused by the possible increase in redemption times in its money market funds. The Group deems there is sufficient liquidity for the near future. 
The Group’s exposure to liquidity arises from the equity and fixed income trading activities within the investment banking business and the settlement of 
trades within this business. This risk is short term in nature.
The following tables analyse the Group’s future cash outflows based on the remaining period to the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed are the 
contractual undiscounted cash flows.

(e) Capital Risk Management
Consistent with others in the industry the Group manages capital on the basis of regulatory capital requirement in accordance with Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 which 
is unchanged from 2008.
The Group’s objectives when managing capital is to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders 
and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
Capital adequacy and the use of regulatory capital are monitored daily by the Group’s management, employing techniques based on the guidelines developed 
by the Basel Committee and the European Community Directives, as implemented by the Financial Services Authority, for supervisory purposes. Compliance 
with FSA regulatory requirements was maintained throughout the year.  The Evolution Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 56
3. Financial Instruments and Risk Management (continued)
(e) Capital Risk Management (continued)
The Group has an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (commonly known as the ICAAP), which it uses to manage regulatory capital. This Assessment 
takes into account the risk profile and future plans of the business. Under this process the Group is satisfied that there is either sufficient capital to absorb 
potential losses or that there are mitigating controls in place to prevent the risks occurring. 
The Risk Department includes commentary on required and available capital in its monthly risk report to the Group and in the Risk Committee pack.  
The commentary highlights any changes to Pillar 1 or 2 numbers and also any expected impact from the anticipated business initiatives. 
On 31 December 2009, the Group had £127.1m (2008: £127.8m) of regulatory capital resource, which is comfortably in excess of its regulatory capital 
requirement. Management consider that the Group has more than sufficient capital for its size and complexity taking into account all material risks faced in 
carrying out the Group’s activities. 
Where significant business initiatives are planned, the effects on the risk profile of the Group and therefore its capital requirement are considered as part of  
the business plan. 
(f) Operational Risk Control
The Group defines operational risk as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events.  
The Group recognises that operational risk can never be eliminated, but seeks to minimise the probability and impact of operational risk events.
The operational risk policy that has been implemented incorporates three key processes:
•  A risk and control assessment carried out by the Risk Department through discussion with department heads. The assessment scores risk events as to 
probability and impact as well as evaluating the design and performance of   controls that have been put in place to mitigate the risk. The results of this 
assessment form the basis of the Key Risks Matrix;
•  Monitoring of Key Risk Indicators by the Risk Committee and Group Board; and
•  Establishment of an operational loss database to capture and analyse risk incidents and loss events.
The Group also undertake yearly appraisals for all employees as well as completing an independent employment screening of all new employees.

WDB Capital Fund
The Group Board’s intention has been to reduce its interest in WDB Capital Fund by way of a deemed disposal, to be effected by bringing in new investors into 
WDB Capital Fund. The Group’s interest in WDB Capital Fund fell below 50% at 31 March 2009, therefore from 1 April 2009 the Group recognises its share of 
WDB Capital Fund as an associate undertaking and accounts for it by using the equity method of accounting in accordance with IAS 28.
ESCL
On 18 December 2008, the Board gave approval for the Group to enter into an investment agreement with First Eastern Financial Holdings Limited, which 
resulted in a partial disposal of the Group’s interest in ESCL. The investment agreement was formally signed on 31 March 2009, and was disclosed in detail 
in Note 36 of the 2008 Annual Report and Accounts. As a result of this transaction the Group’s interest in ESCL has fallen to 48.5%. Prior to the completion 
of this transaction on 31 March 2009 the Group continued to consolidate and present ESCL as a discontinued operation. From 1 April 2009 to 31 December 
2009 ESCL and its subsidiary are accounted for by the equity method of accounting in accordance with IAS 28.

The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK for the year ended 2009 is 28% compared with 28.5% in the comparative period. The rate of 28.5% for 
the comparative period comprised of 3 months (1 January 2008 – 5 April 2009) at 30% and the remaining 9 months at 28%. In 2009 the standard rate of 
corporation tax has remained unchanged at 28%.

13. Earnings Per Share
The calculation of the basic earnings/(loss) per share is based on the profit/(loss) for the year for continuing and discontinuing operations (excluding minority 
interest) and on the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. The calculation of the diluted earnings/(loss) per share is based on 
the basic earnings/(loss) per share adjusted to allow for the issue of shares on the assumed conversion of all dilutive options. However, in accordance with 
IAS 33, potential ordinary shares are only considered dilutive when their conversion would decrease the profit per share or increase the loss per share from

During 2009, £0.1m of the goodwill acquired relates to the acquisition of WDB Asset Management Limited whose principal activities include being an Authorised 
Corporate Director (“ACD”) to several additional funds and that of unit trust management. The remaining goodwill of £0.2m relates to the purchase of the 
business owned by Singer & Friedlander Capital Management Limited. The purchase was agreed on 21 October 2008, however the payment of £0.2m was not 
finalised until 2009. The net assets acquired were already recognised in the year end 31 December 2008, hence the payment of £0.2m is recognised as goodwill.
The goodwill acquired in 2008 relates to the acquisition of the private client business from Kaupthing Singer & Friedlander Limited (in administration) on 
21 October 2008.
In 2008 the goodwill transferred to disposal groups classified as held-for-sale relates to the acquisition of 100% of the share capital of EWSL by ESCL on  
14 June 2006.
Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash generating units (“CGU”) identified according to operating segment. An operating segment-level summary of the 
goodwill allocation is presented below:

At 31 December      9.0 1.7 10.7
Impairment test for goodwill
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial 
budgets approved by the management covering a five year period. The growth rates used (3% for both CGU’s) to extrapolate the cash flow projections 
beyond this period do not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the industries in which the CGU’s operate. The pre-tax discounts rates used for the 
Investment Banking and Private Client business were 10.3% and 8.9% respectively. The result of the value in use calculations suggests there is a significant 
amount of headroom over the goodwill balances allocated to the CGUs above.

The acquired business contributed revenues of £75,000 and a profit of £4,000 to the Group for the period from acquisition to 31 December 2009. If the 
acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2009, revenue and profit for the year ended 31 December 2009 would have been £163,000 and £35,000 respectively.
The goodwill is attributable to the economies of scale expected from combining the operations of Williams de Broë Limited and WDB Asset Management Limited.
Goodwill of £0.2m was also recognised on the completion of the purchase of the business owned by Singer & Friedlander Capital Management Limited. The 
purchase was agreed on 21 October 2008, however the payment of £0.2m was not finalised until 2009. The net assets acquired were already recognised in the 
year end 31 December 2008, hence the payment of £0.2m is recognised as goodwill.

In the ordinary course of business the Group has given letters of indemnity to clients in respect of lost share certificates. Although the contingent liability 
arising from these cannot be precisely quantified, it is not believed to be material.
As at 31 December 2009, the Company has a loan commitment to Evolution Securities China Limited (an associate of the Group) of £0.7m which expires 
on 31 March 2012. Of the £0.7m commitment, £0.2m was drawn down by Evolution Securities China Limited on 22 January 2010. Further details of this 
payment are disclosed within note 34 of the Group’s Financial Statements. 
33. Lease Commitments
The Group has annual non-cancellable operating lease commitments in respect of land and buildings of £2.1m (2008: £2.5m). The future aggregate 
minimum annual lease payments to which these amounts relate expire as follows:
    2009 2008
Land and buildings    £m £m
Within one year     0.1 –
Within two to five years    2.0 2.5
    2.1 2.5
The Group leases various retail offices under non-cancellable operating lease agreements. The lease terms are between one and five years, and the majority of 
lease agreements are renewable at the end of the lease period at market rate.
34. Post Balance Sheet Events
Additional Leases
On 15 February 2010, and following the completion of a further lease over an additional floor at the Group’s Head Office at 100 Wood Street, the Group is 
committed to spending up to £3.0m to cover the costs of refurbishment to both the new and existing floors.
Long Term Incentive Plan
On 22 January 2010, the Group held a General Meeting to approve three long term incentive plans. The plans were approved by attending shareholders 
unanimously on a show of hands. The following proxy votes were received prior to the meeting:

Background to Joint Share Ownership Plan and Growth Share Ownership Plans
The Remuneration Committee has concluded that new long term incentive arrangements are needed which reflect the differing responsibilities of executives 
at group level and of senior employees in the two business strands of the Group, that is, the institutional investment banking business of Evolution Securities 
Limited and the private client business of Williams de Broë Limited.
Accordingly, the Remuneration Committee has introduced the JSOP for executives of the Company and GSOPs for senior employees of each of Evolution 
Securities Limited and its subsidiaries and Williams de Broë Limited and its subsidiaries.
Subordinated Loan
On 22 January 2010, the Company entered into a subordinated loan agreement with ESCL for an amount of £245,000. The loan is interest bearing at a rate 
equal to 10% per annum.

  Represents the period since when the performance condition (as described below) can be met at which point all awards meet the vesting criteria.
 
Options under the share incentive schemes are valued using a Black-Scholes model adjusted for dividends according to those declared by the Company.  
The Company estimates the number of options likely to vest and expenses that value over the relevant period. 
2
  Volatility has been estimated by taking the historical volatility in the Company’s share price over a three year period.
 
In the case of awards of call rights, which have an exercise price of 1p per ordinary share, the fair value is based on the market value at the time of grant 
discounted by the dividend yield over the expected life and therefore no volatility or risk free rate is shown within the table above.

1. Accounting Policies
Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the 
European Union (“EU”) and IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of 
the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The 
Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, 
as modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets. 
A summary of the Company accounting policies is set out below, together 
with an explanation of where changes have been made to previous policies on 
the adoption of new accounting standards in the year.
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company has 
elected not to present its own Income Statement for the year. The Company 
reported a loss for the financial year ended 31 December 2009 of £1.4m 
(2008: Profit of £2.2m). 
Significant accounting policies
a) Investments in subsidiaries
An undertaking is regarded as a subsidiary undertaking if the Company has 
the power to exercise control over its operating and financial policies. This 
generally accompanies a shareholding of greater than 50% of the voting 
power. The Company’s shares in subsidiary undertakings are stated in the 
Balance Sheet at cost less provisions and any impairments incurred.
The carrying value of investments in subsidiary undertakings is assessed at 
the reporting date or whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate 
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The impairment review 
comprises a comparison of the carrying amount of the investment with its 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an investment’s 
fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. An impairment loss is recognised 
in the Income Statement in the period in which it occurs for the amount by 
which the investment’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
b) Associates
Associates are those entities in which the Company has significant influence, 
but not control, over the financial and operating policies and in which the 
Company generally has between 20% and 50% voting power. Investments 
in associates are carried at cost, and are assessed at the reporting date or 
whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount 
may not be recoverable. The impairment review comprises a comparison of 
the carrying amount of the investment with its recoverable amount. 
Financial assets and liabilities 
The Company classifies its financial assets and liabilities as available-for-sale 
financial assets, loans and receivables, trade and other receivables, cash and 
cash equivalents, and trade and other payables. The classification depends on 
the purpose for which the assets and liabilities were acquired. Management 
determines the classification of its investments at initial recognition and  
re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date.
Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs 
for all financial assets not carried at fair value through the profit or loss. 
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from 
the financial assets have expired or where the Company has transferred 
substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. Financial liabilities are 
derecognised when they are extinguished, that is, when the obligation is 
discharged, cancelled or expires.
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are either designated in this category or are 
not classified in any of the other categories. Available-for-sale financial assets 
are those intended to be held for an indefinite period of time, which may be 
sold in response to needs for liquidity or changes in interest rates, exchange 
rates or equity prices. They are initially recognised at fair value including 
direct and incremental transaction costs. They are subsequently held at fair 
value. For available-for-sale financial assets that are quoted in active markets, 
fair values are determined by reference to the current quoted bid/offer price. 
Dividends on available-for-sale equity instruments are recognised in the 
Income Statement when the entity’s right to receive payment is established.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included as a separate 
component of equity within available-for-sale and other reserves until sale  
or when impaired, when the cumulative gain or loss is transferred to the 
Income Statement. 
The management of the Company makes an assessment at each Balance 
Sheet date as to whether there is any objective evidence of impairment. In the 
case of equity investments classified as available-for-sale, the cumulative loss 
(measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair 
value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised  
in the Income Statement) is removed from equity and recognised in the 
Income Statement. 
Subordinated loan
Subordinated loans are non-derivatives with fixed or determinable payments 
that are not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets, 
except for loans with maturities greater than twelve months after the Balance 
Sheet date in which case these are classified as non current assets. These 
loans are measured at amortised costs together with any directly attributable 
transaction costs. 
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, 
less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables 
is established when there is objective evidence that the Company will not 
be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the 
receivables. Evidence that an impairment of the asset may be required 
includes ageing of the debt beyond 180 days, persistent lack of communication 
and internal awareness of third party trading difficulties.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at 
the effective interest rate. The amount of the provision is recognised in the 
Income Statement within operating expenses.
Cash and cash equivalents
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents include 
cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, and other short-term highly 
liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and 
which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Such investments 
are normally those with original maturities of three months or less.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value, which is 
the agreed market price at the time goods or services are provided. The 
Company accrues for all goods and services consumed but yet unbilled at 
amounts representing management’s best estimate of fair value.
Evolution Group employees share trust
The Trust is a separately administered trust, which is funded by loans from 
the Company, and the assets of which comprise shares in the Company.  
The Company recognises the assets and liabilities of the Trust in its  
Financial Statements and shares held by the Trust are recorded at cost 
as a deduction in arriving at shareholders’ funds until the shares vest 
unconditionally with employees. 
Financial Statements
Notes to the Financial Statements The Evolution Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 81
01 Business Review 02 Management and Governance 03 Financial Statements
IAS 39 has a scope for exclusion of treasury share transactions linked to 
share-based payment awards. The Trust is considered to act as an agent for 
the Company, and accordingly the Trust’s assets and liabilities have been 
aggregated to reflect the substance of the relationship between itself and  
the Company. 
Group recharge
The Company, through the normal course of business, incurs costs on  
behalf of its subsidiaries. These costs are recharged, where relevant, to  
those subsidiaries.
The Company recharges its subsidiaries for cash for the cost of share options. 
The amount of the recharge is equivalent to the cost of shares purchased by 
the Company to satisfy the awards made to subsidiary employees under the 
Group’s employee share scheme. This recharge reduces the investment in 
subsidiary and a corresponding entry is made to increase retained earnings. 
Employee benefits
(a) Pension obligations
The Company does not offer any company pension schemes. However, the 
Company does make defined contributions to employees’ approved personal 
pension plans, and the costs of these are charged to the Income Statement 
when they are incurred.
(b) Share-based plans
The Company’s management awards high-performing employees bonuses 
in the form of equity-settled share based payments, from time to time, on a 
discretionary basis. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant. Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes 
pricing model or, in the case of awards of call rights, which have an exercise 
price of 1p per ordinary share; the fair value is based on the market value 
at the time of grant discounted by the dividend yield over the expected life. 
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based 
payment is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on 
the Company’s estimate of the number of shares, which will eventually vest. 
The options are generally subject to a three year service vesting condition, 
and their fair value is recognised as an employee benefit expense with a 
corresponding increase in retained earnings within the vesting period. 
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are 
credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when the options 
are exercised. 
The issuance by the Company to employees of its subsidiaries of an award 
over the Company’s shares is treated as a capital contribution by the 
Company in its subsidiaries. This additional investment in subsidiaries results 
in a corresponding entry to shareholders’ equity. The additional capital 
contribution is based on the fair value of the awards issued allocated on a 
straight line basis over the relevant vesting period.
Current and deferred taxes
Current taxes are computed on a basis of the tax laws enacted or substantially 
enacted at the Balance Sheet date in the countries where the Company’s 
subsidiaries operate and generate income. 
Deferred taxes are computed using the liability method, on temporary 
differences between the bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in financial statements. The deferred tax is not accounted for if it 
arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other 
than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profit nor loss. 
The Company is entitled to a tax deduction for amounts treated as 
compensation on exercise of certain employee share options under UK 
tax rules. As explained under “Share-based plans” above, a compensation 
expense is recorded in the Company’s Income Statement over the period 
from the grant date to the vesting date of the relevant options. As there is a 
temporary difference between the accounting and tax bases, a deferred tax 
asset is recorded. The deferred tax asset arising is calculated by comparing 
the estimated amount of tax deduction to be obtained in the future (based 
on the Company’s share price at the Balance Sheet date) with the cumulative 
amount of the compensation expense recorded in the Income Statement. If 
the amount of estimated future tax deduction exceeds the cumulative amount 
of the remuneration expense, at the statutory tax rate, the excess is recorded 
directly in equity, against retained earnings. 
2. Financial Instruments and Risk Management
The risk management process of the Company is aligned with those of 
the Group as a whole and are fully integrated into the risk management 
framework and processes described within note 3 of the Group’s Financial 
Statements. 
Through its normal operations, the Company is exposed to a number of risks, 
the most significant of which are market and credit risks. Its strong cash and 
cash equivalents position ensures that it has low liquidity risk.
(a) Market Risk
Equity Risk
The Company is exposed to equity market risk in respect of its equity 
holdings, which comprise available-for-sale financial assets. 
The Board continues to review the performance of existing available-
for-sale financial assets in the Company’s portfolio and realises these 
investments when deemed appropriate. Note 10 summarises the available-
for-sale financial assets at the year end date and the disposals and fair value 
movements made in the year.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the Company’s exposure to 
equity risk. The analysis is based on the assumption that underlying equity 
prices had an increase/decrease of 10% with all other variables held constant 
at the year end. The results as outlined below, are only representative of 
the impact that is observed at the year end, and not of the impact that was 
observed during the year. This occurs due to a varying investment held 
throughout the year.
A 10% increase/decrease in equity prices would result in an increase/
decrease in equity reserves of £1.2m (2008: £0.2m).
Foreign Exchange Risk
The Company’s activities are primarily denominated in Sterling and it 
therefore has limited foreign exchange risk. The majority of transactions 
denominated in a foreign currency that would expose the Company to 
currency risk are hedged immediately, normally in the spot market. The 
Company does not enter into forward exchange contracts for hedging 
anticipated transactions. The table below summarises the Company’s 
currency exposure arising from unmatched monetary assets or liabilities  
not denominated in the functional currency of the Company:

2. Financial Instruments and Risk Management (continued)
Interest Rate Risk
The Company has interest bearing assets in mainly cash and cash equivalents. The Company has a policy of maintaining excess funds in cash and short term 
deposits and is exposed to short term interest rate risk. At the year end, all of the Company’s excess funds were invested in cash and short-term deposits. The 
Company does not use any derivatives to hedge interest rate risk.
If LIBOR market interest rates had been 100 basis points higher/lower during 2009, with all other variables held constant, loss for the year (2008: profit for 
the year) would have been £1.2m (2008: £0.8m) (lower) and £1.2m (2008: £0.8m) (higher).
(b) Credit Risk
The quality of the financial assets in terms of their credit rating is “AAA-A” rated 79% (2008: 95%) and “Un-Rated” 21% (2008: 5%). Of the “Un-Rated” 
balance 16% relates to the Company’s investment in WDB Capital UK Equity Fund Limited.
The ratings noted above have been derived using source information from Standard & Poors and Moody’s. All financial assets over an “A Rated” rating 
are consolidated under the “AAA-A Rated” category and represent assets such as cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables. All “Un-Rated” assets 
have undergone a thorough credit review and have been allocated internal ratings based on this review. All items classified as neither past due nor impaired, 
following the credit reviews described above, are considered to be recoverable and therefore of a credit quality that do not require impairment. 
The following table of financial assets analyses amounts due by ageing:
    Neither past due nor impaired Carrying value

Cash and cash equivalents    75.5 75.5
    91.2 91.2
The carrying amounts disclosed above for the Companies financial assets represents the maximum exposure to credit risk. No collateral is held as security on 
these exposures, and the terms have not been renegotiated.
(c) Liquidity Risk
The Company seeks to manage liquidity risk, to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest cash assets safely and profitably. 
The Company actively maintains a mixture of cash and short term deposits that are designed to ensure the Company has sufficient available funds for its 
operations. The Company deems there is sufficient liquidity for the near future. 
The tables below analyse the Company’s future cash outflows based on the remaining period to the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed are the 
contractual undiscounted cash flows.

d) Fair Value Estimation
Effective 1 January 2009, the Company adopted the amendment to IFRS 7 for the financial instruments that are measured on the Balance Sheet at fair value. 
This requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy:
 •   Level 1 –  Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
 •   Level 2 –  Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly as prices or indirectly derived
  from prices;
 •   Level 3 –  Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The following table presents the Company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at 31 December 2009:
  Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total
Assets  £m £m £m £m
Available-for-sale financial assets  12.1 – – 12.1
Total assets  12.1 – – 12.1
There have not been any changes in level 3 instruments for the year ended 31 December 2009.
The carrying values of assets and liabilities not held at fair value (cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, counterparty receivables, other receivables,  
and trade and other payables) are not significantly different from fair value.
e) Capital Risk Management
The Company’s objective when managing capital is to safeguard the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for 
shareholders of the Company and the Company monitors capital risk on the basis of total shareholder funds, at 31 December 2009 the Company had 
shareholder funds of £123.5m (2008: £143.2m).
The Company is not regulated by the Financial Services Authority (“FSA”), but is part of an FSA regulated group. 
3. Auditors’ Remuneration
During the year, the Company obtained the following services from the Company’s auditors at costs as detailed below:
    2009 2008
Audit services    £m £m
Fees payable to the Company’s auditor for the audit of the Company’s annual accounts  0.1 0.1

    0.2 0.3
Taxation services include compliance services such as tax return preparation and advisory services such as consultation on tax matters, tax advice relating to 
transactions and other tax planning and advice. 
4. Deferred Tax
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using a tax rate of 28% (2008: 28.5%).
The movement on the deferred tax assets is detailed below:

Additions
During the year the Company made a further investment into Evolution Securities China Limited (“ESCL”) of £1.2m.
During the year, in recognition of grant of options over equity instruments to employees of subsidiaries the Company has increased its investments in 
subsidiaries by £3.7m in the year (2008: £10.7). The credit entry to this represents an increase in the Company’s available-for-sale and other reserves as 
shown in note 13.
The deduction to investment in subsidiaries of £7.8m in the year (2008: £27.1m) relates to the recharge by the Company for market purchases and costs 
associated with the employee share scheme to its underlying subsidiaries.
On 8 November 2009 the Company incorporated a new legal entity by the name Darwin Strategic Limited, this entity has not commenced trading.
In the prior year the Company made a further investment into Williams de Broë Limited of £5.0m.
Deemed Disposals
On the 31 March 2009 ESCL issued new equity to First Eastern Financial Holdings Limited. The issue of this new equity caused the Company’s shareholding 
in ESCL to fall from 71% to 48.5%. As a result of this transaction the Group has ceased to control ESCL, and hence has changed its holding in ESCL from an 
investment in subsidiary to an investment in associate.

1  
Represents the period since when the performance condition (as described below) can be met at which point all awards meet the vesting criteria.
 
Options under the share incentive schemes are valued using a Black-Scholes model adjusted for dividends according to those declared by the Company.  
The Company estimates the number of options likely to vest and expenses that value over the relevant period. 
2
  Volatility has been estimated by taking the historical volatility in the Company’s share price over a three year period. In the case of awards of call rights, 
which have an exercise price of 1p per ordinary share, the fair value is based on the market value at the time of grant discounted by the dividend yield over 
the expected life and therefore no volatility or risk free rate is shown within the table above.
The share options outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average exercise price and expected remaining life as follows:

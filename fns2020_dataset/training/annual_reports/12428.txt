POUNDLAND AT A GLANCE
Who we are
Poundland is the largest single price value general merchandise retailer in 
Europe by both sales and by number of stores. Poundland operates a network 
of 528 stores across the UK and Ireland. Stores are sited in convenient 
locations, typically with high footfall, across a mixture of high streets, 
shopping centres and retail parks and are all operated on a leasehold basis.
What we do
Poundland is a price driven, volume-led business offering an extensive range 
of products across 17 categories, with the average Poundland store carrying 
approximately 3,000 core range SKUs including over 1,000 branded products. 
These branded products account for the majority of sales, with popular brand 
names such as Cadbury, Mars, Heinz, Nestle and Colgate representing an 
important footfall driver.
How we do it
Poundland is headquartered in Willenhall, West Midlands, and we employed 
on average 12,829 colleagues in the 2014 financial year, of which 
approximately 70% were employed on a part-time basis. We operate three 
distribution centres. A new warehouse is expected to open in 2014 in Harlow 
in the South East of England to replace the existing temporary facility at 
Hoddesdon.

MARKET OVERVIEW
Although we operate in an attractive sub-sector of the overall UK 
retail market, (the value general merchandise retail market), this 
does not tell the whole story. Because we offer our customers 
a broad range of products across 17 different retail categories, 
we compete against a very wide range of retailers, including WH 
Smith in stationery, Holland & Barrett in healthy snacks, Claire’s 
Accessories in hair accessories and Boots in health and beauty. In 
2013, the total retail market in the UK was worth £360 billion, of 
which our share was less than 0.3%.
This low share of the total retail market and the growing appeal of 
the discount sector to UK shoppers, underpins our belief that we 
can double our store base in the UK. 
The key trends and features of the UK value general merchandise 
market are listed below:
• One of the fastest growing sectors within UK retail, having 
grown at a CAGR of approximately 15% since 2007, 
predominantly driven by rapid store roll out;
• An established sector that continues to benefit from a structural 
shift in consumer behaviour towards value retailing;
• Significant long-term growth potential with the market forecast 
by PwC to grow at a CAGR of approximately 9.3% per year 
between 2012 and 2017, driven by a combination of supply and 
demand factors, and also supported by evidence in the more 
mature US value general merchandise market; and
• While the value general merchandise market has primarily 
been targeted towards less affluent consumers, there is an 
increasing penetration of more affluent consumers. 
While many new consumers entered the discount retail market 
during difficult economic times, research suggests that the majority 
of these consumers will continue to use value retailers, even as 
the economy improves.  Research suggests that a number of these 
customers are from the higher socio demographic groups. (source: 
PwC, ‘‘The UK Value General Merchandising Market’’, November 
2013). We think that this will benefit us and the discount market as 
a whole, as its addressable market increases.

OUR BUSINESS MODEL
Supply
How we source products
We source from nearly 1,000 suppliers across the world and have an office in Hong Kong and an exclusive 
sourcing arrangement in India, which together provide a key competitor advantage in our sourcing of 
general merchandise products. No one supplier has more than 5% of our turnover. We aim to buy and 
sell our products responsibly – so our customers know that everything they buy is produced under fair 
conditions. We have a clear social and ethical accountability policy that we ask all our suppliers to comply 
with.
Our customer proposition is enhanced by our strong track record of product innovation and range 
development. We work closely with suppliers in developing exclusive products and pack sizes.  We also 
have strong in-house product development capabilities, offering over 50 own label brand families. 
We believe that Poundland’s own label offering in Fast Moving Consumer Goods (“FMCG”) categories, as well as its strength in developing 
new product ranges, typically non-consumable, general merchandise products, are key differentiators versus other single price value 
general merchandise retailers in the UK.
Distribution
How we manage our distribution across UK and Ireland
We operate from three distribution centres, including two regional distribution centres located in the 
Midlands and South East England (Springvale and Hoddesdon, respectively), and one national distribution 
centre located in the Midlands (Willenhall). All products are taken to one of our distribution centres 
before onwards distribution to our stores, with the exception of fresh products which are delivered 
direct to stores by the supplier or a third-party. The Springvale, Hoddesdon and Willenhall distribution 
centres have capacities of approximately 300,000 square feet, 200,000 square feet and 200,000 square 
feet, respectively. The regional distribution centres cater mostly for FMCG products and the national 
distribution centre caters predominantly for other products. In the  financial year, 96% of product sales in 
Ireland were supplied via our UK distribution centres.
The Hoddesdon distribution centre was opened as a temporary facility in 2012 and marked our first major distribution expansion outside 
the West Midlands. It enabled the Company to reduce the distance travelled to deliver inventory to our stores and help reduce our carbon 
footprint. In 2014, we plan to replace the Hoddesdon distribution centre with a 350,000 square foot purpose-built warehouse in Harlow, 
which will serve as our main depot for South East England and will also provide initial support to the business as we look to expand into 
continental Europe. The adjacency of the new site enables us to transfer the majority of existing, experienced colleagues to the new 
operation. The Harlow distribution centre will increase our total distribution capacity to be able to operate approximately 750 stores in 
the UK, Ireland and Europe. By opening the Harlow facility, we expect to achieve gains in efficiency, including enhanced route efficiency 
and productivity through increased use of double-decker trailers.
We also have four cross-docking facilities, located in Scotland (in Coatbridge), the North East of England (in Spennymoor), Ireland (in 
Dublin) and Northern Ireland (in Larne). The cross-docking facilities in Scotland and the North East of England are operated by our 
logistics partner, DHL. Northern Ireland and Ireland are serviced by AM Nexday, a transportation services company based in Belfast. We 
provide our own transportation services for our Hoddesdon, Springvale and Willenhall distribution centres.
Retail
Our stores and product range
We have established our market-leading position as Poundland in the UK by focusing on delivering 
amazing value to our customers every day. We believe that this is achieved by selling a wide range of great 
products and top brands, offering many new exciting lines each week, at a clear, consistent price point 
which offers our customers amazing value for money. The same commitment to delivering amazing value 
is met in Ireland under our Dealz brand.
We sell a wide range of products across 17 product categories including household goods, grocery, 
impulse and health and beauty, with all products in our stores in the UK selling for £1. Some of the most 
recognised consumer brands in the world are sold in our stores, including Cadbury, Mars, Heinz, Nestlé and 
Colgate. This branded product offering drives footfall to stores, and of the approximately 3,000 core range 
SKUs in our average Poundland store, over 1,000 SKUs are third-party branded. Our own label, typically 
higher margin brands, provide our customers with even greater choice and better value. 
Over the course of the year, our product offer is refreshed continuously, with around 200 new products introduced each week. This 
drives footfall to the stores, as our customers in the UK and Ireland love this treasure trove appeal.
We believe that the single price point in the UK provides us with a competitive advantage to other retailers as it sets a clear and 
consistent base for price comparison. Customers are able to compare prices on identical products across retailers knowing that at 
Poundland, product will be on sale for £1. Introduction Strategy Governance Financials
Poundland Group plc Annual report and financial statements for p/e 30 March 2014 - 7
1. Continued focus on delivering 
amazing value to our customers 
every day 
We have, through our long track record of profitable growth, 
demonstrated our ability to maintain and strengthen our position 
as the market-leading, single price value general merchandise 
retailer in the UK. To continue to drive our business performance, 
we will remain true to our goal of delivering amazing value to our 
customers every day. 
We believe that product innovation and exclusive product ranges 
are key competitive advantages and therefore we remain 
committed to refreshing and developing our product range to meet 
consumer demands. We will, where appropriate, continue to focus 
on increasing store marketing with tailored offers and third-party 
promotions, vouchers and marketing activity.
2. Continued store roll out 
We have a track record of rapid store roll out in the UK, with a 
proven ability to identify strongly performing locations.  The value 
general merchandise market is forecast to continue its exciting 
growth.  We expect to remain as one of the winners in this sector.  
We generate pay backs from our new stores in around one year, 
so it makes sense to continue to add to our store base but only in 
sustainable shopping venues. We believe, supported by external 
research conducted by the Javelin Group, that there is potential for 
more than 1,000 Poundland stores in the UK, making it possible to 
more than double our existing UK portfolio. In addition, we believe 
that there is potential for more than 70 Dealz stores in Ireland. We 
plan therefore to continue opening stores at similar rates as the 
last three years, adding approximately 60 net new stores per year, 
of which approximately 10% are expected to be in Ireland. We 
believe that there are opportunities to add stores throughout the UK 
and in Ireland, as the Poundland business model is robust across 
a wide variety of store sizes (between 1,700 and 12,000 square 
feet), formats (high street, shopping centre, retail park) and market 
demographics (22% of Poundland’s UK customers are from the 
affluent AB socio-demographic group, based on a survey conducted 
by Poundland in 2013). We are increasingly focused on retail park 
stores as part of the overall new store mix, as they tend to be more 
profitable and have a higher average transaction value.
3. Optimisation of existing store 
portfolio
We will continue to seek to drive growth in both average transaction 
value and in number of transactions. We see opportunities to drive 
this through
• Continued innovation and development of our exclusive product 
range
• Better category management
• Improved micro marketing
We also expect, over the long term, as the consumer recovery 
builds, to sell more general merchandise products and will continue 
to improve our product range in these categories.
Around 120 of our stores are smaller than 4,000 square feet. While 
some of these stores are appropriately sized for their location and 
competitor set, we see opportunities to resite and/or expand around 
half of these stores, which should enhance both their performance 
and their long term sustainability.
4. Planned expansion into 
continental Europe
We have carried out a detailed assessment of the expansion 
prospects in continental Europe, including market size, price 
differentials, brand overlap with the UK, supplier considerations, 
logistics and site availability. It is our belief that Spain presents a 
highly attractive opportunity for expansion under our Dealz brand. In 
addition to favourable market conditions for Dealz in Spain, we have 
identified high interest in the concept through consumer surveys. 
Pricing analysis has also illustrated that Dealz pricing is competitive 
and sustainable. Property research has identified good levels of 
site availability and favourable property costs, including favourable 
rental terms, with typical leases of ten years with short break 
periods (e.g. two-year break periods).
We expect to open up to ten stores over a two-year period, 
which will initially be supplied from our UK distribution centres. 
The Spanish operations will be staffed by a core local team with 
extensive Spanish retail experience and will be supported by a 
UK-based senior management team. We expect that there will be 
significant brand and supplier overlap with the Poundland and Dealz 
ROI product base. The pilot stores’ performance will be assessed 
carefully ahead of any further roll out in Spain or elsewhere in 
continental Europe. The cost of this trial will be low and we believe 
that it represents a low cost and low risk strategy to test market 
opportunity.
5. Format and channel development
We will continue to explore new growth opportunities, such as 
the potential development of a transactional website to access 
new customers and fulfil different shopping missions, as well as 
developing new store formats such as a city centre format, which 
is a smaller store designed to operate in high footfall city centre 
locations with a focus on impulse and convenience purchases. 
In addition there may be opportunities within the value and general 
merchandise retail market for further consolidation, which we will 
explore as and when they arise.
OUR GROUP STRATEGY 8 - Poundland Group plc Annual report and financial statements for p/e 30 March 2014
“
We have achieved another record profit 
performance across the Group, with our store 
opening programme on track, underlying profits 
in line with market consensus and good cash

”
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
2014 was a very important year for Poundland.  We 
opened our 500th store in November, listed on the London 
Stock Exchange in March and achieved sales of nearly £1 
billion. Demand for shares in Poundland was high and the 
offer was more than 15 times oversubscribed. The flotation 
has been well received.  
Against a backdrop of continuing difficulties in the 
economy for consumers, and retailers in particular, 
Poundland has stood firm in offering its customers 
amazing value.  We believe, as the economy begins its 
turnaround, our future prospects are even brighter, with 
Poundland having become a retailer of choice. 
Our successful international expansion into the Republic 
of Ireland under the Dealz brand has continued. Our sales 
are growing strongly. Expansion of the Dealz brand into 
continental Europe is an exciting prospect and we are 
planning a small number of trial stores in Spain in the year 
ahead.
Andrew Higginson 
Chairman 
2 July 2014
Trading Performance
This has been another record year for Poundland with total sales 
just short of £1 billion, up 13.3% on the previous year and the total 
number of 70 net new stores opened during the year bringing the 
total estate to 528 at the year end. Between the end of the year and 
the date of this Report we have opened a further 12 stores.
Further details of the Trading Performance are given in the Chief 
Financial Officer’s Report beginning on page 14.
Stock Exchange Listing
Poundland Group plc completed its premium listing on the London 
Stock Exchange and was admitted to the Main Market on 17 
March 2014. The IPO was very successful, being many times 
oversubscribed and the shares continue to trade at a level above 
the initial issue price of 300p.
The Board and Corporate Governance 
I firmly believe that we have a high calibre and experienced Board 
of Directors who will continue to drive the Company to an even 
more successful future. In addition to Chief Executive Officer, Jim 
McCarthy, Chief Financial Officer, Nick Hateley and Trading and 
Marketing Director, Richard Lancaster, I was delighted to announce 
earlier in the year that we had four new independent Non-
Executives joining the team.  All four Non-Executives bring a wealth 
of experience to the Board. Darren Shapland as Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director;  Trevor Bond as Chair of the Audit and Risk 
Committee; Tea Colaianni as Chair of the Remuneration Committee 
and Grant Hearn  as Chair of the Governance and Nominations 
Committee.
Full details of the Committees and their duties are contained in the 
Corporate Governance Report beginning on page 32 and the reports 
from the Audit and Risk Committee and Remuneration Committee 
beginning on pages 35 and 38 respectively. We believe these 
Non Executives will enhance the diversity of the board and bring 
independent judgements on issues of strategy and performance as 
we go forward as a plc. 
Andrew Higginson - Chairman Introduction Strategy Governance Financials
Poundland Group plc Annual report and financial statements for p/e 30 March 2014 - 9
We also have the benefit of the considerable expertise of Paul Best 
and Stephen Coates who continue on the Board as the appointed 
representatives of Warburg Pincus. The combined experience and 
the insight of the Executive Directors, the Non-Executive Directors 
and highly talented and experienced Executive Team will be 
invaluable to the Board.
Full details of the Directors and their memberships of the Board’s 
standing committees can be seen on pages 26 to 27.
Our People
I know that I speak for the whole Board when I say that I am 
immensely proud of our management teams and colleagues across 
the business whether in our stores, distribution centres or the 
Customer Support Centre, for the dedication that they have shown 
and continue to show to the Company and the great service that 
they give to our customers. It has been their hard work which has 
enabled the Company to successfully list on the Stock Market and it 
is their continued hard work which will ensure our future success.
Outlook
Poundland delivers amazing value to our customers every day and, 
as a result of the support from our customers, we have achieved 
another record profit performance across the Group, with our store 
opening programme on track, underlying profits in line with market 
consensus and good cash generation. Looking ahead, we will 
continue to manage the business tightly while investing in clear 
opportunities for future growth and are confident in making further 
progress in the new financial year.
With regard to dividend, as noted in the Prospectus issued to 
prospective Shareholders prior to listing, subject to sufficient 
distributable reserves being available, the Directors intend that the 
first dividend to be declared by the Company will be the interim 
dividend in respect of the first half of the 2015 financial year, which 
is expected to be paid in January 2015.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW
Overview
Poundland started trading from its first store at Burton-upon-
Trent in 1990. Since then, the business has expanded rapidly and 
now serves approximately 5 million value conscious customers 
every week from over 500 stores across the UK and Ireland. The 
Poundland retail proposition is simple and compelling, based on 
selling over 2,000 general merchandise products and over 1,000 
mainly branded FMCG goods at the single price point of just £1. 
Our admission to the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange 
in March 2014 marked a significant milestone in the Company’s 
development and is testament to the growth and performance of 
the business that has been providing amazing value to shoppers for 
nearly a quarter of a century.
We have a track record of delivering strong profitable growth and 
believe we have significant future opportunities through the delivery 
of amazing value every day to millions of discerning customers. 
This is underpinned by our trusted brands, differentiated value 
proposition, strong supplier relationships and our well-invested and 
scalable infrastructure.
In recent years there has been significant structural change in the 
UK’s retail market with the value sector becoming a mainstream 
feature.  As the UK’s single price market leader, Poundland has been 
instrumental in that change. Our £1 price point and our amazing 
value appeal to an increasingly broad section of shoppers, with 
nearly a quarter of our UK customers now coming from the more 
affluent AB demographic.
I am pleased to report another record year for Poundland with 
significant sales and profit growth together with a strong new 
store opening programme. I thank all of our colleagues throughout 
the Company for their commitment, hard work and dedication in 
delivering our strong performance. We are also indebted to our large 
and loyal customer base who continue to find Poundland’s amazing 
value and single £1 price point helpful in providing certainty in their 
household budgeting. This has been especially important in the 
purchase of everyday essential products that have become even 
more important to consumers during the economic turbulence of 
recent years.
In September 2011, Poundland successfully entered the Republic of 
Ireland under the “Dealz” brand where we sell the vast majority of 
products for a1.49. Our Dealz stores in Ireland became profitable 
in their first full year and, at the 2014 year end, we were operating 
from 31 Dealz stores in Ireland and 2 further stores on the Isle 
of Man and Orkney. We intend to further strengthen our market 
presence with additional openings during the coming year. The 
Republic of Ireland and Isle of Man delivered sales of £59.6 million 
during the year, representing 6% of our Group sales. 
We have continued to expand our presence in the UK and Republic 
of Ireland with the opening of 70 net new stores, taking our overall 
estate to 528 stores, with our total trading space expanding by 
18.9%.
Our entry into Ireland under the Dealz brand demonstrates that we 
are not only capable of generating attractive financial returns but, 
also of rapidly establishing a successful brand in a new geography. 
Consequently, as previously advised, Poundland will following 
extensive market research later this year trial the Dealz format 
in Spain with preparations well advanced for our low cost, low 
risk entry. Once this is successfully established we will continue 
to research the opportunities to extend into additional European 
countries and will tailor our offer appropriately to local markets. 
What is clear to us is that consumers across the globe increasingly 
appreciate and understand value for money and we are confident 
that Continental Europe offers the Group substantial future growth 
opportunities. 
The continuing expansion of our retail estate within the United 
Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and, shortly, in Spain has led us 
to invest in a third purpose built 350,000 square foot distribution 
centre at Harlow which will open later in the year, replacing 
the 200,000 square foot temporary facility at Hoddesdon.  The 
adjacency of the new site enables us to transfer the majority of 
existing experienced colleagues to the new operation.

Performance
Poundland’s goal remains clear; to offer amazing value to our 
customers every day. This has never been more relevant, with 
Poundland perfectly positioned to continue to meet the needs of 
value conscious consumers throughout the UK and Ireland.
Over the year, our trading performance has been strong with 
sales and underlying EBITDA at record levels. We continue to 
tailor our broad offer based on consumer research, innovation 
and creativity. We now serve around five million customers each 
week with research demonstrating that Poundland customers are 
from an increasingly broad spectrum of socio-economic groups. 
We believe that the Poundland brand has universal appeal and it is 
likely that more and more consumers will use the value sector as 
an increasingly important part of their shopping repertoire. Clearly 
shopping in the value sector is now worn as a badge of honour with 
a sense of pride for those who realise it is sensible to save money.
Managing cost pressures as a fixed single price retailer is a key 
element in our DNA and is a critical component in delivering 
our goal of offering amazing value every day to our customers. 
Poundland has, for nearly a quarter of a century, successfully 
managed its gross margin through a wide variety of economic 
circumstances, competition and many other challenges, including 
significant VAT increases. I am pleased to report that the gross 
margin percentage we achieved in the financial year to 30 March 
2014 was 36.93%, broadly in line with the previous year.
Furthermore, our business continues to remain well invested and 
I am delighted to report that, once again, through sales growth 
and careful cost control we have reduced our operating costs as 
a percentage of sales when compared to the prior year whilst 
continuing to invest in growth.
The continuing appeal of our unique fixed single price point retail 
proposition remains strong. We enjoyed record Christmas sales, 
in both the UK and Republic of Ireland, serving over 7 million 
customers during the peak Christmas week. Our central Supply 
Chain team, including distribution centres and transport, delivered 
a record breaking 2 million cases to Poundland and Dealz stores 
in the same week, ensuring that our store teams could satisfy the 
purchasing requirements of our value savvy customers.
The Poundland and Dealz brands continue to strengthen, and are 
recognised and well regarded. Our strong growth in new store 
openings has once again increased the visibility of our brand, 
which has been further enhanced by our growing number of social 
media followers on sites including Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest 
and the Poundland Blog. We continue to develop the soon to be 
transactional Poundland website, www.poundland.co.uk.
Sourcing
We are proud that on a value basis over 80% of our products are 
sourced through UK suppliers. However, wherever necessary we 
have the ability to source and develop products on a global basis. 
Therefore, our Far and Near East operations based in Hong Kong 
and New Delhi continue to be an important part of our sourcing 
strategy. We continue to strengthen our teams in both these 
locations, especially in the areas of new product development, 
quality assurance and quality control. We aim to buy and sell our 
products responsibly and ask all our suppliers to comply with 
our clear social and ethical accountability policy. This gives our 
customers confidence that everything they buy from us is produced 
under fair conditions.
Our already good UK vendor relationships continue to improve and 
an overwhelming number of primary manufacturers supply us on a 
direct basis. Major manufacturers of branded products increasingly 
recognise the significance of Poundland and the wider value sector 
to consumers together with the outstanding growth opportunity that 
is offered to them to expand their brand reach and increase profits. 
Top brands are naturally very important to our customers and 
securing continuity of supply through these direct channels allows 
us to increase sales through improved availability and differentiate 
our offer from other single price competitors. We continue to 
recognise the relevance of secondary and tertiary suppliers who 
enjoy long-term relationships with the growing Poundland brand.  
All of our supplier partners remain important to the delivery of our 
overall offer. In addition we have continued to develop our own label 
ranges and the year saw the launch of healthy snack and indulgent 
nut ranges which delivered stellar numbers. We shall continue to 
take advantage of gaps in the market for own label ranges that 
deliver value through quality and value at the amazing £1 price 
point.
Colleagues
Our achievements would not be possible without our colleagues 
and I am immensely proud of their commitment and passion 
in delivering amazing value every day. We are proud of our  12 - Poundland Group plc Annual report and financial statements for p/e 30 March 2014
diverse colleague base and support the investment in meeting the 
development and training needs of our 12,000 plus colleagues 
through a detailed training programme, more details of which are set 
out on page 25. Having progressed personally from the shop floor to 
the Board, there is nothing quite like the pride I feel when colleagues 
choose Poundland for their career development and successfully 
progress through the Company.
I am also proud that our colleagues have once again demonstrated 
that they operate at the heart of their local communities. Macmillan 
Cancer Care has, for the fifth consecutive year, been voted by our 
colleagues as their chosen charity. This partnership has worked 
well and has provided an easy way for our caring customers and 
colleagues to support Macmillan. Donations have now exceeded £1 
million with money being raised through a number of different events, 
including the London Marathon, product sample sales and numerous 
themed fundraising events including dress down days and coffee 
mornings in Poundland stores, distribution centres and our Customer 
Support Centre. 
In our Republic of Ireland Dealz stores we support “Make-A-Wish” 
as our chosen charity. Make-A-Wish has one simple aim, to grant 
the wishes of children and young people living with life-threatening 
medical conditions.
Following Admission in March 2014, Poundland has introduced three 
new employee share plans; the Poundland Performance Share Plan, 
the Poundland Restricted Share Plan and the Poundland Company 
Share Option Plan. We will also be introducing the Poundland Save As 
You Earn Plan for eligible colleagues later this year. Details of the plans 
are contained in the Directors’ Remuneration Report starting on page 
38 of this report.
Store portfolio
We commenced the year operating from 458 stores. The Group 
opened a net 70 stores during the year, and at the year-end we 
operated from 495 Poundland locations, 31 Dealz stores in the 
Republic of Ireland and 2 Dealz stores on the Isle of Man and Orkney, 
making the year-end total 528. I am delighted that our store growth 
programme over the last 2 years has created even more opportunities 
for new colleagues to join us, which in time has enabled us to 
bring the Poundland and Dealz retail proposition to thousands more 
customers every day.
Our new store selection process includes detailed internal 
analysis and input from various consultants to help determine site 
longevity and thus the long term profit opportunity by location. The 
overwhelming number of new stores are acquired under normal 
commercial arrangements with property landlords; typically ten 
year leases with monthly rent payments. However, under certain 
opportunistic circumstances we are prepared to enter into short term 
lease arrangements with landlords that deliver attractive returns 
without long-term liabilities. At the end of the period we operated 26 
stores on such short-term leases. 
Outlook
Clearly there are two types of consumer; those who need to shop 
for value and increasingly, those who choose to shop for value. Our 
goal is to provide amazing value every day and we are therefore 
perfectly positioned to meet demand from both types of consumer. Our 
strong sales and volume increases demonstrate the relevance of our 
proposition to consumers from all socio economic groups.
Manufacturers recognise the increased demand for value and are 
working hard to deliver products that meet these requirements. 
Many forward thinking suppliers are also changing their sales, 
account structures and supply chains to adapt to these changes. This 
complements Poundland and the discount sector as a whole and, 
more importantly, is in the best interests of the consumer. We will 
continue to work with our supplier partners to bring amazing value, 
brands, new products and innovation to our customers. 
Poundland remains fully committed to our single price point in the UK. 
We will continue to develop our multi-price Dealz format outside the 
UK.
Due to our strong pipeline of new stores we expect to deliver the 
unique Poundland retail proposition to circa three quarters of a million 
consumers each week by the end of the current financial year. We are 
planning to open at least 60 net new stores during the next financial 
year, including a number of new Dealz stores in Ireland and Spain.  As 
a result, we estimate that we will create a net 1,000 new jobs.
Trading in the first three months of the new fiscal year has been 
strong as our retail proposition continues to gain traction through 
offering amazing value to savvy consumers. Our single price point 
continues to help consumers plan their household budgets with 
certainty and confidence. Our programme of new store openings, 
international expansion and continuing productivity improvements 
are all key drivers of growth. Additionally, while the economy, and 
thus consumer confidence, is improving, we believe the shopping 
behaviours adopted during the last five or six years will remain, and 
that consequently we will further benefit from increased footfall and 
discretionary spending.  We expect the Poundland Group to continue to 
perform well over the forthcoming year.
On behalf of the Poundland Board I thank all of our colleagues 
throughout the company that work so hard and tirelessly to deliver the 
unique shopping experience that allows us to deliver amazing value to 
our customers every day, every week, every month and every year.
We also take this opportunity to thank all of our supplier partners in 
the UK and abroad for their invaluable help in providing products and 
services that are essential in maintaining our reputation for creating 
the unique Poundland and Dealz shopping experience. 
I look forward to the future with confidence.

Nick Hateley - Chief Financial Officer
The 2014 financial year was a good one for Poundland. Sales grew by 13.3% and, due to strong margin management and cost control, this 
translated into an 18.9% increase in underlying EBITDA and a 25.1% increase in underlying EPS, and we managed our cash well. Net debt 
almost halved, despite costs related to our successful stock market flotation and the redemption of preference shares (£20).
“
Group revenue net of VAT was £997.8 million, 
which represents growth on the prior year of 13.3%. 
This improvement was driven by both the impact of a 
strong store opening programme and a return to like-
for-like sales growth.

Other Operating Metrics
The IPO prospectus also identified a number of other key operating metrics and, as the table above shows, our performance was strong in the 
2014 financial year.
Revenue
Group revenue net of VAT was £997.8m (2013: £880.5m), which represents growth on the prior year of 13.3%. This improvement was driven by 
both the impact of a strong store opening programme and a return to like-for-like sales growth. We grew like-for-like sales during the year by 
1.9% (2013: -1.7%), which was driven by our continued focus on providing our customers with amazing value every day and a return to more 
normal competitor opening activity. 
Gross Margin
Gross profits increased by 13.9% to £368.5m (2013: £323.5m) and gross margins increased by 19 basis points to 36.93% (2013: 36.74%). This 
increase was driven by a combination of our improved buying power and the greater mix within our store base of Dealz and retail parks. The 
number of Dealz and retail park stores increased by 35 to 85. These positive factors offset the negative impact of inflation and an increase within 
our sales mix of branded goods. Consumer price inflation during our financial year was 1.6% (2013: 2.8%; Source: ONS) and the proportion of 
branded goods within our sales mix increased by 30 basis points to 63.4% (2013: 63.1%).
2014 2013 Growth (%)
Average net store size (square feet) 5,233  5,143 1.7
Average number of transactions per week (millions) 4.9  4.4 11.4
Average transaction value (£) 4.55  4.44 2.5
Gross sales (£m) 1,160  1,024 13.3 16 - Poundland Group plc Annual report and financial statements for p/e 30 March 2014
Underlying Operating Costs
Underlying operating costs in the financial year increased by 13.3% to £328.5m (2013: £290.0m). This increase in the cost base in the period 
was primarily a result of the increase in the number of stores in the portfolio. Operating costs now account for 32.92% of sales (2013: 32.94%). 
The fact that this was flat year on year, reflects continued investment in the business.
Stripping out depreciation and amortisation, costs as a proportion of sales fell by 5 basis points to 31.52% (2013: 31.57%).

Poundland Group plc Annual report and financial statements for p/e 30 March 2014 - 17
We report non-underlying items in our income statement to show one-off items and to allow investors to better understand the underlying 
performance of the business. In relation to the 2014 financial year, these included costs in respect of our IPO (£10.0m) and costs related to 
strategic initiatives in ecommerce and in international development (£1.3m). In the previous financial year, we incurred costs related to strategic 
initiatives in ecommerce and in international development, costs resulting from the opening of a new temporary distribution centre and costs 
relating to a new store format trial and brand amortisation. 
Underlying EBITDA grew by 18.9% to £54.0m (2013: £45.5m), driven by the strong trading margin performance of the Group.
The table above shows underlying EBIT and movement in underlying margins. Underlying EBIT is calculated after stripping out brand 
amortisation of £1.1m (2013: £1.1m) from depreciation and amortisation expenses, as we regard this charge as non-underlying.  Underlying 
EBIT grew by 19.6% to £40.0m. Group margins increased at both the underlying EBITDA and the underlying EBIT level, by 25 basis points to 
5.41% in the case of the former (2013: 5.16%) and by 21 basis points to 4.01% in the case of the latter (2013: 3.80%).

the write off of unamortised fees associated with the debt facility agreed in August 2010. Underlying finance expense reduced by 11.7% 
(£0.4m), at £3.2m. This was a consequence of the Group’s strong trading performance and high cash conversion rates.

Statutory Profit Before Tax
Underlying profit before tax was £36.8m, which represented an increase of 23.5% on last year (2013: £29.8m). Statutory profit before tax fell by 
18.9% to £21.5m (2013: £26.5m), due to an increase in net non-underlying charges, primarily costs associated with the Group’s stock market 
flotation. 
Taxation
The underlying tax charge for the period was £9.6m (2013: £8.0m). The full year underlying effective tax rate was 26.0% (2013: 27.0%). There 
was a non-underlying adjustment to the tax charge in the 2013 financial year of £4.9m principally relating to a one-off corporation tax refund 
(£4.0m).  
Statutory Profit After Tax
Underlying profit after tax was £27.3m, which represented an increase of 25.1% on last year (2013: £21.8m). Statutory profit after tax fell by 
40.7% to £13.9m (2013: £23.4m), due to an increase in net non-underlying charges, primarily costs associated with the Group’s stock market 
flotation.

Underlying basic and fully diluted earnings per share increased by 25.1% to 10.90p per share (2013: 8.71p per share).  Non-underlying basic

Capital Expenditure continued
During the 2014 financial year, we invested £17.6 million in capital expenditure, primarily related to the opening of new stores.  We continued 
to roll out the Poundland format in the UK and the Dealz format in Ireland. We opened a total of 82 stores in the 2014 financial year, or 70 net of 
closures and resites.
We ended the year with 528 stores (2013: 458), including 495 Poundland stores in the UK and 33 Dealz stores including 31 stores in Ireland and 
2 in the Isle of Man and Orkney, and have a long-term target of 1,000 stores in the UK and 70 in Ireland. We plan to open 60 net new stores a 
year in the UK and Ireland and our pipeline is strong for the current year.
We continue to invest in our infrastructure to support our planned growth and we will open our new purpose-built 350,000 square feet 
distribution centre in Harlow in August. 
Net Debt and Cashflow
Net debt at the end of the year was £4.7m (2013: £9.2m). This is after paying £20m redeeming preference shares and the payment of £4.9m 
in costs associated with our successful stock market flotation. We received no cash benefit from the IPO, as all proceeds went to selling 
shareholders. Operating cash flow of £58.6m represented an increase of 57.2% on last year (2013: £37.3m). This reflects Poundland’s strong 
trading performance and our continued focus on day-to-day cash management. 
Working capital was well managed, with a £15.8m inflow in the year (2013: outflow of £5.8m). Cash conversion was strong at 123.7% (2013: 
82.7%).
New debt facility
On 17 March 2014, we entered into a new banking facility consisting of a revolving credit and a working capital facility of £55m. We utilised 
£30m of the revolving credit facility, together with cash generated from operating activities to repay our term debt.
Dividend
We intend to adopt a dividend policy which reflects our long-term earnings and cashflow potential, targeting a level of annual dividend cover of 
2.5 to 3.5 times based on earnings. We intend that the first dividend to be declared will be the interim dividend in respect of the first half of the 
2015 financial year, payable in January 2015.

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The Group operates in the 
highly competitive  
retail market.
The retail industry, including the value general 
merchandise retail market, is highly competitive, 
particularly with respect to price, product selection 
and quality, store location and design, inventory, 
customer service and advertising. The Group 
competes at national and local levels with a diverse 
group of retailers of varying sizes and covering 
different product categories and geographic markets. 
These competitors include other single price value 
general merchandise retailers, multi-price value 
general merchandise retailers, supermarkets and 
certain high street retailers in particular categories, 
such as health and beauty.
Poundland works extremely hard to ensure that it 
responds adequately to these multiple sources and 
types of competition, including online competition 
whether from existing retailers or new entrants, to 
ensure that competition does not have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s business, results of 
operations and financial condition.
The Group’s cash flows 
from operations may be 
negatively affected if it is not 
successful in managing its 
inventory balances or level 
of inventory shrinkage.
To be successful, Poundland must maintain sufficient 
inventory levels to meet its customers’ demands 
without allowing those levels to increase to an extent 
such that the costs to store and hold the goods 
unduly impact its financial results. If Poundland is 
not successful in managing its inventory balances, 
its cash flows from operations may be negatively 
affected.
Poundland has been successfully maintaining 
sufficient inventory levels throughout its 24 year 
history and continues to employ the good habits that 
it has gained through this extensive experience.
Poundland, like other retailers, experiences inventory 
shrinkage, and employs measures that will reduce the 
problem. Although some level of inventory shrinkage 
is an unavoidable cost of doing business. 
The Group’s success 
is dependent on its 
logistics and distribution 
infrastructure.
The success of Poundland’s business depends on its 
ability to transport goods from its three distribution 
centres to its stores throughout the UK and Ireland in 
a timely and cost-effective manner.  Any unexpected 
delivery delays, such as due to severe weather 
or disruptions to the national or international 
transportation infrastructure, or increases in 
transportation costs, such as due to increased fuel 
costs, could materially adversely affect the Group’s 
business.
Poundland operates from three distribution centres, 
including two regional distribution centres located 
in the Midlands and South East England, and one 
national distribution centre located in the Midlands. All 
products are taken to one of Poundland’s distribution 
centres before onwards distribution to Poundland’s 
stores, with the exception of fresh products which 
are delivered direct to stores by the supplier or a 
third-party.
In late 2014, Poundland plans to replace the 
Hoddesdon distribution centre with a 350,000 square 
foot purpose-built warehouse in Harlow, which will 
serve as Poundland’s main depot for South East 
England and will also provide initial support to the 
business as it looks to expand into continental 
Europe. The Harlow distribution centre will increase 
Poundland’s total distribution capacity to be able 
to operate approximately 750 stores in the UK and 
Ireland. By opening the Harlow facility, Poundland 
expects to achieve gains in efficiency, including 
enhanced route efficiency, and productivity through 
increased use of double-decker trailers.
The Group may not be able  
to increase sales in  
existing stores.
Poundland’s growth from existing stores is dependent 
upon its ability to increase sales, manage costs 
and improve the efficiencies and effectiveness of 
its operations. Increases in sales in existing stores 
are dependent on factors such as competition, 
merchandise sourcing and selection, store operations 
and customer satisfaction.
Once open, our retailing colleagues ensure that they 
gain experience of the new market and develop name 
recognition and identify customer demand with a view 
to successfully competing against local competition 
on a store-by-store basis. The Group seeks to hire, 
train and retain qualified store management and other 
high quality personnel. At the same time colleagues 
within our Distribution Centres and Customer 
Support Centre look to maintain or improve sourcing 
and distribution capacity, information systems and 
other operational system capabilities and manage 
additional expenses and costs.
Operational Risks
The tables below summarise the material financial and operational risks to the Group and how the Group seeks to 
mitigate them in the day-to-day running of the business.
The Group may not be able to 
open profitable new stores 
on a timely basis or at all.
Part of the Group’s growth strategy is to open new 
stores across the UK and Ireland, and the Group 
is also developing plans to trial Dealz stores in 
continental Europe, with a low-cost pilot launch 
planned for Spain in the 2015 financial year. If 
Poundland does not open new stores on a timely or 
profitable basis, it may not realise its growth strategy.
The Group’s highly motivated and experienced 
property department are constantly working to 
identify and secure attractive locations for new stores, 
including selecting the right store formats.

Inflation or other factors may 
affect Poundland’s ability to 
keep pricing at £1 in  
the UK and a1.49 for the 
majority of its products in 
Ireland.
Poundland’s current pricing strategy is predicated 
on providing a wide range of merchandise for 
profitable resale at a single price point of £1 in the 
UK or a1.49 for the vast majority of products in 
Ireland.
Poundland relies on third-
party suppliers and needs 
to identify, develop and 
maintain relationships with 
a significant number of 
qualified suppliers.
Like many retailers, Poundland is dependent on being 
able to source suitable products from suppliers in 
sufficient quantities, at sufficiently low cost and in a 
timely manner but may not be able to do so in such a 
way as to meet our needs.
Poundland is proud that, on a value basis, over 80% 
of our products are sourced from UK suppliers. 
However, whenever necessary, we have the ability to 
source and develop product on a global basis.
Poundland has good, long-term relationships 
with most of its suppliers which are continuing to 
improve as an overwhelming number of primary 
manufacturers supply us on a direct basis. Major 
manufacturers and suppliers are increasingly 
recognising the significant opportunity that Poundland 
is offering them to expand their brand reach.
Poundland has been able to profitably maintain 
its current UK £1 single price strategy for 24 
years by managing its product range (such as 
by introducing new higher margin branded and 
own label products or discontinuing low margin 
products), re-engineering pack sizes, moving 
sources of supply to lower cost economies and 
renegotiating with suppliers, and it will continue to 
apply this strategy whilst closely monitoring any 
factors which may affect the Group’s single price 
point strategy.
The Group depends on the 
Executive Team and other 
highly qualified employees 
to manage its business and 
brands.
The success of Poundland’s strategy depends on 
the continuing services of the Executive Team and 
the Group’s ability to continue to attract, motivate 
and retain other highly qualified employees. 
Retention of the Executive Team and other highly 
qualified employees is especially important in the 
Group’s business due to the limited availability of 
experienced and talented retail executives.
The Group operates a remuneration policy the aim 
of which is to attract, retain and motivate high 
calibre senior management and to focus them on 
the delivery of the Group’s strategic and business 
objectives, to promote a strong and sustainable 
performance culture, to incentivise high growth 
and to align the interests of Executive Directors 
and members of the Executive Committee with 
those of Shareholders through encouraging equity 
ownership. In promoting these objectives the policy 
aims to ensure that no more than is necessary is 
paid and has been structured so as to adhere to 
the principles of good corporate governance and 
appropriate risk management.
The Group’s business may 
be adversely affected by 
economic conditions and 
other factors in the UK, 
Ireland and globally.
Poor economic conditions in the UK, Ireland and 
globally, as well as economic factors such as 
unemployment levels, consumer debt levels, lack 
of available credit, fuel costs, inflation, interest 
and tax rates, may adversely affect the disposable 
income of Poundland’s customers, which could 
result in lower sales.
Poundland has established its market-leading 
position in the UK by continuously focusing on 
delivering amazing value to its customers every 
day and it is this focus that has allowed Poundland 
not only to survive but to grow significantly during 
the recent period of severe economic downturn. 
We believe that this was achieved by selling a 
wide range of great products and top brands, 
offering many new exciting lines each week, at a 
price point intended to offer customers amazing 
value for money, and it will continue this strategy 
into the future. In a 2013 study prepared for 
the Group comparing prices on a range of 106 
comparable products to UK grocery chains (Asda, 
Tesco and Sainsbury), Poundland was the cheapest 
or joint cheapest 90% of the time.
The Group may be subject 
to adverse fluctuations in 
currency exchange rates.
The Group pays certain suppliers overseas in US 
dollars; however, Poundland’s customers pay 
for products in sterling in the UK and euros in 
Ireland. Consequently, the Group bears the risk of 
disadvantageous changes in exchange rates.
The Group’s policy allows these exposures to be 
hedged for up to 18 months forward in order to fix 
the cost in pounds sterling. Hedging is performed 
through the use of foreign currency bank accounts 
and forward foreign exchange contracts. These 
contracts are put in place as part of the Group’s 
gross margin strategy. It enables buyers to be 
given targeted buying rates for products, which are 
set lower than the hedged rate.

CORPORATE AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
Our Goal
At Poundland we deliver amazing value to our customers every day. 
We are famous for our wide range of great products and top brands, 
offering many exciting new lines every week. Poundland will always 
be fun and friendly with something for everyone.
Our values that underpin our goal are as follows:
• We put customers first
• Keep it simple
• Individual responsibility team delivery
• Treat every £ as your own
• Respect each other
• Recognise and celebrate success
The values are representative of the way we aspire to operate our 
business and our colleagues are encouraged to live these values 
during everyday interaction with our customers and each other.
We put our customers first, and fully understand and recognise our 
responsibility to demonstrate to them that we trade fairly and take 
our corporate and social responsibilities seriously. 
We recognise our duty to operate our business in an ethical and 
responsible manner.
Our CSR strategy focuses on 3 key areas:
• Environment
• Social Responsibility
• Employee Responsibility
HEALTH AND SAFETY
We are aware, and take very seriously, our responsibility for the 
health and safety of our customers, colleagues and anyone else 
who comes into contact with our business or visits one of our 
sites. We are constantly seeking ways to improve health and safety 
practices to ensure the safety of all.
ENVIRONMENT
We recognise that our operations impact the environment and that 
this is an increasingly important issue for consumers. We actively 
pursue policies that help us to reduce our carbon footprint and 
costs. We focus on four key areas; using less electricity; maximising 
recycling opportunities; improving fuel efficiency; and reducing 
packaging waste. We consider this key to the ongoing success of 
our business. 
We continually investigate and test new solutions to reduce the 
environmental impact of our operations and constantly seek to 
reduce our energy consumption to deliver efficiencies and meet 
the exacting environmental requirements of our socially aware 
customers. During 2013/14 we reduced our same store emissions 
by 1,064 tonnes CO
2
 and 1,836 tonnes CO
2
 overall.
Our focus on waste management this year has resulted in the 
recycling of 12,596.24 tonnes of cardboard, an improvement of 
10.1% on the prior year. We also recycled 801.88 tonnes of plastic, 
a 16.4% increase year on year.
We have invested significantly in fuel efficient vehicles. We have 
improved vehicle aerodynamics, used low energy tyres, and trained 
our transport colleagues in more fuel efficient driving techniques.
This year we have set challenging targets for further reductions in 
our energy consumption.
Packaging 
As the largest UK national retailer of single price amazing value 
products, we recognise the need to conserve natural resources 
and to protect the environment. Therefore, we have adopted a 
policy that will reduce the environmental impacts associated with 
our product (primary) packaging and as a minimum comply with 
all relevant legislation. Where possible, the objective is to fit the 
packaging around the product to reduce consumer waste, recycling 
costs, comply with the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive 
and reduce supply chain transport costs by utilising container space 
more affectively.
Packaging Policy Statement
Primary packaging, at its most fundamental level, protects 
and contains the contents and communicates safety and legal 
requirements. 
Poundland will:  
• Meet all legislative requirements as a minimum. 
• Work toward a continuous reduction in the use of packaging 
materials, reducing size and weight through improved design 
and appropriate use of materials. 
• Always view packaging from our customers’ perspective i.e. 
can I re-cycle it, can I re-use it, does it have an alternative use? 
• Wherever possible, provide information to customers 
concerning which packaging has a recycled content and/or 
can be recycled. Ensure all environmental claims are simple, 
meaningful, relevant, accurate, used in the appropriate context 
and can be substantiated. 
• Require suppliers to provide information on the size, weight, 
design and materials content of packaging on all own brand 
products sold. 
• Monitor developments in packaging technologies for 
opportunities to reduce environmental impacts. 
• Encourage suppliers of proprietary brands to adopt best 
environmental practice in the design of packaging used for their 
products. 
• Comply with all rules, licences, copyrights, codes of practice 
and official guidance concerning environmental labelling and 
claims.  Introduction Strategy Governance Financials
Poundland Group plc Annual report and financial statements for p/e 30 March 2014 - 23
Electricity and Gas 
Progress so far:
 • In 2013/14 Poundland consumed 75.3 GWh of electricity and 
gas across its trading portfolio and associated warehousing, this 
equates to emissions of 39,478 tonnes of CO
2
. 
• In 2012/13 Poundland’s committed to an energy efficiency 
campaign aimed at reducing our emissions and their associated 
costs. The campaign focused on giving stores energy information 
that allows them to manage their energy use primarily by good 
housekeeping. 
• In the first 12 months of this campaign we reduced our like for 
like consumption by 6.2% in our smart metered stores. 
• We will endeavour to maintain good housekeeping standards and 
add to them with targeted investment in energy projects that give 
a suitable return on investment. For example we have invested in 
a low energy lighting scheme for our Willenhall warehouse. 
• We will maintain focus on lowering carbon emissions to minimize 
annual costs under the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme. 
Waste Initiatives 
We are fully focused and compliant on all areas of waste: 
• Budget Pack, the Packaging Consultants focused on compliance 
with UK Packaging Waste Regulations, are working in partnership 
with Poundland to provide battery collection facilities throughout 
all of our stores. This means that customers can deposit any type 
of portable battery into collection containers when visiting a store. 
These batteries are collected, sorted and recycled, ensuring that 
the constituent parts are used again. 
• Waste Electrical (WEEE) - We currently operate a take back 
system via helpdesk for the UK & NI. 
• Packaging Waste (PRN’s) - We provide the government with 
data on the weight of packaging waste materials (paper, glass, 
aluminium, steel, plastic, wood, mixed recycling).
Recycling & Waste 
• We recognise the potential impact on the community of waste 
generated from our activities; we therefore seek to reduce 
volumes of waste by recycling wherever possible. 
• All our stores and distribution depots recycle cardboard and soft 
plastics generated in their daily operation. 
• Our Customer Support Centre collects and recycles all of its waste 
paper and packaging. 
• In 2013/14 we recycled 10.6% more cardboard and soft plastics 
than in the previous year. 
• We continue to investigate other sources of waste and 
opportunities to recycle. 
• Waste generated at our Hoddesdon depot is taken for incineration, 
meaning none of its waste is passed to landfill.  24 - Poundland Group plc Annual report and financial statements for p/e 30 March 2014
CORPORATE AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT continued
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 
Sourcing 
During the last few years we have strengthened our supplier code of 
conduct and social accountability processes. In 2011, an independent 
audit of all processes and procedures was undertaken. We have 
implemented in full the recommendations arising out of the audit, 
increasing the number and quality of audits of our suppliers. We have 
joined Sedex, the largest organisation of its kind that shares ethical 
trade information with its members. During 2013 and 2014, further 
independent audits of factories have been commissioned to ensure 
compliance with Poundland’s supplier Code of Conduct. Continuous 
improvement of our ethical, moral and social processes remains one 
of our key priorities. 
We are proud that on a value basis over 80% of our products 
are sourced through UK companies. However, where necessary, 
Poundland has the ability to source and develop products on a global 
basis. Therefore, our Far East and Near East operations based in Hong 
Kong and New Delhi continue to be an important part of our sourcing 
strategy. Accordingly we have strengthened our teams in both these 
locations, especially in the areas of new product development, quality 
assurance and control. 
Our good UK vendor relationships have continued to improve during 
the period and virtually all primary manufacturers supply us direct. It is 
pleasing that major manufacturers of branded products recognise the 
significance of Poundland to consumers and the outstanding growth 
opportunity that we offer them to expand their brand reach. Top 
brands are very important to our customers and securing continuity 
of supply through these direct channels allows us to increase sales 
through improved availability and differentiate our offer from other 
single price competitors. During the year we have once again been 
able to add a number of important new branded suppliers to our 
existing large portfolio of primary manufacturers. We continue to 
recognise the relevance of secondary and tertiary suppliers who enjoy 
long term relationships with our growing Poundland brand. These 
suppliers remain important to the delivery of our overall offer. 
Code of Conduct – Social Accountability Policy
All suppliers commit to achieving the standards outlined. The policy, 
based on International Labour Organisation Core (ILO) conventions 
covers topics including: 
• Child/forced labour 
• Health & safety 
• Freedom of Association & collective bargaining 
• Non-discrimination 
• Hours worked 
• Wage compliance 
Charity 
Poundland supports Macmillan Cancer Care’s aim to reach everyone 
affected by cancer. Since the partnership began in 2009, Poundland 
colleagues and customers have raised over a million pounds, helping 
Macmillan to make sure people living with cancer have the best team 
in their corner, every step of the way. 
We have built and strengthened the partnership engagement with 
both colleagues and customers and created awareness in the media, 
providing an easy and desirable way for people to support Macmillan.
Poundland supports Macmillan with a number of fundraising activities 
in store, distribution depots and at our Customer Support Centre. 
Colleagues have participated in sponsored runs such as the London 
Marathon, Land’s End to John O’Groats cycle ride and held samples 
sales. 
In our Republic of Ireland Dealz stores, our charity of the year is 
“Make-a-Wish” who grant magical wishes to children and young 
people fighting life threatening illnesses.
EMPLOYEE RESPONSIBILITY 
Our Colleagues
We recognise and celebrate success through various initiatives in the 
business. For example we offer seasonal incentives where our store 
colleagues can receive vouchers to spend at their leisure. Eligible 
colleagues are also rewarded for meeting objectives which impact 
business performance and show evidence of living the Company 
values via an annual bonus scheme. In addition we offer at 5 year 
intervals long service awards to our colleagues. 
All colleagues have access to a wide range of benefits via our benefits 
platform offering discounts for colleagues and their families to enjoy. 
From childcare vouchers and improved healthcare, through to special 
discounts in leisure and lifestyle, we offer something for everyone.
Our colleagues’ welfare and wellbeing is important to us and we 
work in partnership with the Retail Trust who offer our colleagues 
an employee assistance program which is a free, confidential and 
independent service to support colleagues at times of need. This 
service is offered 7 days a week and 365 days a year. 
We are interested in what our colleagues have to say and use various 
means of communicating with them on a regular basis. Our colleagues 
are represented at the biannual JCC meetings held between the 
Company and our union (USDAW). In addition the Company has a 
whistleblowing policy which allows colleagues to raise any concerns 
in confidence. We also use colleague surveys as a way of gaining 
feedback on matters that are important to our colleagues and 
encourage their engagement in company projects.
Local community support 
Our new store opening programme and expansion plans means that 
we are creating jobs and opportunities for over 1,000 new colleagues 
annually. We work closely with local job centres and the DWP in 
helping the unemployed gain long term employment and skills and 
qualifications to improve their employability. We take our corporate 
responsibility seriously and the role we play is having a positive 
impact on local communities. Introduction Strategy Governance Financials
Poundland Group plc Annual report and financial statements for p/e 30 March 2014 - 25
Training
All new colleagues receive an induction programme tailored to the 
role they will perform. We review our training regularly to update and 
improve practice. A recent update has seen training taken out of the 
classroom and onto the shop floor. Brand new materials have been 
introduced called ‘Conversation Cards’. These cards are relaxed, 
informal and help Managers to train their colleagues on all aspects of 
their job. Colleagues love this new approach as it is easy, simple and 
practical to understand. 
Managers now receive a ‘Management Organiser’ on day one when 
they join us, which tells them everything they need to know about our 
business and their induction. The new induction is a structured three 
month programme that they take responsibility for, supported by a 
Training Manager. 
We want all our people to have the right knowledge and skills so they 
can be brilliant at their jobs. We have launched a number of training 
programmes for our Managers, these modules run every three months 
and support our Managers to understand how we manage and lead 
‘The Poundland Way’. 
Sharing our knowledge
Poundland once again supported IGD’s ‘Feeding Britain’s Future’ event 
in which workshops were offered around the UK to young people who 
want to pursue a career in retail. They visited Poundland stores and 
were given a flavour of what life in retail is all about, with additional 
support provided on how to write their CVs and deliver a great 
interview. We’ve also supported the charity “Think Forward” who work 
with at risk youths at school. Poundland has run a number of talent 
days to help young people understand what a career in retail is like.  26 - Poundland Group plc Annual report and financial statements for p/e 30 March 2014

Poundland Group plc Annual report and financial statements for p/e 30 March 2014 - 29
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
The Directors present their Annual Report and Financial Statements for 
the year ended 30 March 2014 which were approved by the Board of 
Directors on 2 July 2014.
Strategic Report
The Directors have presented their Strategic Report, which was 
approved by the Board of Directors on 2 July 2014, on page 7 to 28, 
and which contains (a) a fair review of the Group’s business and (b) a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group. 
The review is intended to be a balanced and comprehensive analysis 
of the development and performance of the Group’s business during 
the financial year and the position of the Group’s business at the 
end of that year. The report includes, to the extent necessary for an 
understanding of the development, performance or position of the 
Group’s business, analysis using financial key performance indicators. 
As the Company is now a quoted company, the Strategic Report also, 
to the extent necessary for an understanding of the development, 
performance or position of the Group’s business, includes the main 
trends and factors likely to affect the future development performance 
and position of the Group’s business. It also includes information 
about environmental matters, the Group’s employees and social and 
community issues and the policies that the Group has in place to deal 
with these issues and their effectiveness. 
The Report of the Directors should be read in conjunction with the 
Strategic Report, and contains details of the principal activities of the 
Group during the year.
Going Concern
The Board is of the opinion that there is a reasonable expectation 
that the Company and the Group has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. In arriving at this 
conclusion the Board has taken account of current and anticipated 
trading performance, current and anticipated levels of borrowings 
and the availability of borrowing facilities and exposures to and 
management of the financial risks detailed on pages 20 and 21. 
Consequently, the going concern basis has been used in the 
preparation of the Company and Group financial statements.
 
Results and Dividend
The Group’s consolidated profit for the year attributable to 
Shareholders of the Company is £13.9 million.
The Directors intend, subject to sufficient distributable reserves 
being available, as noted in the Prospectus issued to prospective 
Shareholders prior to Admission to Listing, that the first dividend to 
be declared by the Group following Admission to Listing will be the 
interim dividend in respect of the first half of the 2015 financial year, 
which is expected to be paid in January 2015.
Political Donations
The Group has not made in the past, nor does it intend to make in the 
future, any political donations.
Employees
At the date of this report the Group employed 13,973 colleagues; 
5,981 male and 7,992 female colleagues.
The Directors believe that the Group’s relations with its employees 
have been and continue to be good. The Directors also believe that 
relations with its trade unions are also good. Poundland Limited is 
party to a recognition agreement with the Union of Shop, Distributive 
and Allied Workers, which applies on a company-wide basis across 
all offices, distribution centres and retail stores. There has been no 
industrial action that has affected the Group in recent years. 
The Group communicates with its colleagues, both UK based and 
elsewhere, on matters of concern to them and on more general 
matters by way of notice boards, the circulation of emails, monthly 
updates in person and a series of annual conferences covering all 
geographical areas in which the Group operates. The Executive 
Directors and Executive Team also visit retail and distribution sites on 
a regular basis throughout the year and colleagues are encouraged to 
raise matters of concern with them during these visits. 
The Group has a policy of giving full and fair consideration to 
applications for employment made by disabled persons, having 
regard to their particular aptitudes and abilities, for continuing the 
employment of, and for arranging appropriate training for, employees 
who have become disabled persons during the period when they were 
employed by the Group and for their training, career development and 
promotion.
Directors
The Directors of the Company as at 30 March 2014 and their interests 
in the shares of the Company are shown on page 49.

insurance in place in respect of each of the Executive Directors. The 
Company has entered into a qualifying third-party indemnity (the 
terms of which are in accordance with the Companies Act 2006) with 
each of the Executive Directors.
There have been no changes in the make-up of the Board between the 
end of the Financial Year and the date of this report.
As detailed in the Articles, at every annual general meeting other than 
the first Annual General Meeting due this year,  all Directors at the

from time to time by laws and regulations (for example insider trading 
laws). In addition, pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial 
Conduct Authority, Directors and certain officers and employees of 
the Group require the approval of the Company to deal in the ordinary

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Board and its Role
The Board is committed to the highest standards of corporate 
governance. Other than as set out below the Company has complied, 
and intends to continue to comply, with the requirements of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code.
The Board has a schedule of matters which are reserved for its own 
consideration, which includes:
• The overall management of the Company and the Group and the 
approval of long-term objectives and commercial strategy;
• Changes relating to the capital structure of the Company;
• Approval of financial reporting, dividend policy and significant 
changes in accounting policies and practices;
• Ensuring the maintenance of a sound system of internal control 
and risk management;
• Major capital projects and corporate actions, acquisitions, 
disposals or material joint ventures;
• Ensuring a satisfactory dialogue with Shareholders based on a 
mutual understanding of objectives;
• Board membership and senior appointments within the Group;
• Remuneration of Board members and Executive Team; and
• Approval of the Group’s principal professional advisors.
The Board has delegated a number of these responsibilities to 
standing committees of the Board, as detailed below, and also to 
the executive management of the Group having first approved the 
terms of reference of those committees and the authority limits of 
management and receives regular reports in respect of all delegated 
authorities.
The Board comprises ten members, including three Executive 
Directors and seven Non-Executive Directors (including the Chairman). 
For the purposes of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board 
regards Andrew Higginson, the Chairman, as independent on his 
appointment and regards Darren Shapland, Trevor Bond, Tea Colaianni 
and Grant Hearn as independent Non-Executive Directors. Darren 
Shapland is the Company’s Senior Independent Director. Paul Best 
and Stephen Coates, as Non-Executive Directors nominated by the 
Warburg Pincus Funds, are not regarded as independent for the 
purposes of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
In addition to his Chairmanship of Poundland Group plc, Andrew 
Higginson is also Chairman of N Brown plc and a Non-Executive 
Director of BSkyB, Woolworths (South Africa), McCurrach UK and the 
Rugby Football Union. 
Independence is determined by ensuring that, apart from receiving 
their fees for acting as Directors, Non-Executive Directors do not have 
any other material pecuniary relationship or transactions with the 
Company, its promoters, its management or its subsidiaries, which 
in the judgement of the Board may affect their independence of 
judgement.
The UK Corporate Governance Code recommends that at least 
half the Board of Directors of a UK-listed company, excluding the 
Chairman, should comprise Non-Executive Directors determined by 
the board to be independent in character and judgement and free from 
relationships or circumstances which may affect, or could appear to 
affect, the directors’ judgement. 
The Company does not comply with this recommendation of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. As mentioned above, Messrs. Best and 
Coates are not independent as they have been nominated to act 
as Non-Executive Directors by Poundland’s principal shareholder, 
Warburg Pincus Funds who have entered into a Relationship 
Agreement with the Company under the terms of which, for as long as 
they and their associates control in excess of 30% of the votes able 
to be cast, they are entitled to appoint two Non-Executive Directors. 
When they control between 15% and 30% of votes they will be 
entitled to appoint one Non-Executive Director. They currently control 
30.4% of votes.
The Directors believe that the terms of the Relationship Agreement 
will enable Poundland to carry on its business independently of 
Warburg Pincus Funds.
Conflicts of Interest 
Paul Best and Stephen Coates are principals at Warburg Pincus. 
Warburg Pincus wholly owns the Warburg Pincus Funds which control 
30.4% of the voting rights in the Company. 
Save as set out in the paragraph above, there are no potential 
conflicts of interest between any duties owed by the Directors or 
Senior Management to the Company and their private interests or 
other duties.
Committees of the Board
As envisaged by the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board 
has established an Audit and Risk Committee, a Governance and 
Nomination Committee and a Remuneration Committee. If the need 
should arise, the Board may set up additional committees.
Audit and Risk Committee 
The Audit and Risk Committee’s role is to assist the Board with the 
discharge of its responsibilities in relation to financial reporting, 
including reviewing the Group’s annual and half year financial 
statements and accounting policies, internal and external audits and 
controls, reviewing and monitoring the scope of the annual audit and 
the extent of the non-audit work undertaken by external auditors, 
advising on the appointment of external auditors and reviewing the 
effectiveness of the internal audit, internal controls, whistleblowing 
and fraud systems in place within the Group. The Audit and Risk 
Committee will normally meet not less than three times a year.
The Audit and Risk Committee is chaired by Trevor Bond and its other 
members are Darren Shapland, Tea Colaianni, and Grant Hearn. The 
UK Corporate Governance Code recommends that all members of the 
Audit and Risk Committee be Non-Executive Directors, independent 
in character and judgement and free from any relationship or 
circumstance which may, could or would be likely to, or appear to, 
affect their judgement and that one 
such member has recent and 
relevant financial experience. 
The Board considers that 
the Company complies with 
the requirements of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code in 
this respect. Introduction Strategy Governance Financials
Poundland Group plc Annual report and financial statements for p/e 30 March 2014 - 33
Governance and Nominations Committee
The Governance and Nominations Committee assists the Board in 
reviewing the structure, size and composition of the Board, reviewing 
succession plans for the Directors, including the Chairman and Chief 
Executive Officer and other senior executives and ensuring legal 
and regulatory compliance in respect of corporate governance. The 
Governance and Nomination Committee will normally meet not less 
than twice a year.
The Governance and Nominations Committee is chaired by Grant 
Hearn and its other members are Darren Shapland, Trevor Bond, 
Tea Colaianni and Paul Best. The UK Corporate Governance Code 
recommends that a majority of the Governance and Nomination 
Committee be Non-Executive Directors, independent in character and 
judgement and free from any relationship or circumstance which may, 
could or would be likely to, or appear to, affect their judgement. The 
Board considers that the Company complies with the requirements of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code in this respect.
When the Board wishes to appoint a Director, the Committee will take 
the lead in the process and, after taking due account of the balance 
of skills, knowledge, experience, independence and diversity on the 
Board, will prepare a description of the role, required capabilities 
and expected time commitment and, using external agencies if 
appropriate, will identify suitable candidates for consideration by the 
Board as a whole.
The Committee will also make recommendations to the Board 
regarding the make-up of Board Committees, whether to reappoint 
Directors at the end of their term of office and make recommendations 
about the re-election of Directors put forward for retirement by 
rotation. The Committee will also consider the diversity of the Board.
In addition, the Committee will be responsible for ensuring that the 
Company complies with, and where possible exceeds, all laws and 
regulations to do with the good and ethical governance of corporate 
entities and that all such matters are kept under constant review and 
relevant mitigating actions are taken if required.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee recommends the Group’s policy on 
executive remuneration, determines the levels of remuneration for 
Executive Directors and the Chairman and other senior executives 
and prepares an Annual Remuneration Report for approval by the 
Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. The Remuneration 
Committee will normally meet not less than three times a year.
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Tea Colaianni and its 
other members are Andrew Higginson, Darren Shapland, Trevor Bond 
and Grant Hearn. The UK Corporate Governance Code recommends 
that all members of the Remuneration Committee be Non-Executive 
Directors, independent in character and judgement and free from any 
relationship or circumstance which may, could or would be likely to, or 
appear to, affect their judgement. The Board considers that the Group 
complies with the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
in this respect.
Since the time of its inauguration, the Committee has employed 
external advisors, New Bridge Street, a consulting agency which 
specialises in executive remuneration, to advise and assist in 
formulating and introducing a sustainable remuneration policy.
Director’s Attendance Chart
The schedule below details meetings from the date of incorporation 
up to 30 March 2014:
Audit and Risk Committee and Governance and Nominations 
Committee meetings have been held since the year end.
Board Performance Evaluation
Due to the relatively short time that it has been in existence, the 
Board has not yet completed a performance evaluation. However, a 
performance evaluation to assess the effectiveness of the Chairman, 
individual directors, the standing committees of the Board and the 
Board as a whole will be undertaken on an annual basis and will, 
every third year, as required by the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
engage with an external agency to assist in the process.
Shareholder Communication
The Board believes that it is important to explain business 
developments and financial results to all of the Company’s 
stakeholders, including Shareholders and also to understand any 
concerns that Shareholders may have. The principal communication 
media used to impart information, including financial results, are news 
releases, investor presentations and visits and Company publications.
The Company will also communicate with its Shareholders through 
the Annual General Meeting at which the Board will give an account 
of the progress during the preceding year, review current issues and 
provide Shareholders the opportunity to ask questions of the Chairman 
and the Chairs of the Board’s standing committees who will all be in 
attendance.
In addition, the Company will consult with its larger Shareholders on 
any issue on which it considers it appropriate to do so or where it 
needs to canvass views before taking any particular course of action.

Internal Controls and Risk Management
Overall responsibility for the system of internal control, reviewing its 
effectiveness and ensuring that there is a process to identify, evaluate 
and manage any significant risks that may affect the achievement of 
the Company’s strategic objectives lies with the Board.
The Board and the Audit Committee have reviewed the effectiveness 
of the Group’s internal control and risk management systems in 
accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code for the period 
ended 30 March 2014 and up to the date of approving the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements. The internal control and risk 
management system is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, 
the risk of failing to achieve business objectives and can provide 
only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The Group’s Executive Team principally reviews the effectiveness 
of controls operating within the business. The Audit Committee is 
reviewing and assessing whether or not an independent, standalone 
Internal Audit function would be more appropriate to the needs of the 
business.
The assessment and control of risk are considered by the Board to be 
fundamental to achieving corporate objectives. An ongoing process of 
identifying and evaluating the significant risks faced by the Group and 
the effectiveness of related controls has been established. The key 
elements are:
• a comprehensive system of reporting from executives identifying 
performance against budget, analysis of variances, major 
business issues, key performance indicators and regular 
forecasting;
• well defined policies governing appraisal and approval of capital 
expenditure and treasury operations; and
• reviews of key business risks and of management’s controls and 
plans to mitigate these risks.
During the financial period to 30 March 2014 and up to the date 
of this report, the Audit Committee and management considered 
the Company’s Risk Register and its alignment with the Company’s 
strategic objectives, reporting the findings to the Board. The Board 
considered the key risks and relevant mitigating actions and 
determind that they were acceptable for a retail business of the size 
and complexity as that operated by the Company. More information on 
the key risks and uncertainties faced by the Company are shown on 
pages 20 to 21.
Whistleblowing Policy
Unfortunately from time to time all companies face the risk of 
things going wrong or of malpractice taking place. Poundland is no 
exception.
The Company has a duty to conduct its affairs in an open and 
responsible way. We are committed to high standards of corporate 
governance and compliance with legislation and appropriate codes 
of practice. By knowing about any wrong doing or malpractice at an  
early stage, we stand a good chance of taking the necessary steps 
to stop it. We have a policy in place which is designed to encourage 
colleagues to identify such situations and report them without fear of 
repercussions or recriminations provided that they are acting in good 
faith.
The policy sets out how any concerns may be raised and response 
can be expected from the Company and in what timescales.
External Auditors’ Independence Statement
Professional ethical standards require KPMG LLP (“KPMG”) to 
communicate to the Company as part of planning all significant facts 
and matters, including those related to the provision of non-audit 
services and the safeguards put in place that, in their professional 
judgement, may reasonably be thought to bear on KPMG’s 
independence and the objectivity of the audit partner and audit team.
KPMG have confirmed that they are satisfied that their general 
procedures support their independence and objectivity.
UK Corporate Governance Code 
– Compliance Statement
The UK Corporate Governance Code published by the Financial 
Reporting Council in September 2012 (“the Code”) applies to the 
Company and is available on the FRC website at www.frc.org.
uk/Our-Work/Publications/Corporate-Governance/UK-Corporate-
Governance-Code-September-2012.pdf. In addition, the Financial 
Conduct Authority has yet to change the Listing Rules and therefore 
requires that certain compliance statements are made in relation to 
the predecessor edition of the Code, issued in June 2010. This report 
addresses the requirements of both editions of the Code. For the 
period from 17 March 2014 to 30 March 2014, the Company complied 
with the provisions of both editions of the Code, as applicable, except 
where stated.

Poundland Group plc Annual report and financial statements for p/e 30 March 2014 - 35
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to present to you, on behalf of the Board, the first report 
of the Audit and Risk Committee.
The Committee was inaugurated by resolution of the Board of 
Directors on 27 February 2014 in readiness for the Company’s 
Admission to Listing in March 2014.
As you are no doubt aware, the UK Corporate Governance Code (“the 
Code”) recommends that all members of the Committee be Non-
Executive Directors, independent in character and judgement and 
free from any relationship or circumstance which may, could or would 
be likely to, or appear to, affect their judgement and that one such 
member has recent and relevant financial experience. Consequently, 
with this in mind, the Committee is comprised of the Independent 
Non-Executive Directors of the plc Board. The make-up of the 
Committee is given in the Report below.
The Committee was set up by the Board to assist it with its 
responsibilities in respect of financial reporting, including reviewing 
annual and half-year results, external auditing, internal controls, 
and advising on the independence and appointment of the external 
auditors. 
The Committee will be routinely looking at the significant accounting 
treatments facing the Group and at the year-end will focus on the 
matters raised by KPMG which they consider to be of significant audit 
risk.
Based on their performance during 2013/14, the Committee will be 
recommending KPMG be reappointed at the AGM. 
2013/14 has been an unusual and very busy year for colleagues 
across the business who have succeeded in coping with all the extra 
work associated with becoming a public listed company whilst still 
maintaining adequate controls and “business as usual” as far as 
the world at large, in particular our customers, were concerned. We 
look forward to continuing to learn from our experiences in the listed 
company environment as well as continuing to provide amazing value 
to our customers every day.
Trevor Bond
Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee

Listing onto the London Stock Exchange
The Audit and Risk Committee (“the Committee”) is a standing 
committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, established by 
a resolution of the Board at its meeting held on 27 February 2014. 
The Committee became effective from Listing on the London Stock 
Exchange on 17 March 2014. 
Role of the Committee
The Committee has received delegated authority from the Board 
to assist it in its responsibilities in respect of financial controls 
and reporting as set out in its written Terms of Reference, which 
are available to Shareholders on the Company’s website under 
“Corporate/ Investors/ Corporate Governance”. The primary purposes 
of the Committee are:
• Reviewing the Group’s annual and half-year financial statements 
and accounting policies;
• Ensuring that the Annual Report is fair, balanced and 
understandable;
• Reviewing external audits and internal controls and ensuring their 
effectiveness;
• Reviewing the external auditor’s management letter on internal 
financial controls; 
• Reviewing and monitoring the scope of the annual audit and the 
extent of the non-audit work undertaken by the external auditors; 
and
• Advising on the independence and appointment of external 
auditors.
In addition, going forward, the Committee will review whether there 
is a need to establish an internal audit function and will also review 
the whistleblowing and fraud policies to measure their effectiveness. 
In addition, whilst the Board has retained overall responsibility for the 
Risk Register, it has delegated to the Committee the review of the 
risks contained therein.
AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT 36 - Poundland Group plc Annual report and financial statements for p/e 30 March 2014
Composition of the Audit and Risk Committee
The Committee is comprised exclusively of Independent Non-Executive 
Directors of the plc Board. The Committee is chaired by Trevor Bond 
and its other members are Darren Shapland, Tea Colaianni, and Grant 
Hearn. The Secretary of the Committee is the Company Secretary, 
Jinder Jhuti. 
The Board is satisfied that Trevor Bond has recent and relevant 
financial experience appropriate to his position as Chairman of the 
Audit and Risk Committee. In addition Darren Shapland is also a 
qualified accountant.
Although not a member of the Committee, there is a standing 
invitation to the Company Chairman, Andrew Higginson, to attend 
meetings. The Committee also invites to attend, on a regular basis, 
Nick Hateley in his capacity as Chief Financial Officer, along with the 
external auditor.  Also, the Committee intends to meet regularly with 
the external auditor with no members of management present.
Number of Audit and Risk Committee meetings and 
attendance
The Committee will meet a minimum of three times per year and all 
members expect to be available for all meetings. 
No meetings of the Committee were held in the year under review 
but two meetings have been held between the start of the current 
financial year and the publication of this Annual Report and Financial 
Statements.
Work undertaken by the Committee in relation to 2014 
Financial Statements
Although the Committee did not come into operation until 17 March 
2014, a number of significant matters have been discussed and 
considered:
• Approved 2014 audit plan, audit fee proposal and set performance 
expectations for the auditors;
• Reviewed the integrity of the draft financial statements for the 
year ended 30 March 2014, appropriateness of accounting 
policies and going concern assumption;
• Considered the auditors’ report regarding their findings on the 
2014 annual results;
• Reviewed and recommended approval of the 2014 Annual Report 
and Financial Statements;
• Confirmed compliance or explained deviation from the UK 
Corporate Governance Code;
• Reviewed audit and non-audit expenditure with the external 
auditors during the year; and
• Having reviewed the performance, effectiveness and qualifications 
of the auditors, recommended their re-appointment at the AGM. 
Significant issues considered by the Audit and Risk 
Committee
Following discussion with both management and the external auditors, 
the Committee determined that the area of significant risk that could 
give rise to misstatement of the Group’s financial statements included, 
but were not limited to:
• valuation of inventory
This item was considered by the Committee at the time they reviewed 
and agreed the external auditor’s Group audit plan, to ensure that 
due consideration was given at that point, as well as at the time of 
reviewing the external auditor’s final audit findings.
With regard to the valuation of inventory, the Committee reviewed the 
inventory balances and the related provisions against carrying values. 
Having considered the appropriateness of such provisions and taking 
into account the results of the external audit, the Committee concurred 
with management’s judgement on this issue.
Another area of audit focus which was considered at the time of the 
Committee review and agreed with its external auditors for inclusion 
in the Group’s audit plan was: Intangible Assets - goodwill and brand 
value. The Committee reviewed the assumptions used to justify that 
there was no impairment to goodwill and brand value and were 
comfortable with them. Significant headroom was identified so it was 
concluded that this was not a significant risk that could give rise to 
misstatement of the Group’s financial statements.
Management have reported to the Committee that they were not 
aware of any material misstatements made intentionally to achieve a 
particular presentation. The auditors reported to the Committee any 
misstatements that they had found in the course of their work and no 
material adjustments were required.
After reviewing the presentations and reports from management and 
consulting where necessary with the auditors, the Committee was 
satisfied that the financial statements appropriately addressed the 
critical judgements and key estimates both in respect of the amounts 
reported and the disclosures. The Committee was also satisfied that 
the significant assumptions used for determining the value of assets 
and liabilities had been appropriately scrutinised and challenged and 
were sufficiently robust.
The Committee confirmed that it was satisfied that the auditors had 
fulfilled their responsibilities with due diligence and professionalism.
Internal audit
The Company does not have a stand-alone Internal Audit Department. 
Its internal controls are currently maintained by the Group’s 
management. Whilst the Committee is happy that the current system 
is adequate it will, as part of its remit, evaluate the effectiveness and 
robustness of the current system of control as the Group grows before 
deciding whether or not it should remain in place or to recommend 
changes to the way it operates or to recommend to management that 
a new and independent Internal Audit Department would be more 
appropriate and to set down the guidelines for the operation of such a 
department.
Internal controls
The Company operates various levels of control against which 
the risks of the business are managed. As with any business, the 
Company faces risk in all its activities. Management is responsible for, 
inter alia, establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over 
financial reporting, including over the Group’s consolidation processes. 
The Board is responsible for the Group’s systems of internal 
control and risk management and for reviewing their effectiveness. 
The Committee has considered the process by which the Group 
approaches risk management and is satisfied that the Group has 
systems and procedures in place to identify, evaluate and manage 
all material risks to the business, in accordance with the Turnbull 
Guidance.
AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT continued Introduction Strategy Governance Financials
Poundland Group plc Annual report and financial statements for p/e 30 March 2014 - 37
These systems and procedures are designed to manage rather than 
eliminate risk of failure to achieve business objectives. They can only 
provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. Specifically the Committee has reviewed the 
financial risk category and the internal controls in place. Similarly the 
Committee is satisfied that this process has been in place for the year 
under review and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and 
Financial Statements and that the process will be regularly reviewed 
by the Board.
Assessing external audit effectiveness
The Committee oversees the Group’s relationship with the external 
auditor. The Committee holds meetings with the auditor without 
management present with the purpose of understanding the auditor’s 
views on the control and governance environment and management’s 
effectiveness within it.
To fulfil its responsibilities in respect of the independence and 
effectiveness of the external auditor, the Committee reviewed:
• The terms, areas of responsibility, duties and scope of work of the 
external auditor as set out in the engagement letter;
• The audit work plan for the Group;
• The detailed findings of the audit, including a discussion of any 
major issues that arose during the audit;
• The letter from KPMG confirming its independence and objectivity; 
• The audit fee and the extent of non-audit services provided during 
the year; and
• The Committee specifically challenged and sought comfort from 
KPMG in respect of its work in the areas that drive audit quality.
Appointing the auditor and safeguards on non-audit 
services
The external auditors are appointed by Shareholders to provide an 
opinion on the financial statements and certain other disclosures 
prepared by the Directors. KPMG LLP “KPMG” acted as the external 
auditors to Poundland throughout the year.
Under normal circumstances non-audit services are subject to market 
tender or tests and are awarded to the most appropriate provider 
but, because of their extensive working knowledge of the Poundland 
Group, the Board at the time that the IPO was under consideration 
were of the opinion that KPMG were uniquely placed to undertake 
the considerable amount of work that was required to complete that 
process within the timescales required.
The Committee is responsible for the oversight of the external 
auditors, including approving the annual work plan and, on behalf 
of the Board, approving the audit fee. The auditors are eligible 
for selection to provide non-audit services only to the extent that 
their skills and experience make them a competitive and the most 
appropriate supplier of these services. Non-audit services are normally 
limited to assignments that are closely related to the annual audit or 
where the work is of such a nature that a detailed understanding of 
the Group is necessary. 
The principle followed with regard to non-audit services is that the 
auditors may not provide a service which:
• Places them in a position to audit their own work.
• Creates a mutuality of interest.
• Results in the auditors developing close personal relationships 
with Poundland employees.
• Results in the auditors functioning as a manager or employee of 
Poundland.
• Puts the auditors in the role of advocate for Poundland.
Management will regularly provide the Committee with reports 
on audit, audit-related and non-audit expenditure, together with 
proposals of any material non-audit related assignments. The 
Committee will regularly review and, where necessary, challenge 
management to ensure that auditor objectivity and independence is 
not impaired. The Committee will be formulating a formal policy, with 
built in levels of authority, to control the awarding of non-audit work to 
the Company’s external auditor.
During the year under review the non-audit fees were 12 times 
the audit fee. This figure is distorted by the large amount of work 
undertaken by KPMG in respect of the IPO. Full details are given in 
Note 7 to the Financial Statements on page 74.
On balance, the Committee is satisfied that the overall levels of audit-
related and non-audit fees, and the nature of services provided, are 
not such as to compromise the objectivity and independence of the 
external auditors.
KPMG has been appointed as auditors of Poundland Group plc for 1 
year, being the period ended 30 March 2014. The Group will be giving 
consideration to the timing of the next formal tender in light of the 
Code, the recent Competition Commission and EU recommendations 
on audit tendering and rotation. 
The Group has no contractual arrangements (for example, within 
borrowing arrangements) that restrict its choice of auditor.
Trevor Bond
Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee
2 July 2014 38 - Poundland Group plc Annual report and financial statements for p/e 30 March 2014
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to present, on behalf of the Board, the first remuneration 
report of the Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’) following the 
initial public offering (IPO) on 17 March 2014.
The work of the Remuneration Committee
The year ended 30 March 2014 was a major milestone in Poundland’s 
history. The Committee was formally constituted at IPO, but the 
majority of its work took place prior to that event with a full review of 
the Company’s remuneration policy undertaken. 
A key objective of this review was to ensure an appropriate 
remuneration policy was in place for a listed company, whilst also 
ensuring that it continued to drive the core behaviours and values that 
have been fundamental to the Company’s success to date.  The policy 
is designed to closely align variable pay with future company success, 
with rigorous and stretching targets in place for performance-related 
elements to be paid out.  
Additionally since its formation, the Committee has adopted a range 
of new employee share plans, reviewed the bonus awards for the last 
financial year and considered broader all-employee pay review for the 
current year. 
Objectives of the Remuneration policy
In setting the remuneration policy the Committee focused on simple 
and transparent market competitive remuneration and incentive 
schemes. The proposed policy is designed to:
• attract, retain and motivate high calibre senior management and 
to focus them on the delivery of the Company’s strategic and 
business objectives;
• promote a strong and sustainable performance culture;
• incentivise high growth; 
• align the interests of Executive Directors and members of 
the Executive Committee with those of shareholders through 
encouraging equity ownership; 
• be simple and constructed taking into account best practice 
guidelines for  UK listed companies; and
• encourage widespread equity ownership by colleagues  through 
the operation of several tailored share plans, including an all-
employee SAYE plan.
The key components of remuneration are set out in detail within the 
Remuneration Policy Report, which will be subject to a binding vote at 
our AGM. 
Performance and reward for 2013/14
Financial performance in 2013/14 was very strong, representing a 
record year in Poundland’s profits.  However, despite the financial 
success, the Executive Directors together with the remainder of the 
Executive Team indicated that for this year they did not wish to be 
considered for a bonus, and agreed to spread the bonus pool more 
widely in celebration of the landmark IPO event. 
On listing, the Executive Directors received their first awards under the 
Company’s new Performance Share Plan (PSP), which was adopted at 
IPO.  These awards will vest after three years provided that stretching 
performance targets are met.  No further awards will be made until 
the financial year beginning 30 March 2015.
Shareholder feedback
The Committee recognises that building a close relationship with 
Shareholders can complement the work of the Committee in 
developing the remuneration policy. Prior to the publication of our first 
Directors’ Remuneration Report we consulted with a number of our 
major Shareholders and leading investor representative bodies. One 
of our overarching aims has been to develop a remuneration policy 
which closely aligns the interests of our senior executives and our 
Shareholders, and with this in mind we have adopted share ownership 
guidelines and included clawback provisions in both our annual bonus 
and long-term incentive plans.
As this is the first time we are reporting to you, and the first time we 
will be asking you to approve the remuneration policy, we appreciate 
any feedback you may have.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
Annual statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Introduction Strategy Governance Financials
Poundland Group plc Annual report and financial statements for p/e 30 March 2014 - 39
What is in this report?
The Directors’ Remuneration Report sets out the remuneration policy 
for the Company, describes the implementation of that policy and 
discloses the amounts paid relating to the year ended 30 March 2014.  
It has been prepared in accordance with the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, 
as amended. The policy has been developed taking into account the 
principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2013, the Listing 
Rules and shareholders’ executive remuneration guidelines.
The Remuneration Policy Report for the Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors will be put to a binding shareholder vote at the Annual 
General Meeting on 19 September 2014. The policy will take formal 
effect from that date.
The Annual Statement from the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee and the Annual Report on Remuneration will be subject to 
an advisory vote at the AGM.
As explained in the basis of consolidation accounting policy, the 
Group’s financial statements reflect the continuation of the pre-
existing Group headed by Poundland Group Holdings Limited. In 
keeping with that accounting, the Company has chosen to also include 
the remuneration of these directors when they were directors of 
Poundland Group Holdings Limited or any of its subsidiaries. 
Remuneration Policy Report
Policy overview
The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for determining 
remuneration for the Chairman, Executive Directors and other Senior 
Executives. The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the 
Company’s website.
On Admission in March 2014, a new remuneration policy was adopted 
by the Remuneration Committee.  The Committee designed this policy 
with close regard to market practice in other UK listed companies 
and the Retail Sector, so as to ensure that the arrangements are 
appropriately competitive and structured in line with best practice.  
However, the policy also retains some of the key elements which 
helped to drive the Company’s success prior to IPO, such as effective 
cost control and simplicity in pay structures.  
The aim of the remuneration policy is to attract, retain and motivate 
high calibre senior management and to focus them on the delivery 
of the Company’s strategic and business objectives, to promote a 
strong and sustainable performance culture, incentivise high growth 
and to align the interests of Executive Directors and Executive Team 
with those of Shareholders through encouraging equity ownership 
with shareholding guidelines. In promoting these objectives the policy 
aims to be simple in design, transparent and understandable both to 
participants and Shareholders, ensure that no more than is necessary 
is paid and has been structured so as to adhere to the principles of 
good corporate governance and appropriate risk management.  
A further aim of the remuneration policy is to encourage widespread 
share ownership by colleagues throughout the Company, and in 
support of this objective we have adopted several new share plans 
which are designed with close regard to the various recipient groups 
to ensure optimal benefit delivery.
How the views of Shareholders and employees are 
taken into account
The Committee does not formally consult directly with employees on 
executive pay but does receive periodic updates from the Group HR 
Director in relation to salary and bonus reviews across the Company.  
As set out in the policy table overleaf, in setting remuneration for the 
Executive Directors, the Committee takes note of the overall approach 
to reward for employees in the Company and salary increases will 
ordinarily be (in percentage of salary terms) in line with those of the 
wider workforce.  Thus, the Committee is satisfied that the decisions 
made in relation to Executive Directors’ pay are made with an 
appropriate understanding of the wider workforce. 
The Committee is conscious that this is the first time that 
Shareholders will vote on the remuneration policy since the 
Company’s IPO and with this in mind we offered our largest 
Shareholders the opportunity to discuss our remuneration policy in 
advance of publication.  In addition, we will consider any Shareholder 
feedback received in relation to the AGM.  
This, plus any additional feedback received from time to time, will be 
considered as part of the Committee’s annual review of remuneration 
policy.  
The Committee will seek to engage with Shareholders and their 
representative bodies when it is proposed that any material changes 
are to be made to the remuneration policy.  As Poundland has not held 
an AGM since listing, no voting outcomes are available and we will 
publish details of remuneration related voting outcomes in next year’s 
Directors’ Remuneration Report.
The remuneration policy for Executive Directors
The total remuneration package is structured so that variable 
elements (annual bonus and long-term incentives) make up a 
significant proportion of the package, with the emphasis on variable 
pay focused on long-term incentives.  The table summarises the key 
aspects of the Company’s remuneration policy for Executive Directors. 40 - Poundland Group plc Annual report and financial statements for p/e 30 March 2014

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT continued Introduction Strategy Governance Financials
Poundland Group plc Annual report and financial statements for p/e 30 March 2014 - 41
Operation and performance conditions Maximum
Salaries are normally reviewed annually with changes effective from 1st April taking 
into account:
• Personal performance
• Company performance
• Individual’s experience 
• Increases elsewhere in the Company
Hence, whilst there are no performance conditions conditional on salaries being paid, 
personal and company performance is one factor considered by the Committee when 
determining annual increases.
Salaries are set with reference to similar roles in FTSE 250 companies of a similar size 
and complexity.
The Committee considers the impact of any salary increase on the total remuneration 
package.
There is no prescribed maximum annual increase. The 
Committee is guided by the average annual increase of 
the workforce.  Higher increases may be awarded at the 
discretion of the Remuneration Committee, for example 
(but not limited to): in response to acute retention issues, 
following the appointment of a new executive to bring that 
executive’s package in line with market over a number of 
years or in response to market factors.
The Company currently provides:
• Car allowance 
• Family medical insurance
• Life assurance
• Dependent pension insurance
• Income protection insurance
• Medical health check
• Other ancillary benefits, including relocation expenses (as required)
Executive Directors are also entitled to 30 days’ leave per annum, plus bank and public 
holidays.
Total cost of benefits capped at £25,000 for the Chief 
Executive and £17,500 for the other Executive Directors, 
which may be exceeded in exceptional circumstances if the 
cost of a particular benefit were to significantly increase. 
This cap excludes any relocation costs which may be 
required for a new hire.
Directors may participate in a defined contribution plan, or elect to receive cash in lieu 
of all or some of such benefit.
15% of salary
The annual bonus is based predominantly on stretching financial and operational 
objectives as set and assessed by the Committee on an annual basis.
A bonus pool is to be determined by financial measures (e.g. profit after tax). This 
pool will then be divided among participants using a mix of financial measures and 
strategic/personal objectives.  Financial measures will represent the majority of the 
bonus.  
Details of the performance targets set for the year under review and performance 
against them is provided in the Annual Remuneration Report.
Any bonus paid up to 100% of salary is paid entirely in cash. Any bonus in excess of 
100% of salary will be paid in shares and deferred for three years. Clawback/malus 
provisions apply in the event of material misstatement of results, an error in the 
calculation of bonus outcome or in instances of individual gross misconduct.
The maximum bonus opportunity will not exceed 150% of 
salary, although a lower maximum may be operated. 
At a threshold level of performance, no more than 20% of 
bonus will become payable, rising to 100% of bonus being 
payable for meeting all financial and strategic targets in 
full.
PSP awards may take the form of nil-cost options or conditional share awards. Awards 
normally vest after three years subject to performance and continued service.
Awards vest based on three year performance against a range of challenging EPS 
targets set and assessed by the Committee. The targets for each award will be set out 
in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
The awards can be reduced (via clawback and/or malus) at the discretion of the 
Committee within three years of vesting in the event of a misstatement of the results, 
an error in determining the extent to which performance targets were met or in 
instances of individual gross misconduct.
A dividend equivalent provision allows the Committee to pay dividends on vested 
shares (in cash or shares) at the time of vesting and may assume the reinvestment of 
dividends.
Plan Limits:
200% of salary (normal limit)
300% of salary (exceptional limit – e.g. recruitment or 
retention)
25% of the award vests for achieving threshold 
performance
100% of the award vests for achieving maximum 
performance
HMRC approved plan under which regular monthly savings are made over a 3 or 5 year 
period and can be used to fund the exercise of an option, where the exercise price is 
discounted by up to 20%.  Provides tax advantages to UK employees, with Executive 
Directors eligible to participate on a similar basis to other employees.  
A similar plan is also available to Irish employees.
Maximum permitted savings based on HMRC limits from 
time to time.
Executive Directors are required to retain 50% of the net of tax vested PSP shares until 
the guideline level is met.
At least 150% of salary for the Chief Executive and at least 
100% of salary for other Executive Directors, or such higher 
level as the Committee may determine from time to time. 42 - Poundland Group plc Annual report and financial statements for p/e 30 March 2014
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT continued
How the Remuneration Committee operates the 
variable pay policy
The Committee operates the share plans in accordance with their 
respective rules, the Listing Rules and HMRC requirements where 
relevant. The Committee, consistent with market practice, retains 
discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and 
administration of certain plans, including:
• Who participates in the plans;
• When to make awards and payments;
• How to determine the size of an award, a payment, or when and 
how much of an award should vest;
• The testing of a performance condition over a shortened 
performance period;
• How to deal with a change of control or restructuring of the Group;
• Whether a participant is a good/bad leaver for incentive plan 
purposes, what proportion of an award vests at the original 
vesting date or whether and what proportion of an award may 
vest at the time of leaving;
• How and whether an award may be adjusted in certain 
circumstances (e.g. for a rights issue, a corporate restructuring or 
for special dividends); 
• Whether to enforce an additional 2 year holding period on PSP 
awards post vesting; and
• What the weighting measures and targets should be for the 
annual bonus plan and PSP from year to year.
The Committee also retains the discretion within the policy to adjust 
existing targets and/or set different measures for the annual bonus 
and for the PSP if events happen that cause it to determine that the 
targets are no longer appropriate and amendment is required so they 
can achieve their original intended purpose and provided the new 
targets are not materially less difficult to satisfy. 
Any use of the above discretions would, where relevant, be explained 
in the Annual Report on Remuneration and may, as appropriate, be the 
subject of consultation with the Company’s major shareholders.
Choice of performance measures for Executive 
Directors’ awards
The choice of the performance conditions applicable to the annual 
bonus plan, being a primary financial performance target with 
additional strategic metrics specific to each Executive Director reflect 
the principle that the bonus plan should be self-funding, appropriately 
challenging and tied to both the delivery of profit growth and strategic/
personal objectives.
EPS was selected by the Committee as the sole performance condition 
applicable to the PSP on the basis that it rewards the delivery of the 
Company’s objective of delivering significant growth in profits. The 
Committee will review the performance scales applying to each award 
prior to each grant.
The Company’s ethos of ensuring that costs are carefully controlled is 
reflected in both the annual bonus and PSP , which are designed to be 
self-funding. 
In line with HMRC regulations for such schemes, the SAYE does not 
operate performance conditions. 
Awards granted prior to the effective date
In approving this Directors’ Remuneration Policy, authority is given to 
the Company to honour any commitments entered into with Directors.  
Details of any such payments will be set out in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration as they arise.
Remuneration policy for other employees
The policy described above applies specifically to the Company’s 
Executive Directors and is designed with regard to the policy for 
employees across the Company as a whole.  Overall there is more 
emphasis on variable pay for the Executive Directors; however the 
Company is committed to promoting widespread share ownership.  On 
IPO it made a number of awards under the Poundland Company Share 
Option Plan (CSOP) and the Poundland Restricted Share Plan (RSP), to 
selected managers. Executive Directors are not eligible to participate 
in these plans.
The RSP provides for the grant of share awards which vest after three 
years subject only to continued employment.  Under the CSOP , the 
Board may grant eligible employees share options at a price not less 
than the market value of a share on the date of grant. In the UK the 
first £30,000 of CSOP share options held at any time by an individual 
will be granted as an HMRC approved option. The share options 
normally vest after three years, subject to continued employment, but 
without further performance conditions. 
More specifically, on IPO, awards were made to 55 senior managers 
under the RSP and around 550 management grade employees 
(including approximately 400 Store Managers) under the CSOP .  
Awards may be made in future at the Committee’s discretion but there 
is no proposal for regular annual grants.  In general, differences arise 
in quantum and structure of remuneration for various categories of 
employees in the Company from the development of remuneration 
arrangements that are market competitive. However, our underlying 
remuneration philosophy is consistent across the whole company. Introduction Strategy Governance Financials

Notes:
• Value of benefits assumed at the overall aggregate cap 
• The on-target bonus is taken to be 40% of the current operating maximum bonus opportunity of 100% of salary 
• The on-target level of vesting under the PSP is taken to be 50% of the face value of the award at grant
• The maximum value of the PSP is taken to be 100% of the face value of the award at grant using the current grant policy of 150% for  
 Mr McCarthy and 125% for Messrs Hateley and Lancaster
• No share price appreciation has been assumed for the PSP award
Illustrations of application of remuneration policy
The chart below illustrates how the composition of the Executive Directors’ remuneration packages varies at different levels of performance 
under the 2014 policy, both as a percentage of total remuneration opportunity and as a total value:
Service contracts and payments for loss of office
The service contracts for the Executive Directors are terminable by either the Company or the Executive Director on twelve months’ notice and 
make provision for early termination by way of payment of a cash sum. Payment in lieu of notice can be paid either as a lump sum or in equal 
monthly instalments over the notice period.  The Company may also pay reasonable legal costs in respect of any compromise settlement.
There has been no payment for loss of office in the year ended 30 March 2014 (31 March 2013: nil)
Provision Detailed terms
Notice period 12 months
Termination payments 118% of salary comprising:
• 100% of salary
• 15% in respect of pension contributions
• 3% in respect of other benefits
Change of control There are no enhanced provisions on a change of control. 44 - Poundland Group plc Annual report and financial statements for p/e 30 March 2014
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT continued
Annual bonus on termination
There is no automatic or contractual right to bonus payment. At the 
discretion of the Committee, in certain circumstances a pro-rata 
bonus may become payable at the normal payment date for the 
period of employment and based on full year performance.  Where 
the Committee decides to make a payment, the rationale will be fully 
disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
PSP on termination
Share-based awards are outside of service contracts. The default 
treatment is that any outstanding awards would lapse on termination. 
However, under the Rules of the PSP , in certain prescribed 
circumstances, such as death, disability, injury, redundancy or other 
circumstances at the discretion of the Committee, ‘good leaver’ status 
can be applied.  In determining whether an Executive Director should 
be treated as a good leaver the Committee will take into account the 
performance of the individual and the reasons for their departure and 
in the event of this determination being made will set out its rationale 
in the following Annual Report on Remuneration.
In circumstances where an Executive Director is treated as a good 
leaver, awards will ordinarily vest on a time pro-rata basis subject to 
the satisfaction of the relevant performance criteria with the balance 
of the awards lapsing.  The Committee retains discretion to decide 
not to pro-rate, to alter the basis of time pro-rating, and to alter the 
date on which performance is calculated, if it feels such decisions 
are appropriate in particular circumstances.  However, if the time 
pro-rating is varied from the default position under the PSP Rules, 
an explanation will be set out in the following Annual Report on 
Remuneration.  Performance conditions will always apply to awards 
for good leavers, although the Committee may determine that it is 
appropriate to assess performance over a different period than the 
default three year period.
Service contracts are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office.
Approach to recruitment and promotions
The recruitment package for a new Director would be set in 
accordance with the terms of the Company’s approved remuneration 
policy.  Currently, this would facilitate an annual bonus payment of 
no more than 150% of salary and policy PSP award of up to 200% of 
salary (other than in exceptional circumstances where up to 300% of 
salary may be made).
On recruitment, salary policy may (but need not necessarily) be to set 
below the normal market rate, with phased increases as the executive 
gains experience.  The rate of salary should be set so as to reflect the 
individual’s experience and skills.
In addition, on recruitment the company may compensate for amounts 
foregone from a previous employer (using Listing Rule 9.4.2) taking 
into account the quantum foregone, the extent to which performance 
conditions apply, the form of award and the time left to vesting. 
For an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded 
in respect of their prior role should be allowed to pay out broadly 
according to its terms.  Any other ongoing remuneration obligations 
existing prior to appointment may continue, provided that they are put 
to shareholders for approval at the earliest opportunity.
For all appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will 
meet certain appropriate relocation costs.
Policy on external appointments
Subject to Board approval, Executive Directors are permitted to take 
on non-executive positions with other companies and to retain their 
fees in respect of such positions. Details of outside Directorships 
held by the Executive Directors and any fees that they received are 
provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration.  Introduction Strategy Governance Financials
Poundland Group plc Annual report and financial statements for p/e 30 March 2014 - 45
Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity
Fees To attract and retain the high-calibre 
Chairman and Non-Executive 
Directors by offering a market 
competitive fee level.
Fees are reviewed annually  and approved by the 
Board upon a recommendation from the Chairman 
and Executive Directors (in the case of the Non-
Executives) and from the Remuneration Committee 
in the case of the Chairman, with reference to 
market levels in comparably sized FTSE companies 
and reflect time commitments and responsibilities 
for each role.
Fees are paid in cash and are not performance 
related.  
There are no benefits, other than a contribution 
of up to £15,000 to the Chairman for secretarial 
support, or incentive schemes in operation for the 
Non-Executives.
There is no prescribed maximum 
annual increase. The Committee 
is guided by the general increase 
in the Non-Executive market 
but on occasions may need to 
recognise, for example, change 
in responsibility and/or time 
commitments.
The remuneration policy for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
The Company Chairman’s fee is determined by the Committee (other than the Company Chairman himself).  
The fees for the Non-Executive Directors are reviewed by the Board, excluding the Non-Executive Directors.  
The table summarises the key aspects of the remuneration policy for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors:
Letters of appointment
All Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment with the Company for an initial period of three years, subject to annual re-appointment 
at the AGM.  The appointment letters for the Non-Executive Directors provide that no compensation is payable on termination.  The Chairman is 
entitled to a notice period of 3 months.
Letters of appointment are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office.
Approach to recruitment
For the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director, the fee arrangement would be set in accordance with the approved 
remuneration policy in force at that time. 46 - Poundland Group plc Annual report and financial statements for p/e 30 March 2014
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT continued
Implementation of the remuneration policy for the year 
ending 29 March 2015
A summary of how the Directors’ Remuneration Policy will be applied 
during the year ending 29 March 2015 is set out below:
Base salary
The Executive Directors’ salaries were reviewed during early 2014 
and set on IPO.  Salaries will be reviewed again in early 2015 and any 
increases will take effect from 1 April 2015.
The current salaries are as follows:
Jim McCarthy £440,000
Nick Hateley £325,000
Richard Lancaster £325,000
Pension and benefits
The Committee intends that the implementation of its policy in 
relation to pension and benefits will be in line with the disclosed 
policy on page 39 of this report.  Jim McCarthy has elected to receive 
a 15% cash payment in lieu of pension contributions rather than a 
contribution into a pension plan.  
Annual bonus
The maximum annual bonus for the year ending 29 March 2015 will 
be 100% of salary for all Executive Directors.  Awards are determined 
based on a combination of both financial results, being underlying 
Company profit after tax (PAT), and strategic/personal performance.  
A bonus pool is to be determined by reference to PAT achievement, 
with a sliding scale of performance to be set around budget as 
follows: 
80% of the Pool will be distributed based on the PAT result. The 
remaining 20% available for the performance against strategic targets 
(so that, only for full achievement of the strategic objectives would the 
whole Pool pay out). 
The Strategic bonus elements for the Executive directors are:
Any bonus payment will be self-funding and clawback provisions 
apply. 
The specific targets for the 2014/15 year are considered commercially 
sensitive.  However, the Committee intends to disclose these 
retrospectively in next year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report to the 
extent that they do not remain commercially sensitive.
Performance share plan
PSP awards were made on Admission, and accordingly, other than for 
any new appointments or promotions, it is intended that no further 
awards will be made until the financial year ending 27 March 2016.  
Fees for Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
The Company’s approach to Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration 
is set by the Board with account taken of the time and responsibility 
involved in each role, including where applicable the Chairmanship of 
Board Committees. A summary of current fees is shown below:
Chairman £200,000
Non-Executive Director base fee £45,000
Additional fees:
Senior Independent Director £10,000
Audit Committee Chairman £5,000

Annual bonus for the year ended 30 March 2014
Financial performance in 2013/14 was very strong, representing a record year in Poundland’s profits.  However, the Executive Directors together 
with the remainder of the Executive Team indicated that for this year they did not wish to be considered for a bonus, and agreed to spread the 
bonus pool more widely in celebration of the landmark IPO event. 
Performance share awards made during the year – audited 
On 17th March 2014, the first day of Admission to trading, the following awards were granted to Executive Directors
The number of shares comprising the IPO awards was determined based on the Admission share price of £3.00. On the first day of unconditional 
trading, the close price was £3.75 resulting in a higher face value. The performance condition for these awards is set out below:

Total pension entitlements – audited 
During the year under review the Executive Directors received pension contributions of 15% of salary into defined contribution arrangements 
(or cash equivalent).  Details of the value of pension contributions received in the year under review are provided in the ‘Pensions’ column of the 
‘Remuneration received by Directors’ table.
Performance graph
The graph below illustrates the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance relative to the constituents of the FTSE 250 index 
excluding investment companies of which the Company is a constituent, from the start of conditional share dealing on 11 March 2014.  The 
graph shows performance of a hypothetical £100 invested and its performance over that period.
Directors’ shareholding and share interests – audited 
Share ownership plays a key role in the alignment of our executives with the interests of Shareholders.  Our Executive Directors are expected to 
build up and maintain a 100% (150% for the CEO) of salary shareholding in Poundland.  Where an Executive does not meet this guideline then 
they are required to retain at least 50% of the net of tax vested shares under the Company’s share plans until the guideline is met.  The current 
ownership of the Executive Directors significantly exceeds the requirement. 
The table below sets out the number of shares held or potentially held by Directors (including their connected persons where relevant) as at 30 
March 2014. 
1. Includes shares owned by connected persons.  Only beneficially owned shares count towards the shareholding guideline.

In 2014 the meetings of the Committee covered the following key areas:
• Detailed remuneration considerations prior to IPO and adoption of the new remuneration policy; 
• Consideration of structures and measures for 2014/15 annual bonus; and
• Consideration and adoption of 2014 PSP , RSP , CSOP and SAYE plans, and approval of grants on Admission under PSP , RSP and CSOP .
External advisors
The Remuneration Committee has access to independent advice where it considers it appropriate.  The Committee seeks advice relating to 
executive remuneration from New Bridge Street (NBS), part of Aon plc.  Neither NBS nor Aon provide any other services to the Company. 
The Committee is satisfied that the advice received from NBS in relation to executive remuneration matters during the year was objective and 
independent.  NBS is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and abides by the Remuneration Consultants Group Code of Conduct, 
which requires its advice to be objective and impartial.  The fees paid to NBS for providing advice in relation to executive remuneration over 
the financial year under review was £163K.  This advice primarily related to the development and roll-out of the post-Admission remuneration 
structures.
Statement of Shareholder voting
As mentioned previously, Poundland has not held an AGM since listing and therefore no voting outcomes are available.  We will publish details of 
remuneration related voting outcomes in next year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and Parent Company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they 
are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected 
to prepare the Parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable law (UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company 
financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
• for the Parent Company financial statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the Parent Company financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Parent Company 
will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Parent Company and enable them to ensure that 
its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to 
them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, a Directors’ Report, a Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and a Corporate Governance Statement that comply with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole;
• the Annual Report and Financial Statements taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy; and
• the Annual Report and Financial Statements includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the Group taken 
as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1. Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Poundland Group plc for the year ended 30 March 2014 set out on pages 58 to 100. In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 30 March 2014 and 
of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by 
the European Union; 
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK Accounting Standards; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risk of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit was 
as follows.  
Carrying value of inventory (£89.6 million)
Refer to page 36 (Audit and Risk Committee Report), page 66 (accounting policy), page 82 (financial disclosures) and page 95 (Accounting 
estimates and judgements).
• The risk – The Group holds a significant amount of inventory across a broad and diverse product range. Changes in consumer tastes and 
demands may mean that it cannot be sold or that sales prices are discounted to less than the current inventory carrying value. Estimating 
the future demand for, and hence the net realisable value of, these products is inherently subjective.
• Our response – Our audit procedures in this area included, among others, testing the design and effectiveness of the Group’s controls over 
the identification of slow moving or obsolete products and obtaining an understanding of the Group’s process for measuring the amount of 
provision required. We critically assessed the Group’s provision for those identified slow moving and obsolete products by assessing: the 
ageing of inventory; product lines with a cost in excess of expected net selling price; the level of expected price discounting; the historical 
accuracy of sales plans and the level of discounting activity in previous years. Furthermore, we performed analysis over the stock provision 
held at the year end as a percentage of stock and compared this to our expectations based on our knowledge of the business. 
We also considered the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures (see Note 29) about the degree of estimation involved in arriving at the 
provision. 
3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at £5 million. This has been determined with reference to a benchmark of 
Group Total Revenue (of which it represents 0.5%) which we consider to be one of the principal considerations for members of the company in 
assessing the financial performance of the Group. 
We agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee to report to it all corrected and uncorrected misstatements we identified through our audit with a 
value in excess of £0.25 million, in addition to other audit misstatements below that threshold that we believe warranted reporting on qualitative 
grounds.
The Group audit team performed the audit of the Group as if it was a single aggregated set of financial information. The audit was performed 
using the materiality levels set out above at the Group’s head office in Willenhall. 
4. Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion: 
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the financial statements.

5. We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on which we are required to report by exception 
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have identified other 
information in the annual report that contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge or the financial statements, a material misstatement of 
fact, or that is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to you if: 
• we have identified material inconsistencies between the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the directors’ statement that they consider 
that the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy; or
• the Audit and Risk Committee Report does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit and Risk Committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches 
not visited by us; or 
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
• the directors’ statement, set out on page 29, in relation to going concern; and
• the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on page 34 relating to the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2010 UK 
Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities.
Scope of report and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 54, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.  A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the 
Financial Reporting Council’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. This report is made solely to the company’s members as a body and is 
subject to important explanations and disclaimers regarding our responsibilities, published on our website at www.kpmg.com/uk/auditscopeukco2013a, 
which are incorporated into this report as if set out in full and should be read to provide an understanding of the purpose of this report, the work we have 
undertaken and the basis of our opinions.

Poundland Group plc Annual report and financial statements for p/e 30 March 2014 - 63
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
1 Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
Poundland Group plc (the “Company”) is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The Company was incorporated on 24 
January 2014.
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”).
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the EU (“Adopted IFRSs”).  
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Group financial 
statements.
Judgements made by the Directors in the application of these accounting policies, that have a significant effect on the financial statements and 
estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next period are discussed in note 29.
1.1 Measurement convention
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except where Adopted IFRSs require an alternative treatment. The principal 
variations relate to financial instruments.
1.2 Going concern
The Group financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis as the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The Group has considerable financial resources, together 
with a strong ongoing trading performance. On 17 March 2014, the Group entered into a new revolving credit and working capital facility of £55 
million with a syndicate of banks. The former and new borrowing facilities contain financial covenants which have been met throughout both 
periods. The Group’s forecasts and projections show that the new facility provides adequate headroom for its current and future anticipated cash 
requirements.
1.3 Basis of consolidation
On 17 March 2014, the Company obtained control of the entire share capital of Poundland Group Holdings Limited via a share for share 
exchange. There were no changes in rights or proportion of control exercised as a result of this transaction.
Although the share for share exchange resulted in a change of legal ownership, in substance these financial statements reflect the continuation 
of the pre-existing group, headed by Poundland Group Holdings Limited.
As a result, the comparatives presented in these financial statements are the consolidated results of Poundland Group Holdings Limited. For 
details of the impact on the earnings per share calculation see 1.19.
The prior period statement of financial position reflects the share capital structure of Poundland Group Holdings Limited. The current period 
statement of financial position presents the legal change in ownership of the Group, including the share capital of Poundland Group plc and the 
merger reserve arising as a result of the share for share exchange transaction. The consolidated statement of changes in equity on page 61 
explains the impact of the share for share exchange in more detail.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies 
of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are 
currently exercisable. The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. The financial statements of subsidiaries are 
included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. 64 - Poundland Group plc Annual report and financial statements for p/e 30 March 2014
1 Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies (continued)
1.4 Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency of the Group at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the 
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency 
at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the consolidated income 
statement with the exception of differences on transactions that are subject to effective cashflow hedges, which are recognised in other 
comprehensive income. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated 
using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction, except for differences arising on qualifying cash flow hedges which are recognised in 
other comprehensive income.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to the 
Group’s presentational currency, sterling, at foreign exchange rates ruling at the reporting date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations 
are translated at an average rate for the period where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rate ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of foreign operations are reported as an item of other comprehensive income and accumulated 
in the translation reserve.
1.5 Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group
Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: 
(a) they include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or 
financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group; and 
(b) where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no 
obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company’s 
exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument so classified takes 
the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up share capital exclude amounts in 
relation to those shares.  
1.6 Financial Instruments
Financial Assets
The Group’s financial assets include cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables. All financial assets are recognised when the 
Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
i) Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all 
amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. The amount of the provision is determined as the difference between the asset’s 
carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, and is recognised in the income statement in administrative expenses.
ii) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand and deposits held at call with banks. For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, 
cash and cash equivalents includes bank overdrafts in addition to the definition above.

Poundland Group plc Annual report and financial statements for p/e 30 March 2014 - 65
1 Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies (continued)
1.6 Financial Instruments (continued)
Financial Liabilities 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
The Group’s financial liabilities comprise trade and other payables and borrowings. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at their fair value 
and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
i) Bank borrowings
Term loans are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the borrowing. Borrowings 
are subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is 
recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Financial expenses comprise interest expense on borrowings and the ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value of cashflow hedges.
ii) Trade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
iii) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
Derivative financial instruments (comprising foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swaps and caps and commodity hedges) are used 
to manage risks arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates (relating to the purchase of overseas sourced products), interest rates 
and fuel price fluctuations. The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. The Group uses 
the derivatives to hedge highly probable forecast transactions and therefore the instruments are designated as cash flow hedges.
Derivatives are recognised at fair value on the date a contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value. The effective 
element of any gain or loss from remeasuring the derivative instrument is recognised directly in the cash flow hedge reserve.
The associated cumulative gain or loss is reclassified from the statement of changes in equity and recognised in the income statement in the 
same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects the income statement. Any element of the remeasurement of the derivative 
instrument that does not meet the criteria for an effective hedge is recognised immediately in the income statement within financial income or 
financial expenses.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss 
existing in other comprehensive income at that time remains in other comprehensive income and is recognised when the forecast transaction is 
ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was 
reported in other comprehensive income is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 
twelve months, or as a current asset or liability, if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than twelve months from the reporting date. 66 - Poundland Group plc Annual report and financial statements for p/e 30 March 2014
1 Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies (continued)
1.7 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant 
and equipment.
Depreciation is charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of 
property, plant and equipment. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Short leasehold property over the term of the lease
Property improvements 6 - 7 years
Plant and equipment 6 - 7 years
Fixtures and fittings 6 - 7 years
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date.
1.8 Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred 
to the Group. 
The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as: the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus the fair value of the existing equity 
interest in the acquiree: less the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
Costs relating to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred.
1.9 Intangible assets and goodwill
Goodwill 
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised but tested 
annually for impairment. 
Other intangible assets
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation 
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives 
are indefinite. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at each reporting date. Other 
intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Brand 20 years
Trademarks  5 years
Software 3 years
1.10 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is based on the weighted average principle and includes expenditure 
incurred in acquiring the inventories and other costs in bringing them to their existing location and condition.

1.11 Impairment excluding inventories and deferred tax assets
Financial assets (including receivables)
A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective 
evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition 
of the asset, and that the loss event has a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount and 
the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. Interest on the impaired asset 
continues to be recognised through the unwinding of the discount. When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, 
the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through the income statement.
Non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date 
to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For 
goodwill, and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated each 
year at the same time.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing 
value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested 
individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent 
of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the “cash-generating unit”). The goodwill acquired in a business combination, for the 
purpose of impairment testing, is allocated to cash-generating units, (“CGU”). Subject to an operating segment ceiling test, for the purposes of 
goodwill impairment testing, CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment is tested reflects 
the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to 
groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are 
recognised in the income statement. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to the units, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the units on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed 
at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a 
change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying 
amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had 
been recognised.
1.12 Employee benefits
Defined contribution plans
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and 
will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are 
recognised as an expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees. 68 - Poundland Group plc Annual report and financial statements for p/e 30 March 2014
1 Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies (continued)
1.12 Employee benefits (continued)
Short-term benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability 
is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Share-based payment transactions
The Group operates a number of equity settled share based compensation plans.
The grant date fair value of share-based payment awards made to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding 
increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards. The fair value of the options granted is 
measured using an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. 
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards for which the related service and non-market vesting 
conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the 
related service and non market performance conditions at the vesting date, measured at the grant date fair value of the award.
At each reporting date, the group revises its estimates of the number of share incentives which are expected to vest. The impact of the revision 
of original estimates is recognised in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
1.13 Provisions
A provision is recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, that can be reliably measured 
and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. 
1.14 Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of goods sold to external customers, net of value added tax and promotional discounts. Revenue is recognised 
on the sale of goods when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the customer and the amount of revenue 
can be measured reliably.
1.15 Operating lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease 
incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense. 
1.16 Financial income and expenses
Financial expenses comprise interest payable and the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges that are recognised in 
the income statement. Financial income comprises interest receivable on funds invested and the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value 
of cash flow hedges.
Interest income and interest payable is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, using the effective interest method. 
1.17 Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement and statement of other 
comprehensive income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.

Poundland Group plc Annual report and financial statements for p/e 30 March 2014 - 69
1 Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies (continued)
1.17 Taxation (continued)
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes 
and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the 
initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination, and differences 
relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax 
provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the reporting date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future profits will be available against which the temporary difference 
can be utilised. 
1.18 Non underlying items
Non underlying items are those items that are unusual because of their size, nature or incidence.  The Directors consider that these items should 
be separately identified within their relevant income statement category to enable a full understanding of the Group’s results.
1.19 Earnings per share
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares.  Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit 
attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. For diluted EPS, the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
As explained in the basis of consolidation accounting policy, the Group’s financial statements reflect the continuation of the pre-existing group 
headed by Poundland Group Holdings Limited.  That company had preference shares, the holders of which were entitled to a cumulative 
dividend at the discretion of the Directors.  In accordance with IAS 33, for the comparative period, and for the current period to the date of the 
share restructure, the accrued preference share dividend has been deducted from profit for the period to compute the earnings attributable to 
ordinary shareholders.  The conversion factor applied in the share reorganisation has been applied to calculate the number of ordinary shares 
of Poundland Group Holdings Limited used to compute the weighted average number of ordinary shares for the comparative period and for the 
current period to the date of the share restructure.  In this way the impact of the preference shares has been excluded from both earnings and 
the weighted average number of shares.
As a precursor to the share for share exchange, the preference shares in Poundland Group Holdings Limited were converted to ordinary shares 
and any entitlement to a dividend on these shares was forfeited.  For the periods reported, the Group has chosen to present an adjusted EPS 
calculation to aid comparability and to provide a consistent measure of performance, by excluding the impact of the preference shares from both 
earnings and the weighted average number of shares.  For this adjusted measure, in both reported periods, the weighted average number of 
shares is based on the share capital structure of Poundland Group plc and assumes that this structure was in place from 2 April 2012 (i.e. the 
beginning of the prior period).  
For both EPS measures (statutory and adjusted), the Group has also presented an alternative version with profit adjusted for non underlying 
items.  
A reconciliation of the adjusted and alternative measure to the statutory measure required by IFRS is given in note 3.
1.20 Adopted IFRS not yet applied
The following standards and interpretations have been published, endorsed by the EU, and are available for early adoption, but have not yet been 
applied by the Group in these financial statements. The Group does not believe the adoption of these standards or interpretations would have a 
material impact on the consolidated results or financial position of the Group
• IFRS10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’ replaces the guidance of control and consolidation in IAS 27 and SIC 32: Consolidation – special 
purpose entities. The core principle that a consolidated entity presents a parent and its subsidiaries as if they were a single entity remains 
unchanged, as do the mechanics of the consolidation.
• IFRS11 ‘Joint arrangements’ requires joint arrangements to be accounted for as a joint operation or as a joint venture depending on 
the rights and obligation of each party to the arrangement. Proportionate consolidation for joint ventures will be eliminated and equity 
accounting will be mandatory.
• IFRS12 ‘Disclosure of interests in other entities’ requires enhanced disclosures of the nature, risks and financial effects associated with the 
Group’s interests in subsidiaries, associates, joint arrangements and unconsolidated structures entities.
• IAS32 ‘Financial instruments – presentation’ (Amendment) – the amendment clarifies the offsetting criteria, specifically: when an entity 
currently has a legal right of set-off; and when gross settlement is equivalent to net settlement. 70 - Poundland Group plc Annual report and financial statements for p/e 30 March 2014
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
1.20 Adopted IFRS not yet applied (continued)
• IAS34 ‘Interim Financial Reporting’ (Amendment) – the amendment clarifies the requirements of IAS34 relating to segment information for 
total assets and liabilities for each reportable segment to enhance consistency with the requirements in IFRS8 ‘Operating Segments’.
• IAS36 ‘Impairment of assets’ (Amendment) – the amendments reverse the unintended requirement in IFRS13 to disclose the recoverable 
amount of every cash-generating unit to which significant goodwill or indefinite-lifed intangible assets have been allocated. Under the 
amendments, recoverable amount is required to be disclosed only when an impairment loss has been recognised or reversed.
In addition to the above, amendments to a number of standards under the annual improvements project to IFRS have been endorsed by the EU 
but not yet adopted. None of these amendments are expected to have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements
1.21 Reserves
Cash flow reserve
The cash flow hedge reserve represents the effective portion of cash flow hedges where the contract has not yet expired. The reserve is stated 
net of the associated tax. On expiry of the contract, the effective portion is recycled to the income statement.
Translation reserve
The translation reserve represents the cumulative translation differences for foreign operations, namely Poundland Far East Limited.
Merger reserve
The merger reserve arises on consolidation as a result of the share for share exchange on 17 March 2014. It represents the difference between 
the nominal value of shares issued by Poundland Group plc in this transaction and the share capital and reserves of Poundland Group Holdings 
Limited.
2 Operating segment
The Group has one reportable segment, discount retailing of a variety of products.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) is the Board of Directors. Internal management reports are reviewed by the CODM on a monthly 
basis. Key measures used to evaluate performance are Revenue and EBITDA.  Management believes that these measures are the most relevant 
in evaluating the performance of the segment and for making resource allocation decisions.
All material operations of the reportable segment are carried out in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland and all material non-current 
assets are located in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. The Group’s revenue is driven by the consolidation of individually small 
value transactions and, as a result, Group revenue is not reliant on a major customer or group of customers. All revenue is generated from 
external customers.
3 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary Shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares. For both periods, the weighted average number of shares is based on the share capital structure of Poundland Group plc and assumes 
that this structure was in place from 2 April 2012 (i.e. the beginning of the 52 weeks ending 31 March 2013). This ensures that basic earnings 
per share is calculated on a comparable basis and provides a consistent measure of performance.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential 
ordinary shares.
Proforma earnings exclude dividend payment of £xx million as part of restructure before floating. Introduction Strategy Governance Financials

4 Reconciliation of adjusted profit measure (EBITDA)
The Directors consider EBITDA to be a more consistent measure of operating performance. Operating profit is adjusted to exclude the impact of 
finance costs, taxation, amortisation and depreciation.
Underlying EBITDA excludes the impact of those distribution costs and administrative expenses which do not contribute to current trading 
activities. The Directors consider that this measure more fairly reflects actual operating performance.
6 Non-underlying items
In the period ended 30 March 2014, the Group incurred fees relating to its listing of £9,954,000. It has also incurred £2,981,000 relating to the 
renegotiation of its debt facility, which includes the write off of unamortised fees associated with the debt facility agreed in August 2010.
The Group incurred £1,277,000 of expenditure related to strategic initiatives (e-commerce and international expansion) (2013: £459,000).
In the period ended 31 March 2013, the Group incurred £1,424,000 of one-off costs relating to the opening of a new distribution facility in the 
South East of England and a further £435,000 relating to a new store format trial.
On the acquisition of Poundland Holdings Limited in June 2010, the Group recognised an intangible asset relating to the Poundland brand. This is 
being amortised over 20 years and the amortisation expense is presented as a non-underlying item (2014: £1,112,000, 2013: £1,112,000).
The ineffective portion of foreign exchange hedging contracts is recognised as a financial expense and disclosed as a non-underlying item 
(2014: £1,000 expense, 2013: £92,000 income).

enacted on 26 March 2012 and 3 July 2012 respectively. Further reductions to 21% (effective from 1 April 2014) and 20% (effective from 1 April 
2015) were substantively enacted on 2 July 2013. This will reduce the Group’s future current tax charge accordingly. The deferred tax asset at 
30 March 2014 has been calculated based on the rate of 20% (31 March 2013 liability calculated at 21%) substantively enacted at the reporting 
date. 78 - Poundland Group plc Annual report and financial statements for p/e 30 March 2014

Impairment testing
Goodwill of £163.9 million arising on the acquisition of Poundland Holdings Limited in June 2010 is allocated to the Group’s one operating 
segment. For impairment testing purposes, goodwill has been allocated to a group of cash generating units (CGUs) comprising the Group’s one 
operating segment. This represents the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Goodwill is not amortised, but tested annually for impairment on the basis of value in use calculations using discounted cash flows. As the value 
in use exceeded the carrying value for the cash generating units, no impairment loss was recognised in the period.
In assessing the value in use, the four year business plan was used to provide cash flow projections to the period ended March 2018. The cash 
flow projections are subject to key assumptions in respect of discount rates, expected new store openings, achievement of future revenue and 
EBITDA growth. The Directors have reviewed and approved the assumptions inherent in the model as part of the annual budget process using 
historic experience and considering economic and business risks facing the Group.
In assessing the Group’s value in use a pre-tax discount rate of 13.7% (2013: 15.1%) has been applied to the group of CGUs. 
The calculated value in use significantly exceeded the carrying value of goodwill and no further sensitivity calculations were necessary to 
conclude there was no impairment.

The contractual terms of the Group’s interest-bearing loans and borrowings, which are measured at amortised cost are described below. For 
more information about the Group’s exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk, see note 23.
The Group’s previous debt facility came into effect in August 2010. It consisted of two term loans and a six year working capital and revolving 
credit facility of £25 million, held by one of the Company’s subsidiary undertakings, Poundland Holdings Limited.
Term loan A (£30 million) was repayable in semi-annual instalments over a period of six years from inception.  During the period, the Group 
repaid £3.7 million (2013: £6.1 million) and repaid the outstanding balance of £17.3 million on 17 March 2014.
Term loan B (£35 million) was repayable in one instalment on 10 August 2017. During the period, the Group repaid £0.9 million (2013: £1.0 
million) and repaid the outstanding balance of £33.1 million on 17 March 2014.
The facility carried an interest rate at LIBOR plus an agreed margin. The facility was denominated in sterling.
On 17 March 2014, the Group entered into a new banking facility consisting of a revolving credit and working capital facility of £55.0 million. 
This is held by Poundland Holdings Limited. The Group utilised £30 million of the revolving credit facility, together with cash generated from 
operating activities, to repay the term debt in full.

Rights attached to shares
Ordinary shares
The rights attaching to the Ordinary Shares are uniform in all respects and form a single class for all purposes, including with respect to voting 
and for all dividends and other distributions thereafter declared, made or paid on the Ordinary Share capital of the Company.
Subject to any rights and restrictions attached to any shares, on a show of hands every Shareholder who is present in person shall have one vote 
and on a poll every Shareholder present in person or by proxy shall have one vote per Ordinary Share.
Except as provided by the rights and restrictions attached to any class of shares, Shareholders are under general law entitled to participate in 
any surplus assets in a winding up in proportion to their shareholdings.
Subject to the provisions of the Act, rights attached to any class of shares (unless otherwise provided by the terms of allotment of the shares 
of that class) may be varied or abrogated with the written consent of the holders of three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of the 
class, or the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the holders of the shares of the class.
Preference shares
Preference shares entitle their holder to receive notice of and to attend and speak at general meetings of the Company. Preference shares do not 
entitle their holder to vote at general meetings of the Company.
The rights attached to the Preference Shares may be waived, varied or abrogated with the consent in writing of the holders of at least 50% in 
nominal value of the Preference shares in issue. To the extent that such a waiver, variation or abrogation of any of the rights attached to the 
Preference shares adversely affects one group of Preference shares, such waiver, variation or abrogation must be approved by or on behalf of 
the holders of at least 50% in nominal value of the Preference shares in each respective group.
Except as provided by the rights and restrictions attached to any class of shares, the holders of the Company’s shares are under general law 
entitled to participate in any surplus assets in a winding up in proportion to their shareholdings, provided that the assets of the Company 
available for distribution among the members shall be applied in paying to the Preference Shareholders in proportion to the number of 
Preference Shares held by each of them, in priority to any payment to the holders of any Ordinary Shares in the Company, the issue price per 
Preference Share.
22 Share based payments
The Group operates three share award plans, all of which are equity settled.
The Performance Share Plan (PSP)
The PSP was adopted by the directors on 27 February 2014. All employees of the Group are eligible to participate in the PSP at the discretion of 
the Remuneration Committee. The first issue of awards was made on 17 March 2014.  All awards were granted for nil consideration.
A summary of the rules for this scheme and the related performance conditions are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration report.
The Restricted Stock Plan (RSP)
The RSP was adopted by the Directors on 27 February 2014. Awards over ordinary shares are granted subject only to continued employment. 
There are no performance conditions attached to the award.
All employees of the Group (other than Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee) are eligible to participate in the RSP at the 
discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Initial RSP awards were made on 17 March 2014. Other than these initial awards, the intention is that RSP awards will only be made in special 
or unusual circumstances. All awards were granted for nil consideration.
The RSP awards will usually vest three years after the date of grant. Vested share awards will be released to participants automatically within 30 
days of the vesting date.

22 Share based payments (continued)
The Company Share Option Plan (CSOP)
The CSOP was adopted by the directors on 27 February 2014. Under the CSOP , the Directors may grant to eligible employees options to acquire 
Ordinary Shares at an exercise price which may not be less than the market value of an Ordinary Share on the date of grant.
All employees of the Group are eligible to participate in the CSOP at the discretion of the Directors. 
The CSOP options may be subject to performance conditions. However, the initial award made on 18 March 2014 did not have any related 
performance conditions. All awards were granted for nil consideration.
A CSOP option will normally only be exercisable from the third anniversary of the date of grant and when all conditions applying to it have been 
satisfied. No dividends are paid on shares awarded.
The number and weighted average exercise prices of share based payment awards are as follows:
For the period ended 30 March 2014
In the period ended 31 March 2013, the Group did not operate any share based payment schemes. Therefore no comparatives are presented.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the fair value of the share options granted. 
The PSP and RSP awards are valued at 100% of the share price at the date of grant.
The fair value of CSOP awards is measured using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Measurement inputs and assumptions are as follows:

As the Company has recently listed, there is no history of share price movements. The expected volatility is therefore a proxy volatility figure, 
which has been derived as the average volatility of FTSE 250 companies within the General Retailers sector over the four years prior to grant 
date (i.e. the period equivalent to the expected term).
The risk free rate is equivalent to the prevailing UK Gilts rate at grant date, which is commensurate with the expected term.
CSOP awards are granted under a service condition. This is not taken into account in the grant date fair value measurement of the services 
received. The share based payments expense has been calculated using recent employee turnover levels. 88 - Poundland Group plc Annual report and financial statements for p/e 30 March 2014

23 Financial instruments and related disclosures
Financial risk management
The Directors have overall responsibility for the oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. A formal process for reviewing and 
managing risk in the business has been developed. A register of strategic and operational risk is maintained and reviewed by the Directors, who 
also monitor the status of agreed actions to mitigate key risks.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligation. This 
risk arises from the Group’s foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity hedging agreements with its banking counterparties. The Group 
only deals with credit with Banks in the Banking Syndicate or with Banks who are creditworthy, and monitors the creditworthiness of these 
counterparties using publicly available information.
As the principal business of the Group is cash sales, the Group trade receivables are small. The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in 
the financial statements represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk and any associated impairments are immaterial.
Group policy is that surplus funds are placed on deposit with counterparties, who are either party to the Group’s Banking syndicate, or who are 
creditworthy counterparties with a minimum of BBB credit rating.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group ensures that it has sufficient 
cash or loan facilities to meet all its commitments when they fall due by ensuring that there is sufficient cash or working capital facilities to meet 
the cash requirements of the Group for the current Business Plan. 
The risk is measured by review of forecast liquidity each month to determine whether there are sufficient credit facilities to meet forecast 
requirements and by monitoring covenants on a regular basis to ensure there are no expected significant breaches, which would lead to an 
“Event of Default”. Cash flow forecasts are submitted monthly to the Directors. These continue to demonstrate the strong cash generating ability 
of the business and its ability to operate within existing agreed banking facilities. There have been no breaches of covenants during the reported 
periods.
The Group has a £55.0 million Revolving Credit and Working Capital facility to support short and medium term liquidity. 
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in the market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect the Group’s income. The 
Group’s exposure to market risk predominantly relates to interest and currency risk, although the Group does hedge fuel used by its fleet of 
vehicles in the distribution of product to stores.

23 Financial instruments and related disclosures (continued)
Interest rate risk
The Group’s revolving credit facility incurs variable interest rate charges linked to LIBOR plus a margin dependent on the Group’s net debt ratio. 
The Group’s policy aims to manage the interest cost of the Group within the constraints of its financial covenants and Business Plan. 
The Group has hedged interest rate risk by purchasing an interest rate cap to mitigate interest rate risk to the end of October 2014.
The Group believes that the current interest rate hedge is adequate, and is continuing to monitor the interest rate swap market and future cash 
flows to decide on the appropriateness of any further hedges on the expiry of the existing contracts.
Foreign currency risk
The Group has a significant transaction exposure with increasing, direct sourced purchases from its suppliers in the Far East, with most of the 
trade being in US dollars. In addition to this, the Group is exposed to transaction risk on the translation of surplus Euro balances, generated by 
the Republic of Ireland branch, into sterling. The Group’s policy allows these exposures to be hedged for up to 18 months forward in order to fix 
the cost in sterling. Hedging is performed through the use of foreign currency bank accounts and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group does not hedge either economic exposure or the translation exposure arising from the profits, assets and liabilities of non-sterling 
businesses whilst they remain immaterial.
The carrying amount of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date is as follows:
Pension liability risk
The Group has no association with any defined benefit pension scheme and therefore carries no deferred, current or future liabilities in respect 
of such a scheme. The Group operates a number of Group Personal Pension Plans for its colleagues.
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to optimise returns to its 
Shareholders. The Board’s policy is to retain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor, and market confidence and to sustain 
future growth. The Directors regularly monitor the level of capital in the Group to ensure that this can be achieved.

Fair value disclosures
The fair value of each class of financial assets and liabilities is the carrying amount, based on the following assumptions:
Trade receivables, trade payables, short term deposits and borrowings The fair value approximates to the carrying value because of the  
 short maturity of these instruments.
Long term borrowings The fair value of bank loans and other loans approximates to the  
 carrying value reported in the statement of financial position.
Forward currency contracts The fair value is determined using the market forward rates at the  
 reporting date and the outright contract rate.
Fair value hierarchy
Financial instruments carried at fair value should be measured with reference to the following levels:
Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e.  
 as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) and
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs)
All financial instruments carried at fair value have been measured using a Level 2 valuation method.

In managing interest rate and currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on its earnings. At the end of each 
reporting period, the effect of hypothetical changes in interest and currency rates are as follows:
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The table below shows the Group’s sensitivity to interest rates on floating rate borrowings (i.e. cash and cash equivalents and bank borrowings 
which attract interest at floating rates) if interest rates were to change by +/- 1%. The impact on the results in the income statement and 
statement of other comprehensive income and equity would be:
Foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis
The table below shows the Group’s sensitivity to foreign exchange rates for its US dollar financial instruments, the major currency in which the 
Group’s derivatives are denominated:
A strengthening/weakening of sterling, as indicated, against the US dollar at the reporting date would have increased/(decreased) the cash flow 
hedge reserve and retained earnings by the amounts shown above. This analysis is based on foreign currency exchange rate variances that the 
Group considered to be reasonably possible at the end of the reporting period. The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest 
rates, remain constant.
There are no material movements in the income statement for the period. The movement in equity relates to the fair value movements on the 
Group’s forward contracts that are used to hedge future inventory purchases.

29 Accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect 
the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are 
based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in 
which the estimate is revised and in any future periods impacted.
The key judgements and estimates employed in the financial statements are considered below. 
Allowances against the carrying amount of inventories
The Group provides against the carrying amount of inventories for inventory lines based on expected demand for its products to ensure that 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Judgement is required in respect of assessing future demand and promotional 
offers.
Impairment of goodwill
On an annual basis, the Group is required to perform an impairment review to assess whether the carrying value of goodwill is less than 
its recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is based on a calculation of expected future cash flows, which include estimates of future 
performance. Details of assumptions used in the impairment of goodwill are detailed in note 12.
Provisions
Provisions are made using the Directors’ best estimates of future cash flows based on the current level of information available to them. Actual 
cash flows will be dependent on future events. For details of assumptions see note 20.
Depreciation and amortisation
Judgement is required in assessing the useful economic lives of tangible fixed assets and intangible assets. These assumptions are based on the 
Directors’ best estimate of the life of the asset and its residual value at the end of its economic life.
Valuation of other intangible assets
The assessment of fair value in a business combination requires the recognition and measurement of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities in the acquired business. The key judgements required are the identification of intangible assets meeting the recognition 
criteria of IAS 38 and their attributable fair values. The key assumptions in relation to the brand valuation are the Directors’ best estimate of its 
life and the royalty and discount rate used in its valuation.
Deferred taxation
The Group recognises deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon future taxable income and the expected recoverability of the balance. 
The estimate will include assumptions regarding future income streams of the Group and the future movement in corporation tax rates in the 
respective jurisdictions.

Notes to the Company financial statements
1 Accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the financial 
statements.
The Company was incorporated on 24 January 2014 and, therefore, no comparative information is presented. On 14 February 2014, the 
Company was registered as a public limited company. On 17 March 2014, its shares were listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with all UK applicable accounting standards and under 
the historic cost convention
No profit or loss account is presented for the Company as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. The Company loss for the period 
was £8,489,000, mainly related to non-underlying costs in respect of the IPO.
Going concern
The Company financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis. The Company heads a Group which the Directors believe has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. New banking facilities were agreed on 17 March 2014 and 
the Group’s forecast and projections show this new facility provides adequate headroom for its current and future anticipated cash requirements.
Share based payments
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries it recognises, in its individual financial statements, 
an increase in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled share-based payment charge recognised in its 
consolidated financial statements with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity.
Investments
Shares in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less any provision for impairment where in the opinion of the Directors there has been a 
diminution in the value of the investment.
Cash flow
Under FRS 1 (revised 1996) the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement as a consolidated cash flow has 
been included in the Poundland Group plc consolidated financial statements.
Dividends on shares presented within Shareholders’ funds
Dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that they are appropriately authorised 
and are no longer at the discretion of the Company. Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes to the financial 
statements.
2 Fees payable to the Auditors
Auditor’s remuneration is detailed in note 7 to the Group financial statements.
3 Staff numbers and costs
The Company has no employees other than the Directors. Full details of the Directors’ remuneration and interests are set out in the Directors’

Paul Lester CBE
Chairman
I am pleased to present our first Annual 
Report as a public company, although 
Forterra has a long and successful history.
Forterra has a rich heritage emanating 
from Hanson plc (now part of 
HeidelbergCement AG), and was a 
key player in the consolidation and 
rationalisation of the building products 
sector. The business was successfully 
established as a stand-alone company 
under Lone Star Funds’ ownership before 
being brought to market as a new public 
company in April 2016. T oday, Forterra 
is a UK leader in manufactured masonry 
products, with a unique combination of 
strong market positions in clay bricks 
and concrete blocks. The Group also 
produces a complementary range of 
bespoke building products, the most 
significant being engineered precast 
concrete flooring solutions.
Within our clay brick business, Forterra 
focuses on the efficient manufacture 
of high volume extruded and soft mud 
bricks, primarily for the housing market. 
The business is also the sole manufacturer 
of the iconic Fletton brick sold under the 
London Brick brand. Fletton bricks were 
used in the original construction of nearly a 
quarter of England’ s existing housing stock 
and are today targeted at the residential 
improvement market to match existing 
brickwork. Our concrete block business 
is one of the leading producers of both 
aircrete and aggregate blocks, the former 
being sold under one of the country’ s 
principal aircrete brands of Thermalite.

Forterra plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Chairman’s Statement Health and Safety
Forterra is committed to the highest  
safety standards for all employees,  
sub-contractors and visitors to our 
facilities. We describe later in this report the 
initiatives being taken in this area, including 
Building Safety T ogether . As Chairman, 
I have asked that all Directors conduct 
safety walks at a facility annually in order 
to build awareness and emphasise the 
importance that we place on safety . 
In addition, all senior operational managers 
are required to gain the NEBOSH 
general certification in occupational 
Health and Safety and during the year 
a further 15 managers were awarded 
the qualification. 
The Group’ s ‘Lost Time Injury Frequency 
Rate’ reduced by over 50% from 3.1 
in 2015 to 1.5 in 2016, and the bricks 
business went through the whole year 
without a single lost time incident.
Strategy
The Group primarily supplies products into 
the UK housing industry . After an extended 
period of subdued house building 
activity , the UK has a significant structural 
undersupply of housing. The business 
is well-positioned to take advantage of 
the attractive market fundamentals in 
the short to medium-term by utilising its 
existing, well-invested manufacturing 
facilities, available production capacity 
and inventories. Over the medium-term, 
we have a number of options to drive 
future growth.
The five pillars of Forterra’ s strategy are:
• embed manufacturing excellence 
across our business;
• align capacity and utilisation to 
market conditions;
• maintain cost leadership through 
operational efficiency in all parts of 
the business;
• product and service innovation; and 
• enhance the range of products and 
services offered through both organic 
investment and appropriate bolt-
on acquisitions.
The strategy is discussed in more detail 
on page 20.
Performance
Group revenue of £294.5 million was 1.5% 
ahead of 2015, with a strong end to the 
year offsetting weak merchant demand 
in the first half of the year . The business 
continued to build on its strong position 
with the housebuilders and overall 
brick, aggregate block and concrete 
flooring volumes were ahead of last year . 
Aircrete block volumes were affected by 
production constraints in certain weeks 
arising from availability of raw materials.
Due to the listing on the London Stock 
Exchange’ s Main Market through an Initial 
Public Offering (IPO) in April 2016, coupled 
with a refinancing (which significantly 
reduced indebtedness at the date of 
listing), a true comparison of performance 
with the prior periods is difficult. In order 
to make a comparison more meaningful, 
the profit before exceptionals for 2015 
has been shown on a pro-forma basis 
after adjusting for additional costs relating 
to being a stand-alone plc. The finance 
charge for 2015 and the first half of 
2016 has been calculated assuming that 
the debt structure at IPO was in place 
throughout both periods, and the  
pro-forma profit before tax is calculated  
on this basis. Similarly , the number 
of shares in issue at December 
2016 has been used in calculating 
pro-forma earnings per share for 
comparative periods.
The pro-forma profit before tax and 
exceptional items of £54.3 million for 2016 
increased by £2.0 million compared to last 
year , which was a creditable performance 
in difficult market circumstances. 
The statutory profit before tax (PBT) for 
2016 of £37.1 million compares with 
2015 of £22.2 million. In 2016, this was 
stated after charging exceptional items 
of £8.9 million (2015: £11.6 million) 
relating mainly to setting up the business 
as a stand-alone entity following the 
sale by HeidelbergCement AG and the 
costs associated with listing. The actual 
finance charge for both periods was also 
higher than that used in the pro-forma 
due to the increased net debt and higher 
interest rate in place under the previous 
ownership structure.
Earnings per share (EPS) before 
exceptionals has also been derived on a 
pro-forma basis using the profit before tax 
and exceptional items, effective tax rate 
for each period and the number of shares 
in place at the end of December 2016. 
On this basis, EPS was 4.4% higher than 
2015 at 21.5 pence per share.
The Group continues to generate a strong 
level of free cash flow and net debt at the 
end of December 2016 was £92.3 million, 
representing 1.3 times EBITDA. This  
excellent performance meant that the 
Group exceeded the target set at IPO.

Strategic Report Financial Statements Shareholder Information Governance Dividend
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 
3.8 pence per share, which, together with 
the interim dividend would make a total of 
5.8 pence for the full year. This represents 
a payout of 41% of post-IPO earnings 
which is slightly ahead of the target set 
for the first year.
The Board intends to follow a progressive 
dividend policy from this base.
Board and corporate governance
Becoming a listed company has meant 
a number of changes to the business 
organisation and processes, the formation 
of the plc Board with strong independent 
Directors being central to these changes.
As Chairman, one of my prime 
responsibilities is developing the 
appropriate corporate governance 
framework and ensuring that there is an 
able and experienced group of Executive 
and Non-Executive Directors to support 
this. I am pleased to have had six such 
Directors bring their experience to the 
Board to date, with the appointment 
of another independent Non-Executive 
Director well advanced.
Justin Atkinson, our Senior Independent 
Director and Audit Committee Chairman, 
has over 20 years of experience at 
senior management or Director level 
of listed companies, including those in 
engineering and all types of construction. 
Divya Seshamani, independent Non-
Executive Director, chairs the Group Risk 
Committee and has vast experience in 
areas including investment, infrastructure, 
energy, sustainability and manufacturing.
Bradley Boggess and Richard ‘Chip’ 
Cammerer were appointed as Non-
Executive Directors under the terms of 
the relationship agreement between 
the Company and Lone Star Funds. 
Both Brad and Chip bring many years 
of experience at the senior management 
or Director level of businesses including 
those in investment, retail, manufacturing 
and financial services.
The business is run by a highly 
experienced and committed executive 
management team led by Stephen 
Harrison, Chief Executive Officer and 
Shatish Dasani, Chief Financial Officer. 
Stephen joined Hanson plc in 2002 and 
was Managing Director of the business 
over the four years prior to the IPO. 
Shatish has many years of experience 
within listed companies with exposure 
to building materials, manufacturing, 
electronics and business services.
People
The performance of the business and 
our success is due to the hard work and 
dedication of all of our employees across 
the Group, and I would like to thank them 
all for their excellent work during the year .
On listing, under the Share Incentive Plan 
we were pleased to give each employee a 
deferred stake of £500 in the equity of the 
Company subject to them continuing to be 
with us over the next three years. We also 
launched the Group-wide employee 
Sharesave scheme in October and were 
delighted with a strong participation rate 
of 62% from employees who elected to 
save up to £500 per month for a period 
of three years.
We will continue to put increasing 
employee engagement and people 
development at the forefront of our plans.
Current trading and outlook
2017 has started well, building on the 
momentum seen in the second half of 
2016, with brick volumes for the first two 
months ahead of last year. The Group 
continues to see strong activity levels 
from the major housebuilders and positive 
indications from these customers for at 
least the first half of the year. It appears 
that the destocking in the builders’ 
merchants supply chain is now largely 
complete. As anticipated, price increases 
for the year have now been agreed with 
most customers in order to cover the 
increases in the cost base.
Based on our order book and current 
levels of activity, the outlook for the first 
half of the year is good. We have less 
visibility on the second half, however we 
anticipate a more balanced outcome 
between the first and second halves 
than in 2016. At this stage we expect 
to make progress through 2017 
and our expectations for the full year 
are unchanged.
The Board remains confident that the 
business is well positioned to take 
advantage of the attractive market 
fundamentals and of its ability to increase 
shareholder value.

clear strategic priorities
Our strategy is focused upon 
maximising our current potential as 
well as considering options for product 
expansion and appropriate bolt-on 
acquisitions. Our strong cash generation 
and de-leveraging since our IPO gives us 
significant optionality whilst maintaining a 
progressive dividend policy.
We have established a strong

Our Board is supported by our 
Operating Board who possess

Since Admission we have made

the business.
We are focused exclusively 
on the UK. We are a leading 
supplier of both clay brick 
and concrete block products 
with established brands 
and strong market positions 
across our product range
Government policy is focused on 
stimulating additional housebuilding and 
investing in infrastructure. Our markets 
are mature and established and 
the low value to weight ratio of our

Driven by our objective of boosting brick production in anticipation of further growth 
in the housing market, we have recently completed a multi-million pound investment 
at Measham. We have extended the tunnel kiln and installed an additional drying

I am pleased to present our first 
annual results as a listed company. 
They demonstrate good progress in 
the delivery of our strategy since IPO. 
Revenue and profit both increased during 
the year due to a strong performance 
in the second half. Net debt reduced 
significantly, demonstrating the strong 
cash generation of the business. The 
Group Lost Time Injury frequency rate 
reduced by over 50% and the bricks 
business went the whole year without a 
single lost time incident, demonstrating 
that we continue to deliver on our 
commitment to safety.
Our focus continues to be to drive the 
business forward for the benefit of all 
stakeholders, especially our shareholders 
who have recently invested in the 
Company. We continue to identify and 
implement investments which can 
drive growth and improve our service 
to customers.
I am backed by a strong leadership 
team and a great workforce, whom I 
would personally like to thank for their 
contribution and dedication during the 
year. As a relatively new organisation we 
still have improvements to make, and I 
am determined to continue our efforts 
to increase employee engagement and 
make this a great place to work.
I am looking forward to addressing the

Extraction and sourcing
Each of our major brick factories has 
an adjacent quarry from which clay is 
sourced. We also own clay reserves at 
other strategic locations. In total we have 
access to over 85 million tonnes of clay 
reserves and resources equating to an 
average of over 50 years production.
In addition to internally sourced clay, we 
source a range of other raw materials 
externally, including cement, aggregates, 
steel and packaging. We also consume 
significant quantities of natural gas, 
electricity and diesel which may be 
procured under forward contracts to 
provide price certainty.

Manufacturing efficiency
Manufacturing is at the core of 
our strength. The Brick and Block 
business manufactures and supplies 
a complementary range of clay and 
concrete building products. The Bespoke 
Products business manufactures and 
supplies a wide range of design-led 
products, including precast concrete 
flooring, permeable paving solutions and 
roofing and chimney products. 
We operate from 17 highly efficient 
and well invested facilities, which are 
amongst the largest of their kind in the 
UK. This delivers significant operating 
efficiencies, reducing our production 
costs. We strive for continuous 
improvement with modern methods 
of manufacturing being implemented 
throughout the Group. We continue to 
invest in maximising the performance 
of our installed production capacity with 
a number of de-bottlenecking projects 
further enhancing operating efficiency. 
We possess further un-utilised production 
capacity allowing us to benefit from further 
market growth.

We take great pride in the quality of our 
products and the service provided to our 
customers. In the unlikely event that our 
service levels or products fall short of the 
high standards we demand, then we aim 
to be transparent in putting things right as 
quickly as possible.
7
Our customers
Our customers include major 
housebuilders, builders’ merchants and 
other distributors. We don’t generally sell 
directly to tradesmen and the general 
public, who purchase our products 
from their local stockists. We have long 
standing customer relationships, in many 
cases exceeding 25 years.
8
Innovation
We continue to focus on innovation 
throughout our value chain, from 
seeking new raw materials, to improving 
production processes and designing new 
products for tomorrow’ s markets.
Additional value drivers 
Our people
We are committed to ensuring the 
safety and wellbeing of our people. 
We employee over 1,500 people to  
whom we offer effective training to ensure 
that they can perform to their potential. 
We are developing and empowering our 
people at all levels to help them improve 
their Company and its performance.
Synergies
Our product range is complementary 
and we sell many of our products to the 
same customers. Our shared distribution 
fleet operating across our Brick and Block 
business allows us to reduce costs and 
carbon emissions by reducing the time 
our vehicles run empty.
Production waste from one of our 
products is a valuable raw material for 
another. We re-use brick and aircrete 
waste in the manufacture of our aggregate 
blocks and where our clay deposits are 
found beneath sand and gravel reserves 
we are able to use this sand and gravel in 
manufacturing our aggregate blocks.
Responsibility and sustainability 
Central to everything we do is our 
responsibility for the safety of our people 
and everyone with whom we come into 
contact, along with our obligation to 
protect the environment.

Strategic Report Financial Statements Shareholder Information Governance The UK residential construction sector is Forterra’s primary market place and the 
Group’s results are influenced by the level of activity in this sector
Economic overview 
The current housing shortage should act as a positive driver to industry growth for the foreseeable  
future, although the current outlook is tempered by uncertainty around the impact of the UK’ s 
decision to leave the European Union.
The UK economy grew by 2.0% during 2016 despite a lull immediately after the EU Referendum in 
June 2016. The third and fourth quarters of 2016 saw strong growth as economic activity benefited 
from robust consumer spending. In February 2017 the Bank of England revised its 2017 growth 
forecast for the UK economy upwards with the Bank now forecasting GDP to grow by 2.0% in 
2017. Interest rates remain at record low levels which continue to support the UK housing market. 
Our market
The Group’ s products are almost exclusively used in 
construction activities within the UK and demand for the Group’ s 
products is therefore directly related to levels of UK construction 
activity. Levels and growth of construction activity are influenced 
by a number of macro-economic factors including general 
economic prosperity, government policy, mortgage availability 
and interest rates.

The UK construction market can be segmented by both end 
market and end use. The Group’ s products are predominantly 
utilised within the residential construction sector.
In 2016 c95% of the Group’ s revenue was derived from 
sales to residential construction applications. In addition to 
housebuilders, the Group’ s customers also include builders’ 
merchants and distributors who sell the products to a range 
of end users so a degree of estimation is inherent within 
these figures.

Forterra plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Market Overview UK housing market
The residential construction sector in the UK consists of both 
private and public (social) housing and includes both new 
build and the repair, maintenance and improvement (RM&I) of 
existing properties. New build activity is generally measured 
by the number of housing starts and the number of housing 
completions. Historically, new build activity has tracked broader 
economic cycles. RM&I activity is historically more stable. 
Forterra, through the unique and widely used London Brick, 
has a greater exposure to the residential RM&I market than 
some of its competitors.
New build construction
With over 50% of the Group’ s revenue being derived from 
residential new build construction, the performance of the 
housebuilding sector is fundamental to the Group’ s success. 
Currently over 85% of the houses built in the UK are constructed 
by the private sector with less than 15% being provided 
using public sector funding. Private house building has seen 
considerable growth over the past three years with housing starts 
increasing by 27% between 2013 and 2016. This increase has 
been driven by growth in the wider economy and supportive 
Government policy including the Help to Buy equity loan scheme, 
which is expected to continue until 2021. Private housing starts 
in Great Britain increased by 5.0% in 2016 and, with major 
housebuilders continuing to signal modest increases in output, 
build rates are expected to grow in 2017.
Public housing starts declined by 15% in 2016, but with 
Government policy now shifting towards providing an increased 
supply of social housing this figure is expected to grow in 2017 
with further strong growth anticipated thereafter . 
Structural undersupply of housing
The UK housing market has experienced long-standing 
structural undersupply. The Barker Review of Housing Supply 
in 2004 stated that prior to the financial crisis there was a 
shortage of approximately 450,000 houses. The situation further 
deteriorated following the financial crisis, with a prolonged 
period of depressed construction activity. The market picked 
up following the economic downturn, with a rise in the 
number of housing completions, however, current output 
remains well below both historic levels and the Barker Review 
recommendation that 240,000 new homes be built each year. 
The Construction Products Association estimates that there 
were 167,000 housing completions in 2016, still well short of 
the Barker Review recommendation. It is therefore implied that 
at the end of 2016 there is now a cumulative shortage of over 
1.1 million homes which is continuing to grow. 
Government policy continues to focus on further stimulating the 
rate of housebuilding. In January 2017 plans were announced 
to build 14 new garden villages which is expected to lead to 
25,000 new starts by 2020. The Housing White Paper published 
in February 2017 included measures intended to further boost 
the national rate of housebuilding including changes to the 
planning process and incentives to encourage the building of 
homes for private rental. 
Repair, maintenance and improvement
The housing RM&I market has remained fairly benign during 
the last two years. Whilst there is strong demand for new 
housing, current levels of housing transactions, which stimulate 
RM&I spend with householders renovating homes prior to sale 
or enhancing them after purchase remain at modest levels. 
The EU Referendum has increased the level of future economic 
uncertainty, which in turn may make householders more risk 
averse and less willing to spend on home improvements.

Strategic Report Financial Statements Shareholder Information Governance We have a clear plan to  
capture future opportunities
We have set out the following five strategic pillars that will drive us 
forward and ensure we generate sustainable shareholder value
Priorities Actions Progress in 2016 Looking ahead
1
Embed 
manufacturing 
excellence
• Implement facility 
optimisation 
programmes
• Invest in 
modern process 
technology
• Continual focus on 
Health and Safety 
and Sustainability
In 2016 we successfully completed the expansion 
of our Measham brick facility, further enhancing its 
efficiency and increasing production capacity by 22%. 
Within Bespoke Products we have reduced cement 
consumption in our hollowcore flooring products by 
up to 20% following the introduction of new state-of-
the-art casting machines. 
We also delivered an excellent improvement in our 
accident record with lost time incidents down by over 
50% compared to 2015, with no lost time incidents 
within our Brick business for the first time in our 
history.
We will continue to enhance our 
manufacturing footprint with our Desford 
and Claughton brick factories benefiting 
from significant investment in 2017 . We 
will also roll out the Intouch production 
monitoring system to our aggregate 
block plants in 2017 .
Following on from the excellent Health 
and Safety performance in 2016 
we will continue to strive for further 
improvements.
2
Align capacity 
and utilisation 
to market 
conditions 
• Respond to market 
conditions
• Flex cost base 
where necessary
During 2016 we continued to respond quickly 
and decisively to changes in market conditions. 
We increased our production of London Brick at 
Kings Dyke by recommissioning an idle kiln. We 
also responded to continued strong demand for 
aggregate blocks by increasing output at both of our 
facilities.
We temporarily turned off the kilns at Claughton and 
Accrington in the middle of the year to balance our 
inventories and to maximise the utilisation of our 
most efficient plants.
We will continue to align our output to 
market demand and we have significant 
unused capacity which will allow us to 
benefit from market growth.
Our investments at Desford and 
Claughton will not only improve efficiency 
but will also add an additional 15 million 
bricks of annual capacity.
We retain full optionality for future larger 
scale brick capacity increases at our 
sites at Swillington and Clockhouse.
3
Deliver 
operational 
efficiency 
• Continuous 
improvement 
programmes 
covering:
–  r e s o u r c e u s a g e /
energy efficiency;
–  s up pl y c ha i n 
management;
–  d is t r ib u t i o n 
optimisation.
Within our aircrete business we have made progress 
on developing and utilising alternative raw materials 
in the manufacture of our products. Within Bespoke 
Products we manufactured and delivered a record 
volume of precast concrete T-beams following 
investment at our Somercotes facility. 
We intend to continue exploring and 
developing alternative materials for use 
in the manufacture of aircrete blocks 
and will commit capital to modifying our 
plants where necessary. We will continue 
to investigate options to maximise 
the efficiency of our facilities, further 
develop our procurement and improve 
distribution functions.
4
Product and 
service 
innovation 
• Develop new 
products and 
services
• Enhance our 
customer 
service and 
build on existing 
relationships
We restructured our Brick and Block commercial 
function during the year to maximise our ability to 
cross-sell our wide range of products. We have also 
created a new commercial and specification team 
who will work with architects and specifiers to sell our 
products into this segment, where we are currently 
under-represented.
We demonstrated our commitment to innovation by 
establishing a dedicated new product development team 
and utilising our increased capacity we have already 
added a number of new products to our Ecostock brick 
range manufactured at Measham. Additionally, we have 
developed a new marketing strategy to showcase the 
uses of our products in flood prevention.
We will continue to explore opportunities 
in the emerging field of ‘off-site’ 
construction and this may include 
developing our own products and also 
partnering with others. 
We expect to continue to increase the 
resources we devote to research and 
development.
In 2017 we will make it easier for our 
customers and suppliers to trade with 
us by implementing new IT systems 
throughout our business. 
5
Product range 
enhancement 
• Expand housing 
construction 
product footprint
• Investigate bolt-
on acquisitions
We have commenced a review of opportunities 
for product expansion and appropriate bolt-on 
acquisitions.
We will continue to critically appraise 
opportunities for product expansion 
and appropriate bolt-on acquisitions.

Our Strategy We use the metrics included here to ensure that we are on 
track and making progress against our strategic priorities
Measuring and monitoring 
our performance
Revenue (£ million)
Definition
Revenue represents the sale of our 
products, net of rebates, discounts and 
value added taxes.
Performance
Revenue increased by 1.5% in 2016. 
Sales volumes of bricks, aggregate blocks 
and precast concrete were all ahead 
of last year. Excluding the Structherm 
business, which was disposed of in 
October 2016, Group revenue grew by 
2.3%, from £286.5 million in 2015 to 
£293.0 million in 2016.
EBITDA cash conversion (%)
Definition
EBITDA cash conversion is calculated as 
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, 
amortisation and exceptional items 
(EBITDA before exceptionals) less capex, 
over EBITDA before exceptionals.
Performance
The Group has a strong cash conversion 
history with results greater than 80% of 
EBITDA for both 2015 and 2016. The 
current year result shows an increase of 
five percentage points from the prior year.
Note: In future years operating cash conversion 
will be used. This measure is not meaningful for 
2015 due to inclusion of flows under the previous 
ownership structure.

Net debt (£ million)
Definition
Net debt comprises the balance of short 
and long-term borrowings, less cash and 
cash equivalents.
Performance
Net debt decreased from £155.0 million 
at IPO to £92.3 million at year end. 
The reduction in net debt is due to the 
strong cash generation of the business, 
helped by an excellent working capital 
performance and also the timing of the 
IPO in the last week of April 2016 ahead of 
cash collections at the end of the month.
PBT before exceptionals (pro-forma) 
(£ million)
Definition
Profit before tax adjusted for exceptional 
items, additional costs related to being 
a stand-alone plc and with finance 
costs restated to present the debt 
facility at IPO as if it had been in place 
throughout both years.
Performance
On a pro-forma basis, profit before tax 
grew by 3.8% from 2015 to 2016.

Our Key Performance Indicators Driving efficiency and growth  
through our strategic objectives
Results for the year
Revenue of £294.5 million was 1.5% 
ahead of last year , reflecting a strong 
performance in the second half as volumes 
to housebuilders continued at a good 
rate, and the de-stocking in the supply 
chain at merchants and distributors 
eased towards the end of the year . 
Sales volumes of bricks, aggregate blocks 
and precast concrete products were all 
ahead of last year . As previously reported, 
sales of aircrete blocks were affected by 
availability of raw materials during some 
weeks. The Group achieved low single 
digit price increases at the start of 2016 as 
anticipated, but relatively higher sales of 
some of the lower priced products in our 
range to volume housebuilders led to an 
adverse mix variance.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, 
amortisation and exceptional items 
(EBITDA before exceptionals) of 
£70.6 million for the year was £3.1 million 
ahead of the comparable result for 2015. 
The increase was due to higher sales, 
lower energy costs and tight control of 
fixed costs and overheads, offset in part 
by the adverse sales mix described above. 
EBITDA margin of 24.0% was ahead of the 
comparable 2015 margin of 23.3%.
In October 2016, the Group completed 
the sale of its Structherm subsidiary in 
order to focus on improving and growing 
the core businesses of bricks, blocks and 
other concrete and clay building products. 
Structherm manufactures structural 
external wall insulation solutions for 
residential buildings. 
The pro-forma profit before tax and 
exceptional items of £54.3 million was 
£2.0 million higher than the comparative 
for 2015. 
Profit before tax on a statutory basis was 
£37.1 million for 2016 compared with 
prior year of £22.2 million. Apart from the 
trading factors described above, there 
was a higher finance charge in 2015 due 
to the increased net debt and higher 
interest rate in place under the previous 
ownership structure. Exceptional charges 
totalled £8.9 million in 2016 and 
£11.6 million in 2015, mainly arising from 
the costs of separating the business from 
HeidelbergCement AG and the listing 
costs relating to the IPO completed in 
April 2016.

Forterra plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Business Review Earnings per share and dividend
Earnings per share before exceptionals 
has also been derived on a pro-forma 
basis using the profit before tax and 
exceptional items, effective tax rate for 
each year and the number of shares in 
issue at the end of December 2016. 
On this basis, EPS was 4.4% higher than 
2015 at 21.5 pence per share. EPS on a 
statutory basis has also been calculated 
using the number of shares at the end of 
December 2016 and was 13.8 pence per 
share for 2016.
As reported in the Chairman’ s Statement, 
the Board is recommending a final 
dividend of 3.8 pence per share, making 
a total dividend of 5.8 pence for the year. 
The final dividend will be paid on 6 July 
2017 to those shareholders on the register 
as at 16 June 2017.
Cash flow, borrowings and facilities
Operating cash flow before exceptionals 
of £69.8 million was £16.0 million higher 
than 2015, mainly due to a strong 
trade working capital performance and 
the inclusion in 2015 of flows arising 
from the previous ownership structure. 
The cash generation of the business is 
weighted more to the second half due to 
a build-up of working capital earlier in the 
year. Debtor days on a countback basis 
reduced from 42 days at December 2015 
to 39 days in 2016. Brick inventory levels 
reduced in the year due to the increase in 
demand and the measures put in place 
during the year to balance demand, 
inventory and utilisation levels. 
Capital expenditure for the year totalled 
£9.1 million and included the successful 
completion of the expansion work at 
our Measham facility at the start of the 
year and the upgrade carried out at our 
Hams Hall aircrete facility. We have also 
committed significant investment and 
resources to upgrade our IT systems 
across the business.

Interest cover >4.0x 15.8x
Net debt at 31 December 2016 
was £92.3 million compared with 
£155.0 million at IPO in April 2016. 
The larger than expected reduction in net 
debt is due to the strong cash generation 
of the business, helped by an excellent 
working capital performance and also the 
timing of the IPO in the last week of April 
2016 ahead of cash collections at the end 
of the month.
Net debt to EBITDA (calculated with 
reference to the last 12 months of 
earnings before exceptionals) was 
1.3 times at 31 December 2016 
compared with 2.2 times at IPO and 
ahead of the target set at the time of 
the IPO to reduce the leverage level to 
be below 1.5 times. For the purpose 
of calculating the covenant, the net 
debt excludes capitalised finance costs 
in line with the requirements of the 
Facility Agreement.
Committed borrowing facilities of 
£180 million were agreed with a group 
of leading international banks at IPO, 
comprising a £150 million term facility and 
£30 million Revolving Credit facility (RCF) 
expiring in April 2021. At 31 December 
2016, only the term loan of £150 million 
was drawn down and the whole of 
the RCF remains available for future 
drawdown. The financial covenants 
required interest cover to be greater than 
four times and net debt to EBITDA before 
exceptional items to be less than 3.5 
times at 31 December 2016. The test 
required that for 2016 the interest cost 
was calculated by doubling the interest 
charge for the second half of the year. 
The Group meets these covenant 
tests comfortably.
The interest payable on the facilities 
is set at LIBOR plus a margin ranging 
from 150bps to 275bps dependent on 
leverage, with the margin set at 225bps 
for 2016.

Strategic Report Financial Statements Shareholder Information Governance Bricks and Blocks
The Group has a unique combination of 
strong market positions in both clay brick 
and concrete blocks. It is also the only 
manufacturer of the iconic and original 
Fletton brick sold under the London 
Brick brand. The Group operates nine 
brick manufacturing facilities across the 
country with a total production capacity 
of 570 million bricks per annum. It is also 
a leader nationally in the aircrete block 
market selling under the Thermalite 
brand, operating from facilities at 
Newbury, and Hams Hall in the Midlands. 
The aggregate blocks business has a 
leading position in the important South 
East and East of England markets with 
well-located manufacturing facilities 
at Milton (Oxfordshire) and Whittlesey 
(near Peterborough).
Revenue increased by 1.5% due to 
higher brick and aggregate block volumes 
compared to 2015. There was a strong 
increase in brick sales to housebuilders, 
with volumes to merchants and 
distributors restricted by excess inventory 
held in the supply chain, though this 
eased in the last quarter of 2016. 
Brick imports also reduced during 2016 
as anticipated, enabling a higher level 
of market demand to be satisfied by 
domestic production. Sales of aircrete 
blocks were affected by production 
constraints in some weeks due to the 
unavailability of pulverised fuel ash (PFA), 
which is a by-product of coal-fired power 
stations. Low single digit brick price 
increases were applied at the start of 
2016, in line with expectations, but the 
positive effect of this was offset by a 
mix variance arising from higher sales to 
volume housebuilders.
EBITDA before exceptionals increased on 
a pro-forma basis to £63.6 million, with 
margin improving to 28.7%, due to higher 
sales volumes, lower energy and fixed 
production costs offset partly by sales mix. 
Kilns at two of the Group’ s brick facilities 
at Accrington and Claughton were 
temporarily turned off mid-way through 
the year, and this enabled generally higher 
utilisation at the other facilities as well as a 
reduction in inventory levels in the second 
half. The actions demonstrate the Group’ s 
ability to effectively flex production in 
response to changes in the end market.
In January 2016, the project to increase 
capacity at the Group’ s Measham brick 
facility in Leicestershire was successfully 
completed on schedule and under 
budget, resulting in annual capacity at the 
plant increasing by 22% to 105 million 
bricks with a capital spend of less than 
£4 million. This project included extending 
the length of the kiln and improving 
product flow-through by eliminating 
bottlenecks. Whilst there were some 
teething problems as the plant was 
restarted following the major work, these 
have all been resolved and the plant is 
now fully operational. The Measham 
facility is state-of-the-art and the most 
modern and fully automated soft mud 
brick manufacturing facility in the UK.
The Group saw a 
strong increase 
in brick sales to 
housebuilders.”

Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Business Review continued Refurbishment of one of the kilns at the 
London Brick (Fletton) plant at Kings Dyke 
(near Peterborough) was also completed 
for the start of 2016, enabling an increase 
in available production capacity. In the 
last quarter of the year, capital projects 
were approved totalling £6.5 million at two 
other brick facilities. At Desford, a project 
to increase gas supply capacity and install 
new kiln burners has commenced, with 
an estimated brick capacity increase of 
10 million per annum (c.12%). The project 
to replace the dryers at Claughton has 
also been initiated. This will improve the 
efficiency of the production process and 
add additional capacity of five million 
bricks per annum (c.11%). The Claughton 
kiln was turned off in August 2016, and it 
is planned to complete the project in the 
first half of 2017 in order to be in a position 
to relight the kiln in summer 2017.
The Group continues to progress a 
number of initiatives to secure supplies 
of PFA and alternative materials so as 
to have uninterrupted production of 
aircrete blocks. Following the successful 
modernisation and expansion of the facility 
at Hams Hall in 2015, a further £0.6 million 
was invested at the plant to enable the 
use of conditioned (wet) PFA. Output at 
both the aggregate block plants increased 
in 2016. There was a strong demand for 
this product and record output from the 
two facilities.
A number of important sales and 
commercial changes have been 
implemented during the year in order to 
strengthen relationships with customers 
and improve service levels. A new 
Commercial Director was appointed 
and a new sales structure introduced 
to give clear focus on critical market 
segments. The sales team has been 
reorganised from individuals selling either 
bricks or blocks, to area teams selling all 
products into postcode territories, with 
an improvement in coverage. The Group 
has also increased its presence with 
architects and specifiers by adding further 
resource in this area. A new system 
to monitor sales activity on a real time 
basis has been implemented in order to 
increase customer service and improve 
market insight. 
The Group operates a dedicated sales 
and customer service centre for the 
bricks and blocks business allowing it to 
respond to customers more effectively 
and efficiently. Investment has been 
made in training sales and support staff 
so that they have a greater knowledge 
of all the products the Group offers and 
can continue to provide a high level of 
customer service.
A dedicated New Product Development 
team has been established during the 
year and the product range expanded 
in order to broaden customer offering 
utilising the capability of our facilities and 
people. A number of new brick types 
were added to the range during the year. 
It is planned that this will be an ongoing 
programme of activity, working closely 
with our customers as well as specifiers 
and architects.
The Group offers high service levels by 
operating its own fleet of 125 crane-
equipped delivery vehicles to deliver its 
bricks, aircrete and aggregate blocks to 
customers. These vehicles account for 
approximately 60% of total deliveries, 
with the balance carried out by third 
party hauliers in order to maximise 
flexibility and cost-effectiveness. 
An optimisation tool linked to the sales 
order processing system is used to 
ensure efficient scheduling of deliveries, 
providing visibility of vehicle activity and 
enabling the team to adapt to changes in 
customer requirements.

Strategic Report Financial Statements Shareholder Information Governance Bespoke Products
The Bespoke Products division focuses 
on specification-led, made-to-order 
products comprising: precast concrete, 
block paving, chimney and roofing 
solutions, much of which is primarily 
made-to-measure or customised to meet 
the customer’ s specific needs.
Overall revenue for the division grew by 
1.5%, due to a strong performance from 
the engineered precast concrete flooring 
products. EBITDA before exceptional 
items increased on a pro-forma basis by 
£1.2 million to £7.0 million. As described 
previously, the external wall insulation 
business Structherm was sold in October 
2016. Excluding this business, the 
underlying revenue growth was 4.7%, and 
the underlying EBITDA margin for 2016 
was 9.7%.
Precast concrete
Precast concrete products are designed, 
manufactured and shipped nationwide 
from the Hoveringham and Somercotes 
facilities. These products cover:
• Hollowcore floors, which are used 
for upper floors of multi-family and 
commercial developments, with the 
majority of floors fitted by the in-house 
installations team;
• Jetfloor
 
, which is the UK’ s first system 
to use expanded polystyrene blocks 
combined with a structural concrete 
topping to provide high levels of thermal 
insulation. Jetfloor was voted Best 
Building Fabric at the Housebuilder 
Product Awards 2015;
• Beam and Block flooring, a traditional 
and cost effective suspended flooring 
system for ground floors in domestic 
and commercial applications;
• A range of concrete retaining walls, 
culverts, Omnia Bridgedeck, barriers

Forterra plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Business Review continued The precast concrete flooring business 
had a very successful year in 2016, 
with record supply of T -beams aided 
by utilisation of the additional capacity 
installed at the Somercotes facility in the 
previous year. The Somercotes facility also 
won the contract to design, manufacture 
and supply the Forterra Omnia 
Bridgedeck system for Scotland’ s largest 
infrastructure project, and designed and 
supplied the precast units for Ilkeston’ s 
new railway station platforms. It has 
recently secured dual supplier status with 
the UK’ s largest retirement homes supplier 
and has started receiving orders under 
this new arrangement.
Cost optimisation continues to be a focus 
at all the plants. At our Hoveringham 
facility, new casting equipment technology 
has been installed, resulting in a saving 
of up to 20% on cement usage in 
hollowcore flooring.
Formpave
Formpave, based at our Coleford site, 
designed the UK’ s first permeable block 
paving solution almost 20 years ago and 
continues to be a leading authority in the 
design and specification of sustainable 
urban drainage systems (‘SuDS’) using 
the Group’ s permeable block paving. 
Products sold under the Formpave 
brand include:
• Aquaflow SuDS, a patented filtration 
system that allows rainwater to be 
filtered and cleaned before being 
percolated into the ground or a 
patented attenuation (tanked) system 
allowing water to be collected and 
released into watercourses;
• A wide range of high quality precast 
concrete standard block paving to suit 
all projects from commercial to domestic 
applications, offering a selection of 
colours, block types and finishes, 
including EcoGranite, which contains up 
to 77% recycled content, and Chartres, 
which matches the stone traditionally 
used in certain heritage sites; and
• A range of kerbs, edging, step systems 
and transitions suitable for use with 
conventional block and permeable 
block paving.
During the year, the business secured 
preferred supplier status for its permeable 
paving product from a premium national 
automotive dealership. In addition, 
Formpave has made significant progress 
in the development of its Aquaflow 
Thermapave system, which combines 
ground source heat pump (‘GSHP’) 
technology with its patented Aquaflow 
sub-base, to generate sufficient energy 
to allow the transfer of heat into and out 
of buildings during cold and hot periods, 
respectively.
Formpave has also recently commenced 
a project to install a replacement block 
press machine which will enable higher 
production capacity and greater efficiency 
across its product range.
Red Bank 
Red Bank manufactures its products 
from its facility alongside the Measham 
quarry and brick facility, producing a 
comprehensive range of chimney, roofing 
and flue systems. Products include 
fire-backs, clay and concrete flue liners 
(developed to meet the growing demand 
for flue products to suit modern efficient 
wood-burning, multi-fuel and gas-fired

Strategic Report Financial Statements Shareholder Information Governance Exceptional items
Exceptional items totalled £8.9 million in 
2016 compared with £11.6 million in the 
previous year.
Transaction costs related to the IPO of 
the Company completed in April 2016. 
Separation costs arose from the setting 
up of the business as a stand-alone entity 
after divestment from HeidelbergCement 
AG in 2015 and Forterra Inc in 2016 and 
included rebranding, set up of stand-
alone IT systems, staff recruitment and 
new office fit out costs. An indemnity 
payment was received in the year from 
HeidelbergCement AG relating to previous 
tax paid prior to separation, and this has 
been credited as an exceptional item.
Finance costs
The total finance costs for 2016 were 
£14.2 million (2015: £27.3 million). 
Since the IPO of the business in April 
2016, finance costs relate to the interest 
and commitment fees in respect of the 
new debt facilities of £180 million put in 
place. The interest payable on the facilities 
is set at LIBOR plus a margin ranging 
from 150bps to 275bps dependent on 
leverage, with the margin set at 225bps 
for 2016. In addition the cost of arranging 
the facility of £2.9 million is being 
amortised over the term of the facility.
The Group had a much higher debt level 
and interest rate during 2015 and for the 
first months of 2016 up to the IPO. 
The pro-forma annual finance cost for 
2016 was £5.9 million (2015: £5.8 million) 
assuming that the debt facility at IPO had 
been in place throughout the year, and 
this has been used to calculate the pro-
forma profit before tax and earnings per 
share before exceptional items.

T otal exceptional items (8.9) (11.6)
Taxation
The effective tax rate excluding 
exceptional items is 20.9% (2015: 21.1%). 
The Group derives substantially all its 
revenue from the UK and the rate is based 
on the UK corporation tax rate adjusted 
for permanent non-deductible items such 
as depreciation on non-qualifying assets.
The effective tax rate after including 
exceptional items was 25.9% 
(2015: 18.7%) due mainly to the 
non-deductibility of some of the IPO 
transaction costs.
Pensions
The Group has no defined benefit pension 
scheme in place, with the legacy liabilities 
of the previous pension scheme left 
with HeidelbergCement AG when the 
business was divested. There is a defined 
contribution arrangement in place and 
pension costs for the year amounted to 
£5.2 million (2015: £4.3 million), with the 
increase from prior year due mainly to the 
transition from HeidelbergCement AG and 
the establishment of a new Head Office 
during 2015.
Disposal
In October 2016, the Group completed 
the sale of its Structherm subsidiary in 
order to focus on improving and growing 
the core businesses of bricks, blocks and 
other concrete and clay building products. 
Structherm recorded sales of £1.5 million 
(2015: £3.7 million) and an operating loss 
of £0.1 million (2015: profit £0.1 million) 
up to the date of disposal. The Group 
recorded a loss on disposal of £0.1 million 
as a result of the transaction.

Strategic Report Financial Statements Shareholder Information Governance Commitment to Health and Safety
Forterra is committed to continually 
improving its occupational Health and 
Safety standards and performance. 
The Group recognises that its greatest 
asset is its workforce and therefore its 
ultimate aim is to provide a working 
environment that is free of accidents and 
ill health. T o achieve this the business 
ensures all relevant legislation and 
codes of practice are complied with 
and regularly monitors key performance 
indicators. Forterra also ensures adequate 
arrangements are in place for the health, 
safety and wellbeing of visitors and 
members of the public that come into 
contact with our operational activities.
With our aim to have the safest and most 
engaged workforce possible, we have 
invested in putting our operational staff 
through a recognised safety qualification 
– The Institute of Occupational Safety 
and Health (IOSH) Working Safely course. 
This, combined with our long-standing 
ambition to put supervisors and team 
leaders through IOSH’ s Managing 
Safely programme, is all part of our 
continually evolving Health and Safety 
training strategy.
As a business we recognise the benefits 
of employee involvement and believe 
listening to and engaging with the 
workforce on safety, health and welfare 
issues will significantly improve our overall 
Health and Safety performance. For this 
reason we operate a safety engagement 
program called Building Safety T ogether 
(BST). All plants have an active BST 
working group who meet regularly to 
review local safety related data and recent 
incidents as well as to discuss new 
safety ideas and initiatives. Findings and 
feedback from working groups are 
communicated to the wider workforce 
through appointed Safety Leaders.
Across the Group, 2016 saw us achieve 
our lowest ever Lost Time Incident (LTI) 
frequency rate without a single LTI taking 
place at any of our brick facilities.
* Calculated using contracted working hours and is 
stated as a figure per million working hours over a 
12 month period.
Recognition awards
2016 saw Forterra receive a number of 
safety recognition awards. Awards made 
by the British Ceramic Confederation and 
the British Precast Association saw us 
recognised in the areas of wire stressing, 
quarry safety, haulier traffic management 
and forklift truck incident reduction.
Prostate Cancer UK
As part of our ongoing Health and Safety 
strategy we are supporting Prostate 
Cancer UK, a charity which represents 
a similar demographic to a large part of 
our workforce, and which has a simple 
ambition - to stop men dying from 
prostate cancer.

Forterra plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Corporate Responsibility Overview At Forterra we understand the importance 
of sustainability and the contribution our 
company can make, both in how we 
operate our production facilities and in 
the benefits our products can bring to a 
sustainably built environment. 
As a business, we rely on effective 
management systems to ensure we are 
looking after our people, are minimising 
our effect on the environment, and making 
best use of natural resources. As well 
as providing a framework for how we 
manage our sites, these systems are 
externally audited to provide confidence 
to stakeholders that we operate to a high 
standard. Certificates for the following 
management systems are available on 
our website.
Our management systems
• ISO 9001 – Quality Management
• ISO14001 – Environmental Management
• BS OHSAS 18001 – Health and 
Safety Management
• ISO 50001 – Energy Management 
• BES 6001 – Responsible Sourcing of 
Construction Products 
These systems require us to set objectives 
and targets in order to show continual 
improvement in key areas. We have 
selected a period of 2010 – 2020 to deliver 
these objectives and targets, a summary 
is shown above. Each of our sites has 
a management programme to support 
these targets.
By applying life cycle thinking to our 
products and processes, we are working 
to reduce our environmental footprint and 
become less resource intensive. We take 
our social responsibility seriously and 
protect those people working on our sites 
to ensure they go home unharmed at the 
end of their shift. We also work with our 
local communities to ensure we are a good 
neighbour , for example, we are looking at 
quarry restoration programmes to enhance 
the areas surrounding our factories.
Our delivery fleet operates to the highest 
standards. We utilise the latest logistics 
planning software and ensure our drivers 
are aware of their ability to influence 
vehicle emissions.
Within the built environment, we provide 
products to help construct thermally 
efficient buildings that help reduce heating 
costs and provide a high level of comfort. 
We also have products to help protect 
against flooding from permeable paving 
systems, attenuating water discharge 
through to flood defence systems.
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
As a business, we collect direct and 
indirect fuel consumption data on a 
monthly basis. We use the GHG Protocol 
Corporate Accounting and Reporting 
Standard (revised edition) and the 
latest ‘Defra’ published CO
2 emissions 
conversion factors to measure our 
GHG emissions.
Scope 1 covers our direct emissions, 
including fuels and raw materials; Scope 
2 covers our indirect emissions such 
as purchased electricity. We have also 
reported emission intensity based on 
our production output (see table above). 
Emissions intensity is heavily influenced by 
product mix. During 2016, we increased 
production at two of our most carbon 
intensive plants compared to 2015, 
thus leading to a small increase in our 
intensity ratio.
Kings Dyke Nature Reserve
The award winning King’s Dyke Nature 
Reserve was established in 1995, for 
the benefit of local schools and 
residents. The reserve has been 
extended on a regular basis and now 
covers approximately 70 hectares and 
is home to a large range of wildlife. The 
reserve also supports a purpose built 
fossil hunting area which is regularly 
topped up with fossil bearing material 
from the quarry.

Equality and diversity
As a business we recognise that diversity 
helps our business to grow and succeed.
Employing over 1,500 people we are 
committed to the creation and support of 
a truly diverse working environment with 
opportunities for all. 
People are vital to the continuity, growth 
and success of our organisation and 
we are committed to applying our equal 
opportunities policy at all stages of 
recruitment and selection. Shortlisting, 
interviewing and selection will always 
be carried out without regard to gender, 
sexual orientation, marital status, race,

age, pregnancy/maternity leave or trade 
union membership. 
Should an employee become disabled 
after commencing work for Forterra, 
we will do everything we can to help 
them continue in their role. When that is 
not possible, we will support them with 
appropriate training for other suitable 
employment either within Forterra 
or elsewhere. This forms part of our 
commitment to ensuring Forterra is a 
company where discriminatory practices 
and behaviours are eliminated. 
We are committed to acting ethically and 
with integrity in all our business dealings 
and relationships and to implementing 
and enforcing effective systems and 
controls to ensure modern slavery is 
not taking place anywhere in our own 
business or within our supply chain. 
We are supporters of the Living Wage 
Foundation and pay all employees above 
the Living Wage. The charts below show 
our diversity statistics.
Employment programmes
Our industry needs a workforce for the 
future and during 2016 we introduced 
a number of schemes to help us with 
succession planning/employment for 
the future:
Apprentices 
Apprenticeships are a great way for young 
people to gain the skills they need for a 
career whilst being in paid employment. 
At Forterra our apprenticeship scheme 
covers all fields of engineering. It is a one 
year residential course set in the heart 
of Birmingham, followed by two years 
of work-based training at one of our UK 
facilities. After completing the programme 
students graduate with a NVQ Level 
3 Certificate qualification, as well as 
hands-on experience working with an 
industry leader.
Graduates
Our two year Graduate Scheme is made 
up of four six month secondments 
with a clear career path, mentoring 
and tailored projects, as well as multi-
discipline experience, from factory floor to 
management meetings.
Employee engagement
We place emphasis on communication 
and ensure that employees are well 
informed about business activities and 
also have the opportunity to communicate 
their views to management. We have 
established an employee forum and also 
undertake an annual employee survey.
Frontline to Forterra
We have teamed up with the Career 
Transition Partnership (CTP) who 
assist with the change from serving 
in the military to civilian life. The CTP 
helps serving members of the Royal 
Navy, Army, Air Force and Marines find 
resettlement support, career transition 
advice and training opportunities.
Robert joined Forterra when he  
saw the role of Mechanical Engineer 
advertised on the CTP website while 
still serving in the Army. He decided to 
apply and following a two week trial he 
was brought on board. 
“I’d spent half my life in the Army,”  
said former Royal Electrical and 
Mechanical Engineer (REME) Robert, 
44, “and served around the world, 
from Afghanistan to Bosnia to Northern 
Ireland to Kuwait, and although I’m 
based in one location now I’m still 
working in a constantly challenging 
environment and having to use a lot  
of the same skills.”
“Forterra have been great, as they saw 
that I was highly motivated and 
experienced, and recognised that the 
skills I’d learned as a REME were 
transferable to their concrete facility in 
Somercotes. I’m really enjoying 
working here, and am learning new 
skills every day.”

Corporate Responsibility Overview continued Community 
At Forterra we realise that to be a 
successful business, community 
involvement is essential. It is important 
to us that we have a positive social, 
environmental and economic impact 
on the neighbourhoods we work 
in. By understanding local issues 
and needs, we can contribute to 
engaged communities. 
In 2016 we supported in excess of 30 
different causes, primarily focusing on local 
charities where the effect of donations is 
much more significant and visible.
We regularly engage with local educational 
facilities by supplying product to colleges to 
encourage the next generation of builders, 
and during the year we donated tens of 
thousands of bricks to SkillBuild, a national 
bricklaying competition organised by The 
Construction Industry T raining Board.
A new initiative was our support of 
Northamptonshire’ s Community Safety 
Partnership. By providing a heavy goods 
vehicle and support staff we were able 
to help teach local children about the 
dangers of large vehicles, such as blind 
spots and stopping distances. 
We have also worked with the local 
emergency services in Cambridgeshire to 
supply safety signage near our quarries. 
Similarly, we have installed community 
signs near many of our sites to highlight 
the presence of defibrillators.
Our staff are also supported and 
encouraged in their fundraising activities, 
with access to both a community fund 
and charity match scheme.
Must Farm 
This joint Forterra and Historic England 
project was undertaken by the 
Cambridge Archaeological Unit and 
gave rise to international acclaim. The 
dig captured media headlines around 
the world, after revealing a 3,000 year 
old Bronze Age settlement, dubbed the 
‘British Pompeii’ .
The team of archaeologists uncovered 
the best-preserved Bronze Age 
settlement ever excavated in Britain 
which was destroyed by a major fire 
that caused the dwellings to collapse 
into a river, preserving their contents in 
amazing detail. Forterra made a large 
financial commitment to support this 
important scientific work, and the 
results have been of huge historic 
importance.

Strategic Report Financial Statements Shareholder Information Governance Viability statement
In accordance with provision C2.2 of the 2014 revision of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Directors have conducted a review 
and assessed the prospects and viability of the Group.
Although the Directors have no reason to believe that the Group will not be viable over a longer period, the Board has chosen to 
conduct this review for a period of three years. The Group believes that this is an appropriate time frame as it aligns with the Group’ s 
strategic and financial planning horizon.
The Directors have taken account of financial forecasts for the three year period following the balance sheet date, comparing future 
funding requirements with committed external borrowing facilities. The Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group will continue in operation, meet liabilities as they fall due and will not breach covenants in this period. 
In support of the viability statement that the Directors make, the Directors have stress tested the three year financial forecasts by 
assessing the potential impact that the principal risks facing the Group could have on these financial forecasts. This assessment 
reflected the Directors judgement as to the net potential financial impact of these risks and the likelihood of principal risks occurring.
Identifying and prioritising  
our key risks
The Board recognise that successful risk management is 
essential to meeting the Group’s strategic priorities and 
aligning the Group’s interests with those of our shareholders 
Where we are What we’ve achieved this year Priorities for 2017
Establishing Audit and Risk 
Committees, influencing the Group's 
operations, determining risk appetite 
and establishing priorities.
The Board has set-out the terms of reference  
of the Audit and Risk Committees and appointed 
members. Both Committees met in 2016, set 
the tone for Group risk and audit strategies and 
oversaw activities undertaken to date.
The Group will continue to focus on developing  
its internal control environment, reducing exposure 
to risk in key risk areas and giving the right level  
of focus to health, safety and environment.
Formalising the Group's risk 
assessment and monitoring 
methodology and embedding risk 
management into the organisational 
culture.
The Group has developed a key risk register and 
is tracking risks identified whilst also monitoring 
emerging risks. The Risk Committee has reviewed 
the key risks identified, the potential impact on 
KPIs and the mitigating actions that are being 
taken.
The Group will continue to regularly review key 
risks, assess risk exposure and monitor how risks 
evolve. Risk owners will be a crucial part of this 
process, continuing to provide the bottom-up and 
top-down assessments of all risks. 
Establishing an internal audit function. The Group has appointed a Head of Internal Audit 
to direct the work of a co-sourced internal audit 
partner. PwC have been appointed in this role 
following a comprehensive selection process. 
An initial 18 month internal audit plan has been 
developed and implementation of the plan has 
commenced.
The Group is tracking actions in response to 
the internal audit recommendations, scoping 
additional audits where emerging risk is identified 
and planning for the further audits scheduled in the  
internal audit plan.
Tracking internal control activities 
through a self-assessment reporting 
process.
The Group is developing and rolling-out internal 
control self-assessments across all business 
locations and the majority of functions. Internal 
control issues have been challenged and 
procedural improvements have been made in 
response, where necessary. 
The Group is tracking effectiveness and 
completeness of internal control self-assessments 
in a number of areas and progressing with the 
development of self-assessments for functions not 
yet covered.
Developing our risk management process
The table below summarises the early steps being taken on the Group’ s risk management journey.

management and internal control, has identified the key  
risks and uncertainties currently faced by the Group
Key risks and uncertainties
The table below summarises the Group’ s key risks and uncertainties (not listed in order of priority) and how we respond to them.
Risk: Potential impact on KPIs: How we respond: Link to strategy
Economic 
conditions
The Group’s business could be 
adversely affected by general 
economic and global financial 
market conditions. Demand for 
the Group’s products is closely 
correlated with residential and 
commercial construction activities 
which are influenced by these 
conditions.
The Group reviews and monitors business 
performance, market data and industry forecasts 
in detail on an ongoing basis. The Group has built 
a strong track record of reducing costs rapidly and 
flexing the utilisation of capacity in the event of a 
downturn, whilst continuing to manage assets and 
human resources to take advantage of increases in 
demand.
The broad range of products provided by the Group 
through different distribution channels and the 
strong customer relationships built up over many 
years also provide some resilience.
1
 
2
Government action 
and policy
The general level of residential 
and other construction activity 
is partly dependent on the 
UK Government’s policies to 
encourage housebuilding initiatives 
and investment in public housing. 
Changes to government policy 
or planning regulations could 
adversely affect the Group’s 
business.
The Group participates in trade associations and 
attends events to monitor and influence changes 
in government policy. It also maintains a model of 
future demand for its products using independent 
forecasts of activity so as to anticipate future 
changes.
1
 
2
Customer 
relationships and 
reputation
The Group receives a significant 
portion of its revenue from key 
customers. Should a customer 
relationship deteriorate there is  
a risk to revenue and cash flow.
The Group has long-standing relationships with 
major customers and maintains these through 
an ongoing commitment to quality, service and 
having an appropriate product offering. Some of the 
Group’s leading customers are builders’ merchants 
which represent a distribution channel into 
thousands of end users. The Group is also taking 
positive steps towards broadening the customer 
base through reorganisation and refocusing of the 
sales team.

Cost and availability  
of raw material
Availability of raw materials can 
vary at times and where shortages 
exist the Group is susceptible to 
significant increases in the price 
of raw materials, utilities, fuel and 
haulage which poses a threat to 
operational efficiency, capacity 
and financial performance and 
position.
The Group’s production plans are developed 
collaboratively by Operations and Commercial 
teams to facilitate effective stock management and 
procurement processes. The Group has taken a 
range of positive steps to ensure a more consistent 
supply of certain key raw materials, consistently 
seeks to develop supplier relationships and forward 
purchases certain supplies where possible.

Key Risks and Uncertainties Risk: Potential impact on KPIs: How we respond: Link to strategy
Business disruption
Material disruption at one of the 
Group’s facilities or quarries could 
prevent the Group from meeting 
customer demand. 
The Group’s production plans are developed to 
maintain a sufficient buffer level of key products 
and a proactive maintenance regime is followed to 
minimise the risk of breakdown. 
1
 
3
 
4
IT infrastructure  
and systems
Disruption or interruption to the 
IT and communications systems 
could have a material adverse 
impact on performance and 
position.
The Group is making an investment in IT through 
upgrading a number of its financial platforms and 
interfacing systems that are currently disparate. It 
is also using external service providers to access 
specific IT expertise and developing a cyber strategy 
based on the results of penetration testing. Existing 
disaster recovery plans are being reformulated and 
tested on an ongoing basis.
3
 
4
Business continuity
Group performance is dependent 
on a number of key centralised 
functions operating continuously. 
Should these centralised functions 
fail, there is a risk that product 
cannot be delivered to customers 
to meet demand, which could 
have a material adverse impact 
on performance and position. 
The Group has developed a business continuity 
plan through 2016 and early 2017 to address threats 
to the centralised customer service, IT and finance 
functions. The Group will continue this work through 
2017 , focusing on threats to business continuity at 
specific operational facilities.

3
Health and Safety 
Group employees work in 
manufacturing environments 
where heavy machinery and 
moving parts are present. There 
is a risk of injury which the Group 
takes very seriously. Lost Time 
Incident frequency rate is a critical 
KPI that is monitored at all levels in 
the business on an ongoing basis.
The Group has a well-established approach to 
Health, Safety and Environment and a strategy 
which is aligned to the Health and Safety Executive's 
'Helping Great Britain work well' initiative. The 
Group targets a working environment that is 
free of accidents and ill health and has a robust 
policy covering expected levels of performance, 
responsibilities, communications, controls, reporting, 
monitoring and review. The Group promotes a 
number of ongoing initiatives to highlight hazards, 
promote best practice and undertake on-the-spot 
risk assessments.

People training and 
development
The Group recognises that its 
greatest asset is its workforce 
and a failure to attract, retain and 
develop talent will be detrimental 
to Group performance.
The Group has reviewed key activities and the 
people undertaking these activities to determine 
where key person dependencies and skills gaps 
exist. Following these reviews the Group has started 
to develop succession, talent acquisition, retention 
and training and development plans.

Product quality
Failure or perceived failure of 
Group products could lead 
to a range of claims related to 
product defects. Such claims 
could have a detrimental effect on 
Group performance, reputation 
and existing relationships with 
customers.
The Group has comprehensive quality control 
processes across all products and sites, and reports 
quality control findings and monitors progress at an 
executive level regularly.

Financial risk 
management
The Group’s activities and financial 
arrangements create exposure to 
a number of financial risks which 
could impact Group performance 
and position. Foreign exchange 
risk exists on foreign currency 
purchases, credit risk exists 
as customers may not be able 
to settle amounts owing to the 
Group, liquidity risk could result in 
the Group not being able to meet 
obligations as they fall due and 
interest rate risk could result in 
increased finance costs. 
The Group closely manages financial risks and takes 
steps to reduce risks where necessary. 
Foreign exchange risk: Large foreign currency 
purchases are managed by the Group Treasury 
function. Foreign exchange forward contracts and 
options are arranged with terms timed to match the 
settlement of obligations to mitigate this risk. 
Credit risk: The Group Credit Control function 
manage the risk of customer default and apply 
appropriate credit limits to mitigate credit risk.
Liquidity risk: The Group manages daily cash flow 
and forecasts daily requirements over the Group 
working capital cycle to mitigate liquidity risk. The 
cash-generative operations of the Group and 
committed facilities are sufficient to mitigate liquidity 
risk for the foreseeable future.
Interest rate risk: The Group monitors interest rate 
risk on an ongoing basis and reviews options to 
hedge part of the variable rate risk.
3
Environmental 
issues
Some of the Group’s activities have 
an impact on the environment 
and where this impact is not 
managed appropriately there is a 
risk to the reputation, position and 
performance of the Group.
The Group strives to minimise the impact that 
its activities have on the environment and takes 
particular pride in land restoration and waste 
reduction initiatives. The Group Land and Minerals, 
Environment and Finance departments manage 
activities to ensure that operations are permitted, 
sympathetic to the environment and future liabilities 
are provided for appropriately.

Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Our Operating Board Dear Shareholder
This has been an exciting and challenging 
year as we moved from private to 
public ownership following the IPO in 
April 2016. The Corporate Governance 
Statement, together with the reports 
of the Remuneration, Nomination, 
Audit and Risk Committees on pages 
46 to 69 describe how Forterra has 
implemented a corporate governance 
framework appropriate to that of a 
listed company and explains how we 
have applied the principles of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code 2014 
issued by the Financial Reporting Council 
(the Code) and the Disclosure Guidance 
and Transparency Rules of the Financial 
Conduct Authority handbook (DTR) since 
our admission to trading on the London 
Stock Exchange. 
Compliance with the Code
The purpose of the Code is to facilitate 
effective, entrepreneurial and prudent 
management that can deliver the long-
term success of the Company. The main 
principals of the Code set out standards 
of practice for the Board in relation to 
leadership, effectiveness, accountability, 
remuneration and its relationship 
with shareholders.
Certain provisions of the Code do not 
apply to smaller companies defined as 
those, like Forterra, outside of the FTSE 
350. The Board is committed to achieving 
the highest standards of corporate 
governance and it is our intention to 
be fully compliant with the Code within 
a reasonable time frame. This report 
highlights not only where the Company 
is not fully compliant with the Code as 
applicable to smaller companies but also, 
consistent with the Board’ s commitment 
to achieve full compliance with the Code, 
identifies the further areas where, at 
present, the Company falls short of full 
compliance with the Code as it applies to 
large companies.
The Company has complied with the 
Code applicable to smaller companies 
for the part of the year since listing with 
the following exceptions detailed on the 
following page. It should be noted that as 
the Company listed part the way through 
the year it would not be practical to have 
met certain requirements which the Code 
stipulates should take place annually. 
The Board is committed 
to achieving the 
highest standards of 
corporate governance 
and following the IPO 
we have already made 
significant progress in 
adopting an appropriate 
listed company 
governance regime.”

provision Description Comments
C.2.3
The Board should monitor 
the Company’s risk 
management and internal 
control systems and at least 
annually carry out a review of 
their effectiveness and report 
on that review in the annual 
report. The monitoring and 
review should cover all 
material controls including 
financial, operational and 
compliance controls.
Immediately prior to Admission the Board approved a detailed Financial Position and Prospects (FPP) 
report. This report contained a detailed review and appraisal of the Group's governance structure, controls 
and procedures such that the Directors can be confident a reasonable basis exists to allow them to make 
proper judgements on an ongoing basis as to the financial position and prospects of the Group.
The Board have responded to a number of suggested improvements to the Group’s risk management and 
internal control systems and has made immediate improvements where necessary and will seek to make 
further enhancements moving forward. 
The Risk Management section of the Annual Report on page 34 highlights the principal risks faced by the 
Group along with the key mitigating controls. The Audit and Risk Committees will monitor these controls 
throughout the year and will report to the Board on their effectiveness.
As the Company has been listed for less than a year it is not practicable to have complied with all of the 
Code’s recommendations in respect of tasks which should be undertaken on an annual basis. In this 
instance, significant enhancements were made to the Group’s risk management and internal control 
systems before and subsequent to Admission and as such it is too soon to undertake a meaningful 
review of their effectiveness. Therefore, the Board did not conduct a formal review of the Group’s 
risk management and internal control systems in 2016 and as such was not fully compliant with the 
recommendations of the Code in this respect. 
Action taken to achieve compliance
The Board, assisted by the Audit and Risk Committees, intends to conduct a formal review of the 
Company’s risk management and internal control systems in accordance with the FRC’s guidance on Risk 
Management, Internal Control and Related Finance and Business Reporting during 2017 .
D.2.1
The Company Chairman 
may be a member of but 
not chair the Remuneration 
Committee.
The Remuneration Committee is currently chaired by the Chairman of the Board, Paul Lester. The Board 
considers that Paul Lester currently has the necessary experience and skill to chair the Committee. The 
Committee also includes two experienced independent Non-Executive Directors. 
Action taken to achieve compliance
It is the intention of the Board to comply with this provision along with the recommendation that the 
Remuneration Committee comprises at least three independent Directors within a reasonable time 
frame. A key requirement specified in the criteria for the selection of additional Independent Non-
Executive Directors is for the appropriate skills and experience to serve upon and chair the Remuneration 
Committee. As a small company the Code recommends that the Remuneration Committee comprises two 
independent Directors hence in this respect the Company is currently compliant.
In addition, the Board has identified the following areas where the Company is compliant with the requirements of the Code applicable 
to smaller companies but is not compliant with full requirements of the Code applicable to companies within the FTSE 350. The Code 
encourages smaller companies to comply with the Code in full although it is not mandatory . The Board is committed to implementing the 
highest standards of corporate governance and has committed to achieving full compliance with the Code within a reasonable time frame.

On Admission and at the year end the Board comprised seven Directors including the Chairman who 
was considered independent on appointment, two Independent Non-Executive Directors and two Non-
Executive Directors who are not considered to be independent for the purposes of the Code by virtue of 
their appointment to the Board by Lone Star Funds.
Actions taken to achieve compliance 
As explained in the report of the Nomination Committee a search and selection process has been 
initiated to identify suitable Independent Non-Executive Directors for future appointment to the Board. 
C.3.1
The Board should establish

Corporate Governance Statement continued Share dealing code
The Company has adopted, with effect 
from Admission, a code of securities 
dealings in relation to the ordinary shares 
which is based on, and is at least as 
rigorous as, the Model Code as previously 
published in the Listing Rules. The code 
adopted will apply to the Directors and 
other relevant employees of the Group.
The Board
The Board has overall responsibility for the 
management of the Company in order to 
maximise shareholder value. The Board 
sets the Company’ s strategic aims and 
ensures that the necessary financial 
and human resources are in place for 
the Company to meet its objectives. 
It is the role of the Board to ensure the 
operation of a framework of operational, 
financial and regulatory internal controls 
which enables risk to be assessed 
and managed.
Summary of matters reserved  
for the Board
The Board has a formal schedule of 
matters reserved for its decision which is 
summarised below. This document was 
approved by the Board on 11 April 2016. 
• Approval of the Group’ s long-term 
objectives and commercial strategy;
• Approval of the Group’ s business plans, 
operating and capital budgets;
• Approval of the annual and half 
year accounts;
• Changes in the Group’ s capital or

T o assist in discharging its responsibilities 
the Board is supported by specialist 
Committees established by the Board in 
compliance with the Code. The Board 
has established four Committees, an 
Audit Committee, a Risk Committee, 
a Remuneration Committee and a 
Nomination Committee. The terms of 
reference of each of these Committees 
was approved by the Board on 11 April 
2016. The Board believes each of the 
Committees has the necessary skills 
and resources to fulfil its brief and 
each of the Committees has access to 
appropriate legal and professional advice 
where necessary. 
The Audit Committee report on pages 46 
to 49 outlines how the Board has applied 
the Code in respect of financial reporting 
and internal controls. The Risk Committee 
report on page 51 explains how the 
Board has applied the Code in respect 
of risk management. The Nomination 
Committee report on page 50 outlines the 
Board’ s approach to Board development. 
The Remuneration Committee report on 
pages 52 to 69 provides comprehensive 
detail of the Remuneration Policy to 
be voted upon at the Annual General 
Meeting along with details of the Directors' 
remuneration received in the year. 
Day to day management and 
implementation of strategies approved 
by the Board is delegated to the 
Operating Board which comprises six 
senior managers including two Executive 
Directors. Membership of the Operating 
Board along with biographies are outlined 
on pages 40.
Division of responsibilities 
There is a clear division of responsibilities 
between the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive Officer. 
The Code recommends that a UK listed 
company’ s chairman be independent 
on appointment. The Board considers 
that the Chairman, Paul Lester, 
was independent on appointment. 
The Chairman’ s role is to ensure good 
corporate governance. His responsibilities 
include leading the Board, ensuring the 
effectiveness of the Board in all aspects of 
its role, ensuring effective communication 
with shareholders, setting the Board’ s 
agenda and ensuring that all Directors 
are encouraged to participate fully in the 
activities and decision-making process of 
the Board. 
Stephen Harrison, the Chief Executive 
Officer, assisted by senior management is 
responsible for the day-to-day operational 
and commercial management of the 
Group including the implementation 
of strategies and policies approved by 
the Board. 
Senior Independent Director 
The Code also recommends that 
the Board should appoint one of the 
independent Non-Executive Directors as 
the Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director and Justin Atkinson has been 
appointed to fulfil this role. The Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director is 
available to shareholders if they wish to 
discuss the governance of the Company 
or any other matter and Justin Atkinson 
met with a number of major shareholders 
in this capacity in early 2017.

Strategic Report Financial Statements Shareholder Information Governance Re-election of Directors
The Company’ s Articles of Association 
contain certain powers of removal, 
appointment, election and re-election of 
Directors and provide that each Director 
should retire at the Annual General 
Meeting if they had been a Director at 
each of the two preceding Annual General 
Meetings and was not reappointed by 
the Company in general meeting at or 
since such meeting. A retiring Director 
shall be eligible for reappointment. 
In practice it is intended that all Executive 
and Non-Executive Directors will retire 
and put themselves forward for re-
election annually at each Annual General 
Meeting and as such all Directors will 
stand for re-election at the 2017 Annual 
General Meeting. 
On appointment, Board members, 
in particular the Chairman and Non-
Executive Directors, disclose their other 
commitments and agree to allocate 
sufficient time as necessary to the 
Company in order to discharge their 
duties effectively. The current external 
commitments of the Board are shown on 
pages 38 and 39. Any conflicts of interest 
are dealt with in accordance with the 
Board’ s conflict procedures. 
Board evaluation 
As the Company listed relatively recently 
and as explained in the compliance 
statement, a formal Board evaluation 
process as required by the Code has 
not been carried out in the year under 
review. The Board intends to carry out 
a full internal review of its effectiveness 
along with that of its Committees during 
2017. It is the intention of the Board that 
an independent evaluation of the Board 
and its Committees will be carried out 
at an appropriate time and in any case 
within three years as recommended by 
the Code. 
Conflicts of interest
Directors have a statutory duty to avoid 
situations in which they may have interests 
which conflict with those of the Company. 
The Board has adopted procedures 
as provided for in the Company’ s 
Articles of Association for authorising 
existing conflicts of interest and for the 
consideration of, and if appropriate, 
authorisation of new situations which 
may arise. The Company maintains 
a conflict register to be reviewed by 
the Nomination Committee at least 
annually. Currently the only situations 
authorised and listed on the register are 
the Directors holding Directorships and 
other similar appointments in companies 
or organisations not connected with the 
Company where no conflict of interest has 
been identified.
Directors' and Officers' insurance
The Company maintains Directors’ and 
Officers’ liability insurance policies to cover 
against legal proceedings taken against 
its Directors and Officers acting in their 
capacity as such. The Group has also 
granted indemnities to its Directors to the 
extent permitted by the law in respect 
of liabilities incurred as a result of their 
office. Neither the insurance cover or the 
indemnities would provide any coverage in 
the event that a Director is proven to have 
acted fraudulently or dishonestly. 
Shareholder engagement
The Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer meet regularly with major 
shareholders and work together with the 
joint Brokers to ensure there is effective 
communication with shareholders 
on matters such as governance and 
strategy. As part of the Group’ s investor 
relations programme, meetings with major 
shareholders are scheduled to discuss 
the Group’ s interim and full year results. 
The Chairman is available to meet major 
shareholders on request, and the Senior 
Independent Director recently met with a 
number of major shareholders. 
Relationship agreement 
For as long as Lone Star Funds qualifies 
as a 'controlling shareholder' according to 
the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct 
Authority (LR 6.1.2A) the Company is 
required to have in place a written legally 
binding agreement which is intended to 
ensure that Lone Star Funds complies 
with the independence provisions set out 
in LR 6.1.4D.
On 21 April 2016, the Company and the 
controlling shareholder, LSF9 Concrete 
UK Limited, a company under the control 
of Lone Star Funds, entered into a 
relationship agreement (the 'Relationship 
Agreement') which regulates the ongoing 
relationship between the Company 
and the controlling shareholder and its 
associates. For the purposes of the 
Relationship Agreement, the associates 
of the controlling shareholder are certain 
subsidiaries of Forterra Inc, a Company 
listed on the NASDAQ exchange, in which 
Lone Star Funds also hold a controlling 
shareholding. On 26 May 2016 LSF9 
Concrete UK Limited transferred its 
shareholding in the Company to another 
company, LSF9 Concrete II Limited also 
under the control of Lone Star Funds 
and on this date a new relationship 
agreement was entered into with this 
company on identical terms as the initial 
Relationship Agreement. 
The principal purpose of the Relationship 
Agreement is to ensure that the Company 
can carry on an independent business 
as its main activity. The Relationship 
Agreement contains, among other 
things, undertakings from the controlling 
shareholder that:
 (a)  the Company and each 
other member of the Group 
shall operate on a basis that 
is independent from the 
controlling shareholder and 
its associates and neither the 
controlling shareholder nor any 
of its associates shall materially 
influence the day-to-day running 
of the Company or any other 
member of the Group at an 
operational level; and
 (b)  all transactions and arrangements 
between any member of the 
Group and the controlling 
shareholder or any of its 
associates shall be conducted 
in accordance with the Listing 
Rules and will be conducted 
at arm’ s length and on normal 
commercial terms.

Forterra plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Corporate Governance Statement continued Pursuant to the Relationship Agreement, 
Lone Star Funds is able to appoint: 
 (a)  two Non-Executive Directors to 
the Board for so long as it and its 
associates are entitled to exercise 
or to control the exercise of 20% 
or more of the votes able to be 
cast on all or substantially all 
matters at general meetings of the 
Company; and
 (b)  one Non-Executive Director to 
the Board for so long as it and its 
associates are entitled to exercise 
or to control the exercise of 10% 
or more of the votes able to be 
cast on all or substantially all 
matters at general meetings of 
the Company.
Bradley Boggess and Richard Cammerer 
Jr. were appointed to the Board by Lone 
Star Funds pursuant to the terms of the 
Relationship Agreement. For so long as 
Lone Star Funds and its associates are 
entitled to exercise, or control the exercise 
of, 10% or more of the votes able to be 
cast on all or substantially all matters at 
general meetings of the Company, Lone 
Star Funds is also entitled to appoint one 
member of the Nomination Committee 
and appoint one Lone Star Director as 
an observer to meetings of the Audit 
Committee, the Remuneration Committee 
and the Risk Committee. Under the 
Relationship Agreement, Lone Star Funds 
and its affiliates may engage or hold an 
interest in investments, business ventures 
or other entities similar to, or that compete 
with, the business of any member of the 
Group. The Relationship Agreement will 
continue for so long as (a) the ordinary 
shares are listed on the premium listing 
segment of the Official List and traded 
on the London Stock Exchange’ s main 
market for listed securities and (b) Lone 
Star Funds together with its associates 
are entitled to exercise or to control the 
exercise of 10% or more of the votes able 
to be cast on all or substantially all matters 
at general meetings of the Company.
The Directors believe that the terms 
of the Relationship Agreement 
will enable the Group to carry on 
its business independently of the 
controlling shareholder. 
Board meetings
In a full year it is the intention for the Board 
to meet on at least eight occasions. 
The Directors regularly communicate and 
exchange information regardless of the 
timing of meetings and should the need 
arise a meeting of the Directors can be 
convened at short notice. 
There were seven Board meetings held 
in the period between Admission and 
the year end. In addition, there were 
three meetings of the Audit Committee, 
three meetings of the Remuneration 
Committee, a single meeting of the 
Nomination Committee and a single 
meeting of the Risk Committee. 
Although a formal evaluation of Board 
performance will be undertaken in 
2017, during the year under review, the 
Non-Executive Directors met without the 
Executive Directors being present and, in 
addition, the Senior Independent Director 
chaired a meeting without the Chairman 
being present. 
The Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial 
Officer and external auditor are often 
invited to the Audit Committee meetings 
although the Committee also regularly 
meets with the external auditor without 
the presence of the Executive Directors. 
The table below only includes attendance 
where each Director attended as a 
member rather than as an invitee or 
an observer. 
The Company Secretary is also Secretary 
to each of the Board Committees and 
attends meetings in this capacity.

Strategic Report Financial Statements Shareholder Information Governance Dear Shareholder
Introduction 
I am pleased to present Forterra’ s first 
report to you since Admission to the 
London Stock Exchange in April 2016. 
The role of the Audit Committee (the 
Committee) is to protect the interests of 
shareholders by ensuring the integrity of 
the Group’ s financial reporting and by 
monitoring the ongoing effectiveness 
of the Group’ s internal controls. 
The Committee provides independent 
monitoring, guidance and challenge to 
management in these areas. Although the 
Committee was only established shortly 
ahead of the IPO, the Group has 
initiated measures towards establishing 
a best practice control environment 
and governance structure. The report 
below explains how the Committee 
has discharged its responsibilities since 
the IPO.
Responsibilities and terms of 
reference 
On 26 April 2016 Forterra plc was 
admitted to trading on the main market of 
the London Stock Exchange. The terms 
of reference of the Audit Committee were 
approved by the Board and became 
effective on 11 April 2016. 
The principal responsibilities of the 
Committee are to: 
• monitor the integrity of the Financial 
Statements, half year report, and 
any other announcements relating 
to the Group’ s financial performance 
or position and to assess whether 
management has made appropriate 
estimates and judgements;
• review and challenge where necessary 
the consistency of and any changes to 
significant accounting policies;
• keep under review the adequacy 
and effectiveness of the Group’ s 
financial internal control and risk 
management systems;
• evaluate the effectiveness of the 
Group’ s Internal Audit function;
• review the effectiveness and 
independence of the external auditors, 
negotiate and agree their remuneration 
and to make recommendations to the 
Board in respect of their appointment; 
and
• monitor the effectiveness of the 
Group’ s procedures on whistle blowing, 
anti-bribery and corruption and anti-
money laundering.
The Audit Committee’ s full terms 
of reference are available on the 
Company's website.
Membership
From Admission to the date of this report 
the membership of the Committee 
comprised Divya Seshamani and Justin 
Atkinson. It is the intention that as further 
Independent Non-Executive Directors 
are appointed to the Board at least one 
additional appointment to the Audit 
Committee will be made. 
The Board considers that the members 
of the Committee have the appropriate 
competence and financial and industry 
experience necessary to fulfil their duties. 
Prior to his appointment to the Board, 
Justin Atkinson previously spent 25 
years at Keller Group plc, the FTSE 250 
Ground Engineering Company, latterly as 
Chief Executive Officer and prior to that 
as Chief Financial Officer. Justin is also a 
Non-Executive Director and member of 
the Audit Committee at Kier Group plc 
and a Non-Executive Director of Sirius 
Real Estate Limited as well as being 
a member of the Audit Committee of 
the National Trust. Justin is a qualified 
Chartered Accountant.
During the year the 
Committee oversaw the 
establishment of the 
Group's Internal Audit 
function.”

Audit Committee Report Summary of activity during 2016
Following Admission in April 2016 the 
Committee formally met three times in 
2016. In addition to the members of the 
Committee, other members of the Board 
including the Chief Financial Officer, the 
Head of Internal Audit, representatives 
from co-sourced internal audit service 
provider PwC and the external auditor 
from Ernst & Young may attend the 
meetings by invitation. The external 
auditor was invited to and attended 
each meeting of the Committee in 
2016. The Company Secretary provides 
secretarial services to the Committee and 
attends meetings in this capacity. 
During this period the Committee oversaw 
the following: 
• consideration of the letter to those 
charged with governance prepared by 
Ernst & Young following the audit of the 
2015 Financial Statements;
• establishment of the Internal 
Audit function and, following a 
comprehensive selection process, the 
appointment of PwC to provide internal 
audit services on a co-sourced basis;
• setting of the internal audit programme;
• review of the Group’ s first half year 
interim statement published on 
7 September 2016;
• appointment of a new external audit 
partner following the rotation of 
the incumbent;
• establishing a policy on the use of the 
external auditor for non-audit services; 
and
• consideration of Ernst & Young’ s 2016 
audit plan and the agreement of the 
audit fee.
Significant financial reporting risks 
and judgement areas considered 
The following judgement areas and 
critical estimates were considered by the 
Committee in the review and approval of 
the 2016 Financial Statements:
• Accounting and tax treatment of IPO 
and separation costs
The Company incurred significant 
costs relating to the IPO which have 
been presented as exceptional items. 
Costs associated with the separation of 
back office services following the sale of 
the business by HeidelbergCement AG 
in 2015 and on separation from Forterra 
Inc in 2016 were also incurred during 
the year. Further information regarding 
these costs can be found in note 9 of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements on 
page 95. The Committee has scrutinised 
and approved management’ s treatment of 
these costs. 
• Share-based payments
Following Admission, the Company 
launched a number of share based 
reward schemes – further details of these 
schemes are contained within note 28 of 
the Consolidated Financial Statements 
on page 105. External advice was sought 
both in the initial design of the schemes 
and also in respect of the accounting 
judgements made regarding the 
outcome of performance targets, share 
performance and lapse rates. 
• Discounting of future obligations
The Group has long-term obligations for 
the restoration and decommissioning 
of its facilities at the end of their useful 
economic life. Following the outcome 
of the referendum on the UK’ s 
membership of the European Union 
there has been significant volatility in 
gilt yields which the Company uses 
to determine an appropriate discount 
rate. The Committee has reviewed and 
approved management’ s approach 
in determining a suitable long-term 
discount rate. 
• Revenue recognition, specifically 
accounting for sales rebates
The Group has a number of contracts with 
its customers which contain volume driven 
rebate mechanisms. Management are 
required to make judgements regarding 
the expected rebate achievement and 
make appropriate allowance for these 
uncertain liabilities in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. The Committee 
have reviewed the Group’ s policies and 
procedures covering the recognition 
of revenue and the recording of rebate 
obligations and is satisfied that the 
balances as at 31 December 2016 are 
appropriately recorded. 
• Inventory valuation and provisioning 
The Committee has critically reviewed 
the Group’ s valuation of its finished 
goods inventory including the level of 
provisions recognised against potential 
obsolescence. This review was informed 
by recent trading trends and expectations 
for the coming year. In addition, the 
external auditor presented the results 
of its audit testing on inventory to the 
Committee. Also, during the year, 
the Internal Audit function undertook 
a detailed review of the processes 
and controls around inventories. 
This allowed the Committee to concur 
with management’ s assessment that the 
carrying value of the Group’ s inventories is 
appropriately stated. 
After reviewing management reports 
and consulting where necessary with 
the external auditor the Committee is 
satisfied that the estimates adopted and 
the accounting treatments applied in the 
preparation of the Financial Statements 
are appropriate.

Strategic Report Financial Statements Shareholder Information Governance Risk management and 
internal controls
The Audit Committee is focused 
upon financial risks and controls. 
Operational risk management is contained 
within the terms of reference of the Risk 
Committee. The Audit Committee and the 
Risk Committee work closely together and 
the members of the Audit Committee also 
serve on the Risk Committee. In addition, 
key members of the Internal Audit function 
may by invitation also attend the meetings 
of the Risk Committee. 
One of the first tasks undertaken by 
the Committee was to oversee the 
establishment of an internal audit 
function. Whilst under the previous 
ownership of both Hanson plc and 
then HeidelbergCement AG the 
business had fallen under the auspices 
of the internal audit functions of these 
larger organisations. On leaving the 
HeidelbergCement Group in March 
2015 the Group did not have an internal 
audit function. The Internal Audit function 
was established in the summer of 
2016. The Committee evaluated several 
different models of internal audit provision 
from a fully internalised model to a 
fully outsourced solution. High quality 
proposals were received from a number 
of leading audit and assurance firms. 
Ultimately it was decided to progress 
with a co-sourced model. A Head of 
Internal Audit was appointed and PwC 
have been engaged to provide internal 
audit services under the direction of 
the Head of Internal Audit. The Head of 
Internal Audit functionally reports to the 
Audit Committee, and PwC also has 
this direct line of contact should it be 
necessary. The Committee feels that this 
model combines strong internal business 
knowledge and understanding with a wide 
pool of external experience and specialist 
skill sets to deliver the most effective and 
responsive solution possible. 
The Internal Audit function exists to 
provide the Board and management 
with independent assurance that internal 
controls and risk management processes 
are both appropriate and operating 
effectively. The Committee have agreed 
an initial internal audit programme 
covering an 18 month time frame. 
The audit programme has been designed 
to prioritise review of key financial 
processes and operating units based on 
an assessment of inherent risk and an 
assessment of the control environment 
in place. Findings from internal audits 
and recommended improvements are 
reported to the Audit Committee in a 
timely manner. 
The Chairman of the Audit Committee 
regularly meets with the Head of Internal 
Audit. Other members of the Committee 
and the Board will also meet with the 
Head of Internal Audit on a periodic basis. 
Fair, balanced and understandable
At the request of the Board the Audit 
Committee has considered whether the 
2016 Annual Report is fair, balanced 
and understandable and whether it 
provides the necessary information for 
the Group’ s shareholders to assess the 
Group’ s performance, business model 
and strategy.
Shortly before the publication of the 
full year financial results for 2016 the 
Committee undertook a detailed review of 
the Viability Statement and recommended 
to the Board that the Directors can 
justifiably state that they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company 
will be able to continue in operation 
and meet its liabilities over a three year 
assessment period. 
External audit, auditor 
independence and objectivity
The Committee is responsible for making 
recommendations to the Board regarding 
the appointment, reappointment and 
removal of the external auditor. It keeps 
under review the scope of the audit, 
the audit findings, its cost effectiveness 
and the independence and objectivity 
of the auditor. The Company appointed 
Ernst & Young LLP as auditor upon 
incorporation in January 2016. Ernst 
& Young had previously been auditor 
to the Group and its predecessor 
entities whilst under the ownership of 
HeidelbergCement AG and prior to that 
Hanson plc. Following Admission in April 
2016 the Ernst & Young partner who 
had been responsible for Forterra and its 
predecessor entities for a period of almost 
seven years informed the Committee 
that in accordance with Ernst & Young’ s 
internal policies it was now appropriate for 
him to rotate. The Committee has since 
supervised the selection and appointment 
of a replacement partner with appropriate 
industry experience. 
The Company has complied with the 
Competition and Markets Authority 
final order on mandatory tendering and 
the requirements of the Audit Directive 
(2014/56/EU). It is the Group’ s intention to 
put the audit out to tender at least once 
every 10 years. 
The Committee receives the formal 
letter addressed to those charged with 
governance provided by the external 
auditors on completion of the annual audit 
which summarises the key findings and 
observations arising from the audit along 
with how management have responded 
to these findings. In addition, the external 
auditors provide confidential feedback 
to the Committee as to how members 
of the finance team have conducted 
themselves during the audit process. 
Also, the Chairman of the Committee has 
met with the audit partner outside of the 
formal committee meetings and intends 
to continue doing so on a regular basis 
going forward.

Forterra plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Audit Committee Report continued Non-audit services policy
In response to the Ethical Standard 
for Auditors, issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council on 17 June 2016 
which limits the amount listed entities may 
pay their auditors for non-audit services 
to 70% of the average statutory audit 
fee over a three year period, the Audit 
Committee considered and approved 
a policy for auditor independence and 
the provision of non-audit services. 
The policy provides details of permitted, 
prohibited and audit related services 
and requires Audit Committee approval 
of all anticipated non-audit fees above 
a de-minimis threshold. Whilst the new 
regulations will not formally apply until 
2019, when a three year history of audit 
fees will have been determined, the Group 
is committed to applying best practice as 
soon as practicable and intends to apply 
the new policy (with reference to the prior 
year’ s statutory audit fee) from 2017.
The amounts paid to Ernst & Young 
for non-audit services during the year 
are disclosed in note 6 of the Financial 
Statements. Ernst & Young has its own 
policies and procedures in place to 
ensure it maintains its independence 
and objectivity and regularly reports to 
the Committee on its independence. 
During 2015 Ernst & Young were 
appointed as reporting accountants in 
relation to the IPO. A different partner 
within Ernst & Young was appointed to 
oversee the provision of services related 
to the IPO allowing Ernst & Young to 
maintain their independence. 
Whistleblowing, fraud and the 
Bribery Act 
The Committee has reviewed and 
approved the Group’ s policies and 
procedures covering whistleblowing, 
anti-bribery and corruption including the 
controls in place to detect fraud and to 
ensure compliance with both competition 
and anti-bribery legislation. The Group 
maintains a zero tolerance approach to 
breaches of this legislation and certain 
employees, selected using a risk based 
approach, are provided with dedicated 
training and guidance appropriate to 
their roles. 
The Group operates a MySafeWorkplace 
anonymous incident reporting 
system allowing employees to report 
any wrongdoing or concerns with 
confidentiality assured. There were no 
concerns notified to the Group that 
required the attention of the Committee 
during the year under review and up to 
the date of this report. 
The Report of the Audit Committee has 
been approved by the Board and signed

I am pleased to present the report of the 
Nomination Committee (the Committee) 
for 2016. The report below describes the 
main responsibilities of the Committee. 
I chair Nomination Committee meetings 
but would not participate where the 
Committee was dealing with my own 
appointment as Chairman.
Following the Company’ s listing on the 
London Stock Exchange in April 2016 
the Nomination Committee’ s main task 
was to monitor the functioning of the 
Board and to satisfy itself that the Board 
possessed the right level of skills and 
experience along with starting the process 
of identifying suitable candidates for 
appointment to the Board in 2017. 
Membership 
The members of the Committee are 
appointed by the Board. The members 
of the Committee during 2016 were:
Paul Lester (Chairman)
Justin Atkinson
Divya Seshamani
Bradley Boggess
The Committee met once in 2016. 
Responsibilities and terms 
of reference 
The terms of reference of the Nomination 
Committee were approved by the Board 
and became effective on 11 April 2016. 
The principal responsibilities of the 
Committee are as follows: 
• to regularly review the structure, 
size and composition (including the 
skills, knowledge, experience and 
diversity) of the Board and to make 
recommendations to the Board with 
regard to any changes;
• succession planning for both Executive 
and Non-Executive Board roles along 
with senior management positions;
• to identify and recommend to the Board 
for approval candidates to fill Board and 
senior management vacancies as they 
arise; and
• to make recommendations to the 
Board in respect of the performance

It is recognised that since listing the Board 
is not fully compliant with the Code which 
requires a majority of the Board to be 
independent. Pursuant to the relationship 
agreement between the Company and 
LSF9 Concrete II Limited 'the controlling 
shareholder' the Company and the 
controlling shareholder have agreed to use 
their reasonable endeavours to procure 
that within 18 months of Admission the 
Board does comprise of a majority of 
independent Non-Executive Directors 
in accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. The process of 
appointing a further Independent Non-

Risk Committee Chair
Dear Shareholder 
As Chair of the Risk Committee (the 
Committee) I am pleased to present 
to you on behalf of the Board the first 
report of the Committee. The purpose 
of the Committee is to assist the Board 
in ensuring that all risks, including health, 
safety, environmental, operational and 
commercial are managed effectively and 
proactively throughout the Group. 
Responsibilities and terms 
of reference
The Board elected to establish a 
dedicated Risk Committee in addition 
to the Audit Committee to ensure that 
the management of more operationally 
focused risks of which Health and Safety 
is of paramount importance get sufficient 
and detailed Board level consideration. 
The terms of reference under which the 
Committee operates were approved by 
the Board on 11 April 2016 and can be 
summarised as follows:
• review Health and Safety policy 
considering whether it complies 
with legislation and best practice 
and recommending improvements 
as appropriate;
• implement changes in Health and 
Safety policy as necessary;
• review the effectiveness of risk 
management processes in 
determining whether all risks are being 
identified, evaluated, monitored and 
managed appropriately;
• review of the Group risk register and 
consider its appropriateness and 
completeness along with reviewing 
the appropriateness of the mitigating 
actions being taken; and
• review the effectiveness of the Group’ s 
risk management functions including 
Health and Safety ensuring that 
sufficient resources are devoted to 
this area and that these resources are 
appropriately skilled.
The full terms of reference are available on 
the Company's website. 
Membership 
The members of the Committee during 
the period under review were:
Divya Seshamani (Chair)
Paul Lester
Justin Atkinson
Stephen Harrison 
Shatish Dasani
In addition to the Committee members, 
other members of the management 
team with responsibilities covering Health 
and Safety, environmental compliance, 
commercial and operations functions 
along with representatives of the internal 
audit function may be invited to attend 
and actively contribute to meetings.
During 2016 the Committee met once as 
many of the Committee’ s responsibilities 
had been discharged by the Board. 
The intention is that the Risk Committee 
will meet on at least four occasions 
in 2017.
During the period under review 
the Committee:
• oversaw the formalisation of the 
Group’ s risk assessment and 
monitoring methodology and 
embedding risk management into the 
organisational culture;

Risk Committee Report Executive Directors’ packages in place 
since IPO have been determined taking 
into account:
• the role, experience and performance of 
the Executive Director;
• the location in which the Executive 
Director is working;
• good practice guidelines and emerging 
best practice; and
• remuneration arrangements at UK listed 
companies of a broadly similar size 
and complexity.
The key components of remuneration are 
set out in detail within the Remuneration 
Policy, which in accordance with UK 
company law, will be subject to a binding 
shareholder vote at the 2017 Annual 
General Meeting. The policy is consistent

As explained within the compliance 
statement contained within the 
Governance report, the UK 
Governance Code recommends that 
the Chairman of the Board should not 
chair the Remuneration Committee. 
However the Board considers that I have 
the appropriate skills and experience 
needed to chair the Committee and at 
present am the most suitable Board 
member for this important role. It is the 
intention that as additional Independent 
Non-Executive Directors are appointed 
to the Board then a new appointment to 
chair the Remuneration Committee will 
be made.

Core objectives of the 
Remuneration Policy
The Company aims to attract, retain 
motivate and develop the best talent 
to help ensure continued growth and 
success as it enters the next stage of its 
development. The proposed policy has 
been designed to:
• align the interests of the Executive 
Directors, senior management and 
employees with the strategic goals 
of the Company and the long-term 
interests of shareholders;
• support a culture of high achievement 
and delivery with appropriate reward for 
high performance without incentivising 
the taking of unnecessary risks;
• ensure that our remuneration tools 
and policies are transparent and 
understandable; and
• ensure talented executives and senior 
management are attracted, retained 
and motivated in order to successfully 
lead the Company going forward.
Remuneration Committee activity 
The Remuneration Committee 
operates under terms of reference 
which were approved by the Board on 
11 April 2016. A copy is available on the 
Company's website. 
The Group’ s remuneration policies and 
practices were reviewed extensively 
in preparation for the IPO to ensure 
appropriate remuneration arrangements 
were in place following the listing of 
the Company.
Dear Shareholder
As the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee (the Committee) I am pleased 
to present, on behalf of the Board, the 
Committee’ s first Remuneration Report 
following the IPO, which in addition to 
the Annual Report on Remuneration 
also contains the Remuneration Policy 
(the Policy).
Prior to Admission the Board undertook 
a comprehensive review of the Group’ s 
Remuneration Policy for Directors and 
senior management to ensure the pay 
structure post IPO was appropriate 
for a listed company whilst retaining 
certain key features such as simplicity 
and transparency.
In carrying out this review, the Board paid 
close regard to prevailing best practice 
and the expectations of institutional 
investors and their representative bodies. 
Underpinning the Group’ s policy, the 
Committee’ s objective is to ensure 
remuneration encourages, reinforces and 
rewards the growth of sustainable long-
term shareholder value and promotes the 
long-term success of the Group.

Remuneration Committee Report  
Chairman's Annual Statement Since listing the Committee has, with the 
assistance of independent remuneration 
consultants, undertaken a full review of all 
of the key components of remuneration 
along with the governance mechanisms 
that accompany them to ensure that 
the proposed policy is fit for purpose for 
a listed company and remains aligned 
with our strategic objectives and the 
expectations of our shareholders. 
In addition, the Remuneration 
Committee has:
• implemented and subsequently issued 
shares and granted options under 
the Company’ s four share schemes 
which are detailed in note 28 of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements on 
pages 105 and 106. The Remuneration 
Committee is not solely concerned 
with Executive remuneration and also 
monitors wider employee engagement 
and remuneration matters throughout 
the Group. Following Admission, the 
Board is delighted to have been able 
to foster a culture of employee share 
ownership firstly through launching the 
Forterra Share Incentive Plan (SIP) in 
May 2016 and subsequently in October 
2016 through the launch of the Forterra 
Sharesave Plan, the employee uptake 
of which exceeded expectations at 
62%; and
• set performance targets under the 
Annual Bonus Plan (ABP).
Performance in year and 
bonus outcomes
2016 has been a landmark year with the 
Company being admitted to trading on 
the London Stock Exchange following 
the IPO in April 2016 and subsequently 
becoming established as a public 
company. Despite several headwinds the 
Group has delivered a strong financial 
performance in the year. 
Much of 2016 saw somewhat muted 
demand from the major builders' 
merchants as they reduced the stocks of 
bricks that they carried. T owards the end 
of the year however there were positive 
signs that this destocking was coming 
to an end. The uncertainty triggered 
ahead of the referendum on the UK's 
membership of the European Union 
and the subsequent result impacted the 
business around the middle of 2016 but 
since that time confidence has returned to 
the housebuilding sector and the Group 
has performed strongly in the second 
half of the year. In addition the Group’ s 
aircrete block business suffered from 
constraints to raw material supply, the 
timing and nature of these constraints 
were unexpected and whilst the 
management acted quickly to address the 
issue, production was lost and the result 
impacted accordingly. 
For 2016, 70% of the annual bonus 
was based on EBITDA targets (adjusted 
for exceptional items) and 30% on 
strategic targets. Reflecting a robust 
performance considering the headwinds 
faced during the year, the Group reported 
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation 
and amortisation before exceptional 
items (EBITDA before exceptionals) of 
£70.6 million which resulted in a bonus 
of 22.75% of salary becoming payable. 
Both Executive Directors performed 
well against their strategic objectives to 
reduce net debt, develop greater analyst 
coverage along with gaining exposure 
in the investor community and building 
lasting relationships with both current and 
potential future shareholders. Overall, this 
resulted in a total bonus of 50.25% of 
salary becoming payable. The Committee 
believes the bonus outturn for the year 
reflects the underlying performance of the 
Group over the period.
As disclosed in the Prospectus, directly 
following the successful IPO, Stephen 
Harrison and Shatish Dasani were 
awarded a one-off bonus of £400,000 
and £300,000, respectively, in recognition 
of the significant work undertaken in 
connection with the Offer and Admission. 
This arrangement was agreed whilst 
Forterra was a private company and 
was funded by the selling shareholder. 
Such arrangements do not form part of 
the ongoing Remuneration Policy as a 
listed company.
Matters to be approved  
at the AGM
T wo resolutions will be put to shareholders 
at the AGM:
The first resolution will seek approval 
for the Remuneration Policy (pages 
54 to 62) This outlines the Company’ s 
Remuneration Policy for Executive 
Directors and, if approved, it will take 
effect from the 2017 Annual General 
Meeting (AGM). The vote is binding on the 
Company and is intended to apply for a 
period of three years.
The second resolution will seek approval 
for the remainder of this report being 
my annual statement and the Annual 
Report on Remuneration (pages 63 to 
69). The Annual Report on Remuneration 
details the decisions and actions taken 
by the Committee and the resulting 
remuneration outcomes. It also sets out 
how we intend to implement the policy 
for 2017. This resolution is subject to an 
advisory shareholder vote.
Full details of the resolutions are set out in 
the separate Notice of the AGM.
Our goal has been to be clear and 
transparent in the presentation of both 
parts of this report and I look forward to 
your support on both resolutions.

Strategic Report Financial Statements Shareholder Information Governance Policy overview
The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for determining the remuneration of the Chairman, Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors and other senior management. The Committee’ s terms of reference are available on the Company’ s website.
The Company’ s Remuneration Policy has been designed based on the following key principles:
• to promote the long-term success of the Group, with stretching performance targets which are rigorously applied;
• to provide appropriate alignment between the Group’ s strategic goals, shareholder returns and executive reward; and
• to have a competitive mix of base salary and short-and long-term incentives, with an appropriate proportion of the package 
determined by stretching targets linked to the Group’ s performance.
The remuneration arrangements have been structured with due consideration of the UK Corporate Governance Code and both best 
practice and market practice for UK listed companies. 
The Remuneration Policy for Directors.
The following table summarises the key aspects of the Company’ s Remuneration Policy for Executive and Non-Executive Directors.
Element
Purpose and link 
to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity
Framework used to 
assess performance
Salary Salary is a fixed payment 
that reflects an individual’s 
experience and role 
and may be increased 
to reflect capability and 
performance.
To recruit and retain 
executives.
Salaries are paid monthly and are 
normally reviewed annually with 
changes effective from 1 January 
but by exception may be reviewed 
more frequently if the Committee 
determines this is appropriate.
In reviewing salaries, the Committee 
considers:
• remuneration practices within the 
Group; 
• market benchmarks based 
on companies of broadly 
comparable size and/or 
operating in similar sectors;
• role, competence and 
performance; and
• the general increase awarded to 
salaried employees.
Higher increases may be awarded 
to new Executive Directors who 
were hired at below market rates 
but with the intention to move to a 
market competitive rate over time, 
subject to individual performance.
It is anticipated that salaries 
will generally be increased 
in line with increases 
awarded to salaried 
employees. 
However, in certain 
situations such as where 
there has been an increase 
in the scope, responsibility 
or complexity of the role or 
there has been a significant 
change in the size, value 
or complexity of the Group 
increases may be higher to 
remain market competitive.
Individual and Group 
performance is taken into 
account when determining 
the annual increase.
The rationale for any such 
increase will be disclosed 
in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration.

Benefits The Company’ s aim is to 
offer competitive and cost-
effective benefits valued 
by participants and to help 
recruit and retain executives.
A range of benefits are provided to 
Executive Directors that may include 
a company car (or car allowance), 
private medical and permanent health 
insurance, business travel insurance, 
life assurance/death in service cover.
Relocation (or other related expenses) 
and tax equalisation arrangements 
may be offered as appropriate to 
ensure Directors are no worse or 
better off in a case of relocation. 
Any reasonable business related 
expenses (included tax thereon) may 
be reimbursed if determined to be a 
taxable benefit.
Executive Directors are eligible for 
other benefits which are introduced 
for the wider workforce on broadly 
similar terms.
The cost of providing market 
competitive benefits may 
vary from year to year 
depending on the cost to 
the Company from third 
party providers.
The Committee will 
continue to monitor the 
cost of benefits to ensure 
that the overall benefit 
costs do not increase by 
more than the Committee 
considers appropriate in the 
circumstances.
No performance metrics 
apply.
Pension T o provide a market-
competitive cost-effective 
contribution towards post-
retirement benefits.
Executive Directors receive a 
contribution towards their retirement 
provision which may be paid as a 
contribution to a personal pension 
scheme or a cash allowance in lieu of 
pension or a mix of both.
The Company contribution 
to retirement allowances is 
up to 10% of salary.
No performance metrics

Annual bonus The purpose of the Annual 
Bonus Plan is to incentivise 
Executive Directors to 
achieve annual financial and/
or strategic targets.
Bonus deferral provides a 
retention mechanism and 
provides further alignment 
with shareholders.
Bonus payments are determined 
by the Committee after the year 
end, based on performance against 
the targets set around the start of 
the year.
The Committee aims to set out in the 
Annual Report of Remuneration:
the nature of the targets and their 
weighting for the forthcoming financial 
year; and details of the performance 
conditions, the weightings and 
targets that applied and the level of 
achievement against these targets for 
the financial year being reported on.
The first 10% of salary is payable in 
cash. Up to half of any remainder of 
the bonus may then be deferred into 
shares as either conditional awards 
or nominal cost options under the 
Deferred Annual Bonus Plan (DABP). 
Such awards vest after a period of 
three years subject to continued 
employment. No further performance 
conditions apply.
In line with good practice, recovery 
and withholding provisions apply (see 
note 1). 
An additional payment (in the form 
of cash or shares) may be made in 
respect of shares that vest to reflect 
the value of dividends that would 
have been paid on those shares 
during the vesting period.
The maximum opportunity 
under the annual bonus 
scheme is 100% of salary.
Bonus starts to be 
earned at the threshold 
level (up to 25% of the 
maximum depending on 
the performance metric).
The bonus may be based 
on the achievement of 
an appropriate mix of 
challenging financial, 
operational or strategic 
measures.
T ypically, financial measures 
will account for the majority 
of the bonus opportunity 
and may include measures 
such as profit or cash flow. 
Other financial measures 
that support the key 
short-term priorities of the 
business may be used. The 
targets applying to financial 
metrics will take into account 
the internal plan and external 
expectations of the business 
at the time they are set.
If operational, individual 
or strategic measures are 
included, where possible a 
performance range will be 
set although this will depend 
on the measure chosen.
The measures, targets and 
weightings may be varied by 
the Committee year on year 
based on the Company’ s 
strategic priorities at the time 
(see note 2).

Long-term 
incentives
The Performance Share Plan 
(PSP) incentivises Executive 
Directors and selected senior 
management to deliver 
sustained performance over 
the long-term.
The Plan also acts as a 
method of retaining key 
management over the 
medium-term.
Aligns the interests of the 
Executive Directors and 
shareholders and assists 
Executive Directors in 
building up a substantial 
shareholding.
Awards are granted annually in the 
form of nominal or nil cost options 
under the PSP and vest after no less 
than three years.
Stretching performance conditions 
measured over a period of three 
years determine the extent to which 
awards vest. 
A holding period may apply to vested 
PSP awards under which Executive 
Directors will be required to retain 
the net of tax number of vested 
awards for at least two years from 
the date of vesting. In exceptional 
circumstances, the Committee may 
at its discretion allow participants to 
sell or dispose of some or all of these 
vested shares before the end of the 
holding period.
Details of performance conditions 
for grants made in the year will be 
set out in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration.
Award levels are reviewed annually 
(subject to the PSP individual limits) 
taking into account matters such as 
market practice, overall remuneration, 
the performance of the Company 
and the Executive Director being 
made the award.
In line with good practice, recovery 
and withholding provisions may apply 
(see note 1).
Dividends may accrue based on the 
value of dividends paid during the 
three year vesting period and two 
year holding period (if applicable).
The maximum annual award 
under the PSP that may 
be granted to an individual 
in any financial year is 
200% of salary in normal 
circumstances (250% 
of salary in exceptional 
circumstances).
The current grant levels are 
125% of salary for the CEO 
and 100% of salary for the 
CFO and these will be kept 
under review over the life of 
the policy.
For each measure, up to 
25% of the relevant part of 
the award would vest for 
achieving the threshold level 
of performance, normally 
increasing on a straight line 
basis to 100% for achieving 
maximum performance.
Vesting is based on the 
achievement of one or more 
challenging performance 
targets set by the 
Remuneration Committee 
at the time of grant and 
measured over a three 
year period.
Measures may include EPS 
growth (or another financial 
metric) or TSR. TSR will 
apply for at least part of 
each award under the life 
of this policy. 
In determining the target 
range for any financial 
measures that may apply, 
the Committee ensures 
they are challenging by 
taking into account current 
and anticipated trading 
conditions, the long-term 
business plan and external 
expectations.
The Committee retains the 
flexibility to vary the mix 
of metrics for each year’ s 
award in light of the business 
priorities at the time or to 
introduce new measures 
to support the long-term 
business strategy
(see note 3).
All-employee 
share plans
T o increase alignment 
between employees and 
shareholders in a tax efficient 
manner.
All-employee share schemes may 
be operated. 
Current schemes include:
• Sharesave Plan; 
• Share Incentive Plan (SIP); and
• Other HMRC approved all-
employee schemes may be 
introduced at the Committee’s 
discretion. 
Consistent with prevailing 
HMRC limits.

T o attract and retain high

Non-Executive Directors.
The fees of the Non-Executive 
Directors are set by the Board and 
the Chairman’ s fee is set by the 
Committee (the Chairman does not 
take part in any discussion regarding 
his own fees). Fees are reviewed 
periodically.
Non-Executive Directors receive a fee 
for carrying out their duties, together 
with additional fees for those who 
chair other Board Committees and 
the Senior Independent Director. 
The Non-Executive Directors who 
represent the majority shareholder do 
not receive a fee.
The Chairman and Non-
Executive Directors are entitled 
to reimbursement of reasonable 
business related expense 
(including any tax thereon). They 
do not participate in any incentive 
arrangements and they do not 
receive a pension contribution.
The level of fees reflects the time 
commitment and responsibility of 
their respective roles.
Details of current fees are set 
out in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration.
As set out in the Company’ s 
Articles of Association, the 
total fees paid to Non-
Executive Directors must not 
exceed £1 million a year or 
any higher amount agreed 
by ordinary resolution at a 
general meeting.
No performance metrics 
apply.
Note 1: Recovery and withholding provisions. Recovery and withholding provisions apply to the Annual Bonus Plan, the DABP and the PSP . If, within three years of the payment of a bonus, 
grant of a deferred bonus award and/or vesting of a PSP award, it transpires that payment or vesting should not have occurred as a result of a material misstatement, error in calculation or gross 
misconduct has been discovered, the payment or vesting can be recovered or withheld, in part or in full, as appropriate.
Note 2: Annual bonus performance metrics. The annual bonus measures are reviewed annually and reflect key financial, strategic and operational priorities of the Group. Stretching financial 
targets are set by the Committee by taking account of the Company’s business plan and external expectations. For 2017, these are based on profit and strategic objectives reflecting the short-term 
priorities of the Group. The target ranges set at the start of the financial year are deemed to be commercially sensitive. Actual targets, performance achieved and the awards made will be published at 
the end of the performance period so shareholders can assess payout levels.
Note 3: Performance Share Plan metrics. For 2017 awards the performance conditions will be EPS growth and relative TSR. The use of relative TSR provides a measure of the long-term success 
of the Company relative to appropriate peer comparators. EPS growth is a measure of the overall profitability of the business for investors over the long-term and therefore helps align the interests of 
management with shareholders.

Remuneration Committee Report  
Remuneration Policy continued Incentive plan discretions
The Committee will operate incentive plans including, the Annual Bonus Plan, the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan, and the Performance 
Share Plan according to their respective rules (which were included in the Company’ s IPO Prospectus) and summarised in the policy set 
out previously. The Committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and 
administration of these plans. These include, but are not limited to, the following:
• who participates in the plan;
• the timing of grant and/or payment;
• the size of an award and/or payment;
• the choice of performance measures and targets for each incentive plan in accordance with the policy set out above and the rules 
of each plan;
• the ability to vary any performance conditions if circumstances occur which cause the Remuneration Committee to determine that 
the original conditions have ceased to be appropriate provided that any change is fair and reasonable and in the Committee’ s opinion, 
not materially less difficult to satisfy than the original condition;
• discretion relating to the measurement of performance in the event of a change of control or reconstruction; and 
• determination of a good leaver (in addition to any specified categories) for incentive plan purposes based on the rules of each plan and 
the appropriate treatment under the plan rules.
Any use of the above discretions would, where relevant, be explained in the Annual Report on Remuneration and may, as appropriate, 
be the subject of consultation with the Company’ s major shareholders.
Legacy arrangements
For the avoidance of doubt, any remuneration or loss of office payments that are not in line with this policy may be made if the terms 
were agreed before the approval of this policy, including those disclosed in the Prospectus. In addition, authority is given to the Company 
to honour any commitments entered into at a time when the relevant employee was not a Director of the Company.
Remuneration Policy for other employees
The policy described above applies specifically to the Company’ s Executive and Non-Executive Directors and is designed with regard 
to the policy for employees across the Group as a whole. The following differences exist between the Company’ s policy for the 
remuneration of the Executive Directors and its approach to the payment of employees generally:
• there are differences in salary levels and in the levels of potential reward depending on seniority and responsibility, although a key 
reference point for executive salary increases is the average increase across the general workforce;
• a lower level of maximum annual bonus opportunity (or zero bonus opportunity) may apply to employees;
• performance metrics attached to the annual bonus may differ to reflect the precise roles and responsibilities of the employee; and
• participation in the PSP is limited to the Executive Directors and certain selected senior managers.
In general, these differences arise from the development of remuneration arrangements that are market competitive for the various 
categories of employee. They also reflect that, in the case of the Executive Directors and senior management, a greater emphasis is 
placed on performance related pay reflecting their influence over the Company’ s performance.

Strategic Report Financial Statements Shareholder Information Governance Service contracts and letters of appointment 
Service contracts and letters of appointment are available for inspection at the Company’ s registered office. 
Service contracts 
The service contracts for the Executive Directors are terminable by either the Company or the Executive on 12 months’ notice. 
The Company can terminate either Executive Director’ s service contract by payment of a cash sum in lieu of notice equivalent to the 
base salary and the cost that would have been incurred in providing the Executive Director with contractual benefits for any unexpired 
portion of the notice period (or alternatively the Company can choose to continue providing the contractual benefits). The payment in lieu 
may be paid as one lump sum or in monthly equal instalments over the notice period. If the Company chooses to pay in instalments the 
Executive Directors are obliged to seek alternative income over the relevant period and the payment of each monthly instalment will be 
reduced by the amount of such income earned. There are no enhanced provisions on a change of control.
At the discretion of the Committee, a contribution to reasonable outplacement costs in the event of termination of employment due to 
redundancy may also be made. The Committee also retains the ability to reimburse reasonable legal costs incurred in connection with 
a termination of employment and may make a payment for any statutory entitlements or to settle or compromise claims in connection 
with a termination of employment of any existing or future Executive Director as necessary. Relevant details will be provided in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration should such circumstances apply.
The table opposite sets out, for variable pay elements, the Company’ s policy on payment for loss of office in respect of Executive 
Directors. In general, treatment will depend on the circumstances of departure and in particular whether a leaver is a ‘good leaver’. 
Good leaver reasons include
• death;  • redundancy; 
• injury;  • the employing company being sold outside the Group; or
• retirement;  • other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee.
• disability; 
In any other circumstance, the leaver will be treated as a 'bad leaver'. 
Illustrations of application of Remuneration Policy (£'000)
 
Notes:
• Minimum is equivalent to fixed pay which comprises salary levels applying for 2017 the value of benefits in 2016 and a 10% pension contribution. 
• Target comprises fixed pay plus the value of the on target bonus at 50% of the maximum bonus opportunity (100% of salary) plus the value of the on target level of vesting under the PSP which is 
taken to be 50% of the expected 2017 grant level. 
• Maximum comprises fixed pay plus maximum bonus plus the maximum value of the PSP (equal to be 100% of the face value of the award at grant using the current grant policy of 125% of salary 
for the CEO and 100% of salary for the CFO).
• No share price appreciation has been assumed for the PSP award.

Strategic Report Financial Statements Shareholder Information Governance Letters of appointment
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment and are subject to annual re-election at the AGM. 
The appointment letters for the Non-Executive Directors provide that no compensation is payable on termination. The appointments 
are terminable by the Company on not less than 30 days’ notice or immediately in the event that the appointment is terminated by the 
shareholders (or where shareholder approval is required but not forthcoming).
Bradley Boggess and Richard Cammerer Jr. have been appointed as Non-Executive Directors by Lone Star Funds pursuant to the 
Relationship Agreement, if (a) Lone Star Funds and its associates no longer exercise or control the exercise of at least 20% of the 
votes able to be cast on all or substantially all matters at general meetings of the Company, the Board may request that one of these 
appointments are terminated; and (b) if the Lone Star Funds and its associates no longer exercise or control the exercise of at least 10% 
of the votes able to be cast on all or substantially all matters at general meetings of the Company, the Board may request that both of 
these appointments are terminated.
Approach to recruitment and promotions 
The recruitment package for a new Executive Director would be set in accordance with the terms of the Company’ s approved 
Remuneration Policy. Currently, this would facilitate a maximum annual bonus payment of no more than 100% of salary and PSP award 
of up to 200% of salary (other than in exceptional circumstances (including recruitment) where up to 250% of salary may be made).
On recruitment, salary may (but need not necessarily) be set below the normal market rate, with phased increases as the Executive 
Director gains experience. The rate of salary should be set so as to reflect the individual’ s experience and skills.
In addition, on recruitment the Company may compensate for amounts foregone from a previous employer (using LR 9.4.2R if 
necessary) taking into account the quantum foregone and, as far as reasonably practicable, the extent to which performance conditions 
apply, the form of award and the time left to vesting.
For an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of their prior role should be allowed to payout according to 
its outstanding terms. Any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue, provided that, if they are 
outside the approved policy, they are put to shareholders for approval at the earliest opportunity.
For all appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet appropriate relocation costs.
For the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director, the fee arrangement would be set in accordance with the approved 
Remuneration Policy in force at that time.
Policy on external appointments
Subject to Board approval, Executive Directors are permitted to take on a single paid non-executive position with an unconnected 
company and to retain their fees in respect of such position. Where appropriate details of outside directorships held by the Executive 
Directors and any fees that they received are provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration. At present neither of the Executive 
Directors holds any outside appointments other than those held in the capacity of representing the Group on trade associations and 
similar bodies, and no remuneration is received in respect of these appointments. 
How the view of shareholders and employees are taken into account
In setting the remuneration for the Executive Directors the Committee takes note of the overall approach to reward for employees in the 
Group and salary increases will ordinarily be (in percentage of salary terms) in line with those of the wider workforce. The Committee does 
not formally consult directly with employees on executive pay but does receive periodic updates on employee remuneration within the 
Group as necessary. 
The Committee is conscious that this is the first time that shareholders will vote on the Remuneration Policy since the Company’ s IPO 
and will consider any shareholder feedback received in relation to the Policy at the AGM. This, plus any additional feedback received from 
time to time, will be considered as part of the Company’ s annual review of Remuneration Policy.
As Forterra has not held an AGM since listing no voting outcomes are available. We will publish details of remuneration related voting 
outcomes in next year’ s Remuneration Committee Report.

Remuneration Policy continued Implementation of the Remuneration Policy for the year ending 31 December 2017
A summary of how the Directors’ Remuneration Policy will be applied during the year ending 31 December 2017 is set out below:
Base salary
Executive Directors’ salaries were reviewed in January 2017 and the Committee agreed to increase Executive Directors’ salaries by 2% in 
line with the general increase made to the workforce. The increases will take effect from 1 January 2017.

 Salary in place since date of Admission
Pension and benefits
The Committee intends that the implementation of its policy in relation to pension and benefits will be in line with the policy disclosed on 
page 55 of this report.
Annual bonus
The maximum annual bonus for the year ending 31 December 2017 will be 100% of salary for Executive Directors. Awards will 
be determined based on a combination of both the Group’ s financial results, being profit before tax (70%) and strategic/personal 
performance (30%). The Committee has changed the profitability definition for 2017 from EBITDA to profit before tax (PBT) to take 
account of the cost of debt financing. In both periods the targets are stated before exceptional items. 
The specific financial targets for 2017 are considered commercially sensitive. However, the Committee intends to disclose these 
retrospectively in next year’ s Annual Report on Remuneration along with details as to their achievement to the extent that they do not 
remain commercially sensitive. The strategic objectives for 2017 are also considered commercially sensitive. Stretching targets aligned to 
the Group's five strategic pillars have been set. 
In determining the level of any bonus award to be deferred into shares under the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan the first 10% of salary 
of any bonus and 50% of any further bonus earned will be paid in cash with the balance deferred in shares for three years within the 
Deferred Annual Bonus Plan. 
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
The Committee intends to make awards under the PSP to Executive Directors during the 2017 financial year. These awards are expected 
to be at 125% of salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 100% of salary for the Chief Financial Officer.
Half of the awards will vest by reference to the Group's earnings per share (EPS) performance over the three year period and the 
remaining half will vest subject to the Groups' total shareholder return (TSR) performance against an unweighted index of comparator 
companies. Awards will be subject to clawback/malus provisions and a two year holding period on vested shares may apply.

Annual Report on Remuneration Fees for Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
The Company’ s approach to Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration is set by the Board with account taken of the time and responsibility 
involved in each role, including where applicable the Chairmanship of Board Committees. A summary of current fees is shown below:
Chairman £130,000
Non-Executive Director base fee £50,000
Additional fees:
Senior Independent Director £10,000
Audit Committee Chairman £7,000
Remuneration Committee Chairman £7,000
Risk Committee Chair £4,000
The Directors appointed by Lone Star Funds have waived any right to receive a fee. 
The fees above were set prior to the IPO and will be subject to review in 2018.
Annual report on remuneration 
This report covers the full year ended 31 December 2016. Comparative figures for the 2015 have not been provided as the Company did 
not exist in its current form during the prior year and the Committee does not believe that the remuneration paid in prior years as a private 
company is comparable with the remuneration paid post IPO. Unless stated otherwise, the figures below are full year figures and include 
remuneration paid by Forterra Building Products Limited prior to the incorporation and subsequent Admission of Forterra plc.

 As detailed in the Prospectus, on Admission, the Executive Directors and other senior Executives were awarded a one-off bonus in recognition of the significant work undertaken in connection with 
the Offer and Admission. The pre-IPO restructuring was structured so as to leave the Company with a specified level of net debt upon Admission. These bonus payments were taken into account 
as part of the restructuring thus in practice they were effectively paid out of the selling shareholders proceeds raised on IPO and not the ongoing cash reserves of the Group.

 The first award under the Performance Share Plan was made in 2016. These first awards will not be eligible to vest until 2019 and are subject to performance conditions as described below.

 13,333 options were granted to both Stephen Harrison and Shatish Dasani under the Forterra Sharesave Plan on 24 October 2016 with an exercise price of 135p per share (awarded at a 20% 
discount to the market price at the date of launch in accordance with HMRC rules). The earliest date these options may be exercised is 1 December 2019.

 277 deferred shares were awarded to both Stephen Harrison and Shatish Dasani under the Forterra All Employee Share Incentive Plan (SIP) on 25 May 2016. These shares are not subject to 
performance conditions and will vest in 2019.
Pension entitlements (audited)
The Group operates a defined contribution personal pension plan. Since listing, both Executive Directors receive a 10% retirement 
allowance which they may use to make contributions into the Group personal pension scheme should they wish. Prior to listing, Stephen 
Harrison was entitled to receive a contribution of 19% of salary paid into the Scheme. The Group does not operate a defined benefit 
pension scheme. Details of the value of pension contributions received in the year under review are provided in the pensions column of

The strategic objectives comprising 30% of the overall bonus opportunity and their achievement are set out in full below. Both Stephen 
Harrison and Shatish Dasani were set common objectives. An outline of the objectives and the extent to which they were achieved are 
provided below.
Objective Weighting Achievement Outcome
Payout level 
(percentage of

T o reduce the Group’ s net 
debt at 31 December 2016 
to below a threshold level 
of £130 million with full 
bonus value achieved at 
£110 million or below.
33% Net debt as at 31 December 2016 was 
£92.3 million. Representing a significant 
reduction from the target. This positive 
outcome was delivered partly as a result of the 
timing of the IPO along with disciplined and 
effective working capital management.
Fully met 100%
T o develop analyst 
coverage to six or more 
analysts to increase 
the marketability of the 
Company’ s shares 
post-IPO.
33% The Investor Relations function has developed 
considerably since listing with Forterra 
currently covered by eight analysts. The 
Committee considers this to be a strong level 
of coverage for a recently listed plc of the 
Group’ s size and is expected to bring liquidity 
benefits to the stock. 
Fully met 100%
T o leverage on a successful 
listing by building strong 
and lasting relationships 
with existing investors 
as well as continuing to 
cultivate relationships with 
potential new investors 
who did not participate in 
the IPO.
33% Relationships with existing and prospective 
shareholders were built, maintained and 
further developed. The results of a Lone 
Star sell down which took place in January 
2017 where a number of new shareholders 
joined the shareholder register following 2016 
meetings with management provides tangible 
evidence of this.

Directors’ shareholding and share interests
Share ownership plays a key role in the alignment of our Executive Directors with the interests of shareholders. Our Executive Directors 
are expected to build up and maintain a 200% of salary shareholding in Forterra. Where an Executive Director does not meet this 
guideline then they are required to retain at least 50% of the net of tax vested shares under the Company’ s share plans until the guideline 
is met. The number of shares held by the Directors as at 31 December 2016 are as follows:

Advisors to the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee has access to independent advice where it considers it appropriate. The Committee seeks advice relating 
to executive remuneration from New Bridge Street (NBS), part of Aon plc. Aon plc also provides other remuneration and benefits services 
to the Group and the Committee is satisfied that no conflict of interest exists in the provision of these services. 
The Committee is satisfied that the advice received by NBS in relation to executive remuneration matters during the year was objective 
and independent. NBS is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and abides by the Remuneration Consultants Group Code 
of Conduct, which requires its advice to be objective and impartial. The fees paid to NBS during the year totalled £0.2 million of which 
£0.1 million related to pre-IPO advice, primarily relating to the design, development and roll-out of the post-Admission Remuneration 
Policy and share based reward schemes. £0.1 million was paid to NBS in respect of post listing remuneration advice. 
Statement of shareholder voting
As mentioned previously, Forterra has not held an AGM since listing and therefore no voting outcomes are available. Details of 
remuneration related voting outcomes will be published in next year’ s Remuneration Committee Report.

Directors’ Report Share capital and control 
Details of the Company’ s share capital are included within note 25 of the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 104. 
As at 31 December 2016 there were 200,442,068 ordinary shares of 1p nominal value in issue. The share capital was reorganised ahead 
of the listing and details of this reorganisation can be found in note 25 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Following the capital reorganisation the Company has one class of shares, ordinary shares of 1p nominal value, which carry equal 
rights to dividends, voting and return of capital on winding up of the Company. There are no restrictions on the transfer of securities in 
the Company and there are no restrictions on any voting rights other than those prescribed by law, nor is the Company aware of any 
arrangement which may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or voting rights nor any arrangement whereby a shareholder has 
waived or agreed to wave dividends. 
The Company has established two separate employee benefit trusts for the purposes of satisfying awards under the Company’ s share 
based incentive schemes.
The Company has established a Trust in connection with the Group’ s Share Incentive Plan (the SIP) which holds ordinary shares on trust 
for the benefit of employees of the Group. The Trustees of the SIP Trust may vote in respect of Forterra shares held in the Trust but only 
as instructed by participants in the SIP in accordance with the deed and rules governing the scheme. The Trustees will not otherwise 
vote in respect of the shares held in the SIP Trust. 
The Employee Benefit Trust (the 'EBT') has been established to satisfy future awards vesting under the Performance Share Plan (the 
'PSP'), the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan (the 'DABP') and the Sharesave Scheme. As at 31 December 2016 the EBT did not hold any 
shares in the Company.

Strategic Report Financial Statements Shareholder Information Governance Post balance sheet events
There have been no significant events affecting the Group since the end of the year. Details of developments in the year under review are 
contained within the Strategic Report. 
Political donations
The Group made no donations during the year to any political party or other political organisation. 
Going concern
The Directors have assessed the Group’ s current financial position and the factors likely to affect performance in the coming year in 
light of current and anticipated economic conditions. Based on this assessment the Directors can have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval 
of the Financial Statements. On this basis the going concern concept has been adopted in the preparation of this Annual Report and 
Financial Statements. 
The Directors are also required to provide a broader assessment of viability over a longer period which can be found on page 34.
In making the going concern statement and the viability statement the Directors have taken into account the Guidance on Risk 
management, Internal Controls and Related Financial and Business Reporting issued by the Financial Reporting Council in 
September 2014.
Statement of disclosure of information to the auditor
Each Director of the Company confirms that as far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’ s 
auditors are unaware and that each of the Directors has taken all the steps they ought to have taken individually as a Director in order to 
make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’ s auditors are aware of that information.

Directors’ Report continued The Directors are required by the Companies Act 2006 to prepare Financial Statements for each financial year that give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company as at the end of the financial year, and of the profit or loss of the Group 
for the financial year. Under that law, the Directors are required to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union (‘EU’) and have elected to prepare the Company 
Financial Statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, including FRS 102 The Financial 
Reporting Standard applicable in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland and applicable law. 
In preparing these Financial Statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements respectively;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS are insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’ s financial position and financial performance; and
• prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Company 
will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’ s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the financial position of the Group and the Company, and which enable them to 
ensure that the Financial Statements and the Directors’ remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the Consolidated Financial Statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They also have general responsibility for taking such steps 
as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and the Company, and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’ s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of Financial Statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Financial Statements, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’ s and the Company’ s performance, business model 
and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are set out on pages 38 to 39 confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
• the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give 
a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group; and
• the Strategic Report contained within this document includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and 
the position of the Group together with a description of principal risks and uncertainties that the Group faces.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the members of Forterra plc Overview of our audit approach
Risks of material misstatement • Revenue recognition and accounting for customer rebates.
• Management override of decommissioning and restoration provision.
• Accounting for exceptional items.
• Valuation of finished goods within inventory.
Audit scope • We performed a full scope audit of the complete financial information for the main trading 
component and the plc entity and audit procedures on specific balances for a further three 
components.
• The components where we performed full or specific audit procedures accounted for 99% 
of profit before tax, 100% of revenue and 98% of total assets.
Materiality • Overall Group materiality of £2.3 million which represents 5% of profit before tax stated before 
exceptional items. 
Our assessment of risk of material misstatement
We identified the risks of material misstatement described below as those that had the greatest effect on our overall audit strategy,  
the allocation of resources in the audit and the direction of the efforts of the audit team. In addressing these risks, we have performed  
the procedures below which were designed in the context of the Financial Statements as a whole and, consequently, we do not express 
any opinion on these individual areas.
Risk Our response to the risk
Key observations communicated  
to the Audit Committee
Revenue recognition (£294.5 million 
stated net of rebates, 2015: £290.2 
million) and accounting for rebates
There is a risk of inappropriate revenue 
recognition if revenue is recorded in the 
wrong period or if customer rebates are 
incorrectly recorded. 
Revenue recognition
We identified and assessed key controls over the 
revenue process for Forterra Building Products and 
concluded the controls to be effective. We relied on 
these controls in our audit approach. 
We tested revenue throughout the period by selecting 
a sample of transactions to ensuring they met the IFRS 
revenue recognition criteria and traced them to source 
documentation to ensure they were appropriately 
recorded. 
We inspected the financial impact of transactions 
around the period end and tested a sample of these to 
ensure they were recorded in the correct period. We 
utilised data analytics to track the revenue recognised 
in the year through to cash. 
Accounting for rebates
We selected a sample of customer rebates for 
significant customers and inspected the terms, 
confirmed these terms through direct confirmation 
from customers, confirmed the sales data on which 
the rebate is based and recalculated the rebates, 
performing year on year analysis to understand the 
material changes in the provision and expense.
To assess the completeness of rebates, we assessed 
the aged debtors, post period end credit notes and 
reviewed journal entry transactions recorded through 
data analytics analysis for evidence of any unrecorded 
amounts. We also made enquiries of management 
and a sample of customers for any other rebate 
arrangements.
Based on our procedures we are 
satisfied that revenue and rebates are 
appropriately stated.

Strategic Report Financial Statements Shareholder Information Governance Risk Our response to the risk
Key observations communicated  
to the Audit Committee
Management override of the 
decommissioning and restoration 
provision (£11.4 million, 2015: £11.7 
million)
The decommissioning and restoration 
provision is subject to management 
judgements due to the level of uncertainty 
which surrounds the ultimate cash outflow. 
We have audited management’s methodology applied 
in preparing the calculation of the decommissioning 
and restoration provision (including the underlying 
assumptions), walking through controls over the 
process.
Our valuation specialists have independently evaluated 
the discount and inflation rates used by management. 
Our analysis produced a range of appropriate 
outcomes for both of the assumptions when 
benchmarked against market data. We concluded 
that management's assumptions were within an 
acceptable range. 
We verified management's cost calculation of the 
decommissioning and restoration costs for each 
site, which is based on an independent third party 
consultant's assessment, including verifying the useful 
lives of each site. We have assessed the methodology 
used, confirming its compliance with IFRS and the 
appropriateness of the cost calculated.
We have assessed the appropriateness of the overall 
provision through year on year analysis.
The assumptions used in the 
valuation of the decommissioning and 
restoration provision are considered 
within an acceptable range. 
Based on the procedures performed 
we conclude that the valuation of 
the provision is considered to be 
appropriate. 
Accounting for exceptional items 
(£8.9 million, 2015: £11.6 million)
The Group has undergone a reorganisation 
prior to listing in April 2016 and has incurred 
significant costs in the current and previous 
periods.
We consider there to be a risk that certain 
costs included within the exceptional items 
are not exceptional by nature. 
We have assessed each of the categories 
for recognition against IAS 1 and understood 
management’s basis on which they have concluded 
that these are exceptional by nature. 
We have selected a sample of underlying transactions 
to confirm the appropriate recording of the amounts 
and to assess their consistency with the category that 
they are recognised within.
Based on the procedures performed 
we are satisfied that the amounts 
recognised as exceptional are 
appropriate.
Valuation of finished goods within 
inventory (£31.5 million, 2015: 
£32.9 million)
The valuation of inventory is considered to 
be a significant risk in particular the risk that 
the inventory will be recognised at above its 
net realisable value.
We have identified and walked through key controls 
over the inventory valuation process to assess whether 
they have been designed effectively. 
We have assessed the impact of managements 
standard cost adjustment including validating the 
underlying data. We have assessed management’s 
paper on the basis for recognising each adjustment 
including obtaining supporting schedules. 
We have validated management’s inventory provisions 
through assessing the appropriateness of the 
methodology, recalculation, and testing the underlying 
sales data to ensure it is correct and have assessed for 
obsolescence and net realisable value. 
Based on the procedures we have 
performed we have concluded that 
the inventory has been appropriately 
recorded at the year end.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the members of Forterra plc 
continued The scope of our audit 
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for 
each entity within the Group. T aken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements. We take into 
account size, risk profile, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of Group-wide controls, changes in the business environment 
and other factors such as recent Internal audit results when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.
Of the five components of the Group, we performed a full scope audit of the complete financial information of two components ('full 
scope components') which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. For the remaining three components ('specific scope 
components'), we performed audit procedures on specific accounts within that component that we considered had the potential for the 
greatest impact on the significant accounts in the Financial Statements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile. 
The reporting components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 99% (2015: 98%) of the Group’ s adjusted profit before 
tax, 100% (2015:100%) of the Group’ s revenue and 98% (2015: 99%) of the Group’ s total assets.
For the current year, the full scope components contributed 97% (2015: 93%) of the Group’ s adjusted profit before tax, 97% (2015: 96% 
of the Group’ s revenue and 96% (2015: 97%) of the Group’ s total assets. 
The specific scope component contributed 2% (2015: 5%) of the Group’ s adjusted profit before tax, 3% (2015: 3%) of the Group’ s 
revenue and 2% (2015: 2%) of the Group’ s total assets. The audit scope of this component may not have included testing of all 
significant accounts of the component but will have contributed to the coverage of significant accounts tested for the Group. 
The remaining component represents less than 1% of the Group’ s adjusted profit before tax. For this component, we performed other 
procedures, including analytical review, testing of consolidation journals and intercompany eliminations to respond to any potential risks of 
material misstatement to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Involvement with component teams 
All audit work performed for the purposes of the audit was undertaken by the Group audit team.

Strategic Report Financial Statements Shareholder Information Governance Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit 
and in forming our audit opinion. 
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of the users of the Financial Statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our 
audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £2.3 million (2015: £1.9 million), which is 5% (2015: 5%) of adjusted profit before tax. 
We believe that adjusted profit before tax provides us with the most appropriate basis for materiality based on the level of the one-off 
charges recorded in the year due to the IPO and Group reorganisation.
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the 
probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’ s overall control environment, our judgement was that 
performance materiality was set at 75% (2015: 50%) of our planning materiality, namely £1.7 million (2015: £0.9 million). The movement 
in the performance materiality percentage has been caused due to changes in the risk profile of the business. 
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is 
undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based on 
the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component. 
In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to components was £1.3 million to £0.4 million (2015: £ 0.6 million to 
£0.2 million). 
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of £0.1 million 
(2015: £0.1 million), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds. 
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other 
relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the members of Forterra plc 
continued Scope of the audit of the Financial Statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the Financial Statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the Financial Statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’ s and the Company’ s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the 
overall presentation of the Financial Statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to 
identify material inconsistencies with the audited Financial Statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect 
based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 73, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the Financial Statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express

them in an auditor’ s report and for no other purpose. T o the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’ s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006

• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
• based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: 
–  the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the Financial Statements are 
prepared is consistent with the Financial Statements; and
–  the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
• based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement set out on 
pages 41 to 45 with respect to internal control and risk management systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about 
share capital structures and in compliance with rules 7.2.5 and 7.2.6 of the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook 
made by the Financial Conduct Authority:
–  is consistent with the Financial Statements; and 
–  has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirement.
• based on the work undertaken rules 7.2.2, 7.2.3 and 7.2.7 in the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook made by

Strategic Report Financial Statements Shareholder Information Governance Notes to the Financial Statements
1 General information
Forterra plc (‘Forterra’ or the ‘Company’) and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’) are domiciled in the UK. The address 
of the registered office of the Company is 5 Grange Park Court, Roman Way, Northampton, England, NN4 5EA. The Company is 
the parent of Forterra Holdings Limited and Forterra Building Products Limited, which together comprise the group (the ‘Group’). 
The principal activity of the Group is the manufacture and sale of bricks, dense and lightweight blocks, precast concrete, concrete 
block paving and other complementary building products.
Forterra plc was incorporated on 21 January 2016 for the purpose of listing the Group on the London Stock Exchange. Forterra plc 
acquired the shares of Forterra Building Products Limited on 20 April 2016, which to that date held the Group’ s trade and assets, 
before admission to the main market of the London Stock Exchange. Further details on the acquisition and Group restructuring 
activities are disclosed in note 25.
The Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 were approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 
15 March 2017.
2 Summary of significant accounting policies
(a) Basis of preparation
Forterra plc was incorporated on 21 January 2016, however the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 
2016 and comparatives for the year ended 31 December 2015 have been prepared on the basis that Forterra plc was in existence 
throughout both periods. The terms of the acquisition of Forterra Building Products Limited’ s shares was such that the Group 
reconstruction should be accounted for as a continuance of the existing Forterra Building Products Limited group rather than as an 
acquisition. Accordingly the Consolidated Financial Statements for both periods have been prepared on this basis, extracting financial 
information from the consolidated statutory accounts of Forterra Building Products Limited for both the year ended 31 December 2015 
and the period prior to the incorporation of Forterra plc in 2016.
The accounting policies used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements are set out below. These accounting policies 
have been used consistently in all material respects across the periods presented. The Consolidated Financial Statements have 
been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The Financial Statements are presented in Pounds Sterling and 
all values are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand unless otherwise indicated.
The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting 
estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’ s accounting policies. The areas 
involving a higher degree of judgement and complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements are disclosed in note 3.
(b) Going concern
The Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through its cash reserves and borrowings. The Group’ s forecasts and 
projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group should be able to operate 
within the level of its current cash reserves and borrowings. After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least one year from the date that the Financial 
Statements are signed. The Group therefore adopts the going concern basis in preparing its Consolidated Financial Statements.
Further, the Group sets out on pages 22 to 23 of its Strategic Report the financial position, performance, cash flows and borrowing 
facilities and on page 34 its Viability Statement. In addition, note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements includes the Group’ s 
objectives, policies and procedures for financial risk management, including details of exposure and response to foreign exchange, 
interest rate, credit and liquidity risks.
(c) New standards, amendments and interpretations
The following new standards and amendments to standards have been issued and considered:
IFRS 15 – Revenue from contracts with customers (effective 1 January 2018)
IFRS 9 –  Financial instruments (effective 1 January 2018)
IFRS 16 – Leases (effective 1 January 2019)
IFRS 16 will replace IAS 17 ‘Leases’ and will become effective for accounting periods beginning 1 January 2019. The standard 
addresses the definition of a lease, recognition and measurement of leases and establishes principles for reporting useful information 
to users of Financial Statements about the leasing activities of both lessees and lessors. A key change arising from IFRS 16 is that 
most operating leases will be accounted for by lessees on balance sheet. The Group has begun a systematic review of leases held to 
ensure the effects are understood and changes to the current accounting procedures are highlighted and acted upon in advance of 
the effective date. Further information about the Group’ s operating leases is set out in note 26.
86
Forterra plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Other than the impact of IFRS 16 as noted above, the Group does not expect a significant net impact from the adoption of these new 
standards. The Group has chosen not to adopt any of the above standards and interpretations earlier than required.
(d) Basis of consolidation
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns and has the ability to affect those returns through 
its power over the entity. A subsidiary is an entity over which the Group has control. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on 
which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
Intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between the Group companies are eliminated. 
(e) Foreign currency translation
The functional and presentational currency of the Group is Pounds Sterling; the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which the Group operates.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of transaction. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, or from the translation of monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at period end, are recognised in the Group’ s Consolidated Statement of T otal 
Comprehensive Income.
(f) Revenue 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, and represents amounts for goods supplied, net of 
rebates, discounts, returns and value added taxes. The Group recognises revenue when the goods have been delivered and the risks 
and rewards have passed to the purchaser. The Group provides volume based rebates to certain customers normally on an annual 
basis. The estimated obligation at the year end is recorded within accrued liabilities and other payables.
(g) Segment reporting 
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting to the Operating Board which has been identified 
as the chief operating decision maker. 
(h) Exceptional costs
The Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the Consolidated Statement of T otal Comprehensive Income, those material 
items of income and expense, which, because of the nature and expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate 
presentation to allow shareholders to better understand elements of financial performance in the period.
(i) Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes the 
original purchase price of the asset, costs attributable to bringing the asset to working condition for intended use, the initial estimate 
of any decommissioning obligation and associated changes to those estimates. When components of an item of property, plant and 
equipment have different useful lives, those components are accounted for as separate assets.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’ s carrying value where they meet the recognition criteria.
Assets are derecognised on disposal. Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying 
amount of an asset and are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of T otal Comprehensive Income. Where no future economic 
benefit is expected from the use of an asset, a provision is made against its carrying value in accordance with IAS 37.
Land and assets under construction are not depreciated. For the other categories of property, plant and equipment, depreciation is 
charged to the Consolidated Statement of T otal Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the assets estimated useful life. 
The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:
• Freehold buildings – 40 years
• Leasehold buildings – Shorter of the useful life and the lease term
• Plant and machinery – 4 to 25 years
Asset residual values are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. The carrying amount of an asset is written 
down if it is in excess of recoverable amount.
Borrowing costs and repairs and maintenance expenses are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of T otal 
Comprehensive Income.

Strategic Report Financial Statements Shareholder Information Governance 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
(j) Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
Goodwill arose on the historic acquisitions of businesses, trade and assets where consideration paid exceeded the fair value at the 
acquisition date.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cash generating units 
(CGUs). Each unit to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for 
internal purposes.
Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential 
impairment. The carrying value of the CGU containing the goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair 
value less costs to sell and value in use. Any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of 
T otal Comprehensive Income and is not subsequently reversed.
(ii) Brand
The Thermalite brand is classified as an indefinite life intangible asset due to the longevity of the brand and there not being a time limit 
on when benefit will be gained.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised but are tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or 
changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment.
(iii) Other intangible assets
Other intangibles consists of clay rights, merchant relationships, order book, patent and software development costs. These are 
attributable to both reportable segments. All other intangible assets have finite lives and are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using a straight-line method to allocate the cost of these intangible assets over their estimated 
useful lives of 4 to 30 years. Amortisation of clay rights are treated as cost of sales. Amortisation of all other intangible assets are treated 
as administrative expenses.
(k) Financial instruments
The Group determines the classification of financial assets and financial liabilities at initial recognition. The principal financial assets and 
liabilities of the Group are as follows:
(i) Trade and other receivables (excluding prepayments)
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold in the ordinary course of business. All trade receivables are 
expected to be settled in one year or less.
Trade receivables are reported net of provisions. Provisions are recorded in a separate provision account with the loss being 
recognised within administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of T otal Comprehensive Income. On confirmation that the 
trade receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is written off against the associated provision.
(ii) Trade and other payables (excluding statutory non-financial liabilities)
Trade and other payables are initially stated at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
(iii) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short-term deposits. Prior to February 2015 the treasury activities were 
centralised by HeidelbergCement AG and net cash collections were automatically distributed and reflected as a cash pooling related 
party receivable/payable.
(iv) Loans and borrowings
Loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of attributable transaction costs, and are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise 
cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance income and finance expense.
(v) Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, in particular forward foreign exchange contracts and options, to manage the financial 
risks arising from business activities and the financing of those activities. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for 
speculative purposes. No derivatives have been designated as hedges in the periods presented.
Notes to the Financial Statements continued
88
Forterra plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 (l) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes the cost of direct materials and labour plus attributable 
overheads based on a normal level of activity. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less any further costs expected to be 
incurred in production and sale. The Group applies an inventory provision for damaged, obsolete, excess and slow-moving inventory.
(m) Provisions
Provisions are recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past 
event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle that obligation and the amount can be reliably 
measured. If the effect is material the provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The change in provisions due to 
passage of time is recognised as a net finance expense. 
Provisions are not made for future operating losses. 
(n) Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in share premium 
as a deduction from the proceeds.
(o) Operating leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risk and reward is not transferred to the Group are classified as operating leases. The total 
rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the Consolidated Statement of T otal Comprehensive Income on an accrual 
basis over the lease term. Operating lease incentives, which primarily include rent free periods, are capitalised and released as a rental 
expense within the Consolidated Statement of T otal Comprehensive Income over the lease term. The Group has no finance leases.
(p) Net finance expense 
Finance expense
Finance expense comprises interest payable on borrowings from external and related parties, direct issue costs and unwinding of 
discounts on long-term provisions. Finance expense is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of T otal Comprehensive Income as it 
accrues using the effective interest method.
Finance income
Finance income comprises interest receivable on funds invested. 
(q) Current and deferred income tax 
Income tax for the periods presented comprises current and deferred tax. T ax is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income, unless it relates to items in other comprehensive income or equity. 
The current income tax charge is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. 
Deferred income tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
(r) Employee benefits
The Group operates a defined contribution pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions. The Group has no further 
payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when due.
(s) Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services received in 
exchange for the grant of shares or options is recognised as an expense over the vesting period. The total amount to be expensed 
over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of shares or options granted. Fair values are adjusted where non-
market vesting conditions are attached to a particular scheme. At each balance sheet date the Group revises its estimates of the 
number of shares or options that are expected to vest and recognises the impact of the revision on original estimates, if any, in the 
Consolidated Statement of T otal Comprehensive Income, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
(t) Own shares held by employee benefit trusts
The Group has established two separate employee benefit trusts for the purposes of satisfying awards under the Group’ s share-based 
incentive schemes. Shares in the Group acquired by the trusts are deducted from equity until shares vest or are cancelled, reissued or 
disposed. At 31 December 2016 442,068 ordinary shares had been issued into trust. Shares were issued at nominal value, therefore, 
although the Trust has been consolidated within the Financial Statements there is no monetary impact to the Consolidated Statement 
of Changes in Equity in the period presented.

Strategic Report Financial Statements Shareholder Information Governance 3 Critical accounting judgements and estimates
The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements under IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates 
and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not 
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The Directors consider that the following estimates and judgements are likely to have the most significant effect on the amounts 
recognised in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
(a) Impairment of Property, plant and equipment 
Where there is evidence of potential diminution in value, the Group reviews an item of property, plant and equipment, to assess 
whether the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value. The recoverable amount is defined as the higher of fair value less costs to 
sell and value in use, which in turn is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset. The estimate of 
value in use, and hence the outcome of the impairment test, is sensitive to the assumptions made about the revenue growth, EBITDA 
margin, the long-term growth rate of the relevant market, and the discount rate considered appropriate to reflect the time value of 
money and any risks specific to the asset that are not reflected in the cash flows.
The Group did not recognise an impairment charge in relation to property, plant and equipment in the year.
(b) Impairment of Intangible assets
The Group evaluates its intangible assets with finite lives for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under-
performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of the 
acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends. Where there is evidence of 
diminution in value, the intangible asset is reviewed to assess whether the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value.
Assets not subject to amortisation including goodwill and brands are tested annually for impairment, as discussed in note 14.
The recoverable amount is defined as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use, which in turn is the present value of the 
future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset. The estimate of value in use, and hence the outcome of the impairment test, 
is sensitive to the assumptions made about the revenue growth, EBITDA margin, the long-term growth rate of the relevant market, and 
the discount rate considered appropriate to reflect the time value of money and any risks specific to the asset that are not reflected in 
the cash flows.
(c) Provisions for restoration and decommissioning obligations
The provisions for restoration and decommissioning obligations are made based on the Group’ s best estimate of the likely committed 
cash outflow. These estimated outflows are discounted to net present value. The key estimates requiring judgement associated 
with calculating the provision relate to the cost to perform the necessary remediation work as at the reporting date together with 
determining the year of retirement. This estimation process requires specialist input and takes into consideration the discount rate, 
inflation rate and the useful lives of sites.
(d) Accounting for customer rebates
The Group has a number of contracts with its customers which contain volume driven rebate mechanisms. Management are required 
to make judgements regarding the expected rebate achievement and make appropriate allowance for these uncertain liabilities. 
(e) Inventory valuation and provisioning
The carrying value of the Group’ s finished goods inventory, specifically the level of provisions recognised against potential 
obsolescence, requires commercial judgement.
(f) Share-based payments
Following admission to the London Stock Exchange, the Group launched a number of share-based payment reward schemes. 
External advice was sought both in the initial design of the schemes and in respect of the accounting judgements made regarding the 
outcome of performance targets, share performance and lapse rates.
(g) Exceptional items
Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the Consolidated Financial Statements where management believes it is necessary to do 
so to better understand the financial performance of the Group.
Management has considered both the costs associated with the IPO of the Group in April 2016 and costs relating to the separation 
from HeidelbergCement AG in 2015 and Forterra Inc in 2016 and has judged that presenting these transactions as exceptional items 
within the Consolidated Statement of T otal Comprehensive Income enables a full understanding of the Group’ s financial performance.

following additional performance measures beneficial in comparing the periods presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
(i) EBITDA before exceptional items
Management use EBITDA before exceptional items in calculating compliance with banking covenants. EBITDA is defined as earnings 
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. 
(ii) Pro-forma basis
Pro-forma basis is presented within earnings per share (note 13) as an additional performance measure and is adjusted for exceptional 
items, additional costs related to being a stand-alone plc and with finance costs restated to present the debt facility at IPO as if it had 
been in place throughout both years.

Plc related operating costs of £3.0m in 2016 have also been deducted in 2015 to show performance comparatively across both years.
Finance costs have been calculated for 2016 at £5.9m (2015: £5.8m) on the basis that the Group had the post IPO financing structure 
in place throughout both years. Up to the date of IPO both the debt level and interest rate on borrowings were significantly higher than 
the Group’ s post IPO financing arrangements.
On the basis of the adjustments made above, tax presented within the pro-forma information has been recalculated at the effective tax 
rate before exceptional items of 20.9% (2015: 21.1%).
4 Segmental reporting
Management has determined the operating segments based on the management reports reviewed by the Operating Board that are 
used to assess both performance and strategic decisions. Management has identified that the Operating Board is the chief operating 
decision maker in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 8 ‘Operating segments’.
The Operating Board considers the business to be split into three operating segments: Bricks, Blocks and Bespoke Products. 
The principal activity of the operating segments are:
• Bricks – Manufacture and sale of bricks to the building sector
• Blocks – Manufacture and sale of concrete blocks to the building sector
• Bespoke Products – Manufacture and sale of bespoke products to the building sector
The Operating Board considers that, for reporting purposes, the operating segments above can be aggregated into two reporting 
segments: Bricks and Blocks and Bespoke Products. The aggregation of Bricks and Blocks is due to these operating segments 
having similar long-term average margins, production process, suppliers, customers and distribution methods.
The Bespoke Products range includes precast concrete, permeable paving, chimney and roofing solutions, each of which are typically 
made-to-measure or customised to meet the customer’ s specific needs. The precast concrete flooring products are complemented 
by the Group’ s full design and nationwide installation services, while certain other bespoke products, including permeable paving and 
chimney flues, are complemented by the Group’ s bespoke specification and design service.
Costs which are incurred on behalf of both segments are held at the centre and these, together with general administrative expenses, 
have been allocated to the segments for reporting purposes using relative sales proportions. Management considers that this is an 
appropriate basis for the allocation.
The revenue recognised in the Consolidated Statement of T otal Comprehensive Income is all attributable to the principal activity of 
the manufacture and sale of bricks, both dense and lightweight blocks, precast concrete, concrete paving and other complimentary 
building products.
Substantially all revenue recognised in the Consolidated Statement of T otal Comprehensive Income arose within the UK.

Transaction costs in both years relate to the IPO completed in April 2016 and associated non-recurring professional fees. 
Management incentives related to the IPO amounted to £1.1m.
Separation costs relate to the separation from HeidelbergCement AG in 2015 and Forterra Inc in 2016 and include rebranding, new 
office fit out costs, set up of stand-alone IT operations and staff recruitment.
A cash tax indemnity payment was received in the year from HeidelbergCement AG relating to previous tax paid. It was initially 
recognised as a contingent asset at zero value but later revalued to £1.6m upon confirmation of receipt.
The impairment expense in 2015 was the result of an impairment review. The charge of £2.4m fully impaired the carrying value 
of goodwill in Structherm Limited. In October 2016 the Group disposed of its investment in Structherm Limited and ceased to 
consolidate its assets, liabilities and financial results.

The Directors are proposing a final dividend for 2016 of 3.8p per share, making a total payment for the year of 5.8p (2015: nil).
The proposed final dividend is subject to approval by the shareholders at the AGM and has not been included as a liability in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.
13 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to shareholders of the parent entity by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share additionally allows for the effect 
of the conversion of the dilutive options.
As the Group did not exist in its current form for the comparative period and throughout the current period, basic and diluted EPS for 
2015 have not been presented and EPS for 2016 has been calculated as if the restructuring of the Group at IPO had occurred at the 
beginning of the period.

The carrying value of goodwill relates to the trade of Formpave, a CGU within the Bespoke Products reportable segment. 
Goodwill disposals in 2016 and the impairment charge in 2015 relate to Structherm Limited which was fully impaired before being 
disposed of in October 2016. Until this date Structherm Limited was also a CGU within the Bespoke Products segment.
The brand category comprises the acquired Thermalite brand, a component of the Bricks and Blocks reportable segment.
Other intangibles consists of clay rights, carbon emission rights, merchant relationships, order book, patent and software development 
costs. These are attributable to both reportable segments. Additions in the period relate to costs incurred upgrading Group IT systems.
Impairment of intangible assets
(i) Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives consist of the Thermalite brand which is allocated to the Thermalite CGUs within the Bricks 
and Blocks reportable segment when undertaking annual impairment tests.
The Group estimates the recoverable amount of CGUs using a value in use model by projecting pre-tax cash flows over the estimated 
useful life. The key assumptions underpinning the recoverable amount of the CGUs are forecast revenue, EBITDA margin, capital 
expenditure and discount rate. 
The forecast revenues in the model are based on management’ s past experience and future expectations of performance. The discount 
rate used in 2016 is pre-tax 10.6% (2015: 10%) derived from a WACC calculation and benchmarked against similar organisations operating 
within the sector . The terminal growth rate used in 2016 is 2% (2015: 2%). The short-term growth rate is 3% in 2016 (2015: 2%).
The recoverable amount in respect of the indefinite life intangibles, as assessed by management using the above assumptions, is 
greater than the carrying amount and therefore no impairment charge has been booked in 2016 (2015: £2.4m). Management consider 
that it is not reasonably possible for the assumptions to change so significantly as to eliminate headroom in each of the years 
presented in these Consolidated Financial Statements.

(ii) Goodwill
The goodwill balance of £6.0m (2015: £6.0m) relates to the Formpave CGU allocated to the Bespoke Products reportable segment. 
The Group estimates the recoverable amount of goodwill using a value in use model by projecting pre-tax cash flows over the 
estimated useful life. The key assumptions underpinning the recoverable amount of the goodwill are forecast revenue, EBITDA margin, 
capital expenditure and discount rate.
The forecast revenues in the model are based on management’ s past experience and future expectations of performance. 
The discount rate used in 2016 is pre-tax 10.6% (2015: 10%) derived from a WACC calculation and benchmarked against similar 
organisations operating within the sector. The terminal growth rate used in 2016 is 2% (2015: 2%). The short-term growth rate is 
3% in 2016 (2015: 2%). Management consider that it is not reasonably possible for the assumptions to change so significantly as to

Deferred tax is calculated on temporary differences between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts, using the 
corporation tax rate applicable to the timing of their reversal.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset and there is an intention to settle the 
balances net.
Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of all tax losses and other temporary differences where it is probable that these 
assets will be recovered.

£150 million term loan facility and a £30 million revolving credit facility for five years. Interest is payable on amounts drawn down under 
the agreement at a rate of LIBOR plus a variable margin ranging from 1.50% to 2.75%. The margin for 2016 was set at 2.25%.
The facility is subject to both financial and non-financial covenants and is secured by fixed charges over the shares of Forterra Building

The financial assets of the Group, cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables are derived directly from operations. 
For financial liabilities of the Group, trade and other payables are derived directly from operations and loans and borrowings and 
derivative financial liabilities are arranged to finance operating and investing activities. 
Financial risk management
The Group’ s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks (including movements in foreign currency and interest rates), credit risk and 
liquidity risk. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage certain risks. The risk management framework governing the 
management of these and all other business risks is set by the Board.

Foreign exchange risk:
The functional and presentational currency of the Group is Pounds Sterling although some transactions are executed in Euros and a 
small amount in US Dollars. The transactional amounts realised or settled are therefore subject to the effect of movements in these 
currencies against Pounds Sterling. Management of foreign currency exposure is centrally managed by the Group Treasury function 
using forward foreign exchange contracts and currency options. The principles of hedge accounting are not applied.
Principal rate of exchange: Euro/Sterling
2016 2015
Period end 1.19  1.36 
Average 1.23  1.38 
The Group has entered into forward foreign currency contracts and options to mitigate exchange rate risk for certain foreign currency 
payables. At 31 December 2016, outstanding contracts maturing within 6 months amounted to €1.7m (2015: €nil) and outstanding 
contracts maturing between 6-12 months amounted to €1.3m (2015: €nil). In addition the Group had currency options for the same 
amounts maturing over the same periods (2015: €nil).
Interest rate risk:
The Group’ s borrowings include a revolving credit facility and term loan facility agreement with a group of leading banks. These facilities 
allow the Group to meet short, medium and long-term financing requirements at a margin over LIBOR. The Group manages interest 
rate risk on an ongoing basis and reviews options available to hedge part of the variable rate risk.
Credit risk:
Credit risk associated with trade receivables results from normal commercial operations and procedures exist to ensure that customer 
credit worthiness is assessed and monitored sufficiently and appropriate credit limits are in place and enforced. Trade and other 
receivables are stated net of management estimated bad debt provisions. Deposits with banking institutions also give rise to credit risk. 
T o dilute and mitigate the risk the Group deposits cash and cash equivalents with highly rated counterparties.
Liquidity risk:
The Group’ s borrowing facilities are available to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity to exceed maximum forecast cash flow 
requirements in all reasonably possible circumstances. The Group monitors cash flow on a weekly basis to ensure that headroom 
exists within current agreed facilities and updates the Board on liquidity and cash flow at Board meetings.
The maturity profile of contractual undiscounted cash outflows, including expected interest payments, which are payable under 
financial liabilities at the balance sheet date is set out below:

difference between the cash inflows and outflows and the difference between fair value and carrying value is insignificant.

All non-current provisions are discounted at a rate of 2.65% (2015: 2.65%).
The provisions balance is made up of provisions for restoration and decommissioning, carbon emissions, dilapidations, defective 
materials, restructuring and legal costs.
Non-cash movements on provisions, as disclosed within the Statement of Changes in Cash Flows, is the sum of additional provisions 
and release of provisions in the period.
Restoration and decommissioning
The Group is required to restore quarrying sites to a state agreed with the planning authorities after extraction of raw materials ceases 
and to decommission manufacturing facilities that have been constructed. The provisions for restoration and decommissioning 
are made based on the management’ s best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligations, taking account of suitably 
qualified and experienced consultants and after establishing the costs in line with current practice and standards. These provisions 
are discounted by applying a discount rate that reflects the passage of time. Estimates are revised annually and in the case of 
decommissioning provisions are adjusted against the asset to which the provision relates, which is then subject to an impairment 
assessment. Future costs are expected to be incurred over the useful life of the sites which is a period of up to 50 years.
The impact of changes in discount rate and inflation rates on the provision at year end was nil (2015: £0.5m).
When re-estimating the remaining useful lives of the Group’ s facilities, where the cessation of extraction creates an expectation that 
short-term restoration activities are probable, management have reclassified some restoration provisions from non-current in 2015 to 
current in 2016.

Prior to IPO, the Group’ s immediate parent undertaking was LSF9 Concrete UK Ltd, a company dual-registered in Jersey, and 
England and Wales, and under the control of Lone Star Funds.
Following the IPO, LSF9 Concrete UK Ltd retained ownership of 128,666,827 ordinary shares representing 64.3% of the issued share 
capital at the date of listing. On 26 May 2016 LSF9 Concrete UK Ltd transferred its shareholding to another company, LSF9 Concrete 
II Limited, also under the control of Lone Star Funds. As a result, at 31 December 2016 Lone Star Funds qualifies as a ‘controlling 
shareholder’ under the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (LR 6.1.2A). The relationship agreement entered into to 
ensure that Lone Star Funds complies with the independence provisions set out in LR 6.1.4D is detailed on page 44 of the Corporate 
Governance Statement.
Up to 13 March 2015, related parties were entities within HeidelbergCement AG. From 13 March 2015 onwards, related parties are 
entities under common ownership of Lone Star Funds. All related party transactions and balances have been undertaken in the normal 
course of business and on an arm’ s length basis. 
Prior to IPO, the funding structure of Forterra Building Products Limited was such that the Group loaned money to/from affiliates of 
Lone Star Funds. In the process of listing on the London Stock Exchange, the Group undertook a reorganisation which eliminated 
these balances. These transactions resulted in all related party receivables and payables at that time being set-off, part of the 
borrowings from related parties being capitalised and the remaining borrowings being settled using proceeds from new external loans 
and borrowings.
As at 31 December 2016, payables due to related parties relate to recharges for IT services and insurance costs. There were no other 
related party transactions requiring disclosure, other than compensation of the key management personnel.
Transactions with key management personnel
Key management personnel are those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of 
the Group. The Directors of the Company and the Directors of the Group’ s subsidiary companies fall within this category.

Strategic Report Financial Statements Shareholder Information Governance Notes to the Company Financial Statements
1 General background
Forterra plc is a public limited company, listed on the London Stock Exchange and domiciled and incorporated in the UK under 
the Companies Act 2006. The Company was incorporated on 21 January 2016 and therefore no comparative information has 
been presented.
2 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Company Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards, the Financial Reporting 
Standard applicable in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland (‘FRS 102’) and the Companies Act 2006. As the Company 
has not previously prepared Financial Statements, no transition exemptions or exceptions have been applied and no reconciliations 
are presented.
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, an entity profit or loss account is not included as part of the published 
Financial Statements of Forterra plc. The Company profit for the financial period ended 31 December 2016 was £4.2m.
As permitted by FRS 102, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation 
to presentation of a cash flow statement, standards not yet effective and related party transactions. Where required, equivalent 
disclosures are given in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company Financial Statements are presented in Pounds Sterling, rounded to the nearest hundred thousand and are prepared 
under the historical cost convention.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for at least one year from the date that the Financial Statements are signed. The Company therefore adopts the 
going concern basis in preparing its Financial Statements.
(a) Investments
Investments are included in the balance sheet at the deemed cost of acquisition upon the Group restructure. Where appropriate, a 
provision is made for any impairment in their value. 
Capital contributions arising where subsidiary employees are awarded share options to be settled over the Company’ s equity result in 
increases to the cost of investment.
(b) Taxation
Charges for income tax are based on earnings for the period and take account of deferred taxation on timing differences between the 
treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation 
and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
(c) Financial instruments
The Company determines the classification of financial assets and financial liabilities at initial recognition. The principal financial assets 
and liabilities of the Company are as follows:
(i) Financial assets
Basic financial assets, including trade and other receivables, amounts due from Group undertakings and cash and bank balances are 
initially recognised at transaction price, unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the transaction is measured 
at the present value of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest. Such assets are subsequently carried at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method and assessed for objective evidence of impairment or impairment reversal at the end of each 
reporting period.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, are settled or substantially all the 
risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are transferred.
(ii) Financial liabilities
Basic financial liabilities, including trade and other payables and amounts due to related parties are initially recognised at the 
transaction price, unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the debt is measured at the present value of the 
future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest.
Trade and other payables and loans are subsequently carried at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.

Forterra plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 (d) Share-based payments
The Company operates a number of equity-settled share-based compensation plans, under which the Company receives services 
from the Executive Directors in exchange for equity instruments granted by the Company. The services received and corresponding 
increase in equity are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments granted, on the date granted. The Company also 
compensates certain key management and other employees for services provided to Forterra Building Products Limited. The services 
provided are recognised as an increase in the cost of investment in subsidiaries and a corresponding increase in equity; which is 
measured at the fair value of the equity instruments granted, on the date granted. 
The cost of the equity-settled transactions are subsequently recognised over the vesting period, which ends at the date that the plan 
participant becomes fully entitled to the award. Fair values are determined using appropriate pricing models by external valuers. At the 
end of each reporting period the Company revises its estimate of the number of awards that are expected to vest based on non-
market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the profit or loss, with a corresponding 
adjustment to equity.
Further details regarding the share-based payment schemes are set out in note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
(e) Own shares held by employee benefit trusts
The Company has established two separate employee benefit trusts for the purposes of satisfying awards under share-based 
incentive schemes. Shares in the Company acquired by the trusts are deducted from equity until shares vest or are cancelled, reissued 
or disposed. At 31 December 2016 442,068 ordinary shares had been issued into trust. Shares were issued at nominal value, 
therefore, although the Trust has been consolidated within the Company Financial Statements there is no monetary impact to the 
Statement of Changes in Equity in the period presented.
(f) Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in share premium 
as a deduction from proceeds.
(g) Related parties
The Company discloses transactions with related parties which are not wholly owned within the same Group. Where appropriate, 
transactions of a similar nature are aggregated unless, in the opinion of the Directors, separate disclosure is necessary to understand 
the effect of the transactions on the Company Financial Statements.
3 Critical accounting judgements and estimates
(a) Share-based payments
Following Admission to the London Stock Exchange, the Company launched a number of share-based payment reward schemes. 
External advice was sought both in the initial design of the schemes and in respect of the accounting judgements made regarding the 
outcome of performance targets, share performance and lapse rates.
(b) Impairment of fixed asset investments
The Directors periodically review fixed asset investments for possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in 
managements’ judgement, that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company did not record any impairment 
charges during the period ended 31 December 2016.
4 Employee information
The Company has no employees other than the Directors. Full details of the Directors’ remuneration and interests are set out in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration on pages 63 to 69.

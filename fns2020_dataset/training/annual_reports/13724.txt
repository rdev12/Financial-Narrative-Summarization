 on the Krasnoleninsky Arch 
hydrocarbon bearing formation in 
Western Siberia, a major oil producing 
region in Russia.
As at 31 December, 2012 we had proved 
reserves of 234 million barrels of oil 
equivalent (‘boe’) and proved plus 
probable reserves of 1.838 billion boe.
We produce and sell crude oil and gas 
condensate and produce petroleum gas 
as an associated product. The Company 
has its own metering station at the 
Transneft pipeline through which it 
can sell its crude oil to end-customers 
throughout Europe.
The area in which we are situated 
has a well-developed infrastructure 
and an established service industry for 
hydrocarbon production. This includes 
Federal highways and the national rail 
network. The eld has access to the local 
electricity grid and the in- eld terrain 
and infrastructure allow for the 
year-round production of oil.
The core ‘know-how’ for an oil and gas company is the 
ability to predictively model the performance of wells. 
The de ning physics inherent in these models are based on 
Darcy’s aw. This is the equation governing the ow of uid 
through a porous medium. Ruspetro uses Darcy’s Law as 
the foundation of our performance-oriented, quantitative 
approach to oil eld development. For performance 
management, we use Darcy’s Law as follows:
represents the geological and petro-physical 
properties inherent in the rock – permeability, 
oil viscosity, and the thickness of the oil 
bearing zone. The goal of our geological team 
and our geological model is to pick 
bottom-hole locations maximizing 
  
.
represents the pressure differential 
between the reservoir and the well bore at 
the perforations. The greater this pressure 
differential, the greater the rate of oil ow. 
Our operations team seeks to maximize 
this differential by using electric submersible 
pumps to minimize hydrostatic pressure in 
the well bore (keeping the wells ‘pumped-off’), 
while using water injection to maximize 
pressure in the reservoir. Ruspetro’s 
hydrodynamic model is the guide for this 
endeavor, acting as a tool to identify injectors 
and maximize ood ef ciency (sweep).
is a variable which represents completion 
– mathematically the radius of the well 
bore in relation to the oil bearing formation 
whether as a simple perforated well or with 
an increased radius due to fracturing or 
horizontal drilling. Every fracture or other 
form of stimulation results in a . We manage 
performance in fracture engineering and 
execution using  as our yardstick.

Our assets
Ruspetro has three exploration and 
production licenses making up one 
contiguous eld of 1,205 km
2
.
The three licenses are the Pottymsko-
Inginsky (‘PI’) License in the west of 
the eld, the ostochno-Inginsky (‘ I’) 
License in the center of the eld and the 
Palyanovsky License on the north east 
of the eld. The License Blocks are 
situated in an area with well-developed 
infrastructure including national 
pipelines, highways, roads, rail freight 
terminals and power supply lines.
Each of the Company’s three licenses 
is a combined exploration and 
production license. 
Our license for the Palyanovsky block is 
due to expire in December 2015 having 
been extended in December 2012. 
The I license expires in une 2014 
and the PI License Block expires 
in une 2017.
We expect that the licenses will be 
renewed for the economic lives of the 
 elds although they could be granted 
for a period less than requested.
The Subsoil Law, as currently in effect, 
allows for the extension of a subsoil 
license at the request of the license 
holder if such extension is necessary to 
 nish exploration or production in the 
 eld(s) covered by the license, provided 
that the license holder has not violated 
the terms of the license and ful lled 
its conditions.
As a result, to the extent that we meet 
our obligations under the applicable 
minimum work program required by 
the licenses and are not in breach of 
any license obligations or conditions, 
each of our licenses issued prior to 
this legislation can be extended, 
upon expiration, for the economic 
life of the eld.

Chairman’s statement
“ We take considerable encouragement 
from the reserves upgrade, the second 
since our otation. 2012 was a profoundly challenging 
year for Ruspetro. The outturn, in 
terms of production, and consequently 
returns for our shareholders, was 
disappointing. But to assess the 
Company’s performance fully, one 
must also look deeper into all levels 
of the Company’s operations. Here, I 
have been encouraged by a number of 
positive developments and above all by 
the tenacity of my executive colleagues 
in getting to grips with the challenges 
in the business.
While in private ownership, Ruspetro 
had existed on the lightest footprint 
possible to conserve resources before 
the commencement of substantial cash 
 ows. As a result, post IPO, the senior 
executive team has had not only to carry 
forward the eld development program 
but also to build the Company. I am 
particularly impressed by the speed 
and thoroughness with which Don, 
Tom, Alexander and their colleagues 
have completed this exercise. We have 
recruited a strong international team 
with experience from a variety of 
operating environments around the 
world. At a time of human resource 
shortage in our industry, I am 
encouraged by the caliber of recruits, 
and take this as an endorsement of the 
quality and potential of our business. 
We now have all the necessary human, 
technical and engineering resource 
in our three centers: the London plc 
of ce, the Moscow operational center 
and the Siberian eld of ces to handle 
the anticipated growth in the business.

“ In what has been a challenging 
year for the business I should 
like to thank all our employees 
who have worked with great 
dedication to carry us through 
this period.”
Securing further nancing is essential 
for the continued development of the 
 eld. In this regard, we are discussing 
our nancial requirements with our 
major lender and we aim to secure this 
 nancing in the near future.
In what has been a challenging year 
for the business I should like to thank 
all our employees who have worked 
with great dedication to carry us 
through this period. My thanks 
should also go to my fellow Board 
members who have been engaged in 
the business, giving vital, sometimes 
critical, but always supportive 
advice. Our commitment to the best 
governance remains absolute and 
we continue with our comprehensive 
monitoring and vigorous pursuit 
of any possible improvements to 
the Company’s Health, Safety and 
Environmental performance.
Christopher Clark
Chairman
Turning to our assets, despite the 
challenges of production, we take 
considerable encouragement from the 
further increases to our proved and 
probable hydrocarbon reserves, the 
second since otation announced post 
year end. At these levels, the scale and 
quality of our reserves provide a basis 
of full con dence for our medium and 
long-term production plans. However, 
in the short term, we have to recognize 
that technical issues of recovery have 
frustrated our ambition in 2012. 
Varying permeability and lower than 
expected ow rates in the rst half and 
much higher associated gas production 
in the second, both presented technical 
challenges for the management team. 
Here too, I have been impressed by the 
adaptability and energy that the senior 
executive team have shown. For 
example, the emergence of a gas and 
condensate play in the north east of 
our eld, while creating a technical 
challenge, has markedly bene ted 
cash ows. 
The construction of pipelines, the 
structuring and signing of contractual 
supply relationships for fracturing, 
the completion of processing facilities, 
and nally the development of the 
condensate processing plant in the 
depths of the Siberian winter are all 
real proof of the team’s resourcefulness 
and drive. It is on this basis that I am 
con dent we are equal to the tasks 
ahead, and that stakeholders can expect 
the operational picture to improve.

Associated gas production
A potential new revenue stream
Gas monetization
With signi cant gas reserves and 
production and accessible sales points 
available, associated gas production at 
Ruspetro may contribute signi cantly 
to our revenues in coming years. 
Associated gas production is 
currently 1.6 million cubic meters 
per day (9,400 boepd) due, in large 
part, to signi cant gas production 
in the Palyanovo condensate eld. 
This production is now being ared 
and as such is lost revenue for 
the Company. 
As stated in the 31 December 2012 
DeGolyer and MacNaughton 
reserves’ audit, the Company has 
proved and probable gas reserves 
of 153 million boe. 
The Company has recently signed 
an ‘Agreement of Intent’ to supply 
OJSC Fortum, a subsidiary of a 
leading Finland based electricity 
generator, with dry gas for eight 
years. This is projected to generate 
revenues for the Company of up to 
US$700 million during this period.
The Company has already made 
substantial progress designing the 
gas processing plant and pipeline 
required to commercialize the gas 
and is seeking to arrange the 
required nancing for this project. 
These elements may be completed by 
the middle of 2014, putting Ruspetro 
in a position to market and sell dry 
gas locally or via the Gazprom 
pipeline network.
The processing plant will not only 
enable the Company to sell dry gas 
to the generating plant in Nyagan 
but will also increase the ef ciency 
of our condensate production, 
thereby increasing yields 
substantially. Additional products 
resulting from the processing of 
gas will include large quantities 
of propane and butane which can 
be sold commercially from the 
plant as liquids.
Gas arin The penalties for gas aring paid 
in 2012 totaled US$850,000 under 
the law in force during the period. 
The regulations for gas aring and 
emission limits, however, have been 
revised and as a consequence we will 
not suffer penalties for associated 
gas aring as described below. 
According to the Russian Federation 
Government legislation, effective 
1 January 2013, companies involved 
in the production of associated gas 
are required to reduce the amount of 
 aring of associated gas to 5% or less 
of the overall amount of associated 
gas produced, with the exception of 
early stage production companies. 
Ruspetro, as an early stage 
production company as de ned 
under the law, can are up to 100% 
of its associated petroleum gas for 
three years or until our proved and 
probable reserves are depleted by 
5%. Depletion, as at 31 December 
2012, is less than 1% of the proved 
and probable reserves of the eld.
The gas utilization and 
commercialization plan as described 
above for the gas produced in this 
area will reduce aring, therefore 
eliminating future penalties, and 
optimize the economic potential to 
the Company of the produced gas. Ruspetro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

CEO’s strategic review  
and update
“ The immediate challenge was to increase 
the pace of development of the Company. The Ruspetro team made some 
signi cant accomplishments during 
2012. Unfortunately, we did not meet 
our principal objective which was to 
reach a 10,400 boepd production target. 
I am sincerely disappointed with that 
result. Nonetheless, we did achieve a 
great deal. We created a business that 
ef ciently develops, produces and sells 
hydrocarbons.
Following our Initial Public Offering 
(‘IPO’) on 19 January 2012 we needed 
to move quickly and accomplish six 
key objectives, which were to:
1) Build a team.
2)  Develop sales, treatment and access 
infrastructure urgently.
3) Grow production.
4)  Improve reserve quality by 
increasing the proved category (1P).
5)  Develop a strategy to develop and 
monetize our gas resources.
6)  Improve the Company’s nancial 
performance towards becoming cash 
 ow positive. Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Ruspetro plc

Key partnerships
One of the main risks to our business 
is execution. Part of the challenge is 
to manage the contractors working 
with us to develop our eld and 
ensure they share our vision and 
values and respect how we operate. 
This vision includes timely and 
accurate execution of projects along 
with strict adherence to best practice 
HSE standards. Without contractors 
sharing our vision and working with 
us to maintain the highest standards, 
it is dif cult to maintain consistent 
best practice standards across 
the eld.
Our business relies on close 
cooperation with a number of 
contractors to whom we outsource 
many of our operational functions. 
During 2012, having been let down 
by two fracturing service providers, 
we built a strong relationship with 
Weatherford in the last quarter of 
the year. They were able to ful ll the 
well completion schedule that had 
fallen behind due to the lack of 
capacity of our previous fracturing 
service providers. Building this 
type of long-term, reliable, mutually 
bene cial relationship is key to 
the successful execution of our 
long-term objectives.
 nance, legal, human resources and 
HSE departments both in the head 
of ce in Moscow and in our UK plc 
of ce in London. 
This team executed our eld 
development program successfully 
by mobilizing four additional rigs in 
the eld over the course of the year 
and drilling 33 wells whilst improving 
the surface infrastructure to provide 
access, electricity and pipelines to 
all working pads. This also included 
building and commissioning the 27km 
sales pipeline ahead of schedule and 
signi cantly under budget. The 
Company now has 15,000 bopd of 
processing capacity for our crude oil 
production in our west eld area, and 
9,000 bopd of processing capacity for 
condensate and 3 million cubic meters 
of gas processing capacity per day in the 
north of the eld. The team continues to 
exceed the regional benchmarks in the 
construction of pipelines, power lines, 
roads and facilities.
While the Company made great strides 
in putting in signi cant infrastructure 
quickly and at a lower cost than budgeted, 
growing production at the tempo we had 
initially planned proved to be dif cult. 
Our plan at IPO was to continue 
development of the structural high in the 
west of the eld. Our mapping showed the 
geology progressing on-trend to the east 
and west from Pad 21. As we had some 
existing infrastructure to the east of Pad 
21 and knowledge of the formations from 
3D seismic, we directed our development 
efforts in this direction by building Pad 19, 
The immediate challenge was to 
increase the pace of development of 
the Company. To do this we needed to 
get more rigs into operation, start and 
complete on schedule the construction 
of a sales pipeline to link the Company’s 
processing facility with the Transneft 
pipeline network, build a pump station 
and increase oil treatment capacity. 
At the time of the IPO, we had only 
one rig in operation on Pad 21, with 
no more room for expansion to drill 
further wells. For other rigs to be 
activated, we needed to extend existing 
pads and build the roads, power lines 
and pipelines to connect them. Within 
days of the IPO, we began procurement 
of the pipe for the 27km sales pipeline 
and in parallel began trenching 
operations. Concurrently, we started 
extending Pad 21 in preparation for 
more drilling. This level of activity, 
while impressive, did require a more 
capable team to manage the multiple 
parallel processes for this pace of 
 eld development. 
During the year, we increased the 
size of our team considerably in order 
to be able to gain the expertise and 
management capability necessary to 
triple our drilling program, build-out 
the required infrastructure, increase 
our production and improve our 
understanding of the eld. The new 
team needed to be able to deliver on 
our fast paced rollout. We were able to 
bring key people into the Company with 
both international and local business 
backgrounds. They have roles and 
responsibilities throughout the 
business, in operations, in our 
subsurface department and in the

Staff
Since our IPO, we have considerably 
increased the size of our team in order 
to be able to gain the expertise and 
management capability necessary to 
increase our production and improve 
our understanding of the eld. Key 
new hires include Robert Stewart, who 
heads our production and operations 
and is based in the eld. Robert has 
28 years of industry experience 
with Conoco. Nick De’ Ath, formerly 
of TNK-BP with over 30 years 
of industry experience, heads our 
Subsurface Team. John Krupa has 
joined us from Exillon as Senior 
Geophysicist. He also has over 30 years 
of industry experience. We have also 
made senior appointments to head 
drilling, workovers and fracturing.
In addition to our operations and 
subsurface team, we have made key 
appointments in the nance, legal, 
human resources and 
HSE departments.
We are focused on promoting a 
performance based culture. To do 
this, we are developing an incentive 
program structured to deliver optimal 
performance from our team.

condensate production during the year, 
several upgrades to the production system 
were conducted including upgrading the 
in eld pipelines, separation, water 
disposal and testing equipment.
At the end of 2012, it was necessary to 
further upgrade the EPF to manage the 
large volumes of gas production and to 
dissipate the heat carried to the surface 
by the gas and condensate production. 
A heat exchange system, new separators 
and larger diameter ow lines were 
all added to the facility to bring the 
temperature and pressure of the 
well production to a point whereby the 
condensate could be stabilized. However, 
when the heat exchange system was 
commissioned reservoir pressure decline 
and the resultant drop in condensate 
yield meant that condensate production 
did not rise as initially expected.
The increased gas supply and reserves 
identi ed by the development work 
in the north of the eld has been 
instrumental in pushing forward 
our gas utilization and monetization 
strategy. This strategy is discussed 
in more detail on page 09.
From the Company’s inception it has 
been our stated aim to increase the 
quality of our reserves. 2012 saw a 35% 
increase in our proved reserves, which 
now stand at 234 mmboe. This is a 
61 mmboe increase of which 29 mmboe 
are the proved gas reserves added 
due to the development of the gas and 
condensate play in the north of the eld.
The respectable current gas production 
in the north of the eld associated with 
the condensate we are selling presents 
the potential for a signi cant gas 
business for Ruspetro that will enhance 
our pro tability when brought on-line. 
This was not something that we 
envisaged to be feasible a year ago. 
We are currently producing about 
1.6 million cubic meters per day 
(9,400 boepd).
We have been developing a gas 
monetization plan to allow us to sell 
our associated petroleum gas to several 
potential clients. The initial primary 
customer is a commercial electricity 
generating plant being constructed in 
the region. Other potential customers 
are available via the Gazprom pipeline 
network, which is beginning to open up 
in response to the Russian Government’s 
drive towards greater utilization of 
associated gas by oil producers.
The planning process for a gas processing 
plant and pipeline is under way and we 
intend to start building during the winter 
of 2013 with revenues from the project 
beginning to be realized in the second 
half of 2014. The gas business will have 
relatively low operating costs and thus 
will become another high margin 
revenue stream for Ruspetro.
erecting a rig and beginning to drill. After 
drilling several wells in different areas 
from Pad 19, we were met by consistently 
lower permeability than we had found 
previously. The reservoir rock had similar 
thickness and in some cases superior 
porosity to the reservoir accessible from 
Pad 21 but, due to the lower permeability, 
the wells were only yielding 
approximately 150 bopd of initial rate 
after fracture treatment. At the same time 
that we were experiencing poor reservoir 
quality from Pad 19, we were getting 
better results from the gas-condensate 
reservoir in the north of the eld. 
The gas-condensate eld provided 
two positives. Firstly, the well rates 
and reservoir quality, while variable, 
were on average better than our 
 ndings from Pad 19. Secondly, the 
Mineral Extraction Tax (‘MET’) for 
condensate is approximately US$20 less 
per barrel than for crude oil. This lower 
 scal burden nearly doubled the Well 
Head Revenue (‘WHR’) of production 
on a per barrel basis.
The combination of the higher ow 
rates and the much lower rate of MET 
currently makes condensate far more 
cash generative to produce and sell than 
crude oil. In the second half of the year, 
we capitalized on this and refocused 
our drilling strategy towards this 
condensate rich area. To do this, it was 
necessary to mobilize rigs and build 
an early processing facility (‘EPF’) to 
stabilize the condensate before it could 
be taken to its destination re nery by 
truck and rail. With the increase in gas and

Conclusion
Over the course of 2012, we increased our 
proved reserves base as well as the pace 
of well completions. We have completed 
the surface infrastructure necessary to 
build production and have engaged 
the necessary contractors to ensure 
an optimal well completion tempo. 
We identi ed signi cant contributions 
from higher-value condensate which 
has, in turn, driven a change in direction 
for our short-term initiatives. 
We have gained valuable insights into 
the characteristics of our eld in 2012, 
marking it out as a year of delineation 
for Ruspetro. Although there have been 
some disappointments, we have the 
measures in place to capitalize on the 
vast potential of our eld. The years 
ahead will draw on these insights to 
allow us to effectively exploit the 
intrinsic value of Ruspetro’s assets.

Outlook
Our main priority for 2013 is to deliver 
on our growing cash generation. We will 
continue to develop the gas-condensate 
play in the north of the eld. This will 
help to build our revenues and cash 
 ows, which will give us the exibility 
to grow our business signi cantly 
in the coming years. 
Building production and making sure 
that we execute our drilling program 
are the main tasks ahead of us now. 
We will look to expand our gas business 
to sell substantially all of the associated 
gas produced to third parties from the 
second half of 2014.
In our crude oil area, we will continue 
to expand water ood operations as 
we are now seeing stabilization, and 
in some cases increases, in reservoir 
pressures. This is beginning to generate 
production enhancement opportunities 
and will continue to do so in 2013. 
We will also look to resume drilling 
and increase the range of completion 
technologies used to optimize 
production from the varying geology 
of the eld in 2013.
With these aims in mind we are 
currently working with our lender 
to arrange the required nancing.

Drilling advances 
 ringing ef ciency to the eld
During the year we looked at ways to 
reduce our drilling times. One of the 
critical issues causing longer than 
necessary drilling times was the low 
rate of penetration by the drill bits 
being used and the need to change 
bits during the drilling of a well.
The rig contractors started the 
year using Chinese PDC bits in 
the Cretaceous and Jurassic zones, 
generating a rate of penetration of 
28.3m/hr, and tricone bits in the 
Paleozoic zone averaging 3.9m/hr. 
Apart from the slow rate of 
penetration, changing the bit during 
drilling also delayed the process.
Working with the drilling contractors 
and a western drill bit manufacturer we 
developed a PDC bit speci cally 
designed to drill the entire section 
in one bit run. The rate of penetration 
increased signi cantly to 57.3m/hr 
in the Cretaceous and Jurassic and 
19.4m/hr in the Paleozoic without 
needing to be changed through the 
entire section.

Audited proved reserves
(mmboe)
Operating and nancial review
Our reserves are audited twice 
yearly by DeGolyer and MacNaughton. 
The 31 December 2012 audit includes, 
for the rst time, the characterisation 
of the gas and condensate producing 
formation in the Palyanovo License 
Block in the north east of the eld. 
For the rst time we now have signi cant 
proved and probable gas reserves in our 
 eld. We are currently treating and 
selling some of our condensate, and 
are developing treatment and delivery 
systems to monetize the remainder 
of the gas and gas liquids.
We will continue to migrate probable 
reserves to proved and proved reserves 
to proved-developed as we expand our 
drilling program, deliver water ood 
results and re ne our geological and 
hydrodynamic models. Increases will 
come from increased recovery factors 
driven primarily by water ood 
operations and changes in our OOIP 
and geological model as we re ne and 
reprocess our seismic and well test data.
We are continually developing 
our understanding of the eld, by 
reprocessing the 3D seismic and 
historical log data that we acquired 
with the eld and by increasing our 
data set with each additional well 
drilled. We believe that there remains 
substantial additional opportunity 
Resource potential
Proved reserves have increased 
by 35% since our 31 December 2011 
audit to 234 million barrels of oil 
equivalent (‘mmboe’), of which 
205 mmboe are liquids.
The Company currently has 
proved-developed reserves of 
approximately 16.1 million barrels of 
oil and condensate, this compares to 
11.6 million barrels as at 31 December 
2011, a gain of 40%. We will endeavor 
to grow these reserves over the coming 
years as our drilling program expands. 
Proved and probable (‘2P’) reserves have 
increased by 19% to 1.84 billion boe since 
our 31 December 2011 audit as a result of 
increased Original Oil in Place identi ed 
during ongoing geological work and the 
discovery and characterization of our gas 
and gas condensate eld in Palyanovo. 
The total increase in proved reserves 
was 61 mmboe.
in our eld in both conventional and 
unconventional reserves, and we will 
continue to develop and re ne our 
models through processing new 
well data and the acquisition and 
interpretation of new seismic data 
in the future.
Our next reserves audit will be dated 
30 June 2013.
 o elin our reser oirs
In 2012, the Company assembled 
a highly experienced subsurface 
department. Their aim is to de ne 
the architecture of our reservoir rocks, 
de ning how much oil is present within 
the pore spaces of the rock and how best 
to maximize the production of the oil.
The department is comprised of 
geologists (who describe the intricacies 
of the depositional environment and 
build a ‘geocellular’ or ‘static’ computer 
model of the reservoir); geophysicists 
(who use seismic surveys to help de ne 
the subsurface architecture); petro 
physicists (who de ne the character 
of the rock and the uids they contain); 
and reservoir engineers (who predict 
and model how the uids will move 
in the subsurface).
Our reservoirs are described by our 
geoscientists as thin, tight, Jurassic 
 uvial sandstones. This means they were 
deposited during the 150–200 million 
years’ time-period in a river system 
that in- lled a rift that formed as the 
Siberian tectonic plate started to break 
apart. The tensional forces pulling the 
earth’s crust apart (analogous to the 
present day Red Sea) gradually waned, 
however, and the rift failed.

Erosion of the surrounding uplands 
caused rivers to deposit ‘syn-rift’ 
sediments into the rift. That is to say, 
the uplands surrounding our area were 
quite low so only thin river sands were 
deposited at different times throughout 
the Jurassic period, referred to as the 
UK2 – UK10 sequence. 
The rift system was occasionally 
inundated by the Jurassic sea which lay 
to the north of our eld. When the sea 
encroached, it deposited marine shales, 
mudstones and silts. The principal 
incursions are represented by the 
Radom, Togur and Bazhenov shales; 
the latter being the nal inundation 
which covered most of West Siberia. 
Our Palyanovsky License Block in the 
north east was originally a broad valley. 
In this area, it is the uvial sands of 
UK8 – UK10 that are productive. 
In the Pottymsko-Inginsky License 
Block, in the west of the eld, a small 
basement high was still emergent 
during the later Jurassic period. The 
rivers, during this period, deposited 
their UK2 – UK3 uvial sediments in 
a radial fashion around the small high. 
It is these horizons that are productive 
for Ruspetro in this area and we have 
been producing them from Pad 21.
Because these sands were deposited 
in a rift system, rivers follow the lowest 
areas on the downthrown side of faults. 
Consequently, the connectivity of our 
thin reservoir sands is disrupted by both 
stratigraphic variation (the changing 
direction of rivers) and structural 
complexity (by faulting). This causes 
major challenges in de ning the actual 
area a production well will drain oil from 
as well as understanding which wells 
will be affected by the pressure support 
from water injection wells. 
We use seismic data, especially 3D 
data to help de ne the subsurface 
architecture of the reservoir but 
although we have three 3D cubes 
covering the northern part of our 
Licenses the quality needed to be 
enhanced in order to increase the 
probability of selecting bottom hole 
locations with the best productivity.
In the latter part of 2012 the 
subsurface department has been 
reprocessing the seismic that we 
have with the latest technology, 
in order to give greater clarity and 
enable future wells to be located with 
greater accuracy. As a second step 
the department will then be further 
processing the seismic to provide even 
greater clarity on how our reservoirs 
are distributed. At the same time we 
are acquiring more sophisticated well 
logs in some of our wells to de ne 
the rock physics. This data and 
information will be used to develop 
a much more accurate understanding 
of the reservoir rocks and uids and 
thus improve well predictability.

the Palyanovsky License Block, the

Crude oil and condensate production 
rather than black oil. Just as 
water changes its phase to ice when 
it is cold or steam when it is hot, so 
hydrocarbons change their phase 
depending on temperature and 
pressure. This not only occurs in 
the subsurface but also when the 
hydrocarbons are brought to 
the surface. 
In 2013, the department may 
investigate the production potential of 
the ‘unconventional’ reservoirs which 
are the hydrocarbon source rocks, 
most notably the Bazhenov Shale. 
Technological advancements applied 
to ‘unconventionals’ over the past 
decade, particularly in the US, have 
revolutionized the oil and gas industry 
across the world. Initial activity in our 
area will require detailed investigation 
of the shale potential which would then 
be followed by pilot horizontal wells 
drilled into the shale and multi-stage 
fractures performed along the 
horizontal length of the well. This 
technology may also be applicable 
to our conventional reservoirs.

and our seismic data improves, our static 
and dynamic models will constantly be

and gas reserves. 
 ales an marketin In 2012, the Company produced a 
total of 1,697,950bbls of oil of which 
1,650,294 was sold. An increase 
in production of 82% from 2011 
production of 935,003bbls. 
21% was crude oil sold for export 
via the Transneft pipeline system 
(350,791bbls). For export sales we work 
with Glencore plc, an international oil 
trading company, who sells our crude 
to a re nery in Hungary. Currently we 
have a quota to export up to 35% of 
our production.
We have recently delivered our rst 
crude oil cargo by tanker to Rotterdam 
in the Netherlands, demonstrating 
our exible approach to oil sales and 
commitment to maximizing our 
product prices. We remain opportunistic 
in our approach to sales and price 
maximization of our high quality crude 
and condensate. To achieve our net-back 
goals we have increased our evacuation 
routes and delivery options considerably 
since IPO. In addition to pipeline sales 
to local re neries, we are now able to sell 
crude oil and condensate in Russia and 
internationally by truck, rail, barge 
and tanker. Flexibility in our delivery 
destinations and a broader customer 
base is the key to maximizing pricing 
and we will continue to opportunistically 
explore and develop new ways to realize 
our hydrocarbons in 2013. 
In 2012, we completed our 27km sales 
pipeline connecting our treatment 
facility to the Transneft system and 
built an entirely new facility to treat 
gas and gas-condensate in our new 
gas eld. We also began preliminary 
route design for gas and condensate 
pipelines and the initial engineering 
for a gas processing plant in our 
Palyanovo eld. We will continue 
to improve on the existing treatment 
systems and continue developing 
our gas processing and pipeline 
infrastructure during 2013.
Condensate made up 15% of our sales 
volume in 2012 and 27% of our well 
head revenue. This product was sold 
directly to a domestic off-taker from 
the Early Processing Facility (‘EPF’). 
The off-taker arranges road and rail 
transport from the EPF and gives 
Ruspetro a price net of these costs.
In 2012 Ruspetro also earned US$1.4 
million by providing access to the 
Transneft pipeline via our metering 
station to third party oil producers 
in the region.

Water injection
The Company started its water injection program in June 2012 with the 
conversion of two wells to water injectors. Water ood increases recoveries 
through reservoir pressure maintenance and by mobilizing oil towards 
producing well bores (‘Sweep’), and is an integral part of our eld 
development plan.
We are beginning to see physical response to this activity, as modeled, which will 
enable us to slow or temporarily halt production declines attributed to pressure 
drop, and possibly create enhancement candidates in some of our well stock. 
We will also be submitting this empirical data to our reserves auditors and 
moving some parts of our eld further towards water ood recovery factors.
As part of this program, we have installed a water pumping station at the 
central processing facility that enables the Company to recirculate separated 
water back to the pads for reinjection into the formations. Ruspetro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Drillin The Company drilled 33 wells in 2012 
at a cost of US$66 million including 
fracturing and connections to our 
gathering system. During the year, we 
mobilized four rigs, two in the west of 
the eld drilling into the UK2 – UK3 
formation to produce crude oil and 
two in the north east of the eld 
drilling into the UK8 – UK10 
formations where we had identi ed 
a gas and condensate play.
Our drilling program in the west of 
the eld revealed two issues that we 
are currently addressing. First, that the 
reservoir pressure in the Pad 21 area has 
been lowered by historic production in 
this area and hydraulic communication 
between bottom-hole locations. Second, 
while drilling to the east of Pad 21 
revealed similar formation structure, 
thicker oil-bearing intervals and 
equivalent or better porosity, but upon 
completion the permeability of the sands 
and thus the ow-rate was shown to be 
signi cantly lower than that previously 
known on Pad 21.
To address the lower reservoir pressure 
we have initiated a water injection 
program in this area, beginning 
to convert producer wells to water 
injection wells in the middle of 2012. 
We have begun to see pressure 
response in neighboring wells 
as a result of the water ooding.
In order for the Company to predictively 
select higher quality bottom-hole 
locations across the eld, we will need 
to improve the resolution of our seismic 
maps and the geophysical clarity of our 
geological model. To achieve higher 
resolutions, we have completed some 
reprocessing and inversion analysis 
of the existing 2D and 3D seismic 
that covers 100% and 42% of the eld 
respectively. More detail about our 
reprocessing program can be found 
in the section Modeling our reservoirs 
on page 18.  Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Ruspetro plc

The Company had an average 39 day 
spud to completion time, of which 
21 days were required to drill and case 
a well. We added drilling contractors 
to the eld in 2012, most signi cantly 
with a Weatherford and a SSK rig. 
Both rigs are capable of best-in-class 
vertical well drilling times and quality. 
Both rigs are also capable of drilling 
horizontal sections.

fracture treatments as a standard

Fractures are designed individually for 
the zone of interest in a given well, and 
we employ world-class fracturing service 
contractors to implement our designs. 
Mathematically, a fracture is simply a 
much larger well bore, and provides a 
large increase in effective permeability 
and thus the ability of a given well to 
produce. At the beginning of the year, 
our international oil service contractors 
provided fracturing services in the eld 
with consistency. However, increasing 
demand in the neighboring elds during 
the year resulted in inconsistent fracture 
scheduling and delays in the completion 
of several wells. 
We therefore initiated and established a 
successful relationship with Weatherford 
International Ltd who, in the second 
half of the year, became our primary 
fracturing service contractor in the 
 eld. The relationship was advantageous 
to Weatherford as it allowed them to 
establish themselves in the region with 
a depot in our eld and a signi cant 
number of Ruspetro wells to be 
fractured. For the Company, it enabled 
us to bring our completion backlog up to 
date, allow new wells to be completed on 
schedule and gave us a consistent, high 
quality partner in the eld to meet our 
requirements going forward.
Infrastructure investment 
and delivery
2012 was a year in which we completed 
several key infrastructure projects at a 
speed and cost we believe to be highly 
competitive in our environment. 
Transportation, treatment and gathering 
infrastructure that we built in 2012 
will provide processing and evacuation 
capacity to support production growth 
for the next several years.
Immediately after our IPO we began work 
on and completed the 27km sales pipeline 
that transports crude from our central 
processing facility to our wholly owned 
metering station on the Transneft 
pipeline from where we can sell our crude 
to Russian and European customers. We 
completed this project on time and under 
budget, and eliminated US$2.28/bbl of 
trucking costs from our eld to our 
existing Transneft connection point.
The Company completed several 
projects during the year to secure and 
strengthen its power supply within the 
 eld. We installed a 300 amp step-up 
transformer at the Talinka substation 
which provides the main power source 
for the western part of the eld. The 
Company constructed the necessary 
in- eld power lines to increase drilling 
and production. We also purchased 
4 MW of electricity generators to 
enable us to utilise some of our 
associated petroleum gas in electricity 
production. A petroleum gas generator 
can reduce the daily cost of power 
of running a rig to US$800 from 
US$1,500 when compared to using 
power from the grid. This brings the 
cost of power to drill a new well down 
to US$16,800 from US$31,500.
The necessary in- eld pipeline network 
has been completed to bring production 
 uid from the wells to the processing 
facilities and transport processed water 
back to the pads via the newly installed 
water pumping station at the central 
processing facility.
The in- eld electricity grid, the in- eld 
pipeline system for production uids, 
processed water for reinjection and the 
system partially powered by associated 
gas brings us closer to our goal of 
having a closed loop production system 
producing, treating and transporting 
crude directly from our elds to 
end-customers world-wide.
Condensate production
We started selling gas condensate 
to domestic customers in April 2012 
with the completion of well 1004 in the 
Palyanovo License Block. Condensate 
refers to 51 degree API light oil being 
produced in the north of the eld.
Condensate production has two main 
advantages for our business. First, 
condensate is a premium product in 
high demand throughout Russia and 
commands a price premium to crude 
oil. Second, condensate has been subject 
to a Mineral Extraction Tax (‘MET’) of 
RUR556 per ton in 2012, RUR591 per 
ton in 2013 and RUR647 per ton in 
2014. RUR591 per ton is, currently, the 
equivalent of approximately US$2.30 per 
barrel, as compared to our average MET 
for crude oil in 2012 of US$22 per barrel. 
Consequently, the well head revenue of 
condensate production is approximately 
US$20 per barrel greater than the well 
head revenue for crude oil production. 
This overwhelming net revenue 
advantage has incentivized the 
Company to reorient our drilling 
program towards the condensate 
producing area of the eld in the 
near term.
Condensate now comprises 
approximately 20% of our production. Ruspetro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
24
Outlook for 2013
In 2013, drilling will be focused on the 
condensate producing area in the north 
of the eld. We nished drilling on the 
Pad 1 area in the condensate play in early 
2013, and as at the date of this report are 
mobilizing a rig to Pad 4 in the ‘fairway’ 
of our condensate play. We expect to 
spud the rst well from this Pad in 
late March of 2013.
Development in 2013 is aimed at 
maximizing cash generation from 
operations. Condensate production will 
be the initial target, with crude coming 
back into focus later in the year as Russia 
develops its new tax regime for tight 
conventional and unconventional oil. 
During 2013, our subsurface department 
will be engineering new well and 
completion designs to unlock our less 
permeable crude oil plays. Horizontal, 
multiple fractured wells will be the focus 
of this engineering work and initial 
modeling is encouraging as to ow rates 
and investment ef ciencies. As Russia’s 
tax regime develops to stimulate 
unconventional development, we will 
also be reviewing our unconventional 
shale plays in the Bazhenov and the 
Abalak formations. Our goal is to 
identify reservoir characteristics, 
reserves, and the appropriate completion 
and development approach. 
Financial summary 
For 2012, as set out on pages 58 to 86 
of this report, we ended the year with 
revenues of US$76,230 thousand. This 
was an increase of 97% from 2011, and 
was achieved by increasing average 
production for the year to 4,639 boepd 
from 2,474 boepd. Full year production 
was 1,370,960 boepd of crude oil and 
326,990 boepd of condensate and we 
achieved an exit rate of 6,540 boepd 
at the end of the year. Revenues are 
reported net of export duty. 
We also generated positive EBITDA 
of US$2,426 thousand in the fourth 
quarter of 2012 thanks, in large part, 
to our focus on condensate production. 
EBITDA over the year was negative 
US$6,223 thousand with our absolute 
production and sales volumes being 
lower than anticipated at the time 
of our IPO. 
Cost of sales
2012 cost of sales (including 
depreciation) was US$74,816 thousand 
and represented 98% of revenues in 
2012 as compared to 135% of revenues 
in 2011. The increase in the cost of sales 
was primarily as a result of increasing 
sales volumes and increasing the scale 
of the business in anticipation of further 
sales volume increases.
The higher sales related costs includes 
MET of US$31,816 thousand which 
was 68% higher than the prior year 
commensurate with an increase in 
production volumes of 82% year on year. 
Other sales costs increased by 29%, 
re ecting both increased production 
volumes and expenditures in anticipation 
of the future development of Ruspetro’s 
business. Operating expenses excluding 
depreciation and MET was approximately 
$25,093 thousand compared to $9,719 
thousand in 2011.
Compared with 2011 depletion, 
depreciation and amortization decreased 
by US$5,820 thousand, or 25%, to 
US$17,907 thousand, as a result of an 
increase in the proved developed reserve 
base, partly offset by an increase in 
production. Other costs of sales include 
sundry costs and costs of materials used 
in production. 
 ellin and administrative 
expenses (‘S&A’)
S&A expenses (excluding share-based 
payments) increased to US$28,446 
thousand, or 90% from 2011. S&A 
expenses include oil transportation 
costs, payroll expenses, rent, 
professional services, property and 
land taxes, bank charges and other 
expenses, including costs associated 
with Ruspetro’s status as a public 
company. A full breakdown of the S&A 
can be found on page 73. The increase 
in S&A, re ects the management 
resources and expertise required 
for an increased scale of operational 
activity and production.
Comprehensive loss for the year
The Company recorded a loss for the 
year of US$27,284 thousand. This 
was approximately 68% lower than 
the 2011 loss of US$85,063 thousand. 
After translating the results to the 
presentation currency, which resulted 
in a gain of US$6,061 thousand, the 
total comprehensive loss for the year 
was US$21,223 thousand.
Cash o Our IPO raised net cash proceeds of 
US$213,699 thousand with the issue 
of 126,128,848 new Ordinary shares 
bringing the total number of Ordinary 
shares in issue to 333,381,480 of ten 
pence each.
Operating and nancial review
continued
Development in 2013 is 
primarily aimed at maximizing 
immediate cash generation from 
operations. The early processing 
facility for our condensate 
production can now stabilise 
up to 9,000 boepd. Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Ruspetro plc

We started the year with $1,294 
thousand in cash, after receiving 
US$213,699 thousand net cash from 
our IPO we repaid debt of US$18,575 
thousand and paid interest during the 
year of US$50,645 thousand. We spent 
US$66,014 thousand on drilling (49% 
higher than our development plan at 
IPO) and US$40,569 million on 
infrastructure development (18% lower 
than budgeted in our development 
plan at IPO) during the year. After an 
operating cash out ow before working 
capital adjustments of US$7,511 
thousand, working capital adjustments 
of negative $1,291 thousand and a 
currency translation difference of 
positive US$3,941 thousand we ended 
the year with a closing cash balance 
of US$34,416 thousand.
Purchase of property, plant and 
equipment (‘PP&E’)
The Company invested US$106,583 
thousand in property, plant and 
equipment in 2012 representing an 
increase in investment over 2011 of 
230%. PP&E assets were US$226,736 
thousand at the end of the period, 
an increase of 104%, whilst mineral 
rights and other intangibles increased 
by 6% to US$425,551 thousand.
Financin of Ruspetro’s 
current operations and future 
development
On the basis of its current nancial 
resources and its existing external and 
shareholder debt nance, Ruspetro’s 
development in 2013 and beyond will 
require additional funding. 
While the existing US$289.1 million 
facility with Sberbank is due in April 
2015, securing nancing is essential 
for the continued development of the 
 eld. Therefore Ruspetro is currently 
evaluating a number of nancing options 
including additional nancing and term 
extension of its existing debt with our 
major lender. Such discussions are 
currently underway and it is hoped 
that this re nancing is agreed in the 
near future.

considers that these circumstances 
represent a material uncertainty that 
may cast doubt on the Group’s and

Crude oil and condensate taxes and 
duties in Russia
Mineral Extraction Tax (‘MET’)
MET is applied to all hydrocarbon 
production in the Russian Federation. 
It is a production volume based tax and 
is paid monthly.
Crude oil
For crude oil, MET is calculated by 
multiplying the extracted quantity 
of dewatered, desalted and stabilized 
oil by the base rate per ton of crude oil 
produced and by the adjustment ratio 
that re ects changes in the RUB/US$ 
exchange rate and the depletion rate 
of the subject eld, according to the 
following formula: RUB 470 x (P—15) 
x K/261 x Cd x Cr where:
 — RUB 470 is the base rate that has 
been increased from RUB 446 per 
ton of crude oil as of 1 January, 2013;
 — P is the average price for Urals 
crude on international oil markets 
(Mediterranean and Rotterdam oil 
markets) in US$ per barrel during 
the prior month;
 — K is the average Ruble per US$ 
exchange rate established by the 
Central Bank of Russia during the 
prior month;
 — Cd is the depletion coef cient based 
upon the depletion of each eld. 
Cd is calculated according to the 
following formula: 3.8–3.5 x N/V 
Where: N is the cumulative 
production of an oil eld including 
production losses; and V is the sum 
of the reserves of the Russian 
categories A, B, C1 and C2; and
 — Cr is a new coef cient applicable 
as of 1 January, 2012 to re ect the 
amount of resources for a particular 
subsoil area.
The formula for calculation of the 
crude oil extraction tax rate provides 
for a cut-off price of Urals blend crude 
oil at or below which the tax rate 
amounts to zero. Since 1 January, 
2009, the cut-off price has been 
US$15.00 per barrel.
Export duty
The rate of export duty is linked to the average Urals price in US$ per barrel 
as follows:
Urals price
(1) 
Export duty
(1)(2)
Below US$109.50 per ton
(US$15.00 per barrel)
Export duty is not levied
US$109.50 to US$146.00 per ton
(US$15.00 to US$20.00 per barrel)
35.0% of the difference between 
Urals price and US$109.50 per ton 
(US$15.00 per barrel)
US$146.00 to US$182.00 per ton 
(US$20.00 to US$25.00 per barrel)
US$12.78 per ton (US$1.75 per barrel) 
plus 45.0% of the difference between 
Urals price and US$146.00 per ton 
(US$20.00 per barrel)
Above US$182.50 per ton
(US$25.00 per barrel)
US$29.20 per ton (US$4.00 per barrel) 
plus 60.0% of the difference between 
Urals price and US$182.50 per ton 
(US$25.00 per barrel)
(1) Assumes a conversion factor of 7.3 barrels per ton.
(2) The average Urals price per barrel used is the average price during the prior month.
The depletion coef cient is applicable 
to mature elds with more than 80% 
depletion. A coef cient of 1.0 applies 
to a eld with up to 80% depletion and 
this is reduced on a sliding scale from 
80% to 100% depletion (in increments 
of 0.035 for each 1% of depletion). The 
minimum coef cient is 0.3 for oil elds 
with a depletion rate above 100%. The 
depletion rate is based on crude oil 
production and reserves information 
reported to the Russian Government.
Assuming the average monthly US$/
RUB exchange rate is constant and the 
depletion factor equals 1.0, each increase 
in the average world market price of 
Urals blend oil by US$1.00 per barrel 
above the cut-off price of US$15.00 per 
barrel will result in an increase in the tax 
rate of approximately US$1.61 per ton of 
oil extracted (or US$0.22 per barrel of 
oil extracted using a conversion factor 
of 7.33 barrels per ton).
For example:
Conv. ratio bbl/ton 7.33
Urals US$/bbl 112
MET base RUR/t 470
Exchange rate RUB/US$ 30
MET US$/bbl 22.70
Condensate
The MET rate for condensate was also 
amended on 1 January, 2012. Instead 
of the ad valorem rate of 17.5%, the 
following xed rates in Rubles per ton 
have been set:
 — 556 Rubles per ton for 2012;
 — 591 Rubles per ton for 2013; and
 — 647 Rubles per ton from 
1 January, 2014.
As compared with the ad valorem rate 
applied earlier, the new MET rates for 
condensate reduce the tax burden 
signi cantly for this type of product.  27
Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Ruspetro plc
With a R S exchan e rate 
of 30 and a barrels per ton rate 
of 3 this ives a 2013 MET 
rate for condensate of 
US$2.37 per barrel.
Export duty
For example:
Urals price US$/bbl 112
Export duty US$/bbl 56.20
Since December 2008, the Russian 
Government has been revising the 
crude oil export duty monthly on the 
basis of the immediately preceding 
month’s average crude oil price. By 
introducing this measure the Russian 
Government intended to limit the 
exposure of oil exporting companies 
to severe declines in crude oil prices. 
Previously the rates of export duty 
were revised every two months.
The rate of export duty for condensate 
is not applicable to our operations as 
we sell our condensate to domestic 
customers only. Ruspetro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Health, Safety and the Environment 
(‘HSE’)
Ruspetro is committed to HSE and is working 
to improve its performance across these areas by 
improving the safety and security of its operations, 
increasingly protecting and remediating the 
environment and building relationships with 
the local communities in which we work.
Lost Time Injury Frequency (‘LTIF’) 
– The number of lost time injuries 
(fatalities and lost work day cases) 
per 200,000 work hours. The LTIF 
for Ruspetro in 2012 was zero.
Total Recordable Incident Frequency 
(‘TRIF’) – A broad measure aiming 
to capture all incidents, de ned as the 
total number of recordable incidents 
these include fatalities, injuries 
resulting in greater than one day or 
shift away from work, the restricted 
ability of an employee to work due to 
injury, an incident treated with rst 
aid and any unplanned hydrocarbon 
release per 200,000 work hours. Since 
standard reporting started in August 
2012, Ruspetro’s TRIF was 14.7.
Motor Vehicle Incident Frequency 
(‘MVIF’) – The total number of motor 
vehicle crashes per 1,000,000km. 
Since standard reporting started in 
August 2012 at the Company the 
MVIF was 2.4.
HSE
Introduction
Ruspetro has set its goals for HSE as:
 — to take care of the Company’s 
employees; 
 — to create a high quality working 
environment;
 — to enhance the living standards 
of the communities within which 
we operate; and
 — to produce responsibly from the 
Company’s assets.
Ruspetro is committed to these 
goals and is working to improve its 
performance across these areas by 
improving the safety and security of 
its operations, increasingly protecting 
and remediating the environment and 
building relationships with the local 
communities in which we work.
The Company’s main assets are 
the three license blocks it holds 
on the Krasnoleninsky Arch near 
Khanty-Mansiysk in Western Siberia. 
Ruspetro is committed to developing 
the resources within its asset base 
in a responsible manner, respecting 
all key stakeholders. 
There are two communities based 
within our license blocks: Talinka 
with a population of about 4,200 and 
Palyanovo with a population of about 
200. The Company has its operational 
base in Talinka, where it manages 
day-to-day eld operations. By basing 
our operations here we are bringing 
increased investment, activity and 
employment to the community whilst 
improving the management of our 
production activities.
Safety performance
Production of oil and gas has inherent 
risks that Ruspetro is working to 
effectively manage. During 2012, there 
have been no of cial lost time accidents 
reported to the Russian authorities 
by Ruspetro. A lost time accident is an 
incident which results in an employee 
being absent from work for at least 
 ve days or shifts, as de ned by the 
Russian Government. 
The Company, however, reports 
incidents internally in order to build 
its reporting systems to international 
standards. These reported incidents 
are as follows:
Lost Time Injury (‘LTI’) – A fatality or 
lost time accident. The number of LTIs 
is the sum of fatalities and lost time 
accidents. A LTI will be one which 
results in an employee or contractor 
being absent from work for three days 
or work shifts. During 2012, Ruspetro 
had no LTI. Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Ruspetro plc
29
In addition to these internationally 
recognized measures, the Company 
has developed internal safety 
standards to improve our approach 
to safety issues. These standards are 
based upon recognized international 
standards within the industry 
developed to address the main risks 
faced by the industry. Supervisors and 
employees have been trained so that 
they can ensure the workforce is in 
compliance with these standards. 
The standards are:
To continually improve safety 
standards, the Company believes that 
it is crucial to report all incidents and 
determine their causes. The Company 
is adopting recognized procedures 
and processes to provide consistency 
of reporting and to ensure supervisors 
are involved in identifying and 
implementing corrective actions. 
The Company is also working with 
its main contractors to ensure they 
report transparently to the Company.
When reported incidents are able 
to give a large enough statistical 
reference point as to where the main 
issues are arising, the Company will 
be able to prioritize efforts to improve 
safety performance and measure 
the effects of those efforts.
Security
The Company aims to improve the 
security of its assets and information by 
establishing transparent processes and 
procedures for its operations, nances 
and procurement. Work has started 
on ensuring transparent processes are 
implemented for dealing with counter 
parties and the procurement of goods 
and services. This work will continue 
in 2013.
The protection of physical assets 
has been upgraded through the 
installation of security cameras 
at all the Company’s operational 
locations and with GPS tracking 
devices installed in both the 
Company’s own and contractor 
vehicles to ensure their 
ef cient utilization. 
There are currently six cameras in 
operation with another 18 planned for 
installation to cover production areas 
and primary road access points. We 
also plan to install of ce access control 
systems and video equipment in all 
of ces by the end of the rst half 
of 2013.

Environmental performance
The Company’s duty of care to the 
environment is of key importance. 
During 2012, the Company has 
adopted an environmental protection 
program via its main production 
subsidiaries OJSC INGA and OJSC 
Trans-oil. The production of oil causes 
four possible routes of contamination:
 — atmospheric emissions – principally 
through the aring or venting of 
associated gas;
 — water emissions – mainly from 
produced water; 
 — solid wastes – mainly drilling  
cuttings; and
 — oil spillages and leaks.
The program aims to:
 — reduce waste at source through 
design and operation;
 — recover or recycle the emissions 
of production (e.g. the re-injection 
of produced water);
 — protect the natural water bodies and 
soil from contamination or damage 
from operations;
 — optimize the use of existing land 
for pipeline and transportation 
routes and operational sites whilst 
also minimizing land use in 
sensitive natural, community 
or historical areas;
 — monitor the impact of operations 
on the environment; and
 — clean up any waste materials or oil 
spills using recognized reclamation 
procedures to allow the environment 
to recover.
In order to address its atmospheric 
emissions during 2012, the Company 
installed approximately 4 MW 
of electricity generation powered by 
associated gas. This is intended to 
supply in- eld power demands. 
Over the course of the year, 
the Company paid approximately 
US$850,000 in penalties for the 
 aring of associated gas in compliance 
with the Russian state legislation. 
In November 2012, the Federal 
Government adopted a decree 
signi cantly increasing penalties for 
associated petroleum gas aring when 
overall cumulative production to date 
exceeds 5% of the reserves of the 
reservoir. This decree came into effect 
from 1 January 2013 with the aim of 
improving the utilization of associated 
gas by the oil industry. The Company’s 
low level of current reservoir depletion,  Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Ruspetro plc
31
at approximately 1%, currently means 
that, within the framework of the new 
decree, the Company has no aring 
penalties to pay until the end of 2015. 
The Company is, however, currently 
putting in place a strategy to utilize 
100% of its associated gas production 
from 2015.
Due to the decree, increased 
monitoring will be required 
and plans are already in place 
to install additional gas meters 
in early 2013 to provide the 
required data.
During 2012, the Company carried 
out remediation works to 
contaminated land, including:
 — the reclamation of 0.3 hectares 
of land from oil contamination;
 — the processing of 9,800 cubic 
meters of drilling cuttings;
 — the reclamation of 2,760 square 
meters of sludge pits; and
 — the reclamation of 6,300 cubic meters 
of sludge pits from legacy drilling 
works inherited by the Company.
Further remediation work is planned 
in 2013, when the weather improves 
after winter. This work includes 
further work on legacy drilling.
For the reporting year 2013, the Company 
will be required, under UK Government 
regulations, to comply with the guidelines 
for the reporting of Greenhouse Gas 
Emissions. In preparation for this we 
are working with TruCost, a leading 
consultancy collecting and analyzing 
environmentally impactful company 
data. With TruCost, we will be collecting 
and reporting the relevant emission 
data from our operations.
Community relations
In order to help support the 
communities in which we operate 
the Company has agreements with the 
local authorities in Talinka and the local 
regional authority of the Octyabrskiy 
region. These agreements have been 
renewed for 2013. During 2012, the 
Company invested approximately 
US$250,000 into the local community 
to provide support for the local school in 
Talinka and create a road infrastructure 
for the village of Palyanovo. These works 
will be continued in 2013. 
Additionally, Ruspetro will continue 
to support the local community, 
encouraging quali ed staff to move 
to the area, by investing in a number 
of projects. These include supporting 
the school in Talinka by:
 — funding a school trip to the IVth 
International Festival of Musicians 
and Artists ‘Visiting the Fairy-Tale’;
 — equipping a cartoon animation lab; and
 — purchasing sports equipment and 
costumes for the Center of Recreation 
and Culture.
And improving local medical facilities 
by purchasing:
 — medical supplies for the dental center; 
and
 — medical equipment for the clinic, 
including a de brillator. 
People
The Company has employed many highly 
quali ed staff during 2012, attracted to 
work for the Company due to its:
 — production base and management 
team;
 — the dynamic, fast paced working 
environment; and 
 — the international and progressive 
team environment.
During 2012, the Company has put in 
place processes to employ and retain 
staff and enable them to grow and 
develop within the organization. 
These processes include:
 — workforce planning – to ensure 
the future staf ng needs of the 
Company are met;
 — performance management – to 
identify individual contributions 
to the Company’s success;
 — career ladders – to encourage 
individual growth and development;
 — long-term rewards – to incentivize 
and retain key staff;
 — intra company communications – 
to transmit clear and consistent 
information on Company 
performance;
 — technical and management training 
– to ensure employees and managers 
have the skills required to perform 
their roles effectively; and
 — coaching and mentoring – to 
develop staff through experience 
at work and encourage staff to 
give their best effort.
Ruspetro has recruited over 80 
additional staff in 2012 across our 
locations. These hires included staff in 
the London of ce for plc related tasks, 
strengthening the operational staff in 
Talinka and building out the corporate 
functions in Moscow. During the year 
58 employees left Ruspetro resulting 
in an overall turnover rate of 27%. 
Approximately 5% of staff turnover 
occurred with the relocation of the 
operational base from Nyagan to Talinka 
and the closure of the Nyagan of ce. 
Nyagan is approximately 2 hours drive 
from the production sites whilst Talinka 
is located beside the production 
facilities. Relocating the functions to 
Talinka has improved performance 
within the operational groups.
Critically, highly experienced 
internationally experienced 
professionals have been recruited 
in the areas of reservoir engineering, 
geology, operations and drilling.
During 2012, Ruspetro developed a 
quarterly performance review system 
for all staff. This will be further re ned 
in 2013 to clearly identify highly 
performing employees and to improve 
the transparent link between Company 
performance, individual contribution 
and reward. 
To attract and retain staff, the 
Company’s remuneration policy 
has been developed and is presented 
in this report. Ruspetro has also 
introduced a competitive set of bene ts 
including life and medical insurance 
for all employees and a long-term 
incentive plan. A reward policy for 
all staff has been developed.  Ruspetro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Introduction 
Ruspetro seeks to maintain a high standard of corporate 
governance and places great emphasis on ensuring these 
standards are maintained throughout the business. The 
Board provides speci c guidance on corporate governance 
as a central part of its role of providing leadership and 
direction to the Company.
Governance of the Company 
The Company is committed to the principles of corporate 
governance and since the Company was listed on the London 
Stock Exchange on 19 January 2012, the Company has 
embraced and fully supported the principles contained in the 
UK Corporate Governance Code 2010 and 2012 (the ‘Code’) 
by which the Board is accountable to shareholders.
The Board of directors of Ruspetro plc (the ‘Board’)
Membership of the Board
The Board comprises nine directors made up of the chairman, 
chief executive of cer, chief nancial of cer, president and 
executive director, senior independent non-executive 
directors and four other non-executive directors. Biographical 
details of each of the members of the Board are set out in the 
preceding section of the annual report and details of the 
executive directors’ service contracts and the non-executive 
directors’ letters of appointment are set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report.
The role of the Board 
The Board’s role is to provide entrepreneurial leadership of the 
Company’s business within a framework of prudent and effective 
controls which enables risk to be assessed and managed. 
The Board sets out its vision for the Company’s strategic aims, 
ensures that the necessary nancial and human resources are 
in place for the Company to meet its objectives and to review 
management performance. The Board sets out the Company’s 
values and standards and ensures that its obligations to its 
shareholders and others are understood and met. 
Board balance and independence 
The composition of the Board comprises an appropriate 
balance of expertise, experience, independence and depth of 
knowledge of the Company to enable the Board to discharge 
its respective duties and responsibilities effectively. The Board 
includes a combination of executive and non-executive 
directors, including independent non-executives, to provide 
a balance of perspectives and to ensure that no individual 
director or group of directors can dominate the decisions of the 
Board. The Board has three committees; the audit committee, 
nomination committee and remuneration committee, the 
composition of which is reviewed from time to time to ensure 
that undue reliance is not placed on any one chairman or 
member. During the year the chairman met the other 
non-executive directors without the attendance of the 
executive directors on a number of occasions.
Independent and non-executive directors
The non-executive directors contribute independent and 
objective judgment on issues of strategy and Company 
performance, including compliance to corporate standards 
throughout the organisation. Mr. Stomberg is the Company’s 
senior independent non-executive director. The Company 
considers all non-executive directors to be independent 
non-executive directors within the meaning of ‘independent’ 
as de ned in the Code, except Mr James Gerson who 
represents Limolines Transport Limited. The Company 
con rms that all non-executive directors have suf cient 
time available to ful l their obligations to the Company. 
Governance
Election and re-election of directors 
Directors will stand for re-election at the 2013 annual general 
meeting as required by the Companies Act 2006 and as 
recommended by the Code. For election of a non-executive 
director, the Board will set out for shareholders the merits of 
the individual’s appointment and the chairman will con rm 
the effectiveness and commitment of the individual. 
New appointments to the Board
The appointment of new Board members will be conducted 
and appointments made based on individual qualities that 
will ful ll the requirements of the Company in meeting 
its objectives, and to maintain a healthy balance in the 
composition and balance of the Board. 
Information and support
The chairman, through the company secretary, ensures 
that the members of the Board and its committees receive 
accurate, timely and clear information. The Board receives 
induction and training on corporate governance and the 
Code, and assistance with professional development as 
appropriate to Board members’ needs and roles. All directors 
have access to the advice and services of the company 
secretary and, have the opportunity to take independent 
professional advice, at the Company’s expense, in support 
of the proper discharge and execution of their duties.
Chairman and CEO 
A clear division of the roles and responsibilities in the 
leadership of the Company is demonstrated by the separate 
appointments of the chairman and chief executive of cer. 
The chairman is responsible to the shareholders for the 
overall performance of the Board and the Company; the 
chief executive of cer is responsible to the Board for the 
effective delivery of the Company’s strategic objectives 
and for its operational performance. 
Performance evaluation
Board performance evaluation is conducted annually. 
The executive directors’ performance is evaluated by the 
non-executive directors; the chairman’s evaluation is led by 
the senior independent director with the other non-executive 
directors. The non-executive directors, excluding the 
chairman, are evaluated by the chairman and chief executive 
of cer, taking into account the views of the executive 
directors. The Board committees are reviewed by the senior 
independent non-executive director and the chief executive 
of cer, taking into account the views of the other executive 
directors in addition to self performance assessments by 
those committees. The Board reviews its own performance as 
a whole by consolidating and discussing the foregoing reviews 
and in 2012 by the conduct of a self-assessment review.

Annual Report and Accounts 2012
The key items reviewed and actions taken by the Board 
during the year include the following:
Leadership and strategy – The review and approval 
of operational reports, budgets, a senior secured notes 
offering and the conversion to equity in the Company 
of the outstanding shareholder loan and accrued interest 
of Limolines Transport Limited.
Performance, risk and internal control – Review 
of nancial statements, annual report, approval of Interim 
Management Statement, review of the effectiveness of the 
Company’s risk management and of the internal control

with consideration of the UK Bribery Act and the UK 
Corporate Governance Code.
Shareholder communications – Approving preliminary 
announcement of annual results, annual report, half yearly 
report, quarterly announcements, and the release of any 
other Company announcements to the London Stock 
Exchange’s Regulatory News Service.
Remuneration and awards
The Board sets the level of directors’ remuneration by reference 
to company peer group data and by retaining independent 
remuneration consultants. This process establishes levels of 
compensation that are commensurate with their position in 
the Company and enables the Company to attract and retain 
outstanding candidates. The remuneration of each director is 
set out in their respective service agreements and appointment 
letters. The payment or award of remuneration which is subject 
to performance criteria in the computation of bonuses and 
awards, is assessed and recommended to the Board by the 
remuneration committee. Details of directors’ remuneration 
and interests are set out in the remuneration report. 
Committees of the Board 
Audit committee 
The members of the audit committee are Mr Jenkins, chairman, 
and two independent non-executive directors, Mr Stomberg and 
Mr McBurney. Mr Jenkins, previously nance director and chief 
 nancial of cer of Russian mining and energy companies and 
as an investment banker active in Russian energy transactions, 
possesses the recent and relevant nancial experience to head 
the audit committee. The audit committee meets at least 
quarterly, with the Company’s chief nancial of cer and the 
Company’s auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , in attendance 
as required by the business of the meetings. 
The terms of reference of the audit committee have been 
approved by the Board. The audit committee chairman 
reviews the nancial reporting of all of the Company’s 
subsidiaries and the committee reviews the Company’s 
accounting, internal control and risk assurance policies. 
In addition, it monitors the implementation, development, 
compliance and effectiveness of such internal policies and 
procedures in order to assess their impact on the integrity 
of the Company’s nancial statements. It also reviews public 
announcements relating to nancial performance and results. 
The audit committee reports to the Board and will raise any 
matters to the Board which it considers require the Board’s 
attention. The committee will make recommendations as 
appropriate including those for the Board to put to 
shareholders at the annual general meeting. 
The audit committee maintains an objective relationship 
with the Company’s auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
and meets with them on a periodic basis. The Company 
may also, from time to time, ask them to perform non-audit 
engagements. In such circumstances, the continued 
objectivity and independence of the auditor is an objective 
of the Company. This is met by delegating to the audit 
committee the responsibility for the review and 
recommendation to the Board of the materiality and 
nature of the non-audit engagement and its possible 
impact on the audit engagement.
The audit committee, having reviewed the independence 
and effectiveness of the auditors and being satis ed that the 
auditors remain independent and effective in their role, has not 
considered it necessary to carry out a tender process this year, 
and has therefore recommended to the Board that the existing 
auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP be reappointed. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have expressed their 
willingness to continue as auditors.
The audit committee also considered the Financial Reporting 
Council’s proposals on auditor rotation and agreed that the 
implications for the Company should be reviewed in 2013.
The following main items of business were considered by the 
audit committee during the year: 
Financial and business reporting – The review and 
approval of nancial statements, the annual report and 
accounts, the half yearly report, IMS statements and related 
announcements issued to the London Stock Exchange 
Regulatory News Service.
Risk and internal control – The assessment and 
review of risks, and the mitigating actions/contingency 
plans for those risks; review of internal controls including 
new nancial controls to cover the implementation and 
on-line availability of the Purchase Order (‘PO’) and the 
Authorisation For Expenditure (‘AFE’) systems and the 
review of procedures for the adoption of new counter-parties 
to the Approved Contractors List (‘ACL’); review plans 
for the development of an Enterprise Resource Planning 
System (‘ERP’), which enables the integration of nancial, 
operational and technical data into one database; review 
of internal monthly nancial reporting of actual results 
versus the budget and review of capital and operational 
expenditure budgets; review of related party transactions

company whistle-blowing policy and the introduction of 
a global independent ‘whistle-blower’ hotline accessible 
in many languages; review of material litigation as well 
as of Health, Safety and the Environment (‘HSE’) reports.
Compliance – The review of the Company’s compliance 
with the terms and conditions of its operating licenses 
as well as of the Palyanovo license extension application; 
consideration of an internal audit function with the decision, 
given the size and maturity of the Company, to develop such 
function at a later stage.
Audit – The review of the audit ndings report, the audit 
plan and the management representation letter.

Governance continued
Remuneration committee 
The members of the remuneration committee are 
Mr Stomberg, as chairman, Mr Clark, Mr Mach and 
Mr McBurney. The members are considered by the Board 
to be independent. The remuneration committee met twice 
in 2012 to assist the Board in determining the remuneration 
and contracts of the directors and senior management of 
the Company. The terms of reference of the remuneration 
committee are approved by the Board. 
The remuneration committee has engaged the services of 
specialist remuneration consultants to provide guidance. 
No director is involved in setting his own remuneration.
The remuneration report, which includes details of the 
award of share options in Ruspetro plc together with 
information relating to directors’ service contracts 
and appointment letters, is set out on pages 45 to 56. 
During the year the remuneration committee considered the 
following main items of business:
Remuneration – The review of a report from 
remuneration consultants on the remuneration of executive 
directors and senior management with a decision not to 
change executive directors’ remuneration in 2013 and 
to consider senior management on an individual basis.
Bonuses – The approval of 2012 Key Performance 
Indicators for the executive directors’ bonus scheme 
and consideration of whether bonuses are to be paid 
to executive directors. 
Long Term Incentive Plan – The approval of the 
introduction of a Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) and 
the review and approval of the 2013 LTIP rules and metrics. 
Share options – The approval of share option awards 
to employees (not executive directors). 
Reporting and governance – The approval of the 
remuneration report disclosures. The review of proxy voting by 
shareholders. The approval of remuneration and reward policies.
Nomination committee 
The members of the nomination committee are Mr Clark, 
as chairman, Mr Mach and Mr McBurney. External advisors 
are also invited to attend meetings as and when appropriate. 
The nomination committee meets at least annually and 
more frequently as may be required for the proposed 
appointment of new members to the Board. The activities 
for which the nomination committee is responsible are 
set out in the terms of reference. 
During the year the nomination committee considered the 
following main items of business:
Succession planning – Succession planning proposals 
were discussed. 
Composition of the Board – The size, composition and 
skill set of the Board were reviewed with a decision not to 
recommend any changes to the Board at this time. The impact 
of the Davies Report ‘Women on Boards’ was discussed with 
a decision not to recommend an additional Board appointment 
at this time. Although the nomination committee concurs with 
the conclusions of the report that diversity, in its broadest 
sense, improves Board performance it welcomed the decision 
not to impose quotas regarding gender balance. 
Board and committee effectiveness – A review of 
Board and committee effectiveness by means of an internal 
evaluation was carried out. The matters arising from that 
review were addressed.
Governance – The provisions of the revised UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2012, its impact and compliance requirements 
for the business were reviewed and considered.
The nominations committee supports the importance of 
having diversity of thought and representation on the Board. 
As the committee considers future Board composition and 
succession planning, it will seek applicants from a wide range 
of backgrounds to ensure that the candidate best equipped to 
bring the right combination of skills and experience to bene t 
the Company are identi ed. However in terms of gender the 
Company operates in an environment with low representation 
of women at all levels of the industry. In order to address 
this, the Company operates equal opportunity policies in 
all areas of its activities. The aim, over time, is that women 
as a percentage of the workforce will increase and create 
a pool of talent from which to recruit its senior positions.
The Board, separately from the nominations committee, 
periodically reviews the individual attributes and 
experience of its members and from time to time identify 
the need for additional, replacement and successor 
appointments, and the refreshing of Board committees. 
The nomination committee will convene to review and 
recommend appointments proposed by the Board.

Board responsibility 
The Board is responsible for determining the nature 
and extent of the signi cant risks it is prepared to accept 
in achieving the Company’s strategic objectives. 
Compliance
Ruspetro has complied with the Code in the 2012 nancial 
year and has continued to develop policies and procedures 
that will ensure compliance with the Code and the related 
Financial Services Authority Listing Rules.

Internal control
The Board implements and maintains risk management and 
internal control systems to support the Company’s activities 
and ensure they comply with the minimum requirements of  Ruspetro plc

Annual Report and Accounts 2012
the Code. Speci cally the Company is establishing a 
continuous process for identifying, evaluating and managing 
the signi cant risks of the business, and to regularly review 
the effectiveness of the Company and its subsidiaries’ risk 
management and internal control systems.
Business risk
The Company has an ongoing process, in accordance with best 
practice, that identi es, evaluates and manages risks faced by 
the Company. This is based on each operational and corporate 
function producing a risk matrix which identi es the key 
business risks, the probability of those risks occurring, their 
impact if they do occur and the actions being taken to manage 
those risks to the desired level. From these the Company has 
compiled a risk register, containing the key risks facing the 
Company during conduct of its business. The register is 
regularly reviewed and discussed by the audit committee. 
In the light of the provisions of the UK Bribery Act 2010, 
the non-compliance of which could expose the Company to 
unlimited nes and other consequences it is the Company’s 
intention in 2013 to introduce additional measures into the 
business to reinforce its zero tolerance approach to bribery 
and corruption, including the provision of an on-line 
anti-bribery and corruption training programme for 
all new and existing employees. 
Risk acceptance and reduction objectives are de ned 
with particular attention given to safety and environmental 
factors, and applied to ensure that the risks are at a level that 
is as low as reasonably practicable. The directors are working 
closely with operational and functional management to 
ensure compliance with the Company’s policies, procedures 
and risk management processes. These are designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure in order 
to achieve business objectives.
Management structure
The Board has overall responsibility for the Company and its 
subsidiaries. There is a formal schedule of matters speci cally 
reserved for decision by the Board. The executive directors, 
led by the chief executive of cer, are responsible and 
accountable for all aspects of the Group’s business affairs.
Financial reporting
The Company maintains an effective and reliable 
accounting system and has developed a broader management 
information system during the year. The Board receives a 
monthly report that monitors actual performance against 
budget and forecasts for oil and gas production, gross revenue 
and well head revenue, capital expenditure and development 
progress. It also provides the Board with information on 
key issues including treasury, cash ow forecasting and 
the nancial implications of sensitivities to changes in 
commodity prices and exchange rates. The Company 
also maintains an effective and reliable suite of policies, 
procedures and controls in preparing consolidated nancial 
statements. These controls include rigorous review of the 
process and output data and technical support and review 
to ensure accounting tools and business systems are robust.
Budgetary process
There is a comprehensive budgeting system with an annual 
budget approved by the Board covering capital expenditure, 
public offering proceeds, cash ow, the income statement 
and the balance sheet. Monthly results are reported against 
budget, and revised forecasts are prepared regularly. 
Separate approval processes and authority limits are in 
place for budgeted and unbudgeted expenditure items.
Corporate accounting and procedures
Responsibility levels are communicated throughout the 
Company and its subsidiaries using a table of delegated 
authorities appropriate to each part of the business, through 
written corporate accounting procedures and policies 
common to all companies along with company speci c 
procedures and controls, which are continually reviewed 
and updated as required. The review of the application 
of internal nancial control and operational procedures 
is carried out during visits to the eld operations of ces 
by the directors and senior Moscow of ce management.
Investment appraisal
Capital investment is regulated by the budgetary process 
and authorisation levels. For expenditure beyond speci ed 
levels, detailed written proposals have to be submitted to 
the Board. Capital expenditures are reviewed with major 
overruns in terms of cost and time being investigated. 
Quality and integrity of personnel
The integrity and competence of personnel is ensured 
through high recruitment standards and subsequent 
training courses. High quality personnel are seen as 
an essential part of the control environment. The ethical 
standards expected of employees are communicated 
through corporate presentations of policies including, 
identi cation and prevention of fraud, anti-money 
laundering and bribery including the UK Bribery Act, 
whistle-blower, ethical practices, and a share dealing code.
The Company is committed to operating in an environment 
that provides personnel with a safe and accessible means 
to report concerns without concern of reprisal and a 
whistle-blowing hotline service for all staff and contractors, 
has been introduced which will report directly to the 
chairman of the audit committee.
Internal audit
The audit committee has conducted an annual review into 
whether it is appropriate for the Company to establish an 
internal audit function. The Board places great emphasis 
on the importance of risk management and control at 
all operating levels in the business and is developing 
an appropriate framework. 
The Board has concluded that the Company’s procedures, 
policies and systems are appropriate and suitable to enable 
the Board to safeguard shareholders’ investment and the 
Company’s assets.
Communication with shareholders 
Information about the activities of the Company and its 
subsidiaries are provided in the annual report and accounts 
and the half-yearly report which are sent to shareholders. 
The Company has made quarterly IMS and periodic 
operational updates via the London Stock Exchange’s 
Regulatory News Service. A regular dialogue has been 
developed with institutional shareholders, for which 
the Board as a whole has responsibility. Enquiries from 
individuals on matters relating to their shareholding and 
the business of the Company are welcomed and are dealt 
with in an informative and timely manner.
Annual general meeting
Shareholders are encouraged to attend and participate in 
general meetings to discuss the progress of the Company.

Governance
Principal risks and uncertainties
Ruspetro’s current stage of development, the geographical area in which we operate and the business 
of oil and gas development and production all mean that the business is exposed to a wide variety 
of risks.
Our approach is to actively understand and monitor the risks we are exposed to, and then manage 
solutions to them so that their potential adverse effects are minimized.
The following table describes risks that we face and outlines our approach to mitigating them:
INTERNAL AND OPERATIONAL RISKS
Risk Description
Reservoir  
Performance
Ruspetro’s hydrocarbon reservoirs may not perform as expected, exposing Ruspetro to 
reduced cash ow and challenges in funding planned development. This under performance 
may be due to unforeseen geological factors, formation damage during drilling or completion or 
overestimation of forecast production. Accordingly, forecast reservoir performance is critical in 
deciding on development options for speci c assets, as well as allocation of Ruspetro’s nancial 
resources generally. 
Recruitment and retention 
of key people and critical 
skills
Ruspetro’s ability to maintain a competitive position and implement its business strategy 
and meet its oil production targets depends to a large degree on recruiting and retaining 
the services of its senior operational management team, and contractors with the requisite 
critical skills. 
License status and oil and 
gas eld permitting
Renewal of Ruspetro’s exploration and production licenses (expiring in 2014, 2015 and 2017) 
is of critical importance as, in this context, is the satisfactory ful lment of license conditions.
Procurement and contract 
management, capital and 
operating expenditure
Lack of effectiveness in negotiating and managing purchases and contracts could increase 
costs for Ruspetro and/or cause delays to project completions and operations, negatively 
impacting production, cash ow and value generation.
The vetting of counterparties, in particular for business ethics and integrity as well as nancial 
and operating capability, represents an associated risk area.
Health, Safety, 
Environment and 
Community Relations 
(‘HSEC’)
Failure to put in place and operate a rigorous HSEC regime can endanger and negatively effect 
stakeholders. Adverse publicity from any poor performance in these areas could negatively 
effect Ruspetro. It could be held responsible for failing to address any contamination or 
damage to license and surrounding areas, with signi cant associated costs.
Protection of 
Company Property
Damage, theft or interference to Ruspetro’s physical or intellectual assets can stop or limit 
production resulting in reduced cash ow, increased costs and negative reputation reducing 
stakeholder con dence in Ruspetro. Ruspetro plc

impact Our approach
Medium/
High
High Ruspetro’s senior management is focused on and has proven expertise in modelling, managing and 
maximizing oil reservoir performance and recovery, including through the application of proven 
sophisticated fracturing, water injection and other oil production enhancement techniques.
Medium/
High
High The Group has recruited additional quali ed staff in most functional and technical areas 
to achieve its oil eld development plan objectives. The additional experience recruited has 
reduced this risk but some positions remain critical to implementing the business strategy. 
Innovative reward systems to attract world class contractors are also being introduced.
Medium High Non-compliance with certain license conditions has been remedied. Applicable license conditions 
are being ful lled, and these are largely internally controllable. While license renewal is not 
expected to be problematic, it will be essential to demonstrate an effective gas utilization program.
Low High Ruspetro operates effective policies, procedures and controls in relation to prior approval of 
supplier counterparties and competitive procurement within strict levels of delegated authority 
with the objective of achieving arms-length, transparent purchasing.
Ruspetro, its Board and audit committee monitor carefully and undertake close, regular scrutiny 
of the effectiveness of the Company’s policies.
Low High Ruspetro treats HSEC as a priority, and its Board has formally adopted appropriate policies 
across the HSEC area. In order to manage effectively its rapid oil eld development plan, 
Ruspetro will appoint a Russia-based, senior HSEC manager reporting directly to the CEO, 
along with local managers responsible for ensuring the implementation and monitoring 
of Ruspetro’s policies across the HSEC area.
Ruspetro has budgeted for appropriate expenditures to comply with applicable laws and regulations, 
as well as to contribute to the economic and social bene t and development of the region in which 
it operates.
Ruspetro has put in place appropriate insurance arrangements to manage and mitigate 
its potential nancial exposure risks in the HSEC area.
Medium Medium Development and implementation of a security strategy protecting physical and intellectual 
assets which aims to improve training, processes and procedures for security personnel and 
improve technological components of physical security, and secure assets through robust 
fraud-risk management. Ruspetro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

EXTERNAL AND FINANCIAL RISKS
Risk Description
Political Environment The political environment in the Russian Federation is volatile. There have been and there 
is the risk of actions by its executive and judicial authorities that may adversely affect the 
performance of businesses operating in the country.
Political instability in Russia or an increase in the perceived risk of investing in Russia could 
be materially detrimental to Ruspetro’s business.
Exchange Rate 
and In ation
Ruspetro’s oil revenues are linked to international market prices, and, as a result, it is not protected 
against the negative effect of continuing cost in ation in Russia (e.g. currently at over 5% per annum) 
or demand led industry speci c in ation.
Exchange rate movement in particular in that of RUB: USD could impact negatively Ruspetro’s 
 nancial position. This re ects, in particular, the current pro le of its costs, revenues and 
sources of capital.
Access to Finance Implementation of Ruspetro’s development plan may require it to raise additional nance 
of either a debt or equity nature and market conditions may preclude this, including on terms 
which Ruspetro considers satisfactory. In addition, Ruspetro’s existing level of borrowings 
may constrain it from raising additional debt nance. This may result in it not being able 
to implement its development plan and realize the inherent value of the oil and gas in its 
existing license areas. 
Ruspetro has a signi cant level of bank and shareholder debt, with the risk that it may not be 
able to meet its debt service obligations, either out of cash ow or re nancing.
Oil and Gas Market Prices Although Russia’s taxation regime for its oil producers does give some protection against 
declines in market prices, signi cantly lower market prices than those assumed in Ruspetro’s 
development plan would nevertheless result in materially reduced net revenue contribution.
Ruspetro is exposed to both Russian domestic market and international oil and gas price 
movements. It does not currently enter into any forward sales price hedging agreements.
Bribery and Corruption Bribery and corruption is known to be an area of vulnerability for businesses operating in Russia, 
and as such, Ruspetro may be exposed to such risks. In addition, the UK Bribery Act requires 
that companies introduce adequate procedures to combat bribery at all levels and areas of 
their business.

Potential  
impact Our approach
Medium High This risk cannot be in uenced by the management of the Company. However, the Group 
monitors changes in the political environment and reviews changes to the relevant legislation, 
policies and practices. The continuing need for oil production as a vital source of state revenue 
and the recent proposed changes in legislation for Mineral Extraction Tax indicates that the 
environment for oil producers remains favorable.
Low Medium Ruspetro’s policy and practice is to match, as far as practicable, receipts and payments in the 
same currency, in particular in relation to Russian rouble transactions.
Ruspetro’s risk monitoring will include the review of its actual projected nancial position 
in relation to its US dollar-denominated debt.
In order to mitigate such inherent external risks. Ruspetro’s business model and strategy target 
a superior net Well Head Revenue contribution, including through the production and sale 
of oil condensate, and competitively low operating and other costs to achieve a resulting high 
level of pro tability so as to reduce its potential exposure to the impact of either exchange rate 
movements or cost in ation.
High High Ruspetro considers that its strategic concentration on the development of its existing licenses 
in growing both its production and proved reserves may maximize its ability to attract both debt 
and equity nance.
Ruspetro’s Board will keep under review its debt service obligations in the light of 
 nancial performance.
Medium Medium In order to manage such risks, Ruspetro has structured its development plan to be nancially 
feasible at signi cantly lower oil prices than those of today.
Ruspetro’s sales arrangements effectively mitigate any revenue collection risks. Ruspetro sells 
its oil production in the domestic market to a limited number of local off-takers at transparent 
arms-length market prices, with payment in full on delivery. It exports entirely through 
Glencore International plc, the world’s largest international commodity trading company, 
with sales contracted quarterly at stipulated volumes and arms-length current market prices, 
60% pre-payment and the balance of 40% paid the following month. 
Medium High Ruspetro prohibits bribery and corruption in any form by all employees and by those working 
for and/or connected with the business.
The Company pays special attention to this in its systems, in particular for the approval 
of counterparties and expenditure.
Employees are expected to report bribery or attempted bribery to their line managers even 
if it is only suspected or attempted in line with the Company whistle-blower policy which 
has been implemented across the business together with the introduction of an independent 
whistle-blower hot line to enable any concerns of wronging to be voiced without fear of reprisal.
Ruspetro has developed a code of conduct and a supporting statement of ethics which is 
compliant with the Bribery Act 2010 and its guidance and is in the process of implementing 
this. The communication of the new code is to be implemented in the forthcoming year by 
a training program for management, employees and contractors globally. Ruspetro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

The directors have the pleasure in presenting their annual 
report and audited accounts for the period ending 31 December 
2012. These will be presented to shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting of the Company, which is scheduled to be held 
at 11.00am on Wednesday 17 April 2013 at the Of ces of White 
& Case, 5 Old Broad Street, London EC2N 1DW. 
Principal business activities
The Company’s principal activity is the development 
and production of oil and gas on three contiguous license 
blocks of 1,205km
2
 situated in the Krasnoleninsky Arch 
near Khanty-Mansiysk, western Siberia, Russia. Ruspetro 
is the 100% license holder of the Pottymsko-Inginsky, 
Vostochno-Inginsky and Palyanovsky license blocks, which 
make up 100% of the Company’s oil and gas producing assets. 
Ruspetro’s licenses expire in June 2014 (Vostochno-Inginsky 
block) and June 2017 (Pottymsko-Inginsky block). In December 
2012 the license for the Palyanovsky block was extended until 
December 2015, with an expectation that it and the other 
licenses will be further extended for the economic life of the 
 elds, which run until between 2029 and 2040. This is in 
accordance with recent legislation allowing the license holder 
to extend the licenses for the economic life of the elds as long 
as Ruspetro meets its minimum obligations and is not in breach 
of any license conditions.

Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Letter from the chairman of the 
remuneration committee 
Dear Shareholder, 
On behalf of the remuneration committee, I am pleased to 
introduce the directors’ remuneration report for the year 
ended 31 December 2012, our rst full year as a premium 
listed Company on the London Stock Exchange. 
In line with our commitment to high standards of corporate 
governance, we have adopted some of the proposals from 
the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (‘BIS’) 
regarding revised remuneration reporting regulations 
in advance of being required to do so. There are therefore 
three main sections to this report:
 — 2013 Policy Report: This sets out the elements of our 
remuneration policy going forward and discusses the key 
factors that were taken into account in setting this policy. 
 — 2012 Implementation Report: This sets out how the 
remuneration policy has been implemented during the 
year, including the payments being made to directors 
and the link between performance and executive pay. 
 — Audited information: This section contains details of 
the directors’ emoluments during the year to 31 December 
2012 and has been audited in accordance with the current 
regulations for executive remuneration reporting. 
Business context
During 2012 the Company has made signi cant progress. 
The Company drilled 33 wells against a plan for 24 new 
wells, installed a sales pipeline from the production location 
as well as other infrastructure projects. These projects were 
completed on schedule and within budget. The Company has 
also made signi cant progress in establishing internal 
policies and procedures with improvements to management 
reporting processes, reporting of safety incidents.
However, the production results have been disappointing 
with production below the end of year target, even accounting 
for the production of higher value condensate over crude oil. 
Similarly the nancial results have disappointed. These issues 
are re ected in the performance of Ruspetro’s share price on 
the London Stock Exchange during 2012. 
Remuneration policy
During 2012, the remuneration committee worked on 
developing a remuneration policy that will support our 
vision of being recognized as a leading independent oil 
and gas producer, focused on providing superior 
shareholder returns. 
Accordingly, a signi cant proportion of total remuneration 
for executive directors is performance-related so that 
any pay-out is aligned with the value created for 
our shareholders. 
Prior to the Company’s IPO, the committee decided to make 
an award of market priced share options, at the suggestion 
of the founding shareholders, to Don Wolcott, CEO, and 
Tom Reed, CFO. This was in order to further increase their 
alignment with shareholders, as the inherent share price hurdle 
will ensure that rewards for both executive directors will only 
be available if value has been created for our shareholders, and 
recognize their contribution in preparing the Company for IPO. 
Going forward, any long-term incentive awards to executive 
directors will be in the form of performance shares under 
the Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’), under which awards 
will only be earned subject to the satisfaction of stretching 
performance conditions relating to relative total shareholder 
return and the capital expenditure per incremental barrel 
of production. 
In line with best practice, awards under the PSP will 
be subject to ‘malus’ provisions which will enable the 
committee to cancel or reduce awards prior to vesting 
in certain circumstances. 
The annual bonus plan sets stretching targets for the 
executives on three key areas; production, nancial 
performance and progress on corporate governance 
and operation activities. 
Annual General Meeting
This report will be subject to an advisory vote at the Annual 
General Meeting on 17 April 2013. I will be happy to answer 
questions at the Annual General Meeting on our Remuneration 
Policy and the remuneration committee’s activities and look 
forward to receiving your support.

2013 policy report
Remuneration policy
Ruspetro’s executive remuneration policy has been set 
with the objective of attracting, motivating and retaining the 
highest calibre executives in a manner that is consistent with 
best practice and aligned with the interests of shareholders.
Within these guiding principles, the remuneration policy 
for executive directors and other senior managers is set 
to ensure the following key goals are achieved:
 — To provide a structure and level of pay which attracts 
and retains executives and senior managers capable 
of delivering the Company’s strategic objectives and 
providing leadership within the relevant competitive 
markets, including relevant FTSE listed companies, 
Russian companies with a London listing and other 
Oil & Gas peers.
 — To provide clear and transparent performance incentives 
to reward the attainment of key strategic goals and to 
align the remuneration of executives and senior managers 
with the interests of shareholders.
 — Ensures that rewards provided through the remuneration 
policy are fairly earned and justi ed by performance. 
To that effect, a signi cant proportion of remuneration 
should be performance related and linked to both 
individual and corporate performance. Within the 
performance-related element, there should be an 
appropriate balance between short-term and 
long-term objectives. 
 — To ensure that inappropriate operational and nancial 
risk-taking is neither encouraged nor rewarded through 
the Company’s remuneration policies. The committee 
ensures that account is taken of environmental, social 
and governance risks when setting remuneration and 
is comfortable that remuneration packages do not raise 
such risks by motivating irresponsible behavior.
 — The pay of executive directors and senior managers

Annual bonus  — To incentivize and reward 
the achievement of both 
corporate and individual 
performance. 
 — KPIs are consistent with 
the Company’s short-term 
and medium-term 
objectives. 
 — Target performance: 100% 
of salary for the CEO and 
75% of salary for the other 
executive directors.
 — Maximum opportunity: 
150% of salary for the 
CEO and 100% of salary 
for the other executive 
directors.
 — The annual bonus period 
runs from 1 January to 
31 December. 
 — Targets are set annually 
by the committee and are 
assessed following the 
year end.
 — All bonuses will be paid 
in cash although the 
committee may require 
part of the payment to 
be made in shares. 
 — Company objectives 
may include production, 
 nancial and the 
achievement of strategic 
and operational 
milestones.
 — No bonus will be payable 
unless the minimum level 
of performance has been 
met for both the Company 
and the individual element 
 — The metrics for the annual 
bonus includes production 
measures (end of year 
production rate), nancial 
measures (capital and 
operational budget 
control) and strategic and 
operational milestones. 
Greater weighting towards 
production and nancial 
metrics will be used.
Performance 
Share Plan 
(‘PSP’)
 — To link a substantial 
proportion of reward 
to the achievement of 
strategic targets which 
will drive the creation 
of long-term shareholder 
value as Ruspetro moves 
into the next stage of 
its development.
 — Maximum award level 
under the plan of 150% 
of salary for the CEO and 
125% of salary for other 
executive directors.
 — Annual awards of 
performance shares which 
are only earned subject to 
the achievement of 
performance conditions 
over a three year period. 
 — Malus: Share awards may 
be reduced or cancelled at 
any time prior to vesting, 
at the discretion of the 
remuneration committee, 
following events such as 
a material misstatement 
of results, failure of risk 
management, breach 
of health and safety 
regulations or serious 
reputational damage to 
the Company.
 — The measures used for 
the PSP share plan do not 
repeat the measures used 
for the annual bonus plan. 
A nancial measure of 
Total Shareholder Return 
against a group of peer 
companies will be used. 
A second operational 
measure will be used to 
evaluate the ef ciency 
of capital expenditure 
required to increase 
production.
Annual bonus plan
Each year, the remuneration committee will assess the Company’s performance against the metrics set at the beginning 
of the nancial year. These will include production, nancial and the achievement of strategic and operational milestones. 
Metrics will be de ned according to these categories with greater weighting given to the production and nancial metrics 
as appropriate for a Company at Ruspetro’s stage of development. The overall performance assessment may be adjusted to 
account for exceptional items such as major health, safety and environmental incidents, major changes in oil price or actions 
by third party companies.
The overall Company performance assessment may be adjusted to re ect an individual executive’s contribution to determine 
a nal performance and bonus award. Therefore, no bonus will be payable unless the minimum level of performance has 
been met for both the Company and the individual element. The overall maximum opportunity under the annual bonus 
is 150% of salary for the CEO and 100% of salary for the other executive directors.  Ruspetro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

required from the committee chairman. 
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Group
When setting the policy and levels of directors’ pay, the remuneration committee is mindful of its responsibility to consider 
the pay and employment conditions of employees elsewhere within the Group. 
In particular, the committee takes into account the salary increases provided to the general employee population. 
The committee has also reviewed the Company-wide reward policy, including the bene t offerings at different levels 
throughout the organization, and is satis ed that this policy is appropriate for the Group, supports the business’s 
objectives and is consistent with the policy for executive directors. 
The following table provides a summary of the increase in salary for the executive directors for 2013, as compared with the 
8% increase for employees rated as above average performance throughout the Group. General in ation in Russia has been 
approximately 6% during 2012.

Shareholder considerations
The remuneration committee is committed to ongoing dialogue with our shareholders and welcomes feedback on our 
remuneration policy and its application. 
During February 2013, the remuneration committee chairman or the Company secretary entered into dialogue with a number 
of our institutional shareholders, as well as representatives from the Association of British Insurers (‘ABI’) and Institutional 
Shareholder Services (‘ISS’). The purpose of these discussions was to discuss the Company’s overall approach to remuneration 
and consult with shareholders on the proposed performance conditions under the PSP to Executive Directors. 
Shareholders views were taken into consideration when formulating our policy. Shareholders expressed their disappointment 
with the performance of the Company’s share price and stated that this re ected the missed production and nancial targets. 
Remuneration scenarios based on 2013 policy for executive directors
The chart below shows hypothetical values of the ongoing remuneration package for executive directors under three assumed 
performance scenarios: 
 — Below threshold. Assumes no bonus is paid and no shares vest under the PSP. 
 — Target performance. Assumes payment of the target bonus of 100% of salary for the CEO and 75% of salary for other 
executive directors; and threshold vesting under the PSP of 25% of the award. 
 — Maximum performance. Assumes maximum bonus is earned (150% of salary for the CEO and 100% of salary for the 
other executive directors) and maximum vesting under the PSP. 
Salary and bene ts remain at the same level under all three performance scenarios. The chart re ects ongoing remuneration 
policy and therefore excludes the value of the pre-IPO options granted to the CEO and the CFO.

Service contracts
The following section sets out the main provisions relating to remuneration contained in the directors’ service contracts. 
Executive directors
Each executive director’s terms of appointment are set out in a service agreement with Ruspetro plc which may be 
terminated at any time by either party providing 12 months’ notice. 
Governance

The executive directors are also subject to certain restrictive covenants during the term of their agreement. They are not 
permitted to take up any of ce or employment with, or have any direct or indirect interest in any rm or Company which 
is in direct or indirect competition with the Group or any Company in which any member of the Group has an interest, 
without the consent of the Board. 
Their service agreements also contain a general non-competition covenant in relation to the Group for six months from the 
date of termination.
Details of executive directors’ contracts with Ruspetro plc are shown below.

Tom Reed 1 December 2011 16 December 2011 12 months
Alexander Chistyakov 1 December 2011 16 December 2011 12 months
Any termination payments to executive directors would be subject to the policy set out below. 
Exit payment policy for executive directors 
The Company operates the following policy in respect of exit payments:
 — Notice periods do not exceed 12 months on either side.
 — Termination payments in lieu of notice are restricted to a maximum of 12 months’ salary plus the cost to the Company 
of providing contractual bene ts.
 — The executive directors do not have any contractual entitlement to a termination payment in lieu of notice in relation to 
bonus amounts and vesting of shares under the PSP. The committee has the discretion to determine an appropriate bonus 
amount, which would be subject to performance up to the date of termination and pro-rated for time. Vesting under any 
share incentive arrangements would be determined in accordance with the rules of such plan. Typically under the rules 
of the PSP, outstanding awards for good leavers will be pro-rated for time served and any performance conditions will 
continue to apply. For bad leavers, any unvested awards will lapse. 
 — In any exit payment scenario, the remuneration committee will give due consideration to the circumstances under which 
a director left. 
Non-executive directors
Non-executive directors do not have service contracts and their terms are set out in a letter of appointment. 
Each appointment is for an initial term of three years, subject to being re-elected as a director at each annual general 
meeting and may be terminated with a notice period of one month (three months’ notice in the case of the Board Chairman). 
Non-executive directors are not entitled to any compensation on leaving the Board.

Remuneration committee
Membership and terms of reference 
The remuneration committee was established by the Board prior to the Company’s listing on the London Stock Exchange 
and its members, all of whom were appointed at the time of its establishment, are shown in the table below. 
Name Role
Rolf Stomberg Chairman
Christopher Clark Member
Joe Mach Member
James McBurney Member
In line with the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the committee comprises solely of independent 
non-executive directors and the Board chairman, who was considered independent on appointment. 
No other non-executive directors were members of the committee during the year. 
Under its terms of reference, the committee’s main responsibility is to determine the Company’s overall framework for 
remuneration and to set the remuneration packages for the executive directors, the Chairman of the Board and other 
members of senior management. The committee is also responsible for the design and operation of all share incentive plans. 
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the chairman of the Board and the executive directors. 
Advice to the committee
During the year to 31 December 2012, the following advisors provided services to the committee: 
 — Deloitte LLP (‘Deloitte’) – provision of advice on various remuneration matters under consideration by the Committee 
including on the preparation of this remuneration report. Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group 
and provides advice in line with its code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. 
 — White & Case LLP – provision of legal advice in relation to share plans and service contracts. 
The Committee met twice in 2012 with all members in attendance at both meetings.
In addition to the services described above, other parts of Deloitte provided unrelated taxation services to the Group. 
The remuneration committee does not consider there to be any con ict of interest in this regard.
Furthermore, the committee invited the chief executive of cer, the chief nancial of cer, the HR director and the Company 
secretary to attend its meetings as necessary. No person provided input or was involved when their own remuneration was 
being discussed. 
Discussion of individual remuneration elements 
Salary
Salaries for executive directors were set prior to Ruspetro’s listing on the London Stock Exchange by reference to the FTSE 
250 Index and other Russian/CIS companies in the natural resources sector listed in London. These are the companies 
against which Ruspetro competes for executive talent. 
The committee has made no salary increases for 2013 to any of the executive directors. 
Both the current salary levels and salaries with effect from 1 January 2013 are shown below. Executives have two elements 
to their salary, a UK element and a Russian element.

Bene ts in kind
During the year, executive directors received private medical insurance cover, a car and driver if required, life insurance 
and permanent health insurance. The Company does not currently operate any pension plans for executive directors 
or any other employees. 
Annual bonus plan 
The target bonus for 2012 was 100% of base salary for the CEO and 75% of base salary for the other two executive directors, 
with a maximum opportunity of 150% and 100% of base salary, respectively. 
The actual bonus payable in respect of 2012 has been determined by the committee taking into account the following factors:
 — End of year production at approximately 6,500 boepd against a target of 10,400 boepd. However 1,500 boepd condensate 
which achieves a higher level of income due to a lower rate of the Mineral Extraction Tax. The nal production rate is 
approximately 8,000 boepd.
 — End of year average daily production of 4,600 boepd against target of 7,600 boepd. See note above regarding additional 
value of condensate.
 — EBITDA of -US$5.8 million against target of US$26 million for the year.
 — Very successful completion of the infrastructure projects to handle increased oil production.
 — Development of a HSE management and reporting system.
 — Development of monthly management information reporting.
Despite the progress to date on the installation and commissioning of production infrastructure, the development of the 
corporate governance processes and procedures, the Board of directors believe the missed production and nancial targets 
and resulting poor performance for shareholders of the market value of the Company do not justify a bonus to the executive 
directors in respect of 2012.
Pre-IPO option awards to the CEO and CFO
As previously disclosed, prior to the Company’s IPO on the London Stock Exchange, the Company (following the 
recommendation of the remuneration committee) granted market priced options to Don Wolcott and Tom Reed 
on 17 January 2012, with an exercise price equal to the IPO offer price. 
The granting of these options was intended to further enhance the alignment between executive directors and shareholders, 
as the inherent share price hurdle will ensure that rewards will only be earned if shareholder value has been created. 
In addition, these options were intended to reward the contribution of the directors in preparing the Company for IPO. 
These options vest in equal tranches on the rst, second and third anniversary of the grant date. The options can be exercised 
between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant. The vesting of these options is not subject to the satisfaction 
of any performance criteria. 
The number of options granted to each Executive Director is shown on page 43 of the report. 
Performance Share Plan (the ‘PSP’)
The remuneration committee will decide during the second quarter of 2013 if an award of performance shares will be 
made to the executive directors under the Performance Share Plan and the details of the measures against which Company 
performance will be assessed. However, the performance measures will be 50% against relative total shareholder return 
and 50% against capital dollar spent per incremental barrel of production achieved during the period. 
The nal target value for ef ciency of capital expenditure to increase production (US$ of Capex per incremental barrel) 
will be determined during the second quarter based on the nancial budget agreed with the Board of directors. Ruspetro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept 
or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other 
person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it 
may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent 
in writing.
Scope of the audit of the nancial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the nancial statements suf cient to give 
reasonable assurance that the nancial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
the reasonableness of signi cant accounting estimates made 
by the directors; and the overall presentation of the nancial 
statements. In addition, we read all the nancial and 
non- nancial information in the annual report to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited nancial statements. 
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on nancial statements 
In our opinion the group nancial statements: 
 — give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs 
as at 31 December 2012 and of its loss and cash ows for the 
year then ended; 
 — have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union; and 
 — have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the lAS Regulation. 
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report 
for the nancial year for which the group nancial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the group nancial statements;
Emphasis of matter
In forming our opinion on the nancial statements, 
which is not modi ed, we have considered the adequacy 
of the disclosure made in note 2 to the nancial statements 
concerning the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
This ability is dependent whether the Group can obtain 
additional nancing and an extension of the maturities of 
the existing debt facilities from the respective lenders and 
shareholders. This condition, along with the other matters 
explained in note 2 to the nancial statements, indicate the 
existence of a material uncertainty which may cast signi cant 
doubt about the Group’s and Company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern. The nancial statements do not include the 
adjustments that would result if the Group and Company 
was unable to continue as a going concern.
Matters on which we are required to report 
by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion: 
 — certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration speci ed 
by law are not made; or 
 — we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit; or
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
 — the directors’ statement, in relation to going concern; 
 — the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating 
to the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code speci ed for our review; and
 — certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board 
on directors’ remuneration.
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the parent company nancial 
statements of Ruspetro plc for the period ended 31 December 
2012 and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report that is described as having been audited. That report 
includes an emphasis of matter.

Notes to the consolidated nancial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2012 (all tabular amounts are in US$ thousands, except otherwise stated)
1. Corporate information
The consolidated nancial statements of Ruspetro plc (the ‘Parent’ or ‘Ruspetro’) and its subsidiaries, together referred 
to as ‘the Group’ for the year ended 31 December 2012 were approved by its Board of Directors on 20 March 2013. 
The Parent was incorporated in the United Kingdom on 20 October 2011 as a public company under the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006 of England and Wales. The Parent’s registered of ce is 57–59 St James’s Street, London, SW1A 1LD England.
On 18 January 2012, the Parent became a company of the Group through a series of shares exchanges (see Note 19).
Although these consolidated nancial statements have been released in the name of the Parent, they represent 
an in-substance continuation of the existing Group, headed by Ruspetro Holding Limited (the ‘Previous Parent’) 
and the following accounting treatment has been applied to account for the reorganization:
 — the consolidated assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries were recognized and measured at the pre-reorganization 
carrying amounts, without restatement to fair value; 
 — the retained earnings and other equity balances recognized in the consolidated statement of nancial position re ect the 
consolidated retained earnings and other equity balances of the Previous Parent immediately prior to the reorganization, 
and the results of the period from 1 January 2012 to the date of the reorganization are those of the Previous Parent as 
the Parent was not active prior to the reorganization. Subsequent to the reorganization, the equity structure re ects 
the applicable movements in equity of the Parent, including the equity instruments issued to effect the reorganization 
and the Initial Public Offering (‘IPO’) (Note 19); and 
 — comparative numbers presented in the consolidated nancial statements are those reported in the consolidated nancial 
statements of the Previous Parent for the year ended 31 December 2011.
The principal activities of the Group are exploration for and production of crude oil. The operating subsidiaries of the Group – 
OJSC INGA and OJSC Trans-oil (hereinafter referred to as INGA and Trans-oil respectively) hold three licenses for exploration 
for and extraction of crude oil and natural gas in the Khanty-Mansiysk region of the Russian Federation.
Details of subsidiaries consolidated within the Group are as follows:

On 19 January 2012, LLC Sberbank Capital transferred its 5% participating interest in Ruspetro Russia to the Company in 
consideration for a pro rata number of shares in the Parent. As of this date, all of the Group’s subsidiaries were 100% owned.
2. Basis of preparation
These consolidated nancial statements of the Parent, including those of its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) have been prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. The consolidated 
 nancial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, modi ed for fair values under IFRS.
The consolidated nancial statements are presented in US dollars (‘US$’) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 
unless otherwise indicated.
Going concern
These consolidated nancial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, which presumes that the Group will be able 
to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business in the foreseeable future.
At 31 December 2012, the Group had net current liabilities of US$10,385 thousand, which included cash in hand of 
US$34,416 thousand. Furthermore, the Group has a long-term loan from Sberbank amounting to US$286,671 thousand, 
which is repayable in May 2015, together with long-term shareholder loans of US$61,822 thousand which are also repayable 
in May 2015. 
Management consider that the continued operational existence of the Group is dependent upon the ability to make further 
investment in eld development in order to increase hydrocarbon production and sales. In response to these circumstances, 
management are in discussions with existing lenders with regard to the provision of additional long-term debt nancing and 
the extension of the maturity of the existing long-term loans. Ruspetro plc
63
Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Management consider the additional nancing and the maturity extension of existing debt will provide suf cient nancial 
resources such that the Group can further invest in eld development with the intention of raising production. Management 
further consider that the additional cash ows to be generated from production would allow the Group to service debt, 
further increase production and fund other Group activities. In developing their cash ow forecasts, management have 
a number of signi cant assumptions. These include assumptions as to future hydrocarbon prices, taxes, production 
volumes, and in ation and are further discussed in Note 4. 
Agreements with the existing lenders as to additional nancing and maturity extension have not been entered into as of the date 
of these nancial statements. In the event that such additional nancing and maturity extension is not obtained, the Group may 
be unable to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. These circumstances represent 
a material uncertainty that may cast signi cant doubt on the Group’s and Parent’s ability to continue as a going concern.
However, on the basis of the assumptions and cash ow forecasts prepared, management have assumed that the Group will 
continue to operate within both available and prospective facilities. Accordingly, the Group nancial statements are prepared 
on the going concern basis and do not include any adjustments that would be required in the event that the loan holders 
do request repayment and alternative nance is not available.
3. Summary of signi cant accounting policies
Principles of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are those entities in which the Group has an interest of more than one half of the voting rights, or otherwise 
has power to exercise control over their operations. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is 
transferred to the Group and are no longer consolidated from the date that control ceases. 
All intercompany transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated; 
unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. 
Where necessary accounting policies for subsidiaries have been changed to ensure consistency with the policies adopted 
by the Group. 
The nancial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the Parent, using consistent 
accounting policies.
Business combinations 
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred 
for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests 
issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent 
consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identi able assets acquired and liabilities 
and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition 
date. On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Group recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at 
fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets. 
The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date 
fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identi able net assets 
acquired is recorded as goodwill. If this is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case 
of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognized directly in pro t or loss. 
Oil and natural gas exploration, evaluation and development expenditure 
Oil and gas exploration activities are accounted for in a manner similar to the successful efforts method. Costs of successful 
development and exploratory wells are capitalized.
Development costs
Expenditure on the construction, installation or completion of infrastructure facilities such as platforms, pipelines and the drilling 
of development wells, including unsuccessful development or delineation wells, is capitalized within oil and gas properties.
Property, plant and equipment, Mineral rights and other intangibles
Oil and gas properties and other property, plant and equipment, including mineral rights are stated at cost, less accumulated 
depletion, depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. 
The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing 
the asset into operation, the initial estimate of the decommissioning obligation, and for qualifying assets, borrowing costs. 
The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given 
to acquire the asset.

Financial statements
Notes to the consolidated nancial statements continued
for the year ended 31 December 2012 (all tabular amounts are in US$ thousands unless otherwise noted)
Depreciation and Depletion
Oil and gas properties are depreciated on a unit-of-production basis over proved developed reserves of the eld concerned, 
except in the case of assets whose useful life is shorter than the lifetime of the eld, in which case the straight-line method 
is applied. Mineral rights are depleted on the unit-of-production basis over proved and probable reserves of the relevant area. 
Other property, plant and equipment are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives 
as follows: 
Years
Buildings and constructions 30–50
Other property, plant and equipment 1–6
Major maintenance and repairs
Expenditure on major maintenance re ts or repairs comprises the cost of replacement assets or parts of assets, inspection costs 
and overhaul costs. Where an asset or part of an asset that was separately depreciated and is now written off is replaced and it is 
probable that future economic bene ts associated with the item will ow to the Group, the expenditure is capitalized. Where part 
of the asset was not separately considered as a component, the replacement value is used to estimate the carrying amount of the 
replaced assets which is immediately written off. Inspection costs associated with major maintenance programs are capitalized 
and amortized over the period to the next inspection. All other maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are stated at the amount initially recognized, less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment 
losses. Intangible assets include computer software.
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a 
business combination is fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at 
cost less any accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment losses. Amortization is calculated on a straight-line 
basis over their useful lives, except for mineral rights that are depleted on the unit-of-production basis as explained above.
Impairment of assets
The Group monitors internal and external indicators of impairment relating to its tangible and intangible assets.
The recoverable amounts of Cash Generating Units (‘CGU’) and individual assets have been determined based on the higher 
of value-in-use (VIU)calculations and fair values less costs to sell (FVLCS). These calculations require the use of estimates 
and assumptions. It is reasonably possible that the oil price assumption may change which may then impact the estimated 
life of the eld and may then require a material adjustment to the carrying value of long-term assets. 
Given the shared infrastructure and interdependency of cash ows related to the three licenses the Group holds, the assets 
are considered to represent one CGU, which is the lowest level where largely independent cash ows are deemed to exist.
Share option plan 
The share option plan, under which the Group has the ability to choose whether to settle it in cash or equity instruments at 
the discretion of the Board of Directors is accounted for as an equity settled transaction. The fair value of the options granted 
by the Parent to employees is measured at the grant date and calculated using the trinomial option pricing model and 
recognized in the consolidated nancial statements as a component of equity with a corresponding amount recognized 
in selling, general and administrative expenses over the time share reward vest to the employee.
Modi cations of the terms or conditions of the equity instruments granted in a manner that reduces the total fair value of 
the share-based payment arrangement or is not otherwise bene cial to the employee, are accounted for as services received 
in consideration for the equity instruments granted as if the modi cation had not occurred.
Financial instruments
A nancial instrument is any contract that gives rise to nancial assets or liabilities.
Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classi ed as either nancial assets at fair value through pro t or loss, loans 
and receivables, held to maturity investments, or available for sale nancial assets, as appropriate. When nancial assets are 
recognized initially, they are measured at fair value, plus directly attributable transaction costs for all nancial assets not 
carried at fair value through pro t or loss. 
The Group determines the classi cation of its nancial assets at initial recognition.
3. Summary of signi cant accounting policies continued Ruspetro plc
65
Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Financial instruments carried on the consolidated statement of nancial position include loans and receivables, cash and 
cash equivalent balances, borrowings, accounts payable and put and call options. The particular recognition and measurement 
methods adopted are disclosed in the individual policy statements associated with each item.
An obligation to acquire own shares is classi ed as a liability. The liability to repurchase own shares is initially recognized 
at the fair value of consideration payable (being the net present value of estimated redemption amount) and it is recorded 
as deduction of equity. Subsequent changes (revision of estimate, unwinding of discount) are recognized in pro t or loss. 
If options are not exercised, the amount recognised as a liability is transferred to equity.
Rights to acquire own shares are classi ed as assets. The right to repurchase own shares is initially recognized at the fair 
value of consideration payable, estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and it is recorded as increase 
of equity. Subsequent changes (revision of estimate) are recognized in pro t and loss. 
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative nancial assets with xed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an 
active market. After initial measurement loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective 
interest method less any provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment is recognized when there is an objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all 
amounts due according to the original terms of the loans and receivables. The amount of provision is the difference between the 
assets’ carrying value and the present value of the estimated future cash ows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. 
The change in the amount of the loan or receivable is recognized in pro t or loss. Interest income is recognized in pro t or loss 
by applying the effective interest rate.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statement of nancial position comprise cash at banks and on hand and 
short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. 
For the purpose of the consolidated cash ow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents 
as de ned above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts if any.
Borrowings and accounts payable
The Group’s nancial liabilities are represented by accounts payable and borrowings. 
Borrowings are initially recognized at fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs. 
After initial recognition, borrowings are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method; any difference 
between the initial fair value of the consideration received (net of transaction costs) and the redemption amount is 
recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the period of the borrowings.
A nancial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or canceled or expires. Where an 
existing nancial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an 
existing liability are substantially modi ed, such an exchange or modi cation is treated as a derecognition of the original 
liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the 
pro t or loss.
Impairment of nancial assets 
The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that a nancial asset or a 
group of nancial assets is impaired. A nancial asset or a group of nancial assets is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, 
there is an objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial recognition 
of the asset (an incurred ‘loss event’) and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash ows of the nancial 
asset or the group of nancial assets that can be reliably estimated. Evidence of impairment may include indications that 
the debtors or a group of debtors is experiencing signi cant nancial dif culty, default or delinquency in interest or principal 
payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other nancial reorganization and where observable data 
indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash ows, such as changes in arrears or economic 
conditions that correlate with defaults.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost of inventory is determined on the weighted average 
basis. The cost of nished goods and work in progress comprises raw material, direct labor, other direct costs and related 
production overheads (based on normal operating capacity) but excludes borrowing costs. Net realizable value is the 
estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated cost of completion and selling expenses.

Provisions 
General
Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is 
probable that an out ow of resources embodying economic bene ts will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The expense relating to any provision is presented in pro t or loss net 
of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using rates that re ect, 
where appropriate, the risks speci c to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the 
passage of time is recognized as nance costs.
Provision for dismantlement
Provision for dismantlement is related primarily to the conservation and abandonment of wells, removal of pipelines and other 
oil and gas facilities together with site restoration activities related to the Group’s license areas. When a constructive obligation 
to incur such costs is identi ed and their amount can be measured reliably, the net present value of future decommissioning 
and site restoration costs is capitalized within property plant and equipment with a corresponding liability. Provisions are 
estimated based on engineering estimates, license and other statutory requirements and practices adopted in the industry 
and are discounted to net present value using discount rates re ecting adjustments for risks speci c to the obligation.
Adequacy of such provisions is periodically reviewed. Changes in provisions resulting from the passage of time are re ected in 
pro t or loss each year under nance costs. Other changes in provisions, relating to a change in the expected pattern of settlement 
of the obligation, changes in the discount rate or in the estimated amount of the obligation, are treated as a change in accounting 
estimate in the period of the change and are re ected as an adjustment to the provision and a corresponding adjustment to 
property, plant and equipment. If a decrease in the liability exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, the excess is recognized 
immediately in pro t or loss.
Taxes
Income tax
The income tax expense comprises current and deferred taxes calculated based on the tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period. Current and deferred taxes are charged or credited to pro t or loss 
except where they are attributable to items which are charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the corresponding 
tax is also taken to equity.
Current tax is the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the taxation authorities in respect of taxable pro ts 
or losses for the current and prior periods. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated in respect of temporary differences using the liability method. Deferred 
taxes provide for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values 
for nancial reporting purposes, except where the deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in 
a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting pro t 
nor taxable pro t or loss.
A deferred tax asset is recognized for all deductible temporary differences and carry forward of unused tax credits and 
unused tax losses only to the extent that it is probable that taxable pro t will be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences or carry forward losses can be utilized. 
Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at the end of each reporting period and are recognized to the extent that 
it has become probable that future taxable pro t will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and 
liabilities, when deferred tax balances are referred to the same governmental body (i.e. federal, regional or local) and the 
same subject of taxation and when the Group intends to perform an offset of its current tax assets and liabilities. 
Value added tax
Russian Value Added Tax (‘VAT’) at a standard rate of 18% is payable on the difference between output VAT on sales of goods 
and services and recoverable input VAT charged by suppliers. Output VAT is charged on the earliest of the dates: either the 
date of the shipment of goods (works, services) or the date of advance payment by the buyer. Input VAT could be recovered 
when purchased goods (works, services) are accounted for and other necessary requirements provided by the tax legislation 
are met. 
VAT related to sales and purchases is recognised in the consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis and disclosed separately 
as a current asset and liability.

Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Mineral extraction tax 
Mineral extraction tax on hydrocarbons, including natural gas and crude oil, is due on the basis of quantities of natural resources 
extracted. Mineral extraction tax for crude oil is determined based on the volume produced per xed tax rate (RUR419 per ton) 
adjusted depending on the monthly average market prices of the Urals blend and the RUR/US$ exchange rate for the preceding 
month. The ultimate amount of the mineral extraction tax on crude oil depends also on the depletion and geographic location of 
the oil eld. Mineral extraction tax on gas condensate is determined based on a xed percentage from the value of the extracted 
mineral resources. Mineral extraction tax is accrued as a tax on production and recorded within cost of sales.
Equity
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classi ed as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares and options 
are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. Any excess of the fair value of shares issued or liabilities 
extinguishment over the par value of shares issued is recorded as share premium.
Other reserves
Other reserves include reserve on reorganisation of the Group (Note 19), the amount of initial recognition of share options 
of shareholders (Note 17) and amount related to fair value of directors’ options (Note 17).
Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interests (‘NCI’) is the equity in subsidiaries not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the Parent. NCI at 
the end of the reporting period represents the non-controlling shareholders’ portion of the carrying value of the identi able 
assets and liabilities of the subsidiary. NCI are presented within equity, separately from the equity, attributable to the 
Parent’s shareholders.
The Group treats transactions with NCI as transactions with equity owners of the Group. For purchases from NCI 
the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the 
subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recognized in equity.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods provided or services rendered 
less any trade discounts, value added tax and similar sales-based taxes after eliminating sales within the Group. 
Revenue from sale of crude oil and gas condensate is recognized when the signi cant risks and rewards of ownership have 
been transferred to the customer, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, it is probable that the economic bene ts 
associated with the transaction will ow to the Group and costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of this transaction can 
be measured reliably. If the Group agrees to transport the goods to a speci ed location, revenue is recognized when goods 
are passed to the customer at the designated location. 
Other revenue is recognized in accordance with contract terms. 
Interest income is accrued on a regular basis by reference to the outstanding principal amount and the applicable effective 
interest rate, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the nancial 
asset to that asset’s net carrying amount. Dividend income is recognized where the shareholders’ right to receive a dividend 
payment is established.
Leases
Leases in which a signi cant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classi ed 
as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged 
to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly relating to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying capital project under 
construction are capitalized and added to the project cost during construction until such time that the assets are substantially 
ready for their intended use i.e. when they are capable of production. Where funds are borrowed speci cally to nance a project, 
the amount capitalized represents the actual borrowing costs incurred. Where surplus funds are available for a short term out 
of money borrowed speci cally to nance a project, the income generated from such short-term investments is also capitalized 
and deducted from the total capitalised borrowing cost. Where the funds used to nance a project form part of general 
borrowings, the amount capitalized is calculated using a weighted average of rates applicable to relevant general borrowings 
of the Group during the period. All other borrowing costs are recognized in the pro t or loss as nance costs in the period 
in which they are incurred.

Employee bene ts 
Wages, salaries, contributions to the Russian Federation state pension and social insurance funds, paid annual leave and sick 
leave, bonuses are expensed as incurred.
Foreign currency translation
Foreign currency transactions are initially recognized in the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the date of 
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency rate 
of exchange in effect at the end of the reporting period. 
The US dollar (‘US$’) is the presentation currency of the Group and the functional currency of the Parent. The functional 
currency of subsidiaries operating in the Russian Federation is the Russian Rouble (‘RUR’). The assets and liabilities of the 
subsidiaries are translated into the presentation currency of the Group at the rate of exchange ruling at the end of each of 
the reporting periods. Income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless this 
average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which 
case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions). All the resulting exchange differences 
are recorded in other comprehensive income. 
The US$ to RUR exchange rates were 30.37 and 32.20 as at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011, respectively and the 
average rates for the year ended 31 December 2012 and 2011 were 31.07 and 28.74, respectively. The US$ to GBP exchange 
rates were 0.62 and 0.65 as at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011, respectively and the average rates for the year ended 
31 December 2012 and 2011 were 0.63 and 0.62, respectively. The decrease in the US$ to RUR exchange rate for the year 
ended 31 December 2012 has resulted in a gain of US$23,804 thousand in the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income and an adjustment of US$6,061 thousand in Other comprehensive income (refer to Notes 13 and 14).
 . Signi cant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies management is required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions 
about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. 
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be 
relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing 
basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only 
that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The most signi cant areas of accounting requiring the use of the Group’s management estimates and assumptions relate 
to oil and gas reserves; useful economic lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment; impairment of tangible 
assets; provisions for dismantlement; taxation and allowances.
Subsoil licenses
The Group conducts operations under exploration and production licenses which require minimum levels of capital 
expenditure and mineral production, timely payment of taxes, provision of geological data to authorities and other 
such requirements. The current periods of the Group’s licenses expire between June 2014 and June 2017.
Regulatory authorities exercise considerable discretion in issuing and renewing licenses and in monitoring licensees’ 
compliance with license terms. The loss of license would be considered a material adverse event for the Group.
It is management’s judgment that each of the three licenses held by the Group will be renewed for the economic lives of 
the elds which are projected to be up to 2040 (two licenses held by INGA) and 2029 (the license held by Trans-oil). The 
appraised economic lives of the elds are used as the basis for reserves estimation, depletion calculation and impairment 
analysis. In making this assessment, management consider that the license held by Trans-oil, which was extended for three 
years to December 2015, will be further extended. This further extension will be depended on management demonstrating 
to licensing authorities that associated petroleum gas produced in the course of oil production is being utilised.
Useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment and Mineral rights
Oil and gas properties and mineral rights
The Group’s oil and gas properties are depleted over the respective life of the oil and gas elds using the unit-of-production 
method based on proved developed oil and gas reserves (Note 13). Mineral rights are depleted over the respective life of the 
oil and gas elds using the unit-of-production method based on proved and probable oil and gas reserves (Note 14). 
Reserves are determined using estimates of oil in place, recovery factors and future oil prices.

69
Annual Report and Accounts 2012
When determining the life of the oil and gas eld, assumptions that were valid at the time of estimation, may change when 
new information becomes available. The factors that could affect the estimation of the life of an oil and gas eld include 
the following:
 — changes of proved and probable oil and gas reserves;
 — differences between actual commodity prices and commodity price assumptions used in the estimation of oil and 
gas reserves;
 — unforeseen operational issues; and
 — changes in capital, operating, processing and reclamation costs, discount rates and foreign exchange rates possibly 
adversely affecting the economic viability of oil and gas reserves.
Any of these changes could affect prospective depletion of mineral rights and oil and gas assets and their carrying value.
Other non-production assets
Property, plant and equipment other than oil and gas properties are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful 
economic lives (Note 13). Management at the end of each reporting period reviews the appropriateness of the assets useful 
economic lives and residual values. The review is based on the current condition of the assets, the estimated period during 
which they will continue to bring economic bene t to the Group and their estimated residual value.
Estimation of oil and gas reserves
Unit-of-production depreciation, depletion and amortization charges are principally measured based on Group’s estimates 
of proved developed and proved and probable oil and gas reserves. Estimates of proved and probable reserves are also 
used in determination of impairment charges and reversals. Proved and probable reserves are estimated by independent 
international reservoir engineers, by reference to available geological and engineering data, and only include volumes 
for which access to market is assured with reasonable certainty. 
Information about the carrying amounts of oil and gas properties and the depreciation, depletion and amortization charged 
is provided in Notes 13 and 14.
Estimates of oil and gas reserves are inherently imprecise, require the application of judgments and are subject to regular 
revision, either upward or downward, based on new information such as from the drilling of additional wells, observation 
of long-term reservoir performance under producing conditions and changes in economic factors, including product prices, 
contract terms or development plans. Changes to the Group’s estimates of proved and probable reserves affect prospectively 
the amounts of depreciation, depletion and amortization charged and, consequently, the carrying amounts of mineral rights 
and oil and gas properties.
Were the estimated proved reserves to differ by 10% from management’s estimates, the impact on depletion would 
be as follows:
Increase/decrease in reserves estimation
Effect on loss before tax for 
the year ended 31 December
2012 2011
+10% (1,628) (2,132)
-10% 1,989 2,606
Provision for dismantlement
The Group has a constructive obligation to recognize a provision for dismantlement for its oil and gas assets (Note 21). 
The fair values of these obligations are recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis, which is typically at the time when assets 
are installed. The Group performs analysis and makes estimates in order to determine the probability, timing and amount 
involved with probable required out ow of resources. Estimating the amounts and timing of such dismantlement costs 
requires signi cant judgment. The judgment is based on cost and engineering studies using currently available technology 
and is based on current environmental regulations. Provision for dismantlement is subject to change because of change 
in laws and regulations, and their interpretation.
Estimated dismantlement costs, for which the out ow of resources is determined to be probable, are recognized as a provision 
in the Group’s nancial statements. 
Impairment of non-current assets 
The Group accounts for the impairment of non-current assets in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. Under IAS 
36, the Group is required to assess the conditions that could cause assets to become impaired and to perform a recoverability 
test for potentially impaired assets held by the Group. These conditions include whether a signi cant decrease in the market 
value of the assets has occurred, whether changes in the Group’s business plan for the assets have been made or whether 
a signi cant adverse change in the business environment has arisen.
 . Signi cant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions continued Ruspetro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
70
Subsequent to the year end, the Group’s shares have been trading at a level which indicate that the market capitalization 
of the Group is below the carrying value of net assets. This has resulted in a review of the Group’s non-current assets 
(Oil and Gas properties and Mineral Rights) to determine whether they are impaired as at the reporting date.
If there are indications of loss in value, the recoverable amount is estimated. The recoverable amount is the higher of 
the assets FVLCS, or its VIU. Management consider that an appropriate approach to determining FVLCS is by discounting 
the post-tax cash ows expected to be generated by the oil and gas assets, net of associated selling costs, taking into account 
those assumptions that market participants would use in estimating fair value. The VIU is a discounted cash ow calculation 
based on continued use of the assets in its present condition, excluding potential exploitation of improvement or 
expansion potential.
The determination of the recoverable amount for both the FVLCS and the VIU involves assumptions as to future 
hydrocarbon prices, taxes, production volumes, and in ation. The models also use estimates of proved developed for 
VIU and proved and probable reserves for FVLCS as developed by the independent Reservoir Engineers, DeGolyer and 
MacNaughton. Estimated cash ows are discounted with a risk adjusted discount rate derived as the weighted average 
cost of capital (‘WACC’). For the Group’s businesses the pre-tax nominal discount rate is estimated at 12%. 
Based on our estimation of fair value less cost of sale, we do not consider that the Group’s non-current assets are impaired 
as of 31 December 2012. 
Assumptions used in developing cash ow forecasts of the Group
Assumptions Value
Average crude oil price USD 101 per barrel
Average effective rate of mineral extraction tax of crude oil RUB 4,700 per ton
Average effective rate of mineral extraction tax of gas condensate RUB 590 per ton
Production volume of crude oil over economic life of the elds 438,574 thousand barrels
Production volume of gas condensate over economic life of the elds 13,584 thousand barrels
In ation 5%
As the FVLCS is sensitive to changes in production volume and to changes in average crude oil price the impairment of oil 
and gas properties may occur if crude oil initial ow rate per well would be equal to 220 barrels per day or average crude oil 
price per barrel would be equal to US$60.
Taxation
The Group is subject to income and other taxes. Signi cant judgment is required in determining the provision for income 
tax and other taxes due to complexity of the tax legislation of the Russian Federation. Deferred tax assets are recognized to 
the extent that it is probable that it will generate enough taxable pro ts to utilize deferred income tax recognized. Signi cant 
management judgment is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets recognized, based upon the likely timing 
and the level of future taxable pro ts. Management prepares cash ow forecasts to support recoverability of deferred tax assets. 
Cash ow models are based on a number of assumptions relating to oil prices, operating expenses, production volumes, etc. 
These assumptions are consistent with those used by independent reservoir engineers. Management also takes into account 
uncertainties related to future activities of the Group and going concern considerations. When signi cant uncertainties exist 
deferred tax assets arising from losses are not recognized even if recoverability of these is supported by cash ow forecasts.
Segment reporting
Management views the Group as one operating segment and uses reports for the entire Group to make strategic decisions. 
98% and 97% of total revenues from external customers in 2012 and 2011 respectively were derived from sales of crude oil 
and gas condensate. These sales are made to domestic and international oil traders. Although there are a limited number 
of these traders the Group is not dependent on any one of them as crude oil is widely traded and there are a number of 
other potential buyers of this commodity. The Group’s operations are entirely located in Russia.
Gain on settlement of Makayla Investment Limited liability
Management views the difference between the carrying value of the liability to Makayla Investments Limited (‘Makayla’) 
and the fair value of shares issued for the settlement of the liability is a gain because in effect the transaction was settled 
with a third party (Note 10).
The Parent’s Board of Directors evaluates performance of the entity on the basis of different measures, including total 
expenses, capital expenditures, operating expenses per barrel and others.

6. Segment reporting 
The management views the operations of the Group as one operating segment. Should the Group diversify its operations 
the nancial reporting will be adjusted to re ect the change. 
The Chief operating decision maker evaluates performance of the Group on the basis of different measures, including 
production volumes, related revenues, capital expenditures, operating expenses per barrel and others.

Total cost of sales 74,816 52,355
Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended 31 December 2012 has decreased compared to 2011 due 
to the increase in estimates of proved developed reserves (Note 28). Oil and gas property, plant and equipment are primarily 
depleted on the unit of production basis over proved developed reserves of the elds concerned. The effect on the unit of 
production depletion resulting from the increase in estimates of proved developed reserves is somewhat offset by the 
increase in property, plant and equipment and the increase in hydrocarbons production compared to the 
corresponding period.
Production services include mainly pump rent, geophysics and electricity. Production services for the year ended 
31 December 2012 have increased compared to 2011 primarily due to increased levels of production activity.

10. Other income
On 13 December 2011, Itera Group Limited agreed to sell a receivable from Ruspetro relating to deferred consideration 
arising from the acquisition of INGA and Trans-oil (the ‘Itera debt’) to Makayla Investments Limited (‘Makayla’), a related 
party and shareholder of the Parent. As at 31 December 2011, Ruspetro had a related liability including accrued interest 
of US$47,453 thousand recorded in its consolidated nancial statements.
Makayla negotiated the terms of settlement with Itera and agreed to buy the receivable at an amount lower than the carrying 
value. Makayla passed on this bene t to Ruspetro by entering into an agreement dated 13 December 2011 with Ruspetro, 
granting it the option to acquire the debt owing to Makayla by no later than 25 January 2012 for US$26,171 thousand. 
On 18 January 2012, the Parent Company issued 12,707,584 Ordinary shares at £1.34 each to Makayla to acquire this debt for a 
total fair value of US$26,171 thousand. Management is of the view that the difference between the carrying value of the liability 
and the fair value of shares issued is a gain because in effect the transaction was settled with a third party. Accordingly, an 
amount of US$21,282 thousand representing the difference between the nominal value of the debt and the fair value of the 
issued Ordinary shares was recognized as other income.

Trade receivables are mainly denominated in US$ and are not past-due or impaired. Other receivables and prepayments 
are mostly RUR denominated and relate to counterparties with no history of delays in settlements. VAT recoverable is 
used to offset against amounts due for mineral extraction tax or recovered in cash. The VAT is recovered within three 
to six months from its initiation, following a review by the tax authorities. 
As at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011, the Group did not have any past due or impaired receivables. In determining 
the recoverability of trade and other receivables the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the receivable from 
the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. 
17. Options on shares of the Parent
On 2 December 2011, the Parent and LLC ‘Sberbank Capital’ entered into an option agreement which became effective 
on 17 January 2012, pursuant to which LLC ‘Sberbank Capital’ granted the Parent a call option to acquire the 10,362,632 
Ordinary shares held by LLC ‘Sberbank Capital’. The call option may be exercised once only at any time prior to the day 
which is 15 months from the date of IPO, at an exercise price equal to the IPO Price (£1.34) per share less 10%. 
The fair value of this call option amounted to US$24 thousand as at 31 December 2012. The fair value of this option was 
calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and was recognized in these consolidated nancial statements 
as a current asset. 
The following table presents the changes of fair value of call option for the year ended 31 December 2012:

Expected volatility was determined on the basis of the historic share price volatility of certain peer companies of the Group.
In addition, pursuant to this agreement, LLC ‘Sberbank Capital’ may put the Ordinary shares issued back to the Parent. 
The put option may be exercised once only at any time between the second and third anniversary of Admission, which 
took place on 24 January 2012, at an exercise price equal to the Offer Price (£1.34) less 20%. With respect to the put 
option, a non-current liability of US$15,365 thousand has been recorded as at 31 December 2012. Ruspetro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Reorganization of the Group and Initial Public Offering (‘IPO’)
On 18 January 2012, a new holding structure became effective. The reorganization was effected through a series of shares 
exchanges as described below.
On 18 January 2012, the existing shareholders of the Previous Parent transferred their shares in the Previous Parent to the 
Parent in consideration for the issue of 196,890,000 Ordinary shares in the Parent, representing 95% of the issued share 
capital of the Parent at the date of transfer with nominal value of £0.10 each.
On 19 January 2012, LLC Sberbank Capital transferred its 5% participating interest in Ruspetro Russia to the Parent in 
consideration for the issue of 10,362,632 Ordinary shares in the Parent, representing approximately 5% of the issued share 
capital of the Parent at the date of transfer with nominal value of £0.10 each.
Also on 19 January 2012, the Parent completed an IPO on the London Stock Exchange. As a result of the IPO, 126,128,848 
Ordinary shares were issued with nominal value of £0.10 each at a price of £1.34 per Ordinary share, including 12,707,584 
Ordinary shares to the value of US$26.2 million in settlement of the debt owing to Makayla, related to the original Itera debt 
(Note 10). The IPO-related transaction costs amounted to US$19 million.
The net consideration received amounted to US$213.7 million.

Directors’ options
On 17 January 2012, the Parent granted two executive directors the options to acquire 10,362,632 Ordinary shares with 
an exercise price of £1.34. These options are outstanding as at the balance sheet date. At grant date the options were not 
subject to service and performance conditions, therefore the value of these options was expensed immediately. In February 
2013 the terms of the options were amended by introduction of vesting periods which are as follows: the options vest in three 
equal installments on 17 January 2013, 17 January 2014 and 17 January 2015. After those dates the options are exercisable 
any time up to 16 January 2022. 
The fair value of the options amounted to US$12,035 thousand and was calculated using the Trinomial option pricing model 
and recognized in these consolidated nancial statements as a component of equity, with a corresponding amount recognized 
in selling, general and administrative expenses.
The following assumptions were used in calculating the fair value:

Sberbank credit facility
The Group has a non-revolving US$ denominated credit facility from Sberbank which had the following terms at the date of 
obtaining the credit facility: a limit of US$250,000 thousand expiring in 2013 with an annual interest rate of 14%. The Parent 
has pledged all its shares in INGA and Trans-oil as part of the terms of the credit facility.
In 2010, the annual interest rate on the facility was reduced to 9%, increasing to 10.9% from 1 October of that year.
On 25 November 2011, the terms of Sberbank’s credit facility were amended whereby, inter alia, repayments of a portion 
of accrued interest and its principal were deferred until April 2015, and future accrued interest is to be payable half-yearly 
in May and November of each year. These amendments did not substantially alter the terms of the original credit facility, 
and were therefore not treated as extinguishment of an existing liability and recognition of a new liability. The present value 
difference arising from the amendments was recognized over the remaining life of the instrument by adjusting the effective 
interest rate. 
According to the Amended Agreement, on 3 February 2012, Ruspetro paid a portion of the accrued interest, which amounted 
to US$27,055 thousand together with US$17,945 thousand of principal, with further repayments of outstanding interest 
of US$10,639 thousand and US$12,618 thousand made on 25 May 2012 and on 26 November 2012, respectively.
The Group recognized a net foreign exchange gain amounting to US$19,512 thousand and a net foreign exchange loss 
amounting to US$20,439 thousand during the years ended 31 December 2012 and 2011 respectively on the Sberbank 
credit facility and outstanding accrued interest which is denominated in US$.

Loans from shareholders of the Parent
The Group has a number of US$ denominated loans obtained from the Shareholders of the Parent. All of these loans are unsecured 
and the interest rate on most of these loans is Libor +10% per annum. Certain loans have matured by 31 December 2012 and are 
presented as current liabilities as at this date.
On 17 January 2012, the Parent and one of the shareholders agreed that the Parent will issue new Ordinary shares to that 
shareholder on the date that is 13 months from the date of Admission in full settlement of a loan obtained from the shareholder. 
On 18 February 2013, a decision was taken not to proceed with the conversion.
21. Provision for dismantlement
The provision for dismantlement represents the net present value of the estimated future obligations for abandonment 
and site restoration costs which are expected to be incurred at the end of the production lives of the oil and gas elds 
which is estimated to be in 21 years from 31 December 2012.

This provision has been created based on management’s internal estimates. Assumptions, based on the current economic 
environment, have been made which management believe are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate future dismantlement 
liability. These estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions. However, actual 
dismantlement costs will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary dismantlement works required which 
will re ect market conditions at the relevant time. Furthermore, the timing is likely to depend on when the elds cease to 
produce at economically viable levels. This in turn will depend upon future oil and gas prices and future operating costs 
which are inherently uncertain.

23. Capital commitments and other contingencies 
Capital commitments
The Group did not have any non-cancellable capital commitments at 31 December 2012 or 2011.
License commitments
The Group’s exploration and production licenses require certain operational commitments. These include performance 
criteria certain of which have not been fully met during 2012. The directors note that breach of license performance conditions 
has not given rise to any material nes or penalties. Furthermore, management has been undertaking particular actions to 
meet required license performance criteria. The directors also note that the Group’s production program has been inspected 
by the Russian licensing authorities subsequent to 31 December 2012 and that no material nes or penalties have resulted.
Liquidity of subsidiary undertakings
In accordance with the legal framework in the Russian Federation, creditors and tax authorities may initiate bankruptcy 
procedures against an entity with negative net assets. Ruspetro Russia as at 31 December 2012 reported net liabilities under 
Russian GAAP . However, no such bankruptcy procedures have been initiated either by the creditors or the tax authorities against 
them. The directors consider their net liability position to be normal given that the Company is still at a development stage.

Operating lease commitments – Group as lessee
The Group has entered into leases for land plots, woodlots and motor vehicles. The land in the Russian Federation on which 
the Group’s production facilities are located is owned by the State. The Group leases land through operating lease agreements, 
which expire in various years through 2021. These leases have renewal terms at the option of the lessee at lease payments 
based on market prices at the time of renewal. There are no restrictions placed upon the lessee by entering into these leases.
Future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases as at 31 December 2012 and 2011 were as follows:

Pledge of shares
On the opening of its credit facility with Sberbank, the Group provided to Sberbank as collateral its shares in INGA and Trans-oil. 
Taxation contingencies
Russian tax, currency and customs legislation is subject to varying interpretations, and changes, which can occur frequently. 
Management’s interpretation of such legislation as applied to the transactions and activity of the Group may be challenged 
by the relevant regional and federal authorities in the Russian Federation. 
Recent events within the Russian Federation indicate that the Russian tax authorities may be taking a more assertive 
position in their interpretation of the prevailing legislation and assessments, and it is possible that transactions and 
activities which have not been challenged in the past may be challenged in the future. The Supreme Arbitration Court 
of the Russian Federation has issued guidance to lower courts on reviewing tax cases providing a systemic roadmap for 
anti-avoidance claims, and it is possible that this will signi cantly increase the level and frequency of tax authorities’ 
scrutiny. As a result, signi cant additional taxes, penalties and interest may be assessed. Fiscal periods remain open 
to review by the authorities in respect of taxes for three calendar years preceding the year of review. Under certain 
circumstances reviews may cover longer periods. 
Amended Russian transfer pricing legislation took effect from 1 January 2012. The new transfer pricing rules are considered 
to be more technical and, to a certain extent, more aligned with the international transfer pricing principles developed by 
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (‘OECD’). The new legislation provides the possibility for tax 
authorities to make transfer pricing adjustments and impose additional tax liabilities in respect of controlled transactions 
(transactions with related parties and some types of transactions with unrelated parties), provided that the transaction price is 
not arm’s length. Management has implemented internal controls to be in compliance with the new transfer pricing legislation. 
Management believes the transfer pricing documentation that the Group has prepared, as required by the new Russian 
tax legislation, provides suf cient evidence to support the Group’s tax positions and related tax returns. Given that the 
implementation of the new Russian transfer pricing rules has not yet been reviewed by tax authorities and courts, the 
impact of any challenge of the Group’s transfer prices cannot be reliably estimated; however, it may be signi cant to 
the nancial conditions and/or the overall operations of the Group.
The Group includes companies incorporated outside of Russia. Tax liabilities of the Group are determined on the assumptions 
that these companies are not subject to Russian pro ts tax because they do not have a permanent establishment in Russia. 
Russian tax laws do not provide detailed rules on taxation of foreign companies. It is possible that with the evolution of the 
interpretation of these rules and the changes in the approach of the Russian tax authorities, the non-taxable status of some 
or all of the foreign companies of the Group in Russia may be challenged. The impact of any such challenge cannot be reliably 
estimated; however, it may be signi cant to the nancial condition and/or the overall operations of the entity. 
Management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and the Group’s tax, currency 
and customs positions will be sustained. Where management believes it is probable that a position cannot be sustained, 
an appropriate amount is accrued for in these consolidated nancial statements.

25. Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s principal nancial liabilities comprise accounts payable, bank borrowings and other loans, and obligations 
under the put option. The main purpose of these nancial liabilities and instruments is to manage short-term cash ow and 
raise nance for the Group’s capital expenditure program. The Group has various nancial assets such as accounts receivable 
and cash, which arise directly from its operations.
It is, and has been throughout the years ended 31 December 2012 and 2011, the Group’s policy that no speculative trading 
in derivatives shall be undertaken.
The main risks that could adversely affect the Group’s nancial assets, liabilities or future cash ows are commodity price 
risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. Management reviews and agrees policies for 
managing each of these risks which are summarized below.
The following discussion also includes a sensitivity analysis that is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market 
variables on the Group’s nancial instruments and show the impact on pro t or loss and shareholders’ equity, where applicable. 
Financial instruments affected by market risk include bank loans and overdrafts, accounts receivable, accounts payable and 
accrued liabilities. 
The sensitivity has been prepared for the years ended 31 December 2012 and 2011 using the amounts of debt and other 
 nancial assets and liabilities held as at those statement of nancing position dates.
Capital risk management
The Group considers capital to comprise both debt and equity. Total debt comprises long-term and short-term loans and 
borrowings, as shown in the consolidated statement of nancial position. Equity of the Group comprises share capital, share 
premium, other reserves, retained earnings and non-controlling interests. Equity of the Group was equal to US$180,447 
thousand and US$(40,737) thousand as at 31 December 2012 and 2011 respectively.
Total debt of the Group was equal to US$370,297 thousand and US$406,447 thousand as at 31 December 2012 and 
31 December 2011 respectively.

Annual Report and Accounts 2012
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to 
provide adequate levels of nancing for its current development and production activities. In order to maintain or adjust the 
capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, issue new shares, attract new or repay 
existing loans and borrowings. 
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, based on the funds available to the Group, in order to 
support its construction and production activities. The Group is at the development stage; as such it is dependent on external 
 nancing to fund its activities. In order to carry out its planned construction and production activities and pay for administrative 
costs, the Group will spend its existing capital and raise additional amounts as needed. 
There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital management during the period. As at 31 December 2012 
and 2011, the Group was not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements (except for described in Note 23). 
As at 31 December 2012 the Group was not subject to any covenants.
Commodity price risk
The Group sells crude oil and gas condensate under spot contracts on a monthly basis. Sales are centrally managed and 
during the reporting periods were made principally to domestic customers. The basis for determining the export price is 
the average monthly price of Brent crude. Changes in commodity prices can affect the Group’s nancial performance, either 
positively or negatively and make the Group’s revenues subject to volatility in line with uctuations in crude oil reference 
prices. Currently the Group does not use commodity derivative instruments to mitigate the risk of crude oil price volatility. 
The table below provides the sensitivity of the Group’s revenues to a 10% change in price of crude oil. 
Commodity price risk
Year ended 31 December
2012 2011
Favorable +10% 7,484 3,760
Unfavorable -10% (7,484) (3,760)
For the purposes of this analysis, the effect of a variation in crude oil prices on Group’s pro t is calculated independently 
of any change in another assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may contribute to changes in another, which may 
magnify or counteract the sensitivities. 
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk, however the possible impact of changes in interest rates are not signi cant since 
the Group’s major borrowings are at xed interest rates. There is no speci c policy in place to hedge against possible adverse 
changes in interest rates.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables 
held constant, of the Group’s loss before tax through the impact on oating rate borrowings.

Year ended 31 December 
Effect on loss before tax
2012 2011
+1.0% 809 743
-1.0% (809) (743)
Foreign currency risk
The Group has transactional currency exposures. Such exposure arises from borrowing in currencies other than the 
functional currency. The Group limits foreign currency risk by monitoring changes in exchange rates in the currencies 
in which its cash and borrowings are denominated.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the RUR:US$ exchange rate, with all other 
variables held constant, of the Group’s loss before tax due to changes in the carrying value of monetary assets and liabilities.

1,197 128,863 44,638 402,543 – 577,241
Credit risk
The Group manages its own exposure to credit risk. The Group trades only with recognized, creditworthy third parties. 
All external customers undergo a creditworthiness check. The Group performs an ongoing assessment and monitoring 
of nancial position and the risk of default. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis thus 
the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not signi cant. 
The Company had one major customer in 2012 being an international oil trader and accounting for at least 22% of total sales 
in 2012. Other sales are made to domestic customers. The Group is not dependent on any of its major customers or any one 
particular customer as there is a liquid market for crude oil. Analysis of sales to key customers is included into Note 7.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other nancial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, 
the Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying 
amount of these instruments. The credit risk on cash is limited because the counterparties are either highly rated banks 
or banks approved by the management of the Group. Approval is made after certain procedures to assess reliability 
and creditability of banks are performed. 
Fair values
The Group has nancial instruments carried at fair value only in the ‘Level 3’ category. 
The different levels have been de ned as follows:
 — Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1).
 — Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
(that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (Level 2).
 — Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (Level 3).
The following table presents the Group’s assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value at 31 December 2012. 
As at 31 December 2011 the Group had no assets or liabilities measured at fair value through pro t or loss.

26. Loss per share
Basic
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the pro t attributable to equity holders of the Parent by the weighted 
average number of Ordinary shares in issue during the period.
For comparability, weighted average number of Ordinary shares in issue for the year ended 31 December 2011 presented as 
if the Parent was the Group company in 2011. For calculation of number of shares outstanding in 2011 the number of shares 
issued on reorganization was used.
Year ended 31 December
2012 2011
Loss attributable to equity holders of the Parent/Previous parent 27,284 81,095
Weighted average number of Ordinary shares in issue 315,539,053 196,890,000
Basic loss per share (US$) 0.09 0.41
Diluted
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of Ordinary shares to assume conversion 
of all dilutive potential Ordinary shares. 
The Parent has incurred a loss from continuing operations for the year ended 31 December 2012 and the effect of considering 
the exercise of the options on the Parent’s shares would be anti-dilutive, that is, it would reduce the loss per share.
27. Events after the statement of nancial position date 
In February 2013, the terms of the options to two executive directors (See Note 19) were amended by introduction of vesting 
periods which are as follows: the options vest in three equal instalments on 17 January 2013, 17 January 2014 and 17 January 
2015. After those dates the options are exercisable anytime up to 16 January 2022. As these modi cations decreased the total 
value of the options and are not bene cial to the employees, management continues to account for these options as if the 
modi cation has not occurred. 
There have been no other material events after the end of reporting period which require disclosure in these consolidated 
 nancial statements.
28.  Supplementary information (Unaudited)
Reserve quantity information
For the purposes of evaluation of reserves as of 31 December 2012, 2011 and 2010 the Parent used the oil and gas reserve 
information prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton, independent reservoir engineers, prepared in accordance with 
Petroleum Resources Management System (‘PRMS’) de nition and classi cation system.
Developed reserves are expected quantities to be recovered from existing wells and facilities.
Proved reserves are those quantities of petroleum, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated 
with reasonable certainty to be commercially recoverable, from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under de ned 
economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. If deterministic methods are used, the term reasonable 
certainty is intended to express a high degree of con dence that the quantities will be recovered. If probabilistic methods are 
used, there should be at least a 90% probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate.
25. Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Ruspetro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
86
Probable reserves are those additional reserves which analysis of geoscience and engineering data indicate are less likely 
to be recovered than proved reserves but more certain to be recovered than possible reserves. It is equally likely that actual 
remaining quantities recovered will be greater than or less than the sum of the estimated proved plus probable reserves (2P). 
In this context, when probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50% probability that the actual quantities 
recovered will equal or exceed the 2P estimate.
Due to the inherent uncertainties and the necessarily limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of reserves are inherently 
imprecise, require the application of judgment and are subject to change as additional information becomes available.
Management has included within proved reserves signi cant quantities which the Group expects to produce after the expiry 
dates of certain of its current production licenses. The Subsoil Law of the Russian Federation states that, upon expiration, a 
license is subject to renewal at the initiative of the license holder provided that further exploration, appraisal, production or 
remediation activities are necessary and provided that the license holder has not violated the terms of the license. Since the 
law applies both to newly issued and old licenses, management believes that licenses will be renewed upon their expiration 
for the remainder of the economic life of each respective eld.

Parent Company nancial statements
Independent auditor’s report
Independent auditors’ report to the members 
of Ruspetro plc 
We have audited the parent company nancial statements 
of Ruspetro plc for the period ended 31 December 2012 which 
comprise the Statement of Financial Position, the Statement of 
Changes in Equity, the Statement of Cash Flow, the signi cant 
accounting policies and the related notes. The nancial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the parent company nancial statements and for being 
satis ed that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility 
is to audit and express an opinion on the parent company 
 nancial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for 
and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance 
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for 
no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept 
or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any 
other person to whom this report is shown or into whose 
hands it maycome save where expressly agreed by our prior 
consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the nancial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the nancial statements suf cient to give 
reasonable assurance that the nancial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances 
and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
the reasonableness of signi cant accounting estimates made 
by the directors; and the overall presentation of the nancial 
statements. In addition, we read all the nancial and non-
 nancial information in the annual report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited nancial statements. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on nancial statements 
In our opinion the parent company nancial statements: 
 — give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s 
affairs as at 31 December 2012 and of its cash ows 
for the period then ended;
 — have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union and as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006; and 
 — have been prepared in accordance with the requirements 
of the Companies Act 2006. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion: 
 — the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006; and 
 — the information given in the Directors’ Report for the 
 nancial year for which the parent company nancial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the parent 
company nancial statements. 
Emphasis of matter
In forming our opinion on the nancial statements, 
which is not modi ed, we have considered the adequacy 
of the disclosure made in note 2 to the nancial statements 
concerning the Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern. This ability is dependent whether the Group can 
obtain additional nancing and an extension of the maturities 
of the existing debt facilities from the respective lenders and 
shareholders. This condition, along with the other matters 
explained in note 2 to the nancial statements, indicate the 
existence of a material uncertainty which may cast signi cant 
doubt about the Group’s and Company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern. The nancial statements do not include the 
adjustments that would result if the Group and Company 
was unable to continue as a going concern.
Matters on which we are required to report 
by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you 
if, in our opinion: 
 — adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or 
 — the parent company nancial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not 
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
 — certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration speci ed 
by law are not made; or 
 — we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit. 
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the group nancial statements 
of Ruspetro plc for the year ended 31 December 2012. 
That report includes an emphasis of matter.

2. Basis of preparation
The nancial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union. The nancial statements are prepared under the historical cost 
convention, modi ed for fair values under IFRS.
These nancial statements are presented in US dollars (‘US$’) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand unless 
otherwise indicated.
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Statement of Comprehensive Income of the Parent Company 
is not presented as part of these nancial statements. The loss dealt with in the nancial statements of the Company 
is US$22,240 thousand.
Going concern
These nancial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, which presumes that the Company will be able to realize 
its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business in the foreseeable future.
At 31 December 2012, the Company had net current assets of $28,701 thousand, which included cash in hand of 
$23,877 thousand. 
Management consider that the continued operational existence of the Company is dependent upon the ability to make 
further investment in eld development of the subsidiaries in order to increase hydrocarbon production and sales. In response 
to these circumstances, management are in discussions with existing lenders of the subsidiaries with regard to the provision 
of additional long-term debt nancing and the extension of the maturity of the existing long-term loans. 
Management consider the additional nancing and the maturity extension of existing debt of the subsidiaries will provide 
suf cient nancial resources such that the subsidiaries can further invest in eld development with the intention of raising 
production. Management further consider that the additional cash ows to be generated from production would allow the 
subsidiaries to service debt, further increase production and fund other activities. In developing their cash ow forecasts, 
management have a number of signi cant assumptions. These include assumptions as to future hydrocarbon prices, taxes, 
production volumes, and in ation and are further discussed in Note 4 of the notes to the consolidated nancial statements.
Agreements with the existing lenders as to additional nancing and maturity extension have not been entered into as of the date 
of these nancial statements. In the event that such additional nancing and maturity extension is not obtained, the subsidiaries 
may be unable to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. These circumstances represent 
a material uncertainty that may cast signi cant doubt on the subsidiaries and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
However, on the basis of the assumptions and cash ow forecasts prepared, management have assumed that the Company 
will continue to operate within both available and prospective facilities. Accordingly, the Company’s nancial statements 
are prepared on the going concern basis and do not include any adjustments that would be required in the event that the 
loan holders do request repayment and alternative nance is not available.

Annual Report and Accounts 2012
3. Summary of signi cant accounting policies 
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are included in the balance sheet of the Company at cost less any provision 
for impairment.
Impairment of non- nancial assets
The Company performs impairment reviews in respect of xed asset investments whenever events or changes in circumstance 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the recoverable amount 
of an asset, which is the higher of the asset’s net realizable value and its value in use, is less than its carrying amount.
Financial instruments
The accounting policy for nancial instruments is consistent with the Group accounting policy as presented in the notes 
to the Group nancial statements. The Company’s nancial risk management policy is consistent with the Group’s nancial 
risk management policy outlined in the Group nancial statements.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative nancial assets with xed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an 
active market. After initial measurement loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective 
interest method less any provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment is recognized when there is an objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all 
amounts due according to the original terms of the loans and receivables. The amount of provision is the difference between the 
assets’ carrying value and the present value of the estimated future cash ows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. 
The change in the amount of the loan or receivable is recognized in pro t or loss. Interest income is recognized in pro t or loss 
by applying the effective interest rate.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of nancial position comprise cash at banks and on hand and short term deposits 
with an original maturity of three months or less. 
For the purpose of the cash ow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as de ned above, 
net of outstanding bank overdrafts if any.
Borrowings and accounts payable
The Company’s nancial liabilities are represented by trade and other payables. 
A nancial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. Where an 
existing nancial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an 
existing liability are substantially modi ed, such an exchange or modi cation is treated as a derecognition of the original 
liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the 
pro t or loss.
Impairment of nancial assets 
The Company assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that a nancial asset or 
a group of nancial assets is impaired. A nancial asset or a group of nancial assets is deemed to be impaired if, and only 
if, there is an objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial recognition 
of the asset (an incurred ‘loss event’) and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash ows of the nancial asset 
or the group of nancial assets that can be reliably estimated. Evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtors 
or a group of debtors is experiencing signi cant nancial dif culty, default or delinquency in interest or principal payments, 
the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other nancial reorganization and where observable data indicate that there 
is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash ows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate 
with defaults.
Taxes
Income tax
The income tax expense comprises current and deferred taxes calculated based on the tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period. Current and deferred taxes are charged or credited to pro t or loss 
except where they are attributable to items which are charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the corresponding 
tax is also taken to equity.
Current tax is the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the taxation authorities in respect of taxable pro ts 
or losses for the current and prior periods.  Ruspetro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
92
3. Summary of signi cant accounting policies continued
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated in respect of temporary differences using the liability method. Deferred 
taxes provide for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values 
for nancial reporting purposes, except where the deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability 
in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting pro t 
nor taxable pro t or loss.
A deferred tax asset is recognized for all deductible temporary differences and carry forward of unused tax credits and 
unused tax losses only to the extent that it is probable that taxable pro t will be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences or carry forward can be utilized. 
Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at the end of each reporting period and are recognized to the extent that 
it has become probable that future taxable pro t will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the Company has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets 
and liabilities, when deferred tax balances are referred to the same governmental body (i.e. federal, regional or local) and 
the same subject of taxation and when the Company intends to perform an offset of its current tax assets and liabilities. 
Equity
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classi ed as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares and options 
are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. Any excess of the fair value of consideration received 
over the par value of shares issued is recorded as share premium.
Foreign currency translation
Foreign currency transactions are initially recognized in the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the date 
of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency 
rate of exchange in effect at the end of the reporting period. 
The US dollar (‘US$’) is the presentation currency of the Company. The functional currency of the Company is the pound 
sterling (‘GBP’). The assets and liabilities are translated into the presentation currency at the rate of exchange ruling at the 
end of each of the reporting period. Income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates 
(unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction 
dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions). All the resulting 
exchange differences are recorded in other comprehensive income. 
The US$ to GBP exchange rates were 0.62 and 0.65 as at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011, respectively and the 
average rates for the year ended 31 December 2012 and 2011 were 0.63 and 0.62 respectively. 
Share option plan 
The share option plan, under which the Group has the ability to choose whether to settle it in cash or equity instruments 
at the discretion of the Board of Directors is accounted for as an equity settled transaction. The fair value of the options 
granted by the Parent to employees is measured at the grant date and calculated using the Trinomial option pricing model 
and recognized in the nancial statements as a component of equity with a corresponding amount recognised in selling, 
general and administrative expenses over the time share reward vest to the employee.
Modi cations of the terms or conditions of the equity instruments granted in a manner that reduces the total fair value of 
the share based payment arrangement or is not otherwise bene cial to the employee, are accounted for as services received 
in consideration for the equity instruments granted as if the modi cation had not occurred.
4. Signi cant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions 
The signi cant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions are consistent with the Group signi cant accounting 
judgments, estimates and assumptions as presented in the notes to the Group nancial statements.
5. Other income
On 13 December 2011, Itera Group Limited agreed to sell a receivable from Ruspetro relating to deferred consideration 
arising from the acquisition of INGA and Trans-oil (the ‘Itera debt’) to Makayla Investments Limited (‘Makayla’), a related 
party and shareholder of the Company. 
Makayla negotiated the terms of settlement with Itera and agreed to buy the receivable at an amount lower than the carrying 
value. Makayla passed on this bene t to Ruspetro by entering into an agreement dated 13 December 2011 with Ruspetro, 
granting it the option to acquire the debt owing to Makayla (valued at US$47,453 thousand at the date of transaction) 
by no later than 25 January 2012 for US$26,171 thousand. 
On 18 January 2012, the Company issued 12,707,584 Ordinary shares at £1.34 each to Makayla to acquire this debt for a total 
value of US$26,171 thousand. Accordingly an amount of US$21,282 thousand representing the difference between the nominal 
value of the debt and the fair value of the issued Ordinary shares was recognized as other income in the accompanying 
 nancial statements.
6. Other operating expense
Other operating expense include the impairment in the carrying amount of the investment in one of the Group’s subsidiaries.

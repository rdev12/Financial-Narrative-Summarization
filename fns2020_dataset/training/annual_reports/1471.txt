Head Ofﬁce
Location: Doncaster
The Group’s head office is located in a 
new office building close to the town centre 
in Doncaster. Being only one and a half hours 
from London by train Doncaster is an ideal 
base from which to administer the Group 
whilst enabling regular contact with our 
major power station customers, who are 
located in Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire, as 
well as being able to conveniently meet with 
our other stakeholders based in London.
Garleffan 
Location: New Cumnock, East Ayrshire 
Garleffan was acquired as an operational site 
in November 2003 and required a turnaround 
in the site design and plant fleet. This was 
achieved during 2004 and the site continued 
in production until June 2006 when it entered 
restoration. The award winning restoration 
plan will provide a habitat to attract 
Peregrine falcons. 
Grievehill 
Location: Adjacent Garleffan
The Grievehill site was acquired, together  
with Glenmuckloch, from Scottish Coal as  
a fully permitted site in 2005. The site lies 
adjacent to the Garleffan site and utilises  
the infrastructure already established for 
processing and transporting coal to market  
via the Group’s rail head at Crowbandsgate.
The site entered production in September  
2005 for 24 months and will produce  
1.8 million tonnes.
Glenmuckloch
 Location: 5 miles east of New Cumnock, 
East Ayrshire
Glenmuckloch was acquired in June 2005 
along with the Grievehill site from Scottish 
Coal. Grievehill is a fully permitted site and 
entered production in 2006 with a four and a 
half year production life. There are some 
3.2 million tonnes of coal reserves at 
Glenmuckloch which will be transported to 
Crowbandsgate via a 12km conveyor. 
Laigh Glenmuir
Location: 1 mile north of Garleffan
This site, which was granted planning 
permission in October 2005, contains 
some 0.5 million tonnes of coal which will 
be transported to market via the Garleffan 
site. The site entered production in 2006 
for two and a half years. 
Muir Dean 
Location: Cross Gates, Fife
The Muir Dean site, which is subject to an 
appeal to the Scottish Executive following 
the unreasonable refusal of the planning 
application, lies in some 180 hectares 
of mixed farming and woodland. The 
proposed site will produce some 2.3 million 
tonnes of coal over four and a half years with 
production due to commence in 2007.
Crowbandsgate
Location: New Cumnock
The Group’s railhead at Crowbandsgate 
is used to dispatch coal to our power station 
customers. The railhead can handle up 
to 30 trains per week. Each train can carry 
some 1,400 tonnes of coal in 20 wagons. 
ATH Ogden
Location: Grimethorpe
ATH Ogden is currently undertaking a 
reclamation scheme at the former New Park 
Springs colliery tip at Grimethorpe. Working 
under contract for Renaissance South Yorkshire 
(Yorkshire Forward) the scheme is part of the 
Government’s National Coalfields Programme 
which assists former coalfield communities 
across England by creating new employment, 
homes, leisure facilities and public space. 
ATH Ogden are removing coal from the derelict 
colliery spoil heap and restoring the tip to a new 
safe and stable profile which when complete 
will provide public access to areas of open 
space with a diverse range of habitats. 
Skares Road 
Location: Cumnock, East Ayrshire
The Skares Road site was the Group’s first 
opencast coal site and was acquired as a 
project buyout by the current management  
team in 1998. Covering some 600 hectares 
the site has produced over 5.2 million  
tonnes and is anticipated to continue in 
production until 2008. The site has been 
worked in a number of areas and has been 
progressively restored to mixed grazing  
and woodlands. To date some 25,000  
trees have been planted.

Business progress
When ATH achieved its listing on AIM in 2004 
its stated objectives were to grow the business 
organically and by acquisition.
It is therefore pleasing to report that during the 
course of the year the Group moved ahead 
signiﬁcantly on both of these fronts.
In May 2006 the Group completed its ﬁrst major 
acquisition since achieving its listing on AIM 
with the purchase of A Ogden & Sons Limited. 
The business, now renamed ATH Ogden, 
consists of a coal recovery, land remediation 
and regeneration business. It is believed that 
ATH Ogden is the only company in the UK that 
can reduce the cost of regenerating former 
colliery sites by extracting coal from the old tips.
As such the acquisition complements the existing 
operations of the Group whist opening up the 
potential for future surface mining sites and 
reclamation projects in England where ATH Ogden 
has historically operated.
Secondly, the Group’s development team, 
which was strengthened during the year with 
the appointment of a new Development Director, 
has driven forwards with a number of planning 
applications. The Group’s reserves at the year end 
were 7.9m tonnes. 
“ Another year of progress in delivering 
sustained growth to our shareholders which 
is reﬂected in an increase in the full year  
dividend of 3%.”
01.  Plant maintenance is undertaken by both manufacturer supplied and in house 
ﬁtters within purpose built ﬁtting shops.
02.  Site restoration is undertaken throughout the site’s life and is returned to mixed 
grazing habitat and forestry when complete. 
03.  Coal is loaded onto trains by Caterpillar 966 loading shovels. A 1,400 tonne train 
consisting of 20 wagons is loaded in around 90 minutes.

Board of Directors
There have been a number of changes to 
the Board of Directors during the past year.
Firstly, Mike T od one of the three founding 
Directors stood down from the main Board due 
to ill health in June 2006. Mike was instrumental 
in establishing the original business in 1998 
and has been a driving force behind the 
development of the Group since then. He will 
continue in a part time role with the Group and 
the Board is grateful for his contribution over 
the last eight years.
As part of refocusing the Board the Group 
has recruited Steven Beaumont as Group Finance 
Director. Steven joins the Group from United Utilities 
where he was Commercial Director and will replace 
Richard Croston who will continue in his role as 
Finance Director of our trading subsidiaries and 
Group Company Secretary. Alistair Black has been 
promoted to Managing Director of the surface 
mining business.
Strategy
The Group will continue to develop organically 
and it is pleasing to note that our pipeline of internally 
developed projects is growing month on month. 
Other opportunities to increase market share will 
be exploited as they arise as the Group seeks 
to achieve a leading position in surface mining 
in the UK.
The Government’s report on the Energy Review: 
“The Energy Challenge”, published on 11 July 2006, 
did not produce any great surprises although it did, 
for the ﬁrst time, acknowledge the role of coal 
in the overall balance required for a sustainable 
energy policy. This was in the wake of last winter 
when coal ﬁred generation produced over 50% 
of the UK’s electricity. The review has also 
established a Coal Forum at which the difﬁculties 
of the planning system will be discussed.
The Group believes this is an important step forward 
in recognising the importance that UK produced 
coal has in providing essential energy supplies 
whilst assisting in managing the dependence 
on imported energy in ensuring that the UK 
has a secure supply of energy.
For the energy industry and in particular the coal 
sector the Group is actively lobbying for changes 
to the planning system so that an emphasis 
on security of supply has to be considered 
in the determination of planning applications. 
The Group is well set to deliver the results 
our shareholders expect from a mature industry 
and looks forward in 2007 to pursuing our target 
of further sustained growth.
David Port
Non-executive Chairman
 Derek Moir
 Site Manager, Skares Road
 Derek joined ATH Resources as a Site Engineer in 1998.  
 Since then he has been promoted ﬁrstly to Disposal Point  
  Manager, responsible for the quality control of the coal 
processing and coordinating dispatch of coal to customers,  
and more recently to Site Manager. Derek is responsible for  
the day to day running of the site. 
“ Being given the opportunity to develop 
alongside the growth in the Company 
has been very rewarding.”

Operational review
The surface mining business has continued 
to perform in line with expectations.
Skares Road moved into a new area of operation 
in October 2005 which, although higher in operational 
stripping ratio, yields good quality coal and mitigates 
the overall restoration cost. This site, which initially 
was to have been a 3m tonne ﬁve year site will 
now end up producing some 6m tonnes worked 
over ten years.
The Garleffan site ceased production in June 2006 
and has since moved into restoration. The site 
will be restored over the coming two years 
to produce a wetland and protected nesting 
ground. The restoration plan has won the 
Coal Authority’s annual Environmental Award.
Grievehill was granted an extension of 0.4m 
tonnes during the year which will keep the site 
in production until September 2007. A further 
1.0m tonne extension is to be applied for in the 
near future.
“ The acquisition of ATH Ogden has provided 
the Group with a suitable complementary 
diversiﬁcation from our core surface mining 
activity and we will endeavour to derive added 
value from this over the coming year.” 
04.  The former colliery tip at Grimethorpe is being processed to recover coal 
whilst at the same time restoring the site to public access park land.
05.  A team of development engineers are based at the Group’s head ofﬁce 
in Doncaster. They work on all aspects of site identiﬁcation, planning and 
design using a 3D CAD system.
06.  Coal at Glenmuckloch is being stockpiled ahead of the completion of 
the conveyor.
Chief executive’s statement

_1_ATH_2006arf.indd   4 12/12/2006   11:54:40 05 ATH Resources plc Annual report and ﬁnancial statements 2006
Glenmuckloch was opened up successfully during 
the autumn and has been producing coal to plan. 
Dispatch of coal from the site is awaiting the 
completion of a 12 km conveyor which is to link 
the three sites of Glenmuckloch, Grievehill 
and Laigh Glenmuir to the Group’s railhead 
at Crowbandsgate. Whilst the commencement 
of construction of this conveyor was delayed 
in obtaining the necessary consents, the Group’s 
performance through the construction phase 
has been outstanding.
The conveyor, which is in the ﬁnal stages 
of commissioning and beneﬁts from a freight 
facility grant from the Scottish Executive, will 
be the longest over land conveyor in Europe. 
This investment will deliver a more efﬁcient 
operation in moving coal from the mine to 
disposal point and at the same time reduce 
the impact to the environment by removing  
54,500 lorry journeys and saving some 1.9m 
lorry miles per annum.
Laigh Glenmuir, which was granted planning 
permission in January 2006, entered production 
in the autumn and has been successfully 
established ahead of the winter. The Group 
expects that the site will operate for two and a 
half years with a yield of some 0.5m tonnes.
Overall the surface mines have performed 
well during the past twelve months assisted 
by the close monitoring of costs, including fuel 
which we successfully hedged, and investment 
in new plant to complement the existing ﬂeet.
The ATH Ogden regeneration business has 
been successfully integrated into the Group. 
The business has been performing ahead 
of expectations at the time of acquisition. 
Operational, technical and administrative 
beneﬁts have been realised including the 
improvement of recovery through the coal 
washing process at the surface mines. 
ATH Ogdens’ expertise in land regeneration 
will be applied to new projects over the next 
few years.
Development projects
As previously announced the Group increased 
the size of the Development team during the 
year. The team has been focused on pursuing 
a number of projects which are expected to 
increase Group reserves year on year. In addition 
an extensive exercise has been undertaken during 
the year to “desk top” review prospective sites 
and these are being incorporated into a ﬁve year 
development plan.
Sites for development by both the surface mining 
and ATH Ogden businesses are currently being 
evaluated and the Group expects to make two 
planning applications for new schemes in the 
next year.
Planning permission for Laigh Glenmuir and 
an extension at Grievehill were received during 
the year. However, it was regrettable that the 
planning application submitted for the Muir Dean 
site was turned down by Fife Council. The decision 
will be the subject of an appeal and the Group 
remains conﬁdent of a successful outcome 
given the recommendation from the Council 
ofﬁcers and the lack of substance in the 
Councillors’ objections.
  Robert Haskell
 Project Manager, Head Ofﬁce
 Robert has worked for the Company for over ﬁve years. His role  
 in the Development Department is to ﬁnd, evaluate and project  
 manage new sites through the planning process. 
“ It’s exciting to see an outline scheme for 
a site that I have identiﬁed to become an 
operating coal mine.”

Chief executive’s statement continued
Development projects continued
Progress in developing the Group’s reserves 
in France has been slow. The Commentry 
Concession application is presently awaiting 
the Minister for Energy’s determination in Paris. 
However it is believed that all of the requirements 
of the application have been met. On the Bertholene 
Concession, drilling has been delayed by land 
access issues but it is believed that these will 
be overcome shortly.
Reserves of recoverable coal (proven and 
probable) were 7.9m tonnes as at 1 October 2006, 
as detailed in the adjacent table. After allowing 
for the extraction of 1.8m tonnes in the year 
and 0.5m tonnes which arose from the purchase 
of ATH Ogden, 1.1m tonnes was generated 
through the granting of planning permissions for 
extensions to existing sites and re-engineering 
sites to increase recoverable coal. The Group’s 
pipeline of projects is expected to see continuing 
replacement of reserves over the coming years. 
Market
The market for coal has remained buoyant 
during the last twelve months and shows no 
sign of falling due to high international prices. 
Although the recent weakening of the dollar 
has mitigated the high international prices,

08.  Delivery of the ﬁrst of two Komatsu PC3000 excavators took place in August 2006 
and has been a welcome addition to the muck shifting operation proving to be 
a reliable and capable machine. 
09.  Each site is surveyed weekly to determine the progress made and to measure 
the efﬁciency of the coal recovery process.

the long term trends would still indicate a period 
of relatively high prices with more than one third 
of the UK coal burn being supplied from Russia, 
which is at the top of the price curve.
Demand for coal in the UK for electricity 
generation has been growing steadily during 
the last ten years from 47m tonnes in 1997 to 
over 52m tonnes in 2005. This has been on the 
back of year on year increases in electricity 
generation, coupled with the rapid rise in oil and 
consequently gas prices, enabling coal ﬁred 
generation to earn a greater proportion of the 
electricity generation mix at 34% in 2005.
However, with the decline in deep mined coal 
production, over 68% of the UK’s requirements 
are now imported, whilst the balancing 32% 
was split roughly evenly between deep mined 
and opencast coal in 2005. Accordingly there 
is good scope for increasing the Group’s share 
of the market.
The Group has a portfolio of sales contracts 
with the Electricity Supply Industry (“ESI”) which 
are for different periods of time and at the year 
end had cover for 4.3m tonnes running out to 
March 2010.
The Group remains conﬁdent in the market for 
coal for the foreseeable future.
Staff
It was with much regret that Mike Tod 
tendered his resignation from the Board of 
ATH Resources plc due to ill health. Although 
he has made a good recovery Mike has decided 
to scale back his workload and will continue 
to be employed within the Group on a part 
time basis.
I would like to pay my personal thanks to Mike 
whose help and support was vital in launching 
ATH Resources in 1998 and making it the 
successful Company it is today.
Staff recruitment and training is vital to the 
success of any company but particularly so 
to one which operates in such a potentially 
dangerous industry. Over recent years the 
Group has invested heavily in staff development 
and we were granted training centre status 
by City and Guilds in May 2006 which allows 
the Group to train employees to Level 2 NVQ 
in plant operations. ATH is the only provider 
of accredited training speciﬁc to the surface 
mining industry.
A positive health and safety environment is a priority 
to the Group with all accidents being reported to 
the Board. The Group strives to be a leader in 
the sector and to this end has been working in 
conjunction with the Health & Safety Executive 
to measure health and safety performance. 
This year has been an extremely busy period for 
the Group, in which there has been a continued 
strong operational performance and additions to 
the reserve base. This has been complemented 
by the successful acquisition of ATH Ogden. I am 
very grateful to all of the staff who have helped 
achieve these goals and the Group looks forward 
to building on these successes in 2007.

Summary of ﬁnancial review
Turnover: £54.1m (2005: £39.1m)
EBITDA: £19.2m (2005: £11.4m)
PBIT: £8.6m (2005: £6.4m)
Final dividend: 7.89p (2005: 7.56p)
Total dividend: 11.25p (2005: 10.92p)
EPS: 12.62p (2005: 11.34p)
The results are presented for the 52 week period 
to 1 October 2006 and are compared against 
a 53 week trading period to 2 October 2005.
Turnover
T urnover for the year was £54.1m (2005: £39.1m) 
on sales of 1.8 million tonnes (2005: 1.5 million 
tonnes), with an average price of £30 per tonne 
(2005: £27 per tonne). 
Following the renegotiation of the Group’s 
portfolio of ESI contracts during 2005, together 
with current market prices, the Group has seen 
year on year improvements in the average sales 
price. This additional margin allows for the 
working of reserves which would historically not 
have been economically viable and accordingly 
the full beneﬁt of this uplift in sales price does 
not ﬂow directly through to an increase in 
operating margin.
Proﬁt before interest and tax
Proﬁt before interest and tax was £8.6m 
(2005: £6.4m) whilst earnings before interest, 
tax, depreciation and amortisation was £19.2m 
(2005: £11.4m).
Whilst the average cost of gas oil during the year 
was above the Group’s budgeted level the impact 
upon earnings was mitigated through the targeting 
of fuel efﬁciencies and close monitoring of usage. 
Subsequent to the year end the price has fallen 
and the Group has taken advantage and ﬁxed 
a signiﬁcant proportion of its requirement for the 
coming year. 
10.  The 12km overland conveyor will link the Glenmuckloch, Grievehill and 
Laigh Glenmuir sites to the Group’s railhead and will be the longest in Europe.
11.  Each site has an administration function which looks after all aspects of the site 
from employee welfare to supplier ordering and head ofﬁce reporting. 
12.  Water is closely managed to ensure all suspended soil particles picked up on 
site are removed prior to discharge to the local water courses.
Financial review
“ The year saw turnover increase by 38% from 
both additional sales volumes (up by 20%) 
and improved average prices (up by 11%). 
With the working of higher ratio areas, made 
economically viable by the improved sales 
prices, PBIT improved by 34%.”

_1_ATH_2006arf.indd   8 12/12/2006   11:57:08 09 ATH Resources plc Annual report and ﬁnancial statements 2006
Interest
Interest charges of £1.0m (2005: £0.7m) were 
incurred in the year. Of these charges £0.6m 
(2005: £0.4m) were in respect of hire purchase 
agreements, £Nil (2005: £0.2m) was in respect 
of the unwinding of the discount of the ﬁnal void 
provision (which is not a cash ﬂow item) and 
the remaining £0.4m (2005: £0.1m) related to 
bank interest.
The Group manages its exposure to interest 
rates by acquiring plant on ﬁxed rate hire 
purchase agreements which have an average 
rate of interest of 5% (2005: 5%).
Tax
The effective rate of tax was 34% (2005: 34%) 
compared with a standard rate of tax of 30% 
whilst the underlying rate of corporation tax in 
the year was 20% (2005: 11%). The difference 
between the two rates being primarily deferred 
tax arising on the capital expenditure incurred 
in the year and the timing difference between 
the relief being given in the form of capital 
allowances and expenditure deducted as 
depreciation in the proﬁt and loss account.
Dividends and earnings per share
The Board is recommending a ﬁnal dividend 
of 7.89p per share (2005: 7.56p), subject to 
members’ approval at the Annual General 
Meeting (“ AGM”) payable on 12 January 2007 
to members on the share register as at 
22 December 2006, making a total dividend 
of 11.25p per share (2005: 10.92p), an increase 
of 3%. Under current accounting rules the 
proposed dividend at 1 October 2006 has not 
been accrued in the ﬁnancial statements.
Earnings per share for the year were 12.62p 
(2005: 11.49p) and 12.45p (2005: 11.49p) 
on a diluted basis.
Balance sheet
Investment in new plant and equipment during 
the year amounted to £21.9m (2005: £9.8m) and 
included 57 items of new plant. These included 
two PC3000 Komatsu excavators, 15 Caterpillar 
777 dump trucks, 13 Caterpillar 735 coal trucks 
and three Caterpillar D9 bulldozers.
The acquisition of ATH Ogden, which was 
completed during the year, gave rise to goodwill 
of £6.0m on net consideration (after taking into 
account of cash left on the balance sheet) 
of £9.5m. Goodwill is charged to proﬁt over 
ten years.
Cash ﬂow
Net cash inﬂow from operating activities was 
£17.6m (2005: £8.6m). Net debt amounted to 
£31.4m (2005: £14.3m) due to the additions to 
the plant ﬂeet which were acquired via ﬁxed rate 
hire purchase agreements.
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”)
The Group’s IFRS implementation programme is 
at an early stage, as compliance with IFRS is not 
required until the year ending September 2008, 
with comparative information for 2007, so at this 
stage it is not possible to say what the impact 
upon earnings will be.
However, the key areas of potential impact 
identiﬁed so far are noted below:
IFRS 2 – Share based payments
Under this standard, which becomes applicable 
in the UK for the year ending September 2007, 
the Group is required to recognise a cost for 
share based payments (share options) based 
upon the fair value of the award at the time of 
granting and this cost is recognised over the 
vesting period of the awards. The fair value is 
to be measured using an option pricing model.
IFRS 3 – Business combinations
This standard will require the goodwill arising 
upon consolidation of the Group to cease being 
charged to proﬁt. Instead the goodwill balance 
will be subject to an annual impairment test.

The Directors submit their report and the audited ﬁnancial statements of ATH Resources plc for the year ended 1 October 2006.
Principal activities
The principal activity of the Company is that of a holding company. The principal activity of the Group is the operation of surface coal mines 
and subsequent sale to UK electricity generators, industrial and domestic customers. The Group operates under the title of ATH Resources.
Review of developments and future prospects
The Group’s trading performance for the year was in line with Directors’ expectations and is discussed in greater detail in the Chief Executive’s 
Statement. The acquisition of A Ogden & Sons Limited, which was completed on 18 May 2006, has been successfully integrated into the business 
and is performing ahead of expectations at the time of purchase. The Directors are pleased with the progress made in opening up the Glenmuckloch

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice. Company law requires the Directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year which give a true 
and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and 
of the proﬁt or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those ﬁnancial statements, the Directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
  state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
ﬁnancial statements; and
 prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of the 
Company and to enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985. They are responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

Statement as to disclosure of information to auditors
The Directors who were in ofﬁce on the date of approval of these ﬁnancial statements have conﬁrmed, as far as they are aware, that there is no relevant 
audit information of which the auditors are unaware. Each of the Directors have conﬁrmed that they have taken all the steps that they ought to have 
taken as Directors in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that it has been communicated to the auditor.
Key performance indicators
The Board monitors the Group’s progress and ﬁnancial performance on a regular basis. Performance is assessed against budget using ﬁnancial 
and non-ﬁnancial measures. The following are the most signiﬁcant Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”) used by the Group:
         2006 2005
Sales price – revenue earned per tonne of coal sold (£)       30 27
Cost price – operating cost per tonne of coal sold (£)       22 20
Coal reserves – the volume of coal which is classed as permitted or probable reserves (million tonnes)   7.9 8.1
Health and safety – number of reportable accidents (number)       6 3
Environmental incidents – breaches of environmental legislation (number)      — —
Return on capital employed – proﬁt before interest and tax divided by capital employed (%)    14 15
Principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group
Replacement of production
The Group’s operations have a ﬁnite life due to the geology of each site and will become exhausted at some point in the future. Production is replaced 
through the development or acquisition of new sites.
Exploration and development
The exploration for, and development of, coal deposits involves signiﬁcant risks, which are managed through the combination of careful evaluation, experience 
and knowledge. Not all properties which are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. There can be no guarantee that estimates of quantities 
and qualities made will be realised or that appropriate consents will be granted. With all mining operations there is uncertainty and therefore risks 
associated with operating parameters and costs. 
General mining and processing risks
The Group’s operations are subject to all of the hazards and risks normally encountered in the exploration, development and production of coal. 
Appropriate levels of site investigation are undertaken to minimise the risk but these risks could include unusual and unexpected geological formations, 
geo-technical instability, ﬂooding and other conditions involved in the extraction of material.
Volatility of price of coal
The market price of coal is volatile and is affected by numerous factors which are beyond the Group’s control. These include international supply 
and demand, the level of consumer product demand, international economic trends, currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations, the level of interest rates, 
the rate of inﬂation, the cost of freight, global or regional political events and international events as well as a range of other market forces. This volatility 
is managed through the entering into of long term, ﬁxed price, supply agreements with electricity generating companies.
Environmental issues
The Group’s activities and the markets in which it operates are subject to environmental regulation. Such regulations typically cover a wide variety 
of matters including prevention of waste, pollution and protection of the environment. The risk is managed by daily inspections of all operations with 
a potential to cause environmental breaches and by careful design of the operations to mitigate any potential risk.
Health and safety
The Group’s activities are and will continue to be subject to health and safety standards and regulations. Failure to comply with such requirements may 
result in ﬁnes, penalties, and/or litigation. Risks assessments are carried out by management as well as retaining the services of external risk consultants 
to identify any potential risks and ensure safe methods of working.
Financial instruments
Details relating to ﬁnancial instruments are given in the Corporate Governance Report on page 14.
Payment policy
It is the Group’s policy to pay suppliers in accordance with agreed terms, provided the supplier has also complied with agreed terms and conditions. 
At 1 October 2006, the trade creditors of the Group represented 50 days (2005: 51 days) of purchases.
Auditors
A resolution to re-appoint Baker Tilly as auditors will be proposed at the AGM.

_1_ATH_2006arb.indd   2 12/12/2006   11:49:17 ATH Resources plc Annual report and ﬁnancial statements 2006 14
Introduction
Although the rules of AIM do not require the Company to comply with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (“the Code”), the Company fully 
supports the principles set out in the Code and will attempt to comply wherever possible, given both the size and resources available to the Company. 
Details are provided below of how the Company applies the Code.
The Board
The Board of Directors comprises ﬁve Executive Directors, two independent Non-executive Directors, one of whom is the Chairman, and an 
Alchemy Plan nominated Non-executive Director.
The Board generally meets each month and receives a Board pack comprising individual reports from each of the Executive Directors together with 
any other material deemed necessary for the Board to discharge its duties. It is the Board’s responsibility for formulating, reviewing and approving 
the Group’s strategy, budgets, major items of expenditure and acquisitions.
During the year to 1 October 2006 the Board met a total of ten times.
Board Committees
The Board has established three committees; Audit, Remuneration and Nominations, all having written terms of delegated responsibilities.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises the three Non-executive Directors and is scheduled to meet twice a year. It is the Audit Committee’s role to provide 
formal and transparent arrangements for considering how to apply the ﬁnancial reporting and internal control requirements of the Code, whilst maintaining 
an appropriate relationship with the independent auditors of the Group. In order to comply with the requirement of the Code that at least one member 
has relevant ﬁnancial experience, the Chairman of the Board sits on the Audit Committee.
During the year to 1 October 2006 the Audit Committee met on two occasions.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises the three Non-executive Directors and the Chief Executive and meets at least once a year, normally in June. 
It is the Remuneration Committee’s role to establish a formal and transparent policy on Executive remuneration and to set remuneration packages for 
individual Directors.
During the year to 1 October 2006 the Remuneration Committee met on three occasions.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee comprises the three Non-executive Directors and the Chief Executive and meets as required to consider and make 
recommendations on the appointment of Directors to the Board.
Shareholder relations
The Company meets with its institutional shareholders and analysts as appropriate and encourages communication with private shareholders via the 
AGM. In addition, the Company uses the Annual Report and Accounts, Interim Statement and web site (www.ath.co.uk) to provide further information 
to shareholders.
The Board considers Vaughan Williams to be the Senior Independent Director.
Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for the system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such systems are designed to manage rather than 
eliminate risks and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. Each year, on behalf of the Board, 
the Audit Committee reviews the effectiveness of these systems. This is achieved primarily by considering the risks potentially affecting the Group and 
discussions with the external auditors.
The Group does not currently have an internal audit function due to the small size of the administrative function, which amounts to six people, and the 
high level of Director review and authorisation of transactions.
A comprehensive budgeting process is completed once a year and is reviewed and approved by the Board. The Group’s results, as compared against 
budget, are reported to the Board on a monthly basis and discussed in detail at each meeting of the Board.
The Group maintains appropriate insurance cover in respect of legal actions against the Directors as well as against material loss or claims against the 
Group and reviews the adequacy of the cover regularly.
Financial instruments
Currency risks
The Group does not have any exposure to currency risk as all of the Group’s business is conducted within the UK.
Interest rate risk
The Group uses ﬁxed rate hire purchase agreements in order to hedge its interest rate risk.
Price risk
The Group uses a mixture of short term and ﬁxed price long term contracts with suppliers and customers to manage its exposure to variation 
in market prices.
Credit risk
The Group trades predominantly with long standing customers, the nature of these relationships assist management in controlling its credit risk in 
addition to the normal credit management. In addition the Group carries credit insurance against material loss from the failure of a customer to pay.
Liquidity
Management control and monitor the Group’s cash ﬂow on a regular basis, including forecasting future cash ﬂows.

Introduction
Companies trading on AIM are not required to provide a formal remuneration report. However, in line with current best practice this report provides 
information to enable a greater level of understanding as to how Directors’ remuneration is determined.
The Remuneration Committee of the Board is responsible for considering Directors’ remuneration packages and makes its recommendations to the 
Board. The Committee comprises the three Non-executive Directors and meets at least once a year, normally in June.
Remuneration policy
Remuneration packages are designed to be competitive and to reward above average performance. Executive Directors receive salary, fully ﬁnanced 
Company car, death in service beneﬁt, critical illness and medical cover, pension contribution, annual bonuses and share options.
Service contracts
The Executive Directors have service agreements with the Company dated 28 November 2003 for an initial twelve months, thereafter subject to 
termination upon twelve months’ notice being given by either party.
Pensions
The Group does not have a pension scheme, instead makes contributions to Executive Directors’ personal pension schemes of 12.5% of annual salary.
Non-executive Directors
The Non-executive Directors entered into Letters of Appointment dated 12 May 2004. Both D C Port and V M F Williams were appointed for an initial 
three year term, which can be terminated upon six months’ notice being given by either party. They receive a fee of £51,886 and £20,755 respectively. 
I Ridler is The Alchemy Plan nominated Non-executive Director. The Group pays an annual fee of £20,580 to Alchemy Partners in respect of this

_1_ATH_2006arb.indd   5 12/12/2006   11:49:17 17 ATH Resources plc Annual report and ﬁnancial statements 2006
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements on pages 18 to 32. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and 
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the ﬁnancial 
statements. The information given in the Directors’ Report includes that speciﬁc information presented in the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief 
Executive’s Statement, the Financial Review, the Corporate Governance Report and the Remuneration Committee Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited ﬁnancial statements. This other 
information comprises only the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Statement, the Financial Review and the Directors’ Report. We consider 
the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the ﬁnancial statements. 
Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit 
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements. It also includes an assessment 
of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the accounting policies 
are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with 
sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other 
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the ﬁnancial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion: 
  the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state 
of the Group’s and parent company’s affairs as at 1 October 2006 and of the Group’s proﬁt for the year then ended and have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
 the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements.

Basis of accounting
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
Basis of preparation
The Group has net current liabilities of £12,996,834. The Group meets its day to day working capital requirements through an overdraft facility which 
is repayable on demand.
The Directors have prepared cash ﬂow projections for the coming twelve months which show that the margin of cash requirements is within the Group’s 
existing borrowing facilities. On the basis of this cash ﬂow information the Directors consider that the Group will continue to operate within the facility 
currently and anticipated to be available to the Group. On this basis, the Directors consider it is appropriate to prepare the ﬁnancial statements on 
the going concern basis. The ﬁnancial statements do not include any adjustments that would result from this not being the case.
Accounting period
The Company has drawn up its accounts for the 52 week period to 1 October 2006 (53 week period to 2 October 2005).
Consolidation
The accounts consolidate the accounts of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings other than as stated below.
The accounts do not consolidate the results of the French subsidiary, Société des Ressources Minières du Massif Central (“SRMMC”), as it is not 
material for the purposes of giving a true and fair view (note 10).
Aardvark TMC Limited (“Aardvark”) has 20,000 ‘B’ ordinary shares, subscribed at nominal value of 1p each, in addition to the ordinary shares wholly 
owned by ATH Resources plc.
The ‘B’ ordinary shares only carry the rights to receive a one off dividend in the event that Aardvark TFC Limited or SRMMC (Aardvark’s subsidiary and 
sub-subsidiary) are awarded damages in respect of existing and future litigation against the French State. The ‘B’ ordinary shares carry no voting rights 
or rights to receive any other dividend. As a result the ‘B’ ordinary shares are not accounted for as a minority interest as it is not material for the purposes 
of giving a true and fair view.
The Company has not presented its own proﬁt and loss account, as permitted by Section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985.
Mine development costs
The costs of prospecting and identifying new sites are expensed until such time that a prospective site is considered by the Board to be economically 
viable and that there is a high degree of probability and commitment that the site will be worked. Costs then incurred in preparing and developing sites 
are capitalised up to the start of production. Upon commencement of production, depreciation is charged on a tonnage basis.
Goodwill
Consolidated goodwill, being the excess consideration over the fair values of the assets acquired on the purchase of subsidiary undertakings, 
is capitalised and charged to proﬁt over ten years.
Tangible ﬁxed assets
Depreciation is provided on cost in annual instalments over the estimated useful life of assets which are reviewed annually. The rates of depreciation are 
as follows:
Freehold land Not depreciated 
Freehold buildings Depreciated to their estimated residual value over their estimated remaining economic lives – 20 years 
Mine purchase and development Tonnage basis over the estimated total recoverable reserve 
Plant and machinery 10 – 50%
Stocks and work in progress
Stocks and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Accounting policies
_1_ATH_2006arb.indd   11 12/12/2006   11:49:18 23 ATH Resources plc Annual report and ﬁnancial statements 2006
Finance leases and hire purchase contracts
T angible assets acquired under ﬁnance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised at the estimated fair value at the date of inception of each 
lease or contract. The total ﬁnance charges are allocated over the period of the lease in such a way as to give a reasonably constant charge on the 
outstanding liability.
Operating lease agreements
Rentals applicable to operating leases where substantially all of the beneﬁts and risks of ownership remain with the lessor are charged against proﬁts 
on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or 
events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing 
differences are differences between the Group’s taxable proﬁts and its results as stated in the ﬁnancial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains 
and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the ﬁnancial statements.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are expected to reverse, based 
on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Pension contributions
The Group does not operate a pension scheme for the beneﬁt of its employees but instead makes contributions to their personal pension policies. 
The contributions due for the period are charged to the proﬁt and loss account.
Final void provisions
Following the conclusion of coal extraction the ﬁnal working void of a surface coal site must be back ﬁlled. The total cost of this operation is 
recognised as a provision on site commissioning when the obligation arises. The amount provided represents the present value of the expected costs. 
Costs are charged to the provision as incurred and the unwinding of the discount, being the difference between the present value and the total cost 
of the provision, is included in the interest charge for the period. An asset is created for an amount equivalent to the initial provision. This is charged 
to the proﬁt and loss account on a tonnage basis over the estimated life of the recoverable reserves.
Turnover
Turnover represents the invoiced value, net of Value Added Tax, of goods sold to customers.
Employee share schemes
The Company operates a number of share based incentives as outlined in the Remuneration Committee’s Report. The cost of awards to employees, 
being the difference between the market price at the date of award and the amount of consideration due, is recognised over the period of the 
employee’s related performance where there is a reasonable expectation that the performance criteria will be met.
Financial instruments
Income and expenditure arising on ﬁnancial instruments are recognised on an accruals basis and credited or charged to the proﬁt and loss account 
in the ﬁnancial period to which they relate.

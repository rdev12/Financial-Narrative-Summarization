“   These are excellent results from businesses  
well positioned to enjoy superior growth in the 
years to come. We are proud of the fact that 
overall group profits have not declined through 
this sharp recession and at the current share 
price Melrose has created over £1 billion of 
shareholder value since flotation in 2003.
  We are considering the sale of Dynacast and 
looking for our next acquisition but will only 
proceed if we believe it creates shareholder 
value. Looking ahead, we are confident of  
further progress in 2011 and beyond.”

Chairman’s 
statement
I am pleased to report Melrose’s eighth set of annual results 
since flotation in 2003. Over this period Melrose’s market 
capitalisation has grown from £13 million at flotation to  
£1.5 billion as at the date of this report. This has been achieved 
with a net investment
(1)
 by our shareholders of c£450 million and 
so at the current share price over £1 billion of shareholder value 
has been created since flotation.
Results for the Group
These accounts report the results for the Group for the year  
to 31 December 2010 and comparatives for the previous year. 
Revenue for the year was £1,379.5 million (2009: £1,298.5 million). 
Headline profit before tax (before exceptional costs, exceptional 
income and intangible asset amortisation) was £170.8 million 
(2009: £118.6 million) and headline basic earnings per share 
were 25.4p (2009: 16.6p). Profit before tax was £155.3 million 
(2009: £82.0 million) and the basic earnings per share were 
28.4p (2009: 11.0p).
Further explanation of these results is provided in the Finance 
Director’s review.
Dividends
The Board intends to propose a final dividend of 7.0p per share 
(2009: 4.8p). Together with the interim dividend of 4.0p per 
share (2009: 2.9p) paid on 1 October 2010 this gives a total for 
the year of 11.0p per share (2009: 7.7p), an increase of 43%. 
This reflects both the highly successful performance in 2010 
and the Board’s confidence in the future.
Trading
The trading performance of our businesses in 2010 has  
been outstanding. 
“ In the first half of the year the  
Group story was one of substantially 
increased operating margins on 
essentially flat turnover. In the  
second half of the year this has  
been augmented by the return  
of top-line growth.”

Annual Report 2010 
In the first half of the year the Group story was one of 
substantially increased operating margins on essentially flat 
turnover. In the second half of the year this has been augmented 
by the return of top-line growth. This combination has produced 
an increase of 32% in annual headline operating profit and  
an even higher 53% increase in the year’s headline earnings  
per share due to reductions in tax and net financing costs. 
Group headline operating margins are now at 14.3% up from 
11.5% last year and in the second half of the year we have 
virtually achieved the margin target of 15% we set on the 
acquisition of FKI.
Much of this profit growth has come from FKI businesses 
acquired in July 2008, but also from Dynacast, our principal 
early cycle business, which saw strong sales growth particularly 
in the first half of the year. Order books for the Group remain 
strong going into 2011.
Cash generation in 2010 remained extremely strong. Over 100% 
of profits were turned into cash, generating headline operating 
cash (after capital expenditure) of £202.5 million; and working 
capital remained under strict control even in the face of improving 
sales. Capital expenditure, which had been somewhat curtailed 
during the downturn, is now back on a rising trend – we expect 
this to exceed depreciation over the next few years as our 
investment plans are implemented. We see opportunities for 
profitable investment in all of our businesses.
Dynacast
Dynacast has been owned since May 2005 and the Board 
considers this to be an appropriate time to seek to realise the 
value created since then. A sale process has commenced  
and we are hopeful of a satisfactory outcome. Shareholders, 
however, can be confident that this excellent business will only 
be sold at a price which fully reflects the quality of its prospects. 
In the event a sale is successful it is our intention to return the 
proceeds to shareholders.
Strategy and outlook
Much has been achieved in the period since the acquisition  
of FKI with our existing businesses and management and 
employees are to be congratulated on this performance. 
However, there remains much opportunity for more to  
be achieved.
None of our major businesses has yet regained the levels of 
sales reached in the recent past, nor do we believe they have 
reached their potential in terms of profitability. Our strategy  
of selling businesses at the appropriate moment in their 
improvement cycle remains in place and this moment has not 
arrived for the majority of our businesses. Demand, though 
stronger in Europe and South East Asia than North America, 
continues to be good and current order books lead us to be 
optimistic on the sales outlook for 2011. Our ability to pass  
on raw material price increases, together with many initiatives 
on the cost front, mean we are also hopeful of further 
improvements in operating margins.
We are well placed operationally and financially to take on 
another substantial acquisition. We are as selective as ever  
with our criteria and although it is impossible to be precise 
about timing we are confident of identifying a value enhancing 
opportunity in due course.
In the meantime the inherent strengths of our businesses and 
their management teams gives the Board confidence of further 
progress in 2011.

“ We are well placed operationally and 
financially to take on another substantial 
acquisition. We are as selective as ever 
with our criteria and although it is 
impossible to be precise about timing 
we are confident of identifying a value 
enhancing opportunity in due course.”  06 Melrose PLC Annual Report 2010 
I am very pleased with the trading performance of the Group  
in 2010. As we move back into a period of sales growth though, 
it is worth noting that profits have increased in the Group 
notwithstanding the severe global downturn of the last  
few years.
In the first half of the year, the profit increase was achieved 
largely through lower costs on flat sales, whereas in the second 
half the profit growth was driven by increasing sales as the 
order books, particularly from our later cycle businesses,  
started to kick in. This has resulted in a steady and gratifying 
improvement in headline operating profit margins (a key Melrose 
performance indicator) to 14.9% in the second half of the year. 
This is significant in that it demonstrates the transition to 
increasing revenue driving profit growth rather than cost 
reduction. The Group is well placed to benefit from this in that 
many of its businesses operate in industries and regions with 
strong long term growth characteristics. As a result, during the 
second half of 2010 the Group has stepped up its capital 
expenditure programme significantly.
Whilst there are concerns about the effect of raw material price 
increases on the global economy, individually our businesses  
all benefit from strong positions in their markets and we are 
confident that, absent to an overall decline in the global 
economy, the Group will not be adversely affected.
The Energy division had an excellent year in 2010. Although the 
global power generation market started to recover during the 
year, it was not until well into the second half of the year that 
Brush Turbogenerators’ generator sales started to gather 
momentum, reflecting the later cycle nature of its business.  
In addition, the acquisition of GMS in the year has greatly 
boosted Brush Turbogenerators’ presence in the higher margin 
aftermarket business and this represents a major strategic 
opportunity for Brush. We continue to target growth in higher 
margin aftermarket sales and are confident that we will continue 
to see further success in this area over the months to come.

Annual Report 2010 
The continuing strength of the order book, allied to the efficiency 
gains being achieved, especially in relation to the absorption of 
Brush Transformers’ operations, gives us confidence that 2011 
will be another good year.
In the Lifting division, Bridon’s profit in 2010 fell marginally short 
of its record profit in 2009. Whilst a number of Bridon’s markets 
saw some recovery in the year, the offshore oil and gas industry 
remained subdued, exacerbated by the moratorium on 
deepwater drilling following the Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of 
Mexico. During the year Bridon launched a number of exciting 
new products designed to meet the increasingly demanding 
applications required by its customers and continued to invest  
in the upgrading of its manufacturing and research and 
development facilities. With general market conditions 
continuing to improve and the expectation that the offshore oil 
and gas market will start to recover in the second half of 2011, 
allied to the benefits from the new products and higher capital 
spending, Bridon looks forward to a year of progress. Crosby 
recovered sharply in 2010 following a difficult 2009. Both sales 
and profit grew strongly, partly as a result of a general pick up  
in market conditions, but also as a result of the hard work put in 
during 2009 to work closely with its well established distributor 
base and continue to focus on developing new products, 
thereby resulting in gains in market share. With major advances 
being made in expanding in the Far East and increasing orders 
in its established North American and European markets, 
Crosby looks forward to a successful outcome in 2011.
Dynacast performed exceptionally well in 2010 with revenue and 
profit recovering strongly after a difficult 2009. Some of the cost 
savings made during the downturn have been retained as sales 
have recovered and this has resulted in a highly encouraging 
return on sales in the year of over 15 per cent. Sales in all three 
of Dynacast’s main geographic regions grew strongly in the year 
and new tool sales, a key indicator of future growth, reached  
a record high in Asia during the year. As market conditions 
continue to show improvement, Dynacast is confident of a 
further year of progress.
The Other Industrial division performed well in 2010 – profit  
was up substantially on the back of a modest increase in sales. 
MPC in particular had an exceptional year as the benefits of a 
focused programme of technically differentiated new products 
supported by capital investment started to come on stream.  
This has led to a strong business relationship with Jaguar Land 
Rover which we have been pleased to support with capital 
investment. We look forward to another year of progress from 
this division.
In February 2011, Brush Traction, Logistex UK and Madico  
were sold for a total consideration of £20.7 million.
Outlook
Melrose group companies operate in markets that are forecast 
to continue to expand and to have good medium and long term 
growth characteristics. This, combined with an ongoing benefit 
from tight cost control, gives us confidence that we will continue 
to see progress over the years to come.
On the back of healthy order books, supported by an aggressive 
capital investment programme and a healthy pipeline of exciting 
new product introductions, we look forward to a further year of 
progress for the Group in 2011.

Brush Turbogenerators is the world’s largest independent 
manufacturer of electricity generating equipment for the power 
generation, industrial, oil and gas and offshore sectors. From its 
four plants in the UK, Holland, the Czech Republic and the USA, 
it designs, manufactures and services generators principally in 
the 10 MW to 250 MW range for both gas and steam turbine 
applications and supplies a globally diverse customer base.  
In addition, Brush Turbogenerators designs and manufactures 
Systems and Power transformers under the Brush name for  
UK electrical utilities and for the oil and gas sector primarily  
in the Middle East.
Brush Turbogenerators performed very well in 2010 with a 
particularly strong second half of the year. Revenue was nearly 
10 per cent higher than in 2009 and headline operating profit 
was approximately one third higher, resulting in a most healthy 
and satisfying outcome in return on sales, one of Melrose’s  
key performance indicators.

Sectors served: Power generation plants, oil and gas, utilities, 
industrial, marine, rail, telecommunications, construction, 
commercial, military, hydropower, cogeneration, uninterrupted 
power supply and aftermarket.
Aftermarket sales performed well and produced a 25 per cent 
increase in the year, aided by the contribution from the 
acquisition in February 2010 of GMS, a US company based  
in Pennsylvania. GMS has exceeded its first year targets for 
both orders and sales. 
The global power generation market began a slow recovery  
in 2010 resulting in Brush Turbogenerators’ new-build sales 
increasing by 3 per cent in 2010 over 2009. These sales  
were delivered on a far leaner and more efficient cost base, 
producing a significant improvement in operating margins  
and backed up by excellent cash generation.
Significant progress was also made in the year in implementing 
the new Brush manufacturing strategy. A combination of 
targeted capital investment in core facilities, outsourcing of 
non-core operations and a factory management philosophy 
based on value stream principles has reduced average 
generator manufacturing lead times by 15 per cent. 
Furthermore, this improved performance is being carried  
out off an inventory base which is half what it was when FKI  
was acquired in 2008.
As reported in the Interim Statement last August, the  
operations of Brush Transformers were absorbed into  
Brush Turbogenerators in July 2010.
The integration of the transformers business proceeded 
according to plan and was largely completed during 2010, 
resulting in significant operational gains, which will be reflected 
in Brush Turbogenerators’ performance in 2011. The softness  
in the UK demand for transformers experienced in the first half 
of 2010 has continued into the second half of the year. 
Harrington, the specialist generator manufacturer based in the 
UK, saw a small fall in sales in 2010 following the 30 per cent 
decline in 2009. There is evidence to suggest that the UK  
small generator market bottomed out in 2010 as orders 
increased by 14 per cent, primarily in the last quarter of the  
year. The transition of the business to more specialised 
applications is on track and Harrington enters 2011 with  
a healthy order book.
Outlook
Brush Turbogenerators entered 2011 with a new-build order 
book of £132 million representing well over half of its budgeted 
new-build sales for 2011. These sales, allied to the improved 
operational efficiency of the plants, together with the increased 
proportion of higher margin aftermarket business and the 
benefits from the integration of Brush Transformers, give us 
confidence that Brush Turbogenerators will have another  
good year in 2011.
“ Sales were delivered on a far leaner 
and more efficient cost base, 
producing a significant improvement 
in operating margins and backed  
up by excellent cash generation.”
Brush Turbogenerators
Brush is in the process of supplying four water-hydrogen 
cooled generators as part of an extension to the nuclear 
power plant situated at Mochovce, Slovak Republic.  
The picture shows one of the generators on test at the  
Brush factory in the Czech Republic. All four Brush generators 
will be installed by 2013, together with new hydrogen and 
water systems for cooling the generators, oil systems for 
lubrication and static excitation systems for power supply.
Marelli Motori (“Marelli”)
Marelli, based in Italy, is one of the world’s leading 
manufacturers of industrial generators and electric motors  
with a product portfolio ranging from 0.2 kW to 7.2 MW.  
With five overseas offices in Germany, UK, Malaysia, USA  
and South Africa it serves worldwide markets for power 
generation, marine, oil and gas and industrial manufacturing.
Sales in 2010 were marginally below 2009 and headline

and increasing raw material costs. During 2010 sales shifted 
away from higher margin larger specialist machines towards 
more standard machines, reflecting the impact of the economic 
downturn which hit the marine sector particularly hard. Marelli 
once again confirmed its cash generating abilities by converting 
135% of its headline operating profit into cash.
The building of the Malaysian plant is well underway and should 
be fully operational by the middle of this year. This plant will 
make the smaller, more standard generators, thereby enabling 
Marelli’s Italian operation to focus on manufacturing larger, more 
sophisticated machines.

Marelli
In 2010, Marelli supplied and installed a medium-voltage 
high-speed Vertical Hydropower Synchronous Generator  
to a hydropower plant in Bürglen, Switzerland. The generator  
is fitted with water cooled sleeve bearings able to withstand 
static and hydraulic loads and has a rated power of 3,700 kVA 
and a rated speed of 1,000 rpm. The generator weighs 19 
tonnes and is able to satisfy the electric power requirements 
of over 900 family houses.
Outlook
The positive momentum in orders experienced in 2010 has 
continued into the new year and gives us confidence that 2011 
will be a year of progress at Marelli.
Hawker Siddeley Switchgear (“HSS”)
HSS produces a wide range of indoor and outdoor medium 
voltage switchgear, selling into the global power distribution  
and transit markets. Based in the UK, where it has both a 
manufacturing and a R&D facility, HSS also has manufacturing 
plants in Australia and China.
HSS produced another good trading result in 2010 with  
further encouraging progress in operating margins, assisted  
by continuing focus on operational efficiency improvements 
during the year. In addition, tight control of working capital 
resulted in a creditable cash generation performance.
Both UK and Australian operations recorded healthy sales  
and an encouraging order intake during the year on the back  
of a focused product development programme designed to 
expand the reach and the range of HSS’s core products.  
The indoor and outdoor power distribution markets remained 
strong, supported by the further development of the UK and 
overseas mass transit markets, where HSS secured significant 
business on a number of high profile infrastructure projects.
The facility in Shanghai is now fully operational, supplying  
circuit breakers into HSS’s UK operation. This will now be 
further developed to support the company’s growth strategy  
in South East Asia, with particular regard to the growth of 
metropolitan systems throughout the region. This presents  
a significant opportunity for HSS.
Outlook
On the back of positive trading momentum at the end of 2010 
and with a strong opening order book in 2011, HSS looks 
forward to a good year. Melrose PLC 11

Bridon designs and manufactures a comprehensive range  
of lifting and stabilising solutions for applications in wire rope,  
fibre rope, steel wire and strand. The company services global 
customers in the oil and gas, mining, industrial, marine and 
infrastructure sectors.
As foreshadowed in the Interim Statement in August, Bridon’s 
profit in 2010 fell short of the record profit recorded in 2009, 
which benefited particularly from strong orders in the later  
cycle offshore oil and gas business. Headline operating margins 
in the second half of 2010 were weaker, due to lower sales in this 
business and low margin contracts in Bridon’s structures business. 
Whilst a number of Bridon’s markets experienced some 
recovery in 2010, market conditions in the offshore oil and gas 
industry remained subdued throughout the year. By contrast the 
onshore oil and gas sector did see some recovery.

Lifting 
review continued
General demand in the offshore market was weak in the 
aftermath of the global recession and this was exacerbated  
by the moratorium on deep water drilling following the Horizon  
oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Indeed, the impact of the spill  
was felt in markets beyond North America, as the regulatory 
authorities continued to scrutinise safety issues connected  
with deep water drilling.
By contrast, the mining market continued to improve for both 
deep shaft and surface mining as a result of the renewed 
demand for commodities, which has led to increased orders  
in most markets.
The commercial construction markets in North America, the 
Middle East and Europe remained subdued in 2010. As a result, 
many industrial crane companies have been cautious in placing 
orders, although activity has continued at reasonable levels in 
China and other parts of Asia. However, industrial production 
has increased in some countries, which has driven demand for 
industrial ropes.
Bridon’s focus on leading technology product development 
accelerated in 2010 with the introduction of eleven new products 
designed to meet the increasingly demanding applications 
required by its customers. New product introductions in 2010 
included the 2G Big Hydra, an enhanced multi-layer winch rope 
for the oil and gas industry, which provides greater strength and 
rotational stability to meet the growing challenges of deep-sea 
deployment and the Tiger BiG Bristar rope, used in the surface 
mining industry for dragline applications. Improvements have 
also been made to Bridon’s industrial and crane range with the 
introduction of a new high strength Dyform 8 Bristar rope, which 
offers improved design and plastic sheathing, resulting in 
significantly increased fatigue resistance. 
Bridon continues to invest in the upgrading of its manufacturing 
and research and development facilities. The programme to 
improve the wire mill in Doncaster, designed to increase 
manufacturing efficiencies and significantly reduce carbon 
emissions and other environmental waste, is due for completion 
in the second half of 2011. The £3 million investment in  
the company’s German factory, necessary to increase 
manufacturing capability for large multi-strand ropes, is on 
schedule to complete shortly. Further substantial capital 
investment is also planned over the next two years.
Outlook
Although Bridon expects demand in the offshore oil and gas 
market to remain subdued in the first half of 2011, it is expected 
that this market will start to see some recovery in the second 
half of the year, particularly in light of the continuing strength  
in the price of oil. The higher oil price will also benefit Bridon’s 
mining business, positively affecting activity levels in the 
Canadian Tar Sands.

Whilst the outlook for Bridon’s construction market remains 
uncertain, global manufacturing, particularly in the Far East,  
is likely to continue to increase during 2011, bringing modest 
growth to Bridon’s industrial business.
Bridon’s strategy to lead technology development through high 
quality manufacturing and innovative technical solutions in the 
wire and fibre rope industry leaves it well placed to benefit from 
market recovery.
Crosby
Crosby is a world leader in the design, manufacture and sale  
of lifting fittings and blocks to the oil and gas, construction and 
mining sectors, serviced primarily through a global network  
of specialist distributors. 
The recovery in Crosby’s trading performance from a difficult 
2009, reported in the Interim Statement, has continued on the 
back of an ongoing improvement in order bookings throughout 
the year. Crosby’s sales in the second half of 2010 were over  
20 per cent higher than in the second half of 2009 (the low  
point in Crosby’s sales cycle) and this has resulted in a very 
encouraging recovery in Crosby’s profit and operating margins.
During the year Crosby continued to focus and build upon its 
broad product mix of lifting fittings sold through its traditional 
distributor base. Market share gains have been achieved as a 
result of working closely with its distributors and focusing on 
technical training and end-customer service and support.  
This model has proved very successful in North America  
and is beginning to gain traction in other parts of the world.
An integral part of this model is a continuing focus on new 
product development. During the year Crosby introduced a 
number of new product lines and also made refinements to 
existing products. The Split Nut design, used in crane blocks  
to enable quick removal and easy inspection, has become 
widely accepted in its market. In addition, Crosby is in the 
process of introducing a new e-applications system, soon  
to be available on services such as the Apple iPad, designed  
to provide customers with real-time information regarding the 
installation and usage of Crosby products.
The expansion of the Crosby franchise beyond North America 
and Europe, where it has a powerful presence, remains a  
high priority. In addition to the rationalisation of the 
manufacturing base in Europe, further investment was made  
in strengthening the sales and marketing team with a view to 
increasing penetration, including territories such as India and 
the Middle East. 
Crosby continues to expand its capabilities in China by 
extending its network of distributors – sales volume has 
increased by an average of 35 per cent per annum over the  
past few years. This effort has been greatly assisted by the  
new crane block and sheave centre, based in Hangzhou,  
China, which has resulted in shorter delivery lead times to 
customers. Although at an early stage, Crosby has started 
stocking inventory in Brazil in order to take advantage of the  
fast growing offshore oil exploration opportunities.
Crosby
In October 2010, Crosby supplied  
an integral piece of the system  
used in rescuing thirty three Chilean  
coal miners from their sixty nine  
day underground imprisonment. 
Through a local distributor, Crosby  
provided the key link between the  
wire rope used to hoist the miners  
out of the mine and the capsule in  
which they made the trip to safety.  
A Crosby S421 Wedge Socket  
was used to connect the 24mm wire  
rope to the 600kg rescue capsule. 
Outlook
On the back of a growing order book in its established North 
American and European markets, and significant advances 
being made in penetrating newer regions, we look forward to  
a further year of good progress. 14 Melrose PLC Annual Report 2010

metal components and assemblies.
Dynacast is a global manufacturer of precision engineered 
products, including die-cast metal components that can be 
machined, plated and assembled to customer specifications. 
The products are manufactured using proprietary die-casting 
technology and are supplied to a wide range of end markets, 
including automotive, healthcare, telecommunications, 
consumer electronics, hardware, computers and peripherals.
After a very challenging 2009, Dynacast staged an outstanding 
recovery in 2010. Revenue was 32 per cent higher than in the 
previous year and headline operating profit more than doubled. 
Particularly pleasing was the improvement in the return on  
sales in the year to over 15 per cent. A large proportion of the 
costs that were taken out of the business to deal with the 
downturn have since returned as volumes have grown;  
however, it is expected that there will be some permanent 
saving, resulting in increased profitability.

Annual Report 2010 
Zinc is the major raw material used in the manufacture of 
Dynacast’s products and the LME price increased from an 
average of US $1,658 per tonne in 2009 to US $2,156 per  
tonne in 2010, accounting for approximately £12 million of  
the increase in revenue in 2010. Dynacast benefits from an 
established metal cost pass-through mechanism, such that  
this price increase had little impact on profit during the period.
The underlying (adjusted for metal and foreign currency) sales 
increase in Europe in 2010 over the previous year was over  
30 per cent, with particularly strong performances in Germany, 
Austria and Spain. Sales to Gillette were up significantly as a 
result of the introduction of the new Fusion Pro-Glide razor.
North America, having been the hardest hit of Dynacast’s 
regions in 2009 as a result of the severe downturns in the 
automotive and construction sectors, saw a gradual recovery  
in 2010 with sales picking up. During the year management 
closed the Montreal die-casting facility and transferred the 
production to other Dynacast plants in North America and 
Europe. After adjusting for this effect and foreign currency  
and metal prices, underlying sales in the region rose by  
13 per cent over 2009. 
In Asia, where the downturn in Dynacast’s sales was not as 
pronounced as in Europe and North America, the underlying 
sales growth in 2010 was a most encouraging 23 per cent. 
China continues to be the growth engine in Asia with Dynacast 
Shanghai leading the way with underlying revenue and headline 
operating profit growth in the year of 48 per cent and 153 per 
cent respectively over 2009. The new 4,500 square metre 
factory, which opened in Dongguan, South China, in 2009,  
has continued to develop rapidly. In view of the exciting growth 
potential in this region, Dynacast invested in a greenfield facility 
in Batam, Indonesia, which operates as a satellite unit of 
Dynacast Singapore and commenced production in the  
second half of 2010.
In 2010 there has been pleasing development of Dynacast’s 
international business development team which operates 
centrally to target sales to large multi-national companies  
which can then source product from any of Dynacast’s  
factories worldwide.
New tool sales, which are a key indicator of future growth, 
recovered in 2010 and, although more modest in the more 
developed economies, were at a record high in Asia in the year, 
which bodes well for 2011 and beyond.
Outlook
Having recovered dramatically from the downturn in 2009 
through positive management actions on costs and improving 
markets, Dynacast remains well positioned to continue to 
produce good returns.

Truth reported a creditable trading result for 2010. As previously 
reported, the dramatic recovery in Truth’s trading performance 
from the low point in the first half of 2009 started levelling off in 
the first half of 2010 as distribution pipelines were replenished. 
Although since that time US housing indicators have improved, 
they nevertheless remain significantly below average. Truth has 
done well to continue to raise its operating margins despite  
increasing pressure from substantial increases in the cost  
of materials, a testament to its leading market position in

Truth continued to increase its market share during the  
year, both through organic sales growth and new product 
development. Management’s focus during the year has centred 
on the control of labour costs, productivity, quality, service levels 
and customer satisfaction, together with constant attention to 
working capital management.
The major strategic initiative to outsource the manufacturing  
of lower margin products to China continues to make good 
progress and this has resulted in more capacity being made 
available for the efficient production of higher margin casement 
units in Truth’s Minnesota plant.
Outlook
Notwithstanding the appalling weather conditions in a large  
part of the US at the beginning of 2011, which has made 
comparisons to last year very difficult to assess, there is a 
feeling that, although US housing remains sluggish, Truth will 
show moderate sales growth in the year. In view of the efficiency 
gains continuing to be made in the business and its growth in 
market share, Truth should continue to improve its performance 
in 2011 and is very well placed to benefit when the US housing 
market recovers.
Harris
Harris is a market leader in the scrap and waste recycling 
industries, operating from two plants in Georgia, USA.  
The company designs, manufactures and services a full  
range of equipment solutions and serves the scrap metal  
and fibre recycling industries.
Harris performed well in 2010. Although revenue declined 
slightly in the year, headline operating profit was over  
15 per cent higher than in 2009, as a result of improved 
efficiency and lower costs, resulting in a healthy improvement  
in operating margin. Demand for scrap recycling machines 
recovered in 2010 with order intake being 50 per cent  
higher than in 2009.
Harris continued to invest in design and engineering in 2010 
through its new product development group. During the year, 
Harris introduced four new products that boast higher 
throughput but with approximately half the energy consumption. 
These new products present a strong value proposition in  
the market.
During the year Harris decided to build on its strong reputation 
in the scrap and waste recycling industries by expanding its 
presence in Latin America in order to take advantage of the 
rapidly growing markets in that region.
In addition, during the year Harris continued to add resources  
to its growing aftermarket business. This has grown from 
approximately 20 per cent of Harris’ sales in 2008 to 34 per cent 
in 2010.
Outlook
Harris should have another year of progress in 2011 but, based 
on the current order book, this is expected to be weighted to 
the second half of the year.

The year to 31 December 2010 is the first full year since the  
FKI acquisition for which the prior year performance provides  
a meaningful comparative.
In addition, no businesses are shown as discontinued in 2010 
and hence the 2009 and 2010 results have not been adjusted

Group trading results – continuing operations
The continuing operations at 31 December 2010 include  
four trading divisions, namely Energy, Lifting, Dynacast and 
Other Industrial.
To help understand the results of the continuing operations the 
term ‘headline’ has been used. This refers to results calculated 
before exceptional costs, exceptional income and intangible 
asset amortisation as this is considered by the Melrose PLC 
Board to be the best measure of performance.
For the year ended 31 December 2010 the Group achieved 
revenue from continuing operations of £1,379.5 million (2009: 
£1,298.5 million) representing a 6% increase over the previous 
year. During the second six months of 2010 Group revenue 
increased by 15% compared to the same period in 2009 –  
a significant improvement from the 1% fall in the first six months  
of 2010.
Headline operating profit in the year ended 31 December 2010 
was £196.9 million (2009: £149.7 million) which was up by 32% 
on the previous year, a significantly faster pace of growth than 
for Group revenue. This was achieved by an increase in the 
headline operating profit margin (defined as the percentage of 
headline operating profit to revenue) from 11.5% in 2009 to 
14.3% in 2010. Indeed, in the second half of 2010 the margin 
increased to 14.9%, just below our long term stated target of 
15%. The reasons for this performance are highlighted in the 
Chief Executive’s review.

costs and headline tax. As a consequence of improvements in 
both of these costs compared to the previous year the headline 
EPS in 2010 of 25.4p (2009: 16.6p) has increased by 53%.  
The diluted headline EPS, which recognises the current value of

Central costs comprise £8.6 million (2009: £8.9 million) of Melrose 
PLC corporate costs and an LTIP accrual of £6.6 million (2009: 
£6.8 million). This accrual includes an amount of £1.8 million 
(2009: £1.8 million) in respect of the Melrose 2009 Incentive Share 
Scheme. This annual accrual was calculated in accordance  
with IFRS 2 using a standard pricing model when the scheme 
was established and is constant until the date of crystallisation.  
In addition, an increase in the provision for the cash based  
senior management incentive schemes of £4.8 million (2009:  
£5.0 million) was charged. This scheme is for senior operational 
management and is designed to reward improvement in  
business performance mainly over the period to 2014.
Finance costs and income
The net finance cost in 2010 was £26.1 million (2009: 
£31.1 million).
Net interest on external bank loans, overdrafts and cash 
balances was £17.9 million (2009: £20.3 million), which is largely 
protected from interest rate changes by a number of interest 
rate swaps which fix the interest rate on £378.7 million (US 
$546.0 million and €33.3 million) of term debt. More detail on 
these swaps is given in the finance cost risk management 
section of this review. The net interest expense on external loans 
has reduced during the year. This is because US $80 million  
of the term loan was repaid in 2009 following the sale of the 
Logistex businesses, and also the margin charged to Melrose 
by the bank syndicate has become lower due to the reduction  
in leverage. In 2010 the Group had a blended interest rate of 
3.35% (2009: 3.49%).
Also included in the net finance cost is a £2.3 million (2009:  
£2.1 million) amortisation charge for the initial costs of raising  
the £750 million committed loan facility, a net interest cost on 
pension plans in excess of the expected return on their assets 
of £4.1 million (2009: £6.6 million) and the unwind of discounts  
on long term provisions of £1.7 million (2009: £1.6 million).
Earnings per share and number of shares in issue
The Board believe that headline EPS gives the best reflection of 
performance in the year as it strips out the impact of exceptional 
costs, exceptional income and intangible asset amortisation. 
The headline EPS for the year to 31 December 2010 was 25.4p 
(2009: 16.6p) which represents a 53% increase on the prior 
year. The diluted headline EPS for the year ended 31 December 
2010 was 24.1p (2009: 16.3p). This represents a 5% dilution 
factor (2009: 2%) to recognise the current value, in number  
of shares, of the Melrose 2009 Incentive Share Scheme. 
In accordance with IAS 33, two further basic EPS numbers  
are disclosed on the face of the Income Statement, one for 
continuing operations which is 28.4p (2009: 11.0p) and one that 
also includes discontinued operations, of which there are none 
in 2010, and therefore is also 28.4p (2009: 16.0p). 
Exceptional costs and income
Melrose has continued to undertake significant action to improve 
the operational and financial performance of the Group.  
To achieve this exceptional costs and exceptional income have 
been incurred and, along with intangible asset amortisation, 
these have been highlighted on the face of the Income Statement. 
Exceptional operating costs amounted to £10.3 million (2009: 
£23.9 million), exceptional income to £21.4 million (2009:  
£14.0 million) and intangible asset amortisation to £26.6 million 
(2009: £26.7 million). Exceptional operating costs and income 
consist of the following items:

In addition, the Group entered into a buyout arrangement to  
sell the liabilities of the Bridon Group Senior Executive Plan 
for £4.0 million in excess of IAS 19 carrying value of plan  
net liabilities.
In accordance with IFRS 3 (revised 2008), the £0.2 million of 
costs incurred in the acquisition of Generator & Motor Services 
of Pennsylvania, LLC are shown as exceptional costs in these 
financial statements. The Prelok France business, previously 
shown within the Other Industrial division, was disposed of for  
a loss of £0.2 million.
During the year, it was announced to members of the FKI UK 
Pension Plan that it would be closed to the accrual of future 
benefits on 28 February 2011 resulting in a curtailment gain  
of £13.1 million.
In addition, a gain of £5.6 million was generated by the 
commutation of certain insurance policies within the FKI captive 
insurance company. 
During 2010, provisions created as part of the FKI fair value 
exercise were reassessed based on latest information and this 
resulted in a net release of £2.7 million, the credit for which has 
been shown in exceptional income.
Acquisition during the period
On 12 February 2010, the Group acquired 100% of the  
issued share capital of Generator & Motor Services of 
Pennsylvania, LLC (“GMS”), a company operating in North 
America supplying aftermarket services to the turbogenerator 
industry. The consideration for GMS was £8.0 million. In addition 
acquisition costs of £0.2 million were incurred and expensed  
in the Income Statement in accordance with IFRS 3 (revised 
2008). GMS is now reported within the Energy division.
Disposal of businesses – post 31 December 2010
Three smaller businesses have been disposed of in the two 
months following 31 December 2010, namely, Brush Traction, 
Logistex UK and Madico, all of which were held within the Other 
Industrial division.
The net proceeds for these businesses were £20.7 million  
and the businesses contributed £58 million to revenue and 
£6 million to headline operating profit in 2010.
In addition, £22 million of pension liabilities went with the 
Logistex UK business, including a small deficit, and with the 
Brush Traction disposal over £100 million of parent company 
guarantees and bonds were transferred to the buyer.
Cash generation and management
A key performance measure for Melrose is the percentage  
of profit conversion to cash. This represents the amount of  
cash (post working capital movement and capital expenditure) 
that is generated from headline operating profit. In the year to  
31 December 2010 103% (2009: 149%) of headline operating 
profit has been converted to cash. This means that the long 
term Melrose headline operating profit conversion to cash from 
2003 to 2010 is now 122%, and since acquiring FKI is 136%.
The headline cash generation since acquiring FKI has been 
achieved across all divisions as shown in the table at the bottom 
of the page.
This has enabled Melrose to generate £96.9 million of cash from 
trading after all costs including tax in the year to 31 December 
2010. Importantly, since the acquisition of FKI on 1 July 2008, 
£341.9 million of cash has been generated from trading after all 
costs including tax. In addition, £48.5 million of cash net of 
costs has been generated from disposals and £100.5 million 
has been paid to shareholders. This has meant that, at constant 
exchange rates, net debt has reduced by £278.5 million, 60% 
since the acquisition of FKI on 1 July 2008.

Capital expenditure
The pay back on capital projects is a key part of the Melrose 
strategy to improve operational performance. By division, the 
capital expenditure in the year was as follows:

Melrose six year   
 (2005-2010)   
 average annual   
 multiple 1.2x
The capital spend to depreciation ratio was 1.0x in 2010, 
compared with 0.7x in 2009. Indeed, in the second half of 2010 
it increased to 1.4x. This illustrates that the Group is returning to 
its investment phase where the Board authorises capital and 
restructuring projects which will improve the value of the 
businesses. The six year Melrose average annual capital  
spend is in excess of depreciation at 1.2x.
Working capital management
The Board continues to allow each division to have the correct 
amount of working capital to achieve the most suitable balance 
between commercial and financial efficiency. To ensure this 
happens, working capital days cover targets are set for each 
business unit for inventory, trade receivables and trade payables.
Even in this year of growth, a working capital cash inflow of 
£3.1 million was achieved, which means that working capital 
has become more efficient in the year. During Melrose’s 
ownership of FKI the cash generated from working capital,  
at constant exchange rates, is now £151.4 million, which 
represents a 57% reduction in net working capital. A further 
measure of improvement is that the percentage of net working 
capital to sales for the Melrose Group has now reduced to 8.4% 
at 31 December 2010 compared to 15.4% on acquisition of FKI.
Tax
As expected, the headline Income Statement tax rate in 2010 
was 26% (2009: 30%).
This is consistent with the Group’s natural tax rate, based on the 
mix of 2010 contributions of profit by country and the standard 
statutory tax rate in those countries, as adjusted for specific, 
known factors. The overall effect on the Group of higher tax 
rates in North America and certain European countries is offset 
by the benefit that continues to arise from lower tax rates in the 
Far East and other European countries.
The rate after exceptional items and intangible asset 
amortisation is 9% (2009: 33%), which is lower than the  
headline rate due mostly to the recognition of exceptional US 
deferred tax assets of £23.5 million as an exceptional credit. 
These deferred tax assets are recognised now because 
sufficient future taxable profits are now expected to arise  
to benefit from future likely tax deductions and losses.
The headline cash tax rate of 16% (2009: 3%) is again low  
due to the benefit arising from the utilisation of tax losses and 
other deferred tax assets. In the medium term, the headline 
cash tax rate is expected to trend toward the headline Income 
Statement rate.
The total amount of tax losses in the Group has increased 
slightly due to the recalculation of prior year positions. This is 
largely offset by the utilisation of losses and other deferred  
tax assets against current year profits. The tax losses are  
as follows:
Tax losses

£m

Total 2010 – 251.7 251.7 
Total 2009 13.6 237.8 251.4 
The Group’s net deferred tax liability is £81.9 million (2009: 
£103.2 million). A £102.8 million (2009: £112.9 million) deferred 
tax liability is provided in respect of brand names and customer 
relationships acquired. This liability does not represent a future 
cash tax payment and will unwind as the brand names and 
customer relationships are amortised.

The non-current assets have been tested for impairment

Pensions
The Group has a number of defined benefit and defined 
contribution plans. The IAS 19 deficit of the defined benefit 
pension plans as at 31 December 2010 was £119.6 million 
(2009: £169.1 million).
The current market value of the assets of the FKI UK Pension 
Plan, the most significant plan in the Group, is insufficient to 
satisfy the liabilities to members when they are valued on a 
basis consistent with IAS 19. The net accounting deficit on  
this plan was £78.6 million at 31 December 2010 (2009:  
£110.1 million). This plan had assets at 31 December 2010  
of £549.2 million (2009: £508.7 million) and liabilities of  
£627.8 million (2009: £618.8 million). 
The other UK defined benefit pension plan of significant size  
in the Group, namely the McKechnie UK Pension Plan, was in 
surplus of £1.9 million at 31 December 2010 (2009: deficit of 
£12.1 million). This plan had assets at 31 December 2010  
of £143.8 million (2009: £128.1 million) and liabilities of  
£141.9 million (2009: £140.2 million).
In addition, a US defined benefit plan for FKI exists.  
At 31 December 2010, this had assets of £193.3 million  
(2009: £174.4 million), liabilities of £213.1 million (2009:  
£191.4 million) and consequently a deficit of £19.8 million  
(2009: £17.0 million). 
The assumptions used to calculate the IAS 19 value of the 
pension plans within the Melrose Group are considered carefully 
by the Board of Directors. For the FKI UK Pension Plan a male 
aged 65 in 2010 is expected to live for a further 20.2 years.  
This is assumed to increase by 2.5 years (12%) for a male aged 
65 in 2035. A summary of the key assumptions of the FKI UK 
Pension Plan are shown below:
2010 
Assumption 
%
2009 
Assumption 
%
Discount rate 5.55 5.75
Inflation 3.45 3.45
Salary increases 4.00 3.95
It is noted that a 0.1 percentage point decrease in the discount 
rate would increase the pension liability on the FKI UK Pension 
Plan by £9.5 million and a 0.1 percentage point increase to 
inflation would increase the liability on this plan by £3.5 million. 
Furthermore, an increase by one year in the expected life of a 
65 year old male member would increase the pension liabilities 
on this plan by £17.3 million.
The long term strategy for the UK plans is to focus on the cash 
flows required to fund the liabilities as they fall due. These cash 
flows extend many years into the future and the ultimate 
objective is that the total pool of assets derived from future 
company contributions and the investment strategy allows each 
cash payment to members to be made when due. The Melrose 
Group contributes £18.5 million to the FKI UK Pension Plan and 
£4.6 million to the McKechnie UK Pension Plan per annum.
In addition, the strategy includes reducing the volatility of 
liabilities whenever commercially viable.
The McKechnie UK Pension Plan is closed both to new 
members and current members’ future service. The FKI UK 
Pension Plan is closed to new members and on 28 February 
2011 it closed to current members’ future service, resulting in  
a curtailment gain of £13.1 million. This gain was included in 
exceptional income so as not to distort headline performance. 
Further post retirement benefits were terminated during 2010  
on US retiree benefit plans reducing liabilities by £3.4 million.
In addition, on 5 March 2010 the Group sold the assets  
(£17.4 million) and liabilities (£18.9 million) of the Bridon Group 
Senior Executive Plan to Aegon Trustee solutions at a premium 
to the IAS 19 net liabilities of £4.0 million which is shown in 
exceptional costs. The Trustees are in the process of winding  
up this plan. 24 Melrose PLC
Finance Director’s review

Annual Report 2010 
Risk management
The financial risks the Group faces have been considered  
and policies have been implemented to best deal with each  
risk. The four most significant financial risks are considered  
to be liquidity risk, finance cost risk, exchange rate risk and 
commodity cost risk. These are discussed in turn.
Liquidity risk management
The Group’s net debt position continued to improve during the 
year ending 31 December 2010 at £287.4 million compared  
with £321.7 million a year earlier. This decrease in net debt 
resulted from strong operational cash generation (more cash 
was generated than profit) and is despite an exchange rate 
translation loss on foreign currency denominated net debt  
of £7.2 million. 
The Group has a multi-currency committed facility that provides 
a term loan and revolving credit facility through to April 2013. 
These facilities have reduced from £750 million at inception in 
April 2008 to approximately £739 million as at 31 December 
2010. The term loan is fully drawn down, having originally been 
set at £500 million and has since been reduced by applying the 
proceeds from the disposal of the Logistex businesses in 2009. 
The term loan is subject to a 15% repayment amortisation and, 
as a result of the repayments arising from the Logistex 
proceeds, the first scheduled repayment of approximately  
£3 million is not now due until April 2012. The last repayment 
prior to maturity of £25 million is due in October 2012.  
The revolving credit facility of £250 million is not subject to  
any such repayments and the undrawn facility headroom at  
31 December 2010 was £234.6 million (2009: £224.9 million).  
In addition, there are a number of small uncommitted overdraft 
and borrowing facilities made available to the Group.  
These uncommitted facilities are lightly used.
In 2008 the term loan portion of this facility was converted into 
currency loans comprising US $686.0 million, €58.3 million and 
£50.0 million. In 2009 the Group used disposal proceeds to 
repay US $80.0 million of the US Dollar loans equivalent to 9% 
of the term loan, leaving US $606.0 million, €58.3 million and 
£50.0 million outstanding at 31 December 2010. Consequently, 
using the exchange rates as at 31 December 2010, the term 
loan is now equivalent to £488.8 million. 
The facility has two financial covenants: a net debt to headline 
EBITDA (headline operating profit before depreciation and 
amortisation) covenant and an interest cover covenant. The first 
covenant, which now calculates net debt at average exchange 
rates during the period, is set at 3.0x for December 2010 
reducing by 0.25x each year until 2013. At these exchange  
rates the net debt to headline EBITDA at 31 December 2010 
was 1.27x (compared to 1.25x at Balance Sheet rates) allowing 
significant headroom compared to the covenant test.  
The interest cover covenant remains at 3.5x throughout the life 
of the facility. At 31 December 2010 the actual interest cover 
was 9.7x which also affords comfortable headroom compared 
to the covenant test. Covenant tests are performed each June 
and December.
Cash, deposits and marketable securities amounted to  
£195.7 million at 31 December 2010 (2009: £147.5 million)  
and are offset against gross debt of £483.1 million (2009: 
£469.2 million) to arrive at the net debt position of £287.4 million 
(2009: £321.7 million). In combination with the undrawn committed 
facility headroom of £234.6 million (2009: £224.9 million), the 
Board considers that the Group has sufficient access to liquidity 
for its current needs.
In accordance with the reporting requirements on going 
concern issued by the Financial Reporting Council the Directors 
acknowledge that the economic environment causes uncertainty 
as to the trading outcome for 2011. The Group has committed 
borrowing facilities until April 2013. In addition, the breadth of 
the end markets that the Melrose Group companies trade in, 
both by sector and geographically, gives some balance to 
various market and economic cycle risks. Furthermore, as a 
result of the consistent cash generation record, which has 
allowed net debt at constant exchange rates to reduce by 60% 
since July 2008, the financial headroom has significantly 
improved. The Group’s forecasts take into account reasonable 
possible changes to trading performances. As a consequence 
the Board believes that the Group can manage its business 
risks successfully and accordingly the Group financial 
statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. 
Finance cost risk management
The Group maintained a net debt position throughout 2010.  
The Group protects 78% of its gross debt from exposure to 
changes in interest rates by holding a number of interest rate 
swaps to fix £378.7 million (US $546.0 million and €33.3 million) 
of term debt. Under the terms of these swaps, the Group has 
fixed the underlying interest rate at 2.1% for US Dollars and 
2.6% for the Euro through to early 2013. At 31 December 2010 
this produced a blended interest rate of 3.35% (2009: 3.49%) on 
the £750 million facility, calculated after inclusion of the current 
1.5% margin but before amortisation of arrangement fees and 
non-utilisation fees. Melrose PLC 25

Exchange rate risk management
The Group trades in various countries around the world and  
is exposed to many different foreign currencies. The Group 
therefore carries an exchange rate risk that can be categorised 
into three types as described below. The Board policy is 
designed to protect against some of the cash risks but not the 
non-cash risks. The most common cash risk is the transaction 
risk the Group takes when it invoices a sale in a different 
currency to the one in which its cost of sale is incurred. This is 
addressed by taking out forward cover against approximately 
60% to 80% of the anticipated cash flows over the following 
twelve months, placed on a rolling quarterly basis or for 100%  
of each committed contract. This does not eliminate the cash 
risk but does bring some certainty to it.

The effect on the key headline numbers in 2010 for the 
continuing Group due to the translation movement of exchange 
rates from 2009 to 2010 is shown below. The table illustrates 
the translation movement in revenue and headline operating 
profit if the 2009 average exchange rates had been used to 
calculate the 2010 results rather than the 2010 average 
exchange rates.

Headline operating profit increase 1.2
For reference, guidelines to show the net translation exchange 
risks that the Group currently carries and an indication of the 
short term exchange rate risk, which shows both translation 
exchange risk and unhedged transaction exchange rate risk is 
as follows:

operating profit 
£m
For every 10 cent strengthening of the  
 US Dollar against Sterling 5.0
For every 10 cent strengthening of the  
 Euro against Sterling 5.0
The long term exchange rate risk, which ignores any hedging 
instruments in place, is as follows:
Sensitivity of profit to translation and  
full transaction exchange rate risk
Increase  
in headline 
operating profit 
£m
For every 10 cent strengthening of the  
 US Dollar against Sterling 10.4
For every 10 cent strengthening of the  
 Euro against Sterling 9.0
No exchange instruments are used to protect against translation 
risk. However, when the Group has net debt, the hedge of 
having a multi-currency debt facility funding these foreign 
currency trading units protects against some of this risk.
The most significant exchange risk that the Group takes arises 
when a significant business that is predominantly based in a 
foreign currency is sold. The proceeds for those businesses will 
most likely be received in a foreign currency and therefore an 
exchange risk arises if these proceeds are converted back to 
Sterling, for instance to pay a dividend to shareholders. 
Protection against this risk is taken on a case-by-case basis. 
Commodity cost risk management
As Melrose owns engineering businesses across various 
sectors the cumulative expenditure on commodities is 
important. The Group addresses the risk of base commodity 
costs increasing by, wherever possible, passing on the cost 
increases to customers or by having suitable purchase 
agreements with its suppliers which sometimes fix the price 
over some months into the future. On occasions, Melrose  
does enter into financial instruments on commodities when  
this is considered to be the most efficient way of protecting 
against movements.

Directors’ report
Business reviews
During the year, in many of the Group’s business units, focus 
has been placed on the development of new product lines; this 
has helped to ensure that businesses remain at the forefront  
of technological advances within defined market sectors and 
continue to meet specific customer demand.
The Group continues to invest in the building of new factory 
facilities, particularly in the Far East, with Hawker Siddeley 
Switchgear, Dynacast, and Marelli opening, or in the process  
of opening, new plants in China, Indonesia and Malaysia, 
respectively. Elsewhere, investment in the Group’s factories 
continues; at Bridon a programme to upgrade the wire mill in 
Doncaster is due for completion next year, with further 
investment also planned at their German, North American and 
Chinese facilities in order to increase manufacturing capability.
An emphasis has also been placed on developing leaner 
manufacturing processes where possible and exploring 
outsourcing opportunities to other areas of the world, 
predominantly the Far East. Truth made the decision to 
outsource more of its lower margin products to China during 
2009 and the benefits of this began to materialise in 2010;  
over time Truth plan to further develop this strategy. 
Within Brush, focus was placed on the Aftermarket business and 
this resulted in a 25% increase in Aftermarket sales when 
compared to 2009. This performance was assisted by the 
purchase of Generator & Motor Services of Pennsylvania, LLC 
(“GMS”), a US company based in Pittsburgh, in February 2010.
The development of growth opportunities in emerging markets 
continued to be a key focus within the Group during the year, 
especially in China, Indonesia, Malaysia and other parts of Asia. 
Some business units are also exploring the opportunities for 
growth within South America to capitalise on the rapidly growing 
sales opportunities that may be available within these markets.
The cost base of all business units was kept under constant 
review during 2010. Businesses have continued to build on the 
various cost reduction initiatives introduced in 2009, with several 
restructuring projects taking place. The Group also continues to 
regularly review its pension and benefit liabilities and reduce 
volatility where possible. A decision has recently been taken to 
close the largest defined benefit scheme of the Group (the FKI 
UK Pension Plan) to future accrual on 28 February 2011; this 
decision is expected to result in the funding deficit of this scheme 
being removed earlier than may have otherwise been expected.
The Directors remain focused on identifying the next business 
opportunity in order to create further value for shareholders.
The Chairman’s statement on pages 4 and 5, together with  
the Chief Executive’s review on pages 6 and 7, Business reviews 
on pages 8 to 18 and Finance Director’s review on pages 19

performance, financial position and likely future prospects  
of the Group. The results of the Group are set out in detail  
in the financial statements on pages 47 to 51 and in the 
accompanying notes.
The Company is required by the Companies Act 2006 to set out 
in this report a fair review of the development and performance 
of the Group during the year, the position of the Group at the 
end of the year and a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the Group. The information that fulfils these 
requirements can be found within the Chief Executive’s review, 
Business reviews, Finance Director’s review and in this 
Directors’ report. The Finance Director’s review also discusses 
the key performance indicators that management use. 
The Directors of Melrose PLC present their report and the 
audited financial statements of the Group for the year ended  
31 December 2010.
Strategy and principal activities 
Melrose PLC has a strategy to acquire industrial businesses, 
enhance their performance and realise their value in the  
medium term. Further details of each part of the strategy are 
shown below:
    Acquisition Strategy
Melrose aims to acquire industrial businesses that, in the 
opinion of the Directors, have the potential to improve, both 
financially and operationally, and create value for shareholders. 
In order for this acquisition strategy to be successful, businesses 
are targeted that have strong headline fundamentals, such as 
high quality products, or a leading market share, to generate 
sustainable cash flows and achieve profit growth.
  The executive Directors have extensive experience of 
identifying and evaluating acquisition opportunities, in both 
quoted and unquoted companies, within the UK and overseas.
    Performance Improvement Strategy
The Company is not a passive investor in the businesses that 
it acquires. The Directors and senior management team have 
a hands-on relationship with each acquired company, by 
working closely with their divisional senior management teams 
in developing the long term strategic plans of the business, as 
well as having regular input on restructuring decisions, capital 
expenditure and working capital management. The Company 
is fully committed to investing within the businesses it acquires 
in order to fully exploit their operational and strategic 
strengths. A natural part of this process involves the disposal 
of non-core businesses.
  Generally, Melrose will retain acquired companies for a period  
of between three to five years.
    Disposal Strategy
Once the performance improvement strategy has been 
completed, at the appropriate time each business will be 
disposed of in order to return any value creation to shareholders.
  The Directors are experienced in being able to recognise the 
appropriate time in the business cycle for disposal, in order  
to provide funding for future acquisitions and return funds  
to investors.
The Company has already delivered significant value to 
shareholders. For example, the acquisition of the McKechnie 
Group in May 2005 and its subsequent restructure resulted in 
the sale of two McKechnie divisions in 2007 (two years after 
they were acquired), which allowed the Company to repay  
£173 million of debt and return £220 million to shareholders.
The largest acquisition by the Group to date has been that of 
FKI plc, in July 2008, for a total consideration of £970.4 million; 
this increased the size of the Melrose Group by approximately 
six times. There has been significant ongoing restructuring 
within FKI since acquisition, including the disposal of several 
non-core businesses. In June 2009, the Company sold  
its North America operations of the Logistex division for  
US $40 million. The European operations of Logistex  
were also sold for €30 million, in August 2009. 
Post year end, the Company has disposed of three non-core 
businesses, being Madico, Logistex UK and Brush Traction, for 
£20.7 million.  Business performance Governance Financials Shareholder information
Melrose PLC 29 Annual Report 2010 
The Company has taken out an insurance policy in respect  
of those liabilities for which the Directors may not be 
indemnified. Neither the indemnity nor the insurance provides 
cover in the event that a Director is proved to have acted 
dishonestly or fraudulently.
Directors’ responsibilities
The Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in relation to the 
consolidated financial statements is set out on page 44.
Share capital
Details of the structure of the Company’s share capital and 
rights attached to the Company’s shares are set out on this  
and the following page in compliance with the requirements  
of section 992 of the Companies Act 2006.
No changes were made to the share capital of the Company 
during the year. The number of Ordinary Shares and 2009 
Incentive Shares in issue at the beginning and end of the year  
is shown below:
 Ordinary  
 Shares
 2009  
 Incentive   
 Shares
1 January 2010 and  
 31 December 2010 497,586,779 50,000
The Ordinary Shares and 2009 Incentive Shares represent 
95.2% and 4.8% respectively of the total nominal value of all 
shares in issue.
Ordinary Shares
The Ordinary Shares have a nominal value of 0.2p and are 
traded on the London Stock Exchange.
Incentive Shares
The 2009 Incentive Shares of £1.00 each have been awarded  
to Directors and senior managers within the Company, together 
with Ogier Employee Benefit Trustee Limited (as Trustee of  
the Melrose PLC Employee Benefit Trust) and replaced the 
share incentive scheme introduced in 2007. The rights attaching 
to the 2009 Incentive Shares are identical to those originally 
attached to the 2007 Incentive Scheme, with the exception that 
the Company may pay a dividend on the 2009 Incentive Shares  
as an alternative to converting them into Ordinary Shares and 
the award holders may not request early conversion in 2010 
and/or 2011. 
Participants are entitled to either a cash dividend, or a number 
of Ordinary Shares in the Company based on an increase  
in shareholder value between the period of July 2007 and  
May 2012.
The 2009 Incentive Shares do not confer a right to be paid  
an interim or final dividend or to vote at a general meeting.  
On winding up, the holders are entitled to participate in the 
Company’s assets equal to an amount to which they would 
have been entitled if their 2009 Incentive Shares had crystallised 
as at the date of winding up. Further details of the 2009 
Incentive Shares can be found in the Remuneration report  
on pages 40 and 41.
Further rights and obligations attaching to shares
The following summary is based on the Company’s current 
Articles, as adopted at the AGM on 13 May 2010.
The subsidiary undertakings principally affecting the profits  
or net assets of the Group in the year are listed in note 3 to  
the Melrose PLC UK Company accounts.
Financial results
The Group’s profit for the financial year attributable to members 
was £141.1 million (2009: £79.5 million). In addition, there  
were minority interest gains of £0.2 million (2009: losses  
of £0.2 million).
Shareholder dividend
The Directors are pleased to recommend the payment of a  
final dividend of 7.0p on 16 May 2011 to Ordinary shareholders 
on the register at the close of business on 15 April 2011.  
This dividend recommendation of the Directors will be put  
to shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting 
(“AGM”) of the Company, to be held on 12 May 2011.
It is the intention of the Board to maintain a progressive  
dividend policy where appropriate going forward.
Directors’ appointment and powers
The Directors of the Company as at the date of this report, 
together with their biographical details, are given on pages 26 
and 27. There were no changes to the Board during the year.
The Company’s Articles of Association (“the Articles”) give the 
Directors power to appoint and replace Directors. Under the 
terms of reference of the Nomination Committee, any 
appointment must be recommended by the Nomination 
Committee for approval by the Board. The Articles also require 
Directors to retire and resubmit themselves for election at the 
first AGM following their appointment. Furthermore, at each 
AGM one third of the Directors are subject to retirement by 
rotation and must therefore submit themselves for re-election.
The Directors are responsible for managing the business of  
the Company and may exercise all the power of the Company, 
subject to the provisions of relevant statutes, to any directions 
given by special resolution and to the Company’s Articles. 
Powers relating to the issuing of shares and powers to purchase 
the Company’s own shares are also included in the current 
Articles and such authorities are submitted for approval by  
the shareholders at the AGM each year.
Pursuant to sections 693 and 701 of the Companies Act 2006 
and a special resolution passed at the AGM in 2010, the 
Company is authorised to purchase its own shares, limited to  
an aggregate maximum number of 49,758,677 Ordinary Shares. 
The Company has not purchased any Ordinary Shares pursuant 
to this authority. The resolutions being proposed at this year’s 
AGM include a resolution to renew this authority.
Directors’ interests and remuneration
Information on Directors’ beneficial interests, including those  
of connected persons (within the meaning of section 252 of the 
Companies Act 2006), in the shares of the Company is shown  
in the Remuneration report on pages 40 to 43.
No Director had a material interest at any time during the year in 
any contract, other than a service contract, with the Company 
or any of its subsidiary undertakings.
Directors’ indemnities
The Directors have the benefit of an indemnity from the 
Company in respect of liabilities incurred as a result of their 
office. This indemnity is provided under the Articles and satisfies 
the indemnity provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 30 Melrose PLC Annual Report 2010 
Directors’ report 
continued
Transfer of shares
Subject to the Articles, any member may transfer all or any of 
his shares in any form which the Board may approve, and the 
transfer shall be executed by or on behalf of the transferor. 
Subject to the Articles and the requirements of any relevant 
investment exchange, the Board may, in its absolute discretion, 
refuse to register a transfer of a share which is not a fully paid 
share or on which the Company has a lien. The Board may also 
decline to register a transfer unless the transfer is: (i) in respect 
of only one class of shares; (ii) in favour of not more than four 
joint transferees or renouncees; (iii) duly stamped (if required); 
and (iv) delivered for registration to the registered office, or such 
other place as the Board may decide, accompanied by the 
certificate for the shares to which it relates and such other 
evidence as the Board may reasonably require to prove the  
title of the transferor.

The Corporate Governance report is included as a separate

Risks and uncertainties
The Group operates a variety of risk management processes 
designed to take into account the identification, management 
and mitigation of business risk, where both short term and long 
term considerations are monitored.
Due to the fact that Melrose operates within such a wide range 
of specialised engineering markets, across a range of customers, 
suppliers, labour markets and economic conditions, the 
Directors believe that many of the business risks are diversified. 
The fact that a large proportion of the Group’s business units 
operate within different parts of the world reduces the impact  
of local economic conditions that may be experienced.
The Directors have identified a variety of financial risks that may 
affect the Group from time to time; these include liquidity risk, 
finance cost risk, exchange rate risk and commodity costs.  
The financial risk management objectives and policies in relation 
to the use of financial instruments are described in the Finance 
Director’s review on pages 19 to 25.
Other risks that have been identified within the Group relate to 
the financial viability of key customers, product and employer’s 
liability claims, management of health and safety, environmental 
matters and intellectual property risks. Further information in 
relation to these risks is provided within some of the remaining 
sections of the Directors’ report. Additionally, any key 
commercial and economic risks are covered in each of the 
Business reviews on pages 8 to 18.
Voting
Only Ordinary Shares have voting rights attached. In a general 
meeting of the Company, subject to the provisions of the current 
Articles and to any special rights or restrictions as to voting 
attached to any other class of shares in the Company (of which 
there are currently none):
    on a show of hands, every member present shall have one 
vote; and 
    on a poll, every member who is present in person or by proxy 
shall have one vote for every share of which he is the holder.
The Company’s Articles were amended at last year’s AGM to 
take account of Shareholders’ Rights Regulations in relation to 
proxy voting. As such, the Articles now provide that each proxy 
appointed by a member has one vote on a show of hands 
unless the proxy is appointed by more than one member, in 
which case the proxy has one vote for and one vote against if 
the proxy has been instructed by one or more members to vote 
for the resolution and by one or more members to vote against 
the resolution.
No member shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting or 
class meeting in respect of any shares held by him, if any call or 
other sum then payable by him remains unpaid. Currently, all 
issued shares are fully paid. 
The Melrose PLC Employee Benefit Trustee holds 25,279 
Ordinary Shares at a nominal value of 0.2p per share, resulting 
from the crystallisation of the original incentive scheme in 
August 2007. The FKI Employee Benefit Trust holds a further 
158,114 Ordinary Shares at a nominal value of 0.2p per share, 
arising from the Melrose acquisition of FKI plc. The Remuneration 
Committee may direct how the voting rights of those shares  
are exercised. 
Deadlines for voting rights 
Full details of the deadlines for exercising voting rights in  
respect of the resolutions to be considered at the AGM to be 
held on 12 May 2011 are set out in the Notice of AGM, on pages 
97 to 99.
Dividends and distributions 
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, the 
Company may, by ordinary resolution, declare a dividend to be 
paid to the members, but no dividend shall exceed the amount 
recommended by the Board. The Board may pay interim 
dividends and also any fixed rate dividend, whenever the 
financial position of the Company, in the opinion of the Board, 
justifies its payment. All dividends shall be apportioned and paid 
pro rata according to the amounts paid up on the shares. 
The Board may deduct from a dividend or other amounts 
payable to a person in respect of their shares amounts due from 
him to the Company on account of a call or otherwise in relation 
to such shares.
Liquidation 
Under the current Articles, if the Company is in liquidation, the 
liquidator may, on obtaining any sanction required by law:
    divide amongst the members in kind the whole or any part of 
the assets of the Company; or
    vest the whole or any part of the assets in trust for the benefit 
of members as the liquidator shall determine. Business performance Governance Financials Shareholder information
Melrose PLC 31 Annual Report 2010 
Payments to suppliers 
Melrose has decided not to utilise standard protocols in respect 
of payments to suppliers, given the international nature of the 
Group’s operations. It is the responsibility of each business unit 
to agree the exact terms and conditions of transactions with 
their suppliers and these arrangements are adhered to, 
provided that suppliers meet their contractual commitments. 
The Company, as a holding company, did not have any material 
amounts owing to trade creditors at 31 December 2010.
Intellectual property
Each business unit is responsible for the protection and 
enforcement of its intellectual property (“IP”) rights through  
the use of external agents and it is therefore managed on a 
decentralised basis. However, the Directors recognise the 
importance of IP within the Group and seek to protect and 
enforce such rights where necessary. Internal IP audits are 
conducted by the Group on a periodic basis within each of  
the business units.
Employment policies
Due to the diverse nature of the Group, business units  
are required to manage their employment matters on a 
decentralised basis and therefore responsibility for the adoption 
of employment policies and practices sits at a local business 
unit level. This position ensures that policies and procedures 
meet both site and local regulatory requirements, taking into 
account the size and nature of the businesses.
Each business unit is responsible for setting and measuring its 
own key performance indicators (“KPIs”) and as such these vary 
throughout the Group. However, such measurements will 
generally include absenteeism, punctuality, headcount and 
employee relations issues. Any concerns or adverse trends  
are responded to in a timely manner. 
The Group recognises its responsibilities for the fair treatment  
of all its employees in accordance with legislation applicable to 
the territories within which it operates. Having regard to their 
skills and abilities, the Group gives full and fair consideration to 
applications for employment received from disabled persons. 
Further, and so far as particular disabilities permit, the Group  
will give employees disabled during their period of employment 
continued employment in the same job or, if this is not 
practicable, a suitable alternative job. Equal opportunities for 
appropriate training, career development and promotion are 
available to all employees regardless of any physical disability, 
gender, religion, race, nationality, sexual orientation or age.
Employee involvement, consultation and development
The Directors attach great importance to good labour relations, 
employee involvement and employee development. The nature 
of the Group’s activities places the responsibility for employment 
practices with local management, in a manner appropriate  
to each business. 
A culture of clear communication and employee consultation  
is inherent in the Group’s businesses. Employee briefing 
sessions are held on a regular basis to communicate strategy, 
key changes, financial results, achievements and other 
important issues affecting operations. Regular appraisals, 
employee surveys, notice boards, intranet sites, team meetings, 
suggestion boxes and newsletters are also used to 
communicate with employees. 
Various procedures are in place within the Group to provide 
internal control and risk management and these are explained  
in more detail within the Corporate Governance report on  
pages 36 to 39.
Key customers
The Company seeks to limit the risk of business failure within its 
key customer base through an ongoing review process, which 
has particular regard for the financial strength of such key 
business customers. However, the Company considers that the 
loss of any one key customer would not have a material effect 
on the Group’s results, even though it is acknowledged that 
such a loss could be material to an individual business unit.
Significant agreements and change of control
With the exception of the Group’s banking facilities, the 2009 
Incentive Share Scheme and the divisional long term incentive 
schemes, there are no other agreements that take effect, alter 
or terminate upon a change of control of the Company following 
a takeover bid, that are considered to be significant in terms of 
their potential impact on the business of the Group as a whole 
on 9 March 2011.
Upon the acquisition of FKI plc, the Group arranged a 
syndicated £750 million facility, comprising a term loan and 
revolving credit facility maturing in April 2013. In the event of a 
change of control of the Company following a takeover bid, the 
Company and lenders under this facility are obliged to enter into 
negotiations to determine whether and, if so, how to continue 
with the facility. There is no obligation for the lenders to continue 
to make the facility available for more than 30 days beyond any 
change of control. Failure to reach agreement with parties on 
revised terms could require an acquirer to put in place 
replacement facilities.
In the event of a takeover of the Company, the 2009 Incentive 
Shares convert into Ordinary Shares or an entitlement to a 
dividend paid in cash, the conversion being based upon the 
offer price of the Company’s Ordinary Shares as calculated on 
the date of the change of control of the Company. If part or the 
entire offer price is not in cash, the Remuneration Committee 
will determine the value of the non-cash element, having been 
advised by an investment bank of repute that such valuation is 
fair and reasonable.
Product and employer’s liability claims
The Group seeks to assess its ongoing risks in relation to 
potential future liabilities arising from insurance claims via  
the use of external actuarial projections to measure material 
exposures. An analysis of historic claims experience is used to 
analyse risks in relation to less significant exposures. Actuarial 
projections and claims history experience are regularly analysed 
by management and key issues, trends and statistics are also 
discussed at Board level.
Risks within the Group relate to potential future liabilities arising 
from product, disease (including asbestos), employer’s liability and 
workers’ compensation claims. Provisions in relation to such risks 
are recognised in the Group’s Balance Sheet, where appropriate. 
Note 30 to the consolidated financial statements provides further 
information with regard to contingent product liabilities.
A number of businesses have ISO 9001 and ISO 16949 
certifications for their quality management systems, which also 
helps to ensure their products and processes are of a recognised 
quality, reducing the risk of product claims. Some business units 
are also certified to international health and safety standards via 
ISO 18001, which helps to further ensure that risks in relation to 
employer’s liability claims are kept to a minimum. 32 Melrose PLC Annual Report 2010

The FKI UK Pension Plan (“FKI UK Plan”) is a UK defined benefit 
pension plan with FKI Limited as its principal employer.  
The primary liability for funding rests with the participating 
employers, which currently pay £18.5 million annually into the 
FKI UK Plan. This is expected to remove the funding deficit by 
31 December 2022, when the contribution levels were last 
formally assessed as at 31 December 2008. The FKI UK Plan 
closed to future accrual on 28 February 2011 and this is 
expected to lead to the funding deficit being removed earlier 
than would otherwise have been the case.
The FKI US Pension Plan is a defined benefit pension plan 
covering several of FKI’s US business units. The primary liability 
for funding the FKI US Pension Plan rests with the participating 
employers. The Company and Trustees have reviewed the 
funding requirements of the FKI US Pension Plan, based on its  
1 January 2009 actuarial valuation and no pension contributions 
are required, as it is expected that the deficit will be eliminated 
over time via excess asset returns. Unlike the UK pension plans, 
deferred member liabilities do not increase by inflation each year.
The McKechnie UK Pension Plan (“McKechnie UK Plan”) is a UK 
defined benefit pension plan with McKechnie Limited as its 
principal employer. The primary liability for funding rests with the 
participating employers. The Company and Trustees reviewed 
the funding of the McKechnie UK Plan as part of the actuarial 
valuation as at 31 December 2008 and it was agreed that the 
participating employers would contribute £4.6 million annually 
into the McKechnie UK Plan. The Company has guaranteed the 
funding of the McKechnie UK Plan on an ongoing basis. 
Health and safety
The Directors regard health and safety and the efficient 
management of such risks as a key priority within the Group. 
They regularly review health and safety performance statistics 
within each of the business units. The Group has a policy to 
ensure that the Directors are made aware of any serious health 
and safety incidents, wherever they occur in the world, as soon 
as possible, to ensure that suitable investigations and corrective 
action can be taken without delay. Health and safety is also 
covered at every quarterly Board meeting of the Group.
Each business unit is responsible for setting its own health and 
safety policies and procedures in accordance with local health 
and safety legislation. Most businesses strive to achieve best 
practice, in terms of what is suitable and practical for the size 
and nature of their operations. Several of the Group’s business 
Employee engagement at Brush Turbogenerators’ 
Loughborough site was a key priority in 2010 and they joined 
the ‘Innovate Workplaces’ scheme initiated by Unite (the largest 
union in the UK). Brush and other participating companies are 
committed to creating site committees and to actively 
addressing employee issues to assist in developing 
organisational performance and communication. Following the 
development of a focus group and a subsequent employee 
survey it was decided to introduce a quarterly employee 
magazine, Falcon News, in March 2010, designed to encourage 
networking between different parts of the business and to keep 
all employees updated on a variety of company issues. 
Extensive training is available to all staff and is actively 
encouraged to ensure a high standard of skill is maintained 
across the Group. Cross-training programmes are also in place 
at a number of units. The importance of training extends beyond 
on-the-job training and also focuses on enhancing personal 
development. Apprenticeship programmes are in place at the 
majority of sites, which help to assist with succession planning 
in locations where there is an ageing workforce. Employees are 
encouraged to think in an innovative manner across the Group. 
Within the business unit of Harris, the ‘New Product 
Development Group’ was formed last year, an in-house initiative 
designed to encourage employees to deliver new products to 
market, thus enhancing teamwork and transfer of knowledge 
within the workforce. It resulted in four new products being 
launched in 2010, which were substantially more efficient in 
terms of energy use than prior production models and thus  
also provided environmental benefits.
A training academy has recently been introduced at the  
Brush Turbogenerators site in Loughborough, to ensure that 
classroom style facilities are made available to enhance the 
skills of existing employees and to ensure that future apprentices 
can benefit from a structured learning environment. These new 
training facilities are also being used to carry out employee 
training courses in relation to the growing Aftermarket customer 
service team, in order to further improve customer focus. 
Elsewhere within Brush Turbogenerators, the plant in the Czech 
Republic has plans to implement a variety of training initiatives 
during the year, to include opportunities for selected managers 
to study Open University courses, as well as training in relation 
to work related knowledge, leadership and project management.
Various other business units have training and employee 
development initiatives planned for 2011. At Bridon, a new 
‘Bridon Leader’ management development programme is 
underway, designed to enhance leadership skills within the 
business. Other employee initiatives taking place within some  
of the business units include executive team development 
programmes, the roll out of local level employee communication 
surveys, cultural and behavioural change programmes and  
a variety of succession planning initiatives. 
A significant number of employees are members of unions  
and some businesses operate works councils, both of which 
are used for consultation and dissemination of information  
as appropriate.
The Directors have monthly meetings with divisional senior 
management and visit the sites on an ad-hoc basis to 
communicate with the wider Group. Financial results for the  
half year and full year are discussed with the Group’s senior 
management team and Group developments are 
communicated to the businesses as appropriate. Employee 
involvement in and commitment to the Group’s profitability is 
encouraged through appropriate bonus schemes. Business performance Governance Financials Shareholder information
Melrose PLC 33 Annual Report 2010 
The environment
The Directors fully understand the importance of the Group’s 
environmental responsibilities and are committed to ensuring 
that its operations have a minimum adverse effect on  
the environment. Many of the Group’s business units are 
developing environmental policies and procedures in line with 
best practice guidelines, via ongoing improvements to local 
processes to reduce the impact of their activities. A number of 
the business units have achieved, or are currently in the process 
of achieving, the high standards required to obtain ISO 14001 
Environmental Management Systems certification. In addition, 
the UK subsidiaries comply with the UK Packaging Waste 
Regulations and REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation 
and Restriction of Chemicals), as appropriate. 
Although there are no standardised environmental KPIs 
currently used within the Group, each of the business units fully 
understand the importance of monitoring the impact of their 
operations on the environment. A range of KPIs are used as 
environmental measures, including energy consumption, carbon 
dioxide (CO 2) emissions, water consumption, water contamination, 
waste disposal, solid and liquid waste generation, recycling and 
volatile organic compound emissions. Environmental 
performance is measured via the use of KPIs in order that each 
of the business units can plan for year-on-year improvements.
A variety of business units have made substantial capital 
investments during the year with regard to environmental 
initiatives to reduce energy consumption, water usage and 
waste. At Bridon’s Doncaster site, steps have been taken to 
substantially reduce the use of hydrochloric acid as a pickling 
agent by the end of 2012. This in turn will reduce the amount  
of waste created by the cleaning process, as well as preserving 
local water supplies. In conjunction with this strategy, Bridon are 
also investing in a new “triple rinse system” to conserve water 
used to rinse product and recover acid. Other environmental 
initiatives at Bridon include the utilisation of variable speed 
drives on pumps within the effluent plant, which had previously 
operated on a constant full power setting, thus substantially 
reducing the amount of electricity required to operate such 
machinery; this initiative will be further developed during 2011, 
via the introduction of variable speed drives on pumps used 
within Bridon’s bore hole extraction process.
At Truth, investment was made last year in a project to rebuild 
waste water treatment facilities to more efficiently control the 
treatment of waste water and reduce consumption levels.  
Truth also recruited an environmental engineer to further  
build on the ‘best in class’ environmental reputation it has 
established over the past few years.
Within the Brush Turbogenerators factory at Loughborough, 
efforts have been made during the last couple of years to 
reduce the amount of volatile organic compounds (solvent 
emissions) being expelled from the various paint processes.  
The most significant benefits of this initiative have been achieved 
through the increased use of water based paints and lower 
solvent content products.
Each of the business units have made their employees aware  
of the role they play in ensuring the environmental impact of the 
company is kept to a minimum and in safeguarding the future  
of the environment. For example, the Brush Turbogenerators 
plant in the Czech Republic joined the “Green Company” 
project a couple of years ago. This is an initiative designed to 
develop the principles of the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic 
Equipment Directive to set collection, recycling and recovery 
targets for all types of electrical equipment. Activities under this 
scheme were extended last year to include the recycling of 
units already hold ISO 18001 certification, the internationally 
recognised assessment standard for occupational health and 
safety management systems. Both Brush Turbogenerators 
(Loughborough site) and Harris (US) achieved this status during 
the year following rigorous health and safety audits. At Brush 
Turbogenerators, this process also led to a variety of health and 
safety training courses being organised at director and team 
unit manager level, together with the introduction of additional 
refresher courses for activities such as manual handling and 
fork lift truck usage. At Bridon, they have a medium term 
strategy to achieve ISO 18001 international health and safety 
standards for all their sites. 
At Truth’s factory in Minnesota, USA, investment was made to 
replace the salt paint stripping system towards the end of 2009. 
The new system became operational during the early part of 
2010 and resulted in considerable improvements to on-site 
health and safety. The original equipment required regular 
cleaning to remove sludge from the tank. The new system  
has minimal cleaning requirements and therefore substantially 
reduces the health and safety risks associated with this type  
of work.
Divisional managers within each business unit have 
responsibilities to ensure that health and safety remains a key 
focus and to ensure that active procedures and monitoring 
systems are in place to provide substance to written policies. 
Detailed health and safety plans are set by most businesses each 
year to determine annual targets and improvement initiatives. 
All business units have an established Health and Safety 
Committee (“H&S Committee”) structure in place; such 
committees meet on a regular basis and are made up of 
representatives from both management and shop floor level 
personnel. Each of the H&S Committees have wide ranging 
responsibilities which vary from business unit to business unit 
and include the review of reported incidents and the monitoring 
of incident trends. These H&S Committees are also responsible 
for ensuring that corrective measures are implemented when 
accidents occur and that all incidents, whether or not they are 
deemed reportable under local legislation, are given due attention. 
One of the key responsibilities for these H&S Committees is to 
carry out regular tours of the premises in which they work, in 
order to ensure compliance with local policies and procedures. 
These tours also identify potential hazards for which counter 
measures can be identified to prevent accidents from 
happening. Each H&S Committee recommendation is followed 
up at the next committee meeting to ensure that issues are 
resolved. Additionally, operations are audited by the H&S 
Committees at least annually and reports of performance and 
recommended improvements are prepared and circulated to the 
divisional senior management teams. Divisional managers are 
provided with detailed health and safety reports on a frequent 
basis to ensure that such matters are given high visibility and 
that improvements are authorised and implemented quickly. 
Although there are no standardised health and safety KPIs 
currently used across the Group, the business units have 
established KPI measures suitable for use within their  
individual businesses. As a minimum requirement, these KPI 
measurements include monitoring the number of incidents  
and lost time injuries. Going forward, the Company is working 
with each of its business units to develop Group wide health 
and safety KPIs, in order to gain consistency in terms of 
measurement and analysis. Once KPI measurements have  
been agreed each business unit will be given annual reduction 
targets to achieve.  34 Melrose PLC Annual Report 2010 
Directors’ report 
continued
development that occurred in 2010, the associated costs were 
expensed during the year rather than being capitalised, in line 
with the Group’s accounting policies on page 54. The Group  
will continue to invest in research and development that has  
a suitable return.
Corporate social responsibility
The Group recognises that its operations potentially impact a 
wide variety of stakeholders in terms of social, environmental 
and ethical matters, including employees, customers, suppliers 
and local communities. 
Many of the Group’s business units have social and  
ethical policies, with responsibility for communication and 
implementation resting with relevant senior managers.  
Such policies apply and extend to local law and standards  
and as a minimum include equal opportunities and anti-
discrimination policies.
Applications for employment by disabled persons are always 
fully considered by the Group, taking into account job specific 
requirements and applicant aptitude. It is the policy of the Group 
that in recruitment, training, career development and promotion 
the treatment of disabled persons should, as far as possible, be 
identical to that of other employees.
The Group regards employee training and advancement as an 
essential element of industrial relations. Disputes and days lost 
through strike action are negligible. 
The majority of the businesses provided community support 
during the year with efforts ranging from charitable donations to 
voluntary assistance and fund raising. Support is given to local 
schools by offering traineeships and work experience to students. 
The Company will continue to invest in its businesses during its 
ownership, enhancing their reputation within the markets and 
communities in which they operate.
Charitable and political donations
The Group paid £21,550 (2009: £8,757) to UK charities during 
the year, principally to local charities serving the communities  
in which the Group operates. There were no political donations 
made during the year (2009: nil). 
Auditor
Under the Companies (Audit, Investigation and Community 
Enterprise) Act 2004, auditors have the right to access all 
information necessary for the performance of their duties as 
auditor and the duties of Directors in this regard are clarified.
So far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the auditor is unaware and the Directors 
have taken all the steps which they ought to have taken as 
Directors to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is  
aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in 
accordance with the provisions of section 418 of the Companies 
Act 2006.
Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in 
office as auditor. Accordingly, a resolution will be proposed at 
the AGM of the Company to re-appoint Deloitte LLP as auditor 
of the Company and to authorise the Directors to determine 
their remuneration.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and position are 
fluorescent light tubes and to encourage employees to correctly 
dispose of old electrical appliances and batteries. 
Besides the various high profile environmental investments 
commissioned during the year, a variety of small scale local 
initiatives were also introduced. At Bridon’s factory in Doncaster, 
the introduction of movement detectors to control the use of 
lighting in unused areas of the factory has resulted in electricity 
savings each month; this initiative is due to be rolled out in  
other areas of the factory shortly. An analysis at the Brush 
Turbogenerators site in Holland is underway to identify locations 
of high gas and energy consumption within the plant in order to 
set reduction targets.
Looking forward into 2011, various environmental improvement 
initiatives are planned, some of which build on the initiatives 
introduced in 2010. At Bridon’s factory in Doncaster, a feasibility 
study was carried out in partnership with the Carbon Trust last 
year to consider what opportunities may exist in relation to the 
reduction of electricity usage via the process of heat recovery. 
This involves channelling energy created via the various furnaces 
and galvanising systems into steam, which in turn can be used 
for processing heat, thus reducing the need for gas to power 
the factory’s boiler systems; the research process will continue 
through the year. 
In April 2010, the Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy 
Efficiency Scheme (“CRC”), a new mandatory climate change 
and energy saving scheme, was introduced in the UK. CRC is 
part of the UK’s strategy for improving energy efficiency and 
reducing CO2 emissions, as set out in the Climate Change Act 
2008, and requires UK companies to purchase carbon 
allowances based on their energy usage. The Group believes 
that the introduction of the CRC scheme will further complement 
each of the UK business units in striving to reduce their carbon 
footprint and assist in the measurement and ongoing reduction 
of energy usage. The Company has been proactive in preparing 
for both the scheme’s implementation and ongoing compliance. 
As part of this process external consultants have been appointed 
to act as the Group’s CRC advisors. 
A Group registration in the CRC was successfully obtained in 
2010, for those businesses identified as qualifying and requiring 
registration. Several business units were exempt from registration 
because they already had Climate Change Agreements in place.
Environmental liabilities
The Directors seek to ensure that all environmental risks  
are closely managed by external environmental specialists  
in conjunction with internal management. The environmental  
laws of certain jurisdictions impose obligations to remediate 
contaminated sites in relation to sites both currently and 
previously owned by the Group.
The Company Secretary is made aware of all major environmental 
liabilities that may occur within any of the business units; the 
Board are also regularly updated on such matters. All costs 
incurred by the Group with regard to environmental liabilities are 
monitored, with provisions being made as appropriate. 
Research and development
Continuous investment is made within the Group in relation to  
the research and development of new designs, products and 
processes. This helps to ensure that each business unit  
remains at the forefront of technological advances and is able  
to meet the ever-changing demands of its customers. Details  
of some of the new products currently being introduced to  
the market are included within the Chief Executive’s review  
on pages 6 to 18. Due to the nature of the research and  Business performance Governance Financials Shareholder information
Melrose PLC 35 Annual Report 2010 
the Directors consider appropriate to deal with fractions  
and overseas requirements, and otherwise up to a maximum 
nominal value of £49,758, representing approximately  
5 per cent of the Company’s issued Ordinary Share capital  
as at 9 March 2011, which is in accordance with the relevant 
guidelines for the Company.
If approved, the Section 551 authority and the Section 570 
authority will expire at the conclusion of next year’s AGM or, if 
earlier, at the close of business on 30 June 2012. The Directors 
have no present intention of exercising the Section 551 authority 
or the Section 570 authority.
Resolution 10 will seek to renew the authority conferred on the 
Company to purchase its own shares pursuant to sections 693 
and 701 of the Companies Act 2006. This authority is limited to 
an aggregate maximum number of 49,758,677 Ordinary Shares, 
representing approximately 10 per cent of the Company’s 
issued Ordinary Share capital as at 9 March 2011. This power 
will expire at the conclusion of next year’s AGM or, if earlier, at 
the close of business on 30 June 2012. The maximum price 
which may be paid for an Ordinary Share will be an amount 
which is not more than 5 per cent above the average of the 
middle market quotation for an Ordinary Share as derived from 
the London Stock Exchange plc’s Daily Official List for the five 
business days immediately preceding the day on which the 
Ordinary Share is purchased. The Directors have no present 
intention of exercising all or any of the powers conferred by this 
resolution and will only exercise their authority if it is in the 
interests of shareholders generally.
Resolution 11 will seek shareholder approval to allow the 
Company to continue to call general meetings (other than 
AGMs) on 14 clear days’ notice. Changes made to the 
Companies Act 2006 by the Companies (Shareholders’ Rights) 
Regulations 2009 (the “Shareholders’ Rights Regulations”) have 
increased the notice period required for general meetings of the 
Company to 21 days unless shareholders approve a shorter 
notice period (subject to a minimum period of 14 clear days). 
AGMs will continue to be held on at least 21 clear days’ notice.
The approval will be effective until the Company’s next AGM, 
when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed. 
Note that the changes to the Companies Act 2006 mean that, in 
order to be able to call a general meeting on less than 21 clear 
days’ notice, the Company must make a means of electronic 
voting available to all shareholders for that meeting.
Recommendations
The Board believes that each of the resolutions to be  
proposed at the AGM is in the best interests of the Company 
and its shareholders as a whole. Accordingly, the Directors 
unanimously recommend that members vote in favour of all  
of the resolutions proposed, as they intend to do in respect  
of their own beneficial holdings.

set out in the Business reviews on pages 8 to 18. The financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and 
borrowing facilities are described in the Finance Director’s 
review on pages 19 to 25. In addition, notes 19 and 24 to the 
consolidated financial statements include the Group’s policies 
and processes for managing its capital, exposures to liquidity 
risk and financial risk management objectives, as well as  
details of its financial instruments and hedging. Credit risk 
exposure is discussed in notes 16 and 24 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
The Group prepares regular business forecasts and monitors 
projected facility headroom and compliance with its banking 
covenants, which are reviewed by the Board. Forecasts are then 
adjusted for sensitivities which address the principal risks to 
which the Group is exposed, such as fluctuations in exchange 
rates between Sterling and both the US Dollar and the Euro and 
best estimates of the possible impact of the macroeconomic 
environment on the Group’s underlying trading results. 
Consideration is then given to the potential actions available  
to management to mitigate the impact of one or more of  
the sensitivities. 
Taking all this into consideration, the Group should be able  
to operate within the level of its current facility and remain 
covenant compliant for the foreseeable future, being a period  
of at least twelve months from the date of approval of these 
financial statements. 
After making appropriate enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the Annual Report and financial statements.
Annual General Meeting (“AGM”)
The AGM of the Company will be held at Barber-Surgeons’ Hall, 
Monkwell Square, Wood Street, London, EC2Y 5BL at 11.00am 
on 12 May 2011.
Resolutions dealing with the following special business will be 
proposed at the AGM:
Resolution 8 will seek shareholder approval to renew the 
Directors’ authority to allot shares or grant rights to subscribe 
for or convert any securities into shares pursuant to section 551 
of the Companies Act 2006 (the “Section 551 authority”).  
The authority contained in paragraph (A) of the resolution  
will be limited to an aggregate nominal amount of £331,724, 
representing approximately one third of the Company’s issued 
Ordinary Share capital as at 9 March 2011. 
In line with guidance issued by the Association of British Insurers, 
paragraph (B) of this resolution would give the Directors authority 
to allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for or convert any 
securities into shares in connection with a rights issue up to an 
aggregate nominal amount equal to £663,449, representing 
approximately two-thirds of the Company’s issued Ordinary Share 
capital as at 9 March 2011, as reduced by the nominal amount 
of any shares issued under paragraph (A) of this resolution.
The Company does not hold any treasury shares.
Resolution 9 will seek to renew the authority conferred on the 
Board to allot equity securities of the Company (or sell any 
shares which the Company may elect to hold in treasury) for 
cash pursuant to section 570 of the Companies Act 2006 (the 
“Section 570 authority”) without first offering them to existing 
shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings.

good governance. Throughout the year ended 31 December 
2010, the Company has complied with the provisions of Section 
1 of the Combined Code and with the requirements of the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules (“DTR”) on audit committees 
and corporate governance statements. The statements below 
describe how the Company has applied the principles identified 
in the Combined Code and DTR directives. 
The Company is currently reviewing the UK Corporate 
Governance Code in relation to financial years from 1 January 
2011 in light of amendments made to it by the Financial 
Reporting Council during 2010, which will apply to financial  
years beginning on or after 29 June 2010.
The Board
Members: Christopher Miller, Executive Chairman 
 David Roper, Chief Executive 
 Simon Peckham, Chief Operating Officer 
 Geoffrey Martin, Group Finance Director 
 Miles Templeman, Senior non-executive Director 
 Perry Crosthwaite, Non-executive Director 
 John Grant, Non-executive Director
All of the above Directors served throughout the year.
Main responsibilities:
    effectively and properly manage and control the Company 
via a formal schedule of matters reserved for its decision;
   determine and review Company strategy and policy;
    consider acquisitions, disposals and asset requests for major 
capital expenditure;
   review trading performance;
   ensure that adequate funding and personnel are in place;
   maintain sound internal control systems; and
    report to shareholders and give consideration to all other 
significant financial matters.
Board responsibilities are undertaken in conjunction with senior 
management, who in turn are responsible for the day-to-day 
conduct of the Group’s operations and for reporting to the 
Board on items of significance and progress against objectives. 
The Board meets regularly during the year as well as on an 
ad-hoc basis as required by time critical business needs.  
There were four scheduled Board meetings held during the  
year and the attendance of each of the Directors is shown  
on page 38. 
Board balance, independence and performance
The Board believes that the Directors possess diverse business 
experience in areas complementary to the activities of the 
Company. Biographies of the Directors are shown on pages  
26 to 27. These biographies identify any other appointments  
held by the Directors. The only executive Director to hold 
non-executive Director appointments elsewhere is  
Mr Christopher Miller, who is a non-executive Director of TMO 
Renewables Limited and is allowed to retain the remuneration 
he receives from that appointment.
In accordance with the provisions of the Combined Code, 
consideration has been given to the independence of all the 
non-executive Directors and the Board considers all the 
non-executive Directors to be independent. The non-executive 
Directors are not entitled to any bonus or shares under the 2009 
Incentive Share Scheme. Performance of the Board and each 
Committee is evaluated annually. The Chairman has held 
meetings with the Directors, including the senior independent 
non-executive Director, Mr Miles Templeman, to discuss the 
performance of individual executive Directors and the Board as 
a whole. It was considered that the individual Directors and the 
Board as a whole were operating effectively. Directors 
determine whether there are any training requirements, by 
completing an evaluation questionnaire during the year that  
is designed to identify any failures in the performance of the 
Board and each of its Committees. The findings of the 2010 
evaluations were reviewed by the Company Secretary and 
feedback was provided to the Board.
All Directors receive a formal and tailored induction shortly after 
their appointment. Directors are advised that they have access 
to the advice and services of the Company Secretary, Garry 
Barnes, who is responsible for ensuring that Board procedures 
are followed and that applicable rules and regulations are 
complied with. The Board may seek independent legal and 
financial advice in the furtherance of their duties, at the 
Company’s expense. 
A pack of briefing papers and an agenda are provided to each 
Director in advance of each scheduled Board or standing 
Committee meeting. The Directors are able to seek further 
clarification and information on any matter from any other 
Director or employee of the Group whenever necessary. 
Decisions are taken by the Board in conjunction with the 
recommendations of its Committees and advice from external 
consultants, advisors and senior management.
Director terms and conditions
The terms and conditions of the executive Directors’ service 
contracts and the non-executive Directors’ appointments are 
available for inspection at the Company’s registered office.  
The non-executive Directors’ appointment letters are also 
available on the Company’s website: www.melroseplc.net.
Rotation of Directors
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association,  
one third (or the number nearest to but not less than one third) 
of Directors are required to retire and submit themselves for 
re-election at each Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) of the 
Company. It is the policy of the Board that non-executive 
Directors are appointed for an initial term of three years, 
following which their appointment will be reviewed.
The Directors proposed for re-election at the AGM on  
12 May 2011 are Mr Simon Peckham, Mr Perry Crosthwaite  
and Mr Geoffrey Martin. The Board and Nomination Committee 
have carefully considered the time commitments required and 
the contribution made by each Director. Both the Nomination 
Committee and the Board are of the belief that the performance 
of each executive and non-executive Director continues to be 
effective and that each Director demonstrates commitment  
to his role.  Financials Shareholder information

Chairman and Chief Executive
The roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive of the Company 
are, and will remain, separate and distinct from one another in 
accordance with best practice and Board policy.

shareholders together with the other executive Directors.  
The Chief Executive is responsible for strategic direction  
and decisions involving the day-to-day management of the 
Company. These respective responsibilities are set out in writing 
and have been approved by the Board, who consider that the 
respective roles and responsibilities are clearly understood  
by both individuals and by the Board as a whole. 
Committees of the Board
In accordance with the provisions of the Combined Code, the 
Board has three standing Committees: the Audit, Remuneration 
and Nomination Committees. Each of these includes the  
three independent non-executive Directors. The duties of the 
Committees are set out in formal terms of reference. These are

Each member of the Audit Committee brings relevant financial

as described in their biographies on pages 26 and 27.
The Audit Committee invites the Group Finance Director, the 
Head of Financial Reporting and senior representatives of the 
external and internal auditors to attend meetings as appropriate 
to the business being considered. The Audit Committee has the 
right to invite any other employees to attend meetings where 
this is considered appropriate. In addition, the Audit Committee 
meets at least once per year with both the external and internal 
auditors, without management present. 
The Audit Committee is expected to meet not less than three 
times a year and the Audit Committee met three times during 
2010. The attendance of its members, along with the Group 
Finance Director, is shown in the table on page 38.
Group auditor
The Group’s external auditor is recommended for re-
appointment by the Audit Committee who also assess the 
appropriateness of the scope of audit work performed and 
provides recommendations in respect of their remuneration.  
The Audit Committee receives regular reports from the  
Group’s external auditor. 
The Audit Committee has a policy on the engagement of the 
external auditor for the supply of non-audit services and the 
Committee is aware of the audit and non-audit services 
(including taxation and transaction advice) which have been 
provided by Deloitte LLP during 2010. A significant proportion  
of the non-audit services related to non-recurring work, some of 
which was in connection with the provision of tax advisory and 
transaction related services. The provision of non-audit services 
was considered to be appropriate, given the external auditor’s 
depth of knowledge of the affairs and financial practices of the 
Group. The Audit Committee is satisfied that, notwithstanding 
non-audit work, Deloitte LLP has retained objectivity and 
independence during the year. The Audit Committee will 
continue to monitor its policy in this regard and accepts that 
non-audit work should be controlled to ensure that it does not 
compromise the independence of the auditor.
Deloitte LLP was appointed in 2003. At each year end Deloitte 
LLP submits a letter setting out how it believes its independence 
and objectivity have been maintained and they are required to 
rotate the audit partners responsible for the Group and subsidiary 
audits every five years. The Group’s audit signing partner changed 
as part of that rotation process in 2010. There are no contractual 
obligations that restrict the Group’s capacity to recommend  
a particular firm for appointment as auditor. 38 Melrose PLC

Internal control and risk management
Objectives and policy
The objective of the Directors and senior management is to 
safeguard and increase the value of the business and assets  
of the Group. Achievement of this objective requires the 
development of policies and appropriate internal control 
frameworks to ensure the Group’s resources are managed 
properly and any key risks are identified and mitigated  
where possible.
The Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s overall system 
of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness, while the 
role of management is to implement the policies set by the Board 
in respect of risk management and controls. The Directors 
recognise that the systems and processes established by the 
Board are designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives and cannot provide absolute 
assurance against material financial misstatement or loss. 
Internal audit programme
Due to the size and complexity of the Group, it is appropriate  
for an internal audit programme to be used within the business.  
BM Howarth, an external firm provides internal audit services  
to the Group. A rotation programme is in place, such that every 
business unit will have an internal audit at least once every three 
years, with the largest sites reviewed at least once every two 
years. The internal auditors’ remit includes assessment of the 
effectiveness of internal control systems, compliance with the 
Group’s Policies and Procedures Manual and a review of the 
businesses’ Balance Sheets. A report of key findings and 
recommendations is presented to the Group Finance Director, 
Head of Financial Reporting and Group Operations Controller, 
followed by a meeting to discuss key findings and resulting 
action points. The rotation programme allows divisional 
management’s actions and responses to be followed up  
on a timely basis.
Review of the internal audit process and scope of work covered 
by the internal auditor is the responsibility of the Audit Committee, 
to ensure their objectives, level of authority and resources are 
appropriate for the nature of the businesses under review.  
A report of significant findings is presented by the internal 
auditor to the Committee at each meeting and implementation 
of recommendations by the Board is followed up at the 
subsequent Committee meeting.

senior employees are provided with appropriate incentives to 
encourage enhanced performance and that they are rewarded 
for their individual contributions to the success of the Company;
    approve the structure of, and determine targets for, any 
performance related pay schemes operated by the Company 
(including long term incentive plans); and
    annually review remuneration trends across the Group 
and obtain reliable and up to date information about the 
remuneration of Directors and senior employees in  
other companies.
In developing its recommendations, the Committee has given 
due consideration to Schedule 8 of Part 15 of the Companies 
Act 2006.

Business performance Governance
The Board confirms that, from the review of internal controls,  
it has not determined any significant failings or weaknesses that 
it considers require remedial action. The Board also confirms 
that it has not been advised of any material weaknesses in the 
internal control systems that relate to financial reporting.
Whistleblowing and bribery and corruption policies
The Group is currently in the process of revising its bribery and 
corruption policy, in light of the Bribery Act 2010 (“2010 Act”).  
As part of this process, a Group risk assessment is currently 
being carried out to ensure the Company has good systems in 
place to prevent bribery taking place in any areas of its business 
and to ensure full compliance with the 2010 Act. An ongoing 
audit process, together with suitable induction and training 
initiatives are currently being finalised for roll out within each  
of the business units.
The Group’s bribery and corruption policy requires all 
employees to act with honesty, integrity and transparency and 
to conduct themselves in a lawful, ethical and professional 
manner. All employees, agents, consultants, contractors and 
agency workers of Melrose PLC, its subsidiaries and associated 
companies in which it has a majority interest, are forbidden from 
offering or soliciting any bribe, or similar inducement; there is 
also an obligation to report any offer of a bribe or unorthodox 
payment. The Company also encourages application of its 
policy by joint venture partners and suppliers. 
Responsibility for anti-corruption policies and procedures rests 
with the Board of Directors. They are tasked with ensuring that 
adequate internal financial controls and record keeping is in 
place within the Group in order to minimise the risk of bribery 
and corruption.
The Group also has a whistleblowing policy which sits alongside 
the bribery and corruption policy. This is designed to enable 
individuals to make protected disclosures to their divisional 
human resources manager, Group Company Secretary or 
Senior non-executive Director if they have concerns about 
possible improprieties in financial reporting or other 
malpractices within their business.
Communications with shareholders
The Company seeks to build on a mutual understanding  
of objectives with its institutional shareholders, via the  
executive Directors, through regular meetings and presentations 
following announcements of its annual and interim results.  
Miles Templeman, Senior non-executive Director, is available  
to meet institutional shareholders should there be unresolved 
matters they wish to bring to his attention. The views of key 
analysts and major shareholders are fed back to the Board 
directly by individual Directors and via the Company’s brokers, 
ensuring all members of the Board develop an understanding  
of the views of major shareholders. Corporate information is 
available on the Company’s website, www.melroseplc.net. 
The Board welcomes the attendance of shareholders at the 
AGM. The number of proxy votes cast for and against each of the 
resolutions proposed is announced at the AGM and a summary 
will be provided shortly after the AGM, on the Company’s website.
By order of the Board
Garry Barnes 
Secretary 
9 March 2011
The Board is committed to satisfying the internal control 
guidance for Directors set out in the revised version of the 
Turnbull Guidance on Internal Control. In accordance with this 
guidance, there is an ongoing process, regularly reviewed by 
the Directors, for identifying, evaluating, managing and 
mitigating (where possible) the significant risks faced by the 
Group. This process for reviewing the Group’s internal controls 
is consistent with prior years and has been in place throughout 
the 2010 financial year and up to the date of approval of the 
Annual Report.
Managing and controlling risk
The Group has policies which address a number of key 
business risks, including financial, treasury, health and safety 
and environmental risks. The Group’s financial risk management 
objectives and policies are described in the Finance Director’s 
review on pages 19 to 25. Other key risks which could adversely 
affect the Group are described in the Chief Executive’s review 
on pages 6 and 7; Business reviews on pages 8 to 18; and 
Directors’ report on pages 28 to 35. These policies and further 
detailed business unit specific policies are made available to 
employees through manuals and also via specific employee 
briefings and other communications, as appropriate. 
The Group operates on a decentralised basis and the Board 
has established an organisational structure with clear reporting 
procedures, lines of responsibility and delegated authority. 
Divisional senior management, plant managers and financial 
controllers have been delegated responsibility by the Board for 
the establishment and implementation of detailed control 
systems as appropriate for their business. 
An established programme of regular review is in place at the 
businesses and a culture of continuous improvement is 
encouraged by the Board through regular meetings with senior 
management, review of operating performance and progress 
against business plans. The ongoing process of review provides 
assurance that the control environment is operating as intended. 
The Audit Committee also monitors the effectiveness of the 
internal control processes implemented across the Group through 
review of the key findings presented by the external and internal 
auditors and discussions with senior management on an ad-hoc 
basis. The Board is responsible for considering the Audit 
Committee’s recommendations in respect of internal controls and 
risk management and ensuring implementation by management 
of those recommendations it deems appropriate for the business. 
Internal financial controls
The Group has a comprehensive system for assessing the 
effectiveness of the Group’s systems of internal financial 
controls, including strategic business planning and regular 
monitoring and reporting of financial performance. A detailed 
annual budget is prepared by senior management and 
thereafter is reviewed and formally adopted by the Board.  
The budget and other targets are regularly updated via a rolling 
forecast process and regular Business review meetings are  
held involving senior management to assess performance.  
The results of these reviews are in turn reported to and 
discussed by the Board at each meeting.
As discussed in the Audit Committee section on pages 37  
and 38 of this report, BM Howarth is the Group’s internal 
auditor. Nineteen business units have been visited during the 
year and the Directors are pleased to report that there were no 
material deficiencies and that the majority of recommendations 
presented in the internal auditor reports have now been,  
or are in the process of being implemented. A further twenty 
seven business units are planned for review during 2011.  40 Melrose PLC Annual Report 2010 
Remuneration report
The salaries of all executive Directors and the senior 
management team are reviewed by the Remuneration 
Committee prior to the beginning of each year. Base salaries  
for 2010 were reviewed in December 2009. In January 2010, 
each of the executive Directors received an inflationary increase 
of three per cent. Each of the non-executive Directors received 
an increase of £10,000 from January 2010, in order to align 
them with the market rate for such positions.
The executive Directors also receive a company car allowance, 
fuel allowance, private medical insurance, life insurance and 
permanent health insurance cover. Mr Martin also receives paid 
train travel to and from London and accommodation for working 
in London.
Annual bonuses
Bonus scheme arrangements are in place for executive 
Directors and senior management. Annual bonuses are 
awarded to the executive Directors and senior management 
contingent on the achievement of a number of challenging 
objectives, including improvements in operating performance, 
earnings per share (“EPS”), working capital, overhead cost 
control and liability management. The maximum bonus payable 
is 100% of base salary. The Chairman does not participate in 
the annual bonus scheme.
Long term incentives 
Long term incentives are granted to Directors and other senior 
employees in order to promote the success of the Company. 
The long term incentive arrangements currently in place  
are structured to ensure that participants are only rewarded  
for growth in the underlying value of the business in order  
to align the interests of the Directors with those of the 
Company’s shareholders.
During 2010 the Group operated the following long term 
incentive schemes:
   2009 Incentive Share Scheme
   Divisional long term incentive plans
   FKI Cash long term incentive plan 
2009 Incentive Share Scheme
The 2009 Incentive Share Scheme (the “2009 Scheme”)  
was approved by shareholders at a General Meeting held in 
May 2009; it replaced the 2007 Incentive Share Scheme and 
continues to ensure the interests of the executive Directors  
and senior employees are aligned with those of shareholders  
by only rewarding participants if shareholder value is created. 
The executive Directors and five other senior employees are  
the only participants in the 2009 Scheme.
Participants of the 2009 Scheme are entitled to either a  
cash dividend or a number of Ordinary Shares, equal in value  
to 10 per cent of the increase in shareholder value from  
18 July 2007 to 31 May 2012, or earlier upon a takeover of the 
Company (the “trigger date”). The increase in shareholder value 
is calculated as the difference between the market capitalisation 
on the trigger date (determined by reference to the average 
market price of an Ordinary Share over 40 business days prior 
to the trigger date, or the offer price as appropriate) and the net 
invested capital in the Company. The net invested capital is the 
issued share capital at 18 July 2007, plus any amounts paid up 
for the issue of new Ordinary Shares, less all dividend payments 
or other distributions made by the Company in respect of its 
Ordinary Shares, as adjusted in line with the movement in the 
RPI (plus two per cent per annum). 
Introduction and compliance
This report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee 
on behalf of the Board in accordance with the requirements of 
Schedule 8 of Part 15 of the Companies Act 2006 and the 
Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority. A resolution 
inviting shareholders to approve the report will be put to the 
Annual General Meeting on 12 May 2011.

Unaudited information:
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Mr Perry 
Crosthwaite, an independent non-executive Director. Mr Miles 
Templeman and Mr John Grant, the other two independent 
non-executive Directors, complete the Committee.
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are 
posted on the Corporate Governance section of the Company’s 
website (www.melroseplc.net) and are also available from the 
Company Secretary. Page 38 of the Corporate Governance 
report sets out the function of the Remuneration Committee.
Remuneration policy 
The remuneration policy in place for the current and  
subsequent financial years is described below.
Executive Directors and other senior employees
The Board establishes the remuneration policy based on  
the recommendations of the Remuneration Committee.  
The remuneration policy adopted by the Company requires  
the package offered to any executive Director or senior 
employee to be sufficient to attract, retain and motivate 
management of a suitable quality, but not to be more than is 
necessary for this purpose. It is intended that performance 
related pay should comprise a significant proportion of the  
total remuneration package. 
Non-executive Directors
The executive Directors are responsible for proposing the 
non-executive Directors’ fees. In proposing such fees they  
take account of fees paid to non-executive Directors of similar 
sized listed companies within the Company’s listing sector.  
Any decision on fee changes is taken by the executive Directors 
as a whole and non-executive Directors do not take part in 
discussions on their own remuneration. Non-executive Directors 
do not receive other taxable benefits or pension contributions 
from the Group.
The remuneration package 
Remuneration packages are reviewed annually, generally 
effective from 1 January. The Remuneration Committee and its 
advisors use a number of third party remuneration surveys from 
which to obtain remuneration data in order to carry out 
benchmarking exercises.
The remuneration package for all executive Directors comprises 
base salary and benefits, annual bonus, long term incentive 
arrangements and pension contributions as described within 
this report. Some senior employees of the Group are also 
entitled to bonuses and long term incentive arrangements as 
noted below. 
Base salary and benefits
The Remuneration Committee gives consideration to both the 
performance of the individual during the period of review and  
of current market salaries for equivalent roles and is based  
on independently sourced market information.  Financials Shareholder information

There were no options over 2009 Incentive Shares outstanding 
as at 31 December 2010.
The Company’s Articles of Association provide that the 
entitlement may be settled by payment of a cash dividend as  
an alternative to conversion to Ordinary Shares.
As at 31 December 2010 the fair value attributable to the 2009 
Incentive Shares (including those held by the Employee Benefit 
Trust) was calculated as £70.7 million (2009: £21.0 million) of 
which £61.5 million (2009: £18.3 million) was attributable to the 
executive Directors. Details of the Directors’ beneficial interest in 
the 2009 Incentive Shares are shown in the table of Directors’ 
shareholdings later in this report.
The Melrose Employee Benefit Trust currently holds 500 of the 
2009 Incentive Shares and in due course may transfer these 
shares, or grant options over them, to executive Directors and/
or senior employees. 
Divisional long term incentive plans 
Divisional long term incentive plans have been implemented for 
certain divisional senior managers. It is the intention of the 
Board that participants will receive a cash payment upon the 
sale of a division or based upon financial performance as 
measured by growth in operating profit from the date of the FKI 
acquisition on 1 July 2008 to December 2014. 
FKI cash long term incentive plan 
A cash long term incentive plan exists for senior management  
of the FKI businesses; this has in the past operated over rolling 
three year performance periods and was discretionary, based 
on performance targets for the relevant business unit for each  
plan year.
Pension
No Director is a member of any Group pension arrangement. 
The executive Directors may elect to receive a Company 
contribution to their individual pension arrangement, or a 
supplement to base salary in lieu of a pension arrangement. 
Company contributions are calculated on base salary only.
Service contracts 
Consistent with the best practice guidance provided by the 
Combined Code, the Company’s policy is for Directors’ service 
contracts to be terminable on a maximum of one year’s notice. 
Directors’ service contracts do not provide for predetermined 
compensation in the event of termination. Any payments made 
would be subject to normal contractual principles, including 
mitigation as appropriate. The length of service for any one 
executive Director is not defined and is subject to the 
requirements under the rotation rules in the Companies  
Act 2006. 
The non-executive Directors do not have service contracts,  
but have letters of appointment for an initial period of three 
years which may be renewed by mutual agreement. Generally,  
a non-executive Director may be appointed for up to a further  
two periods of three years after the initial three year period  
has expired. The terms of appointment do not contain any 
contractual provisions regarding a notice period or the right  
to receive compensation in the event of early termination. 42 Melrose PLC Annual Report 2010

FTSE Industrial Engineering Index Melrose return FTSE All Share Index
The total shareholder return graph shows the value as at December 2010 of £100 invested in the Company in December 2005, 
compared with £100 invested in the FTSE All Share Index and the FTSE Industrial Engineering Index. These are considered the 
most relevant indices given the Company is part of the FTSE All Share Index and the underlying businesses of the Company 
operate in the industrial engineering sector.
The source data for the above chart assumes that the £220 million of cash returned to shareholders in August 2007, following the 
McKechnie Aerospace and PSM Fasteners disposals, was reinvested to purchase shares in the Company. This results in an 
adjustment factor on the price and this factor is used in ongoing calculations of shareholder return for the Company, as ordinarily  
a return of capital would reduce the share price and an analysis of returns going forward would not reflect value already returned to 
shareholders. The benefit of any cash distribution is thereby reflected within the shareholder return performance of the Company.  Financials Shareholder information

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement 
The Directors confirm that to the best of their knowledge:
   the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair  
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or 
loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
   the Chairman’s statement, Chief Executive’s review, Finance 
Director’s report and Directors’ report include a fair review  
of the development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and the undertakings included in  
the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
By order of the Board
 
Geoffrey Martin Simon Peckham 
Group Finance Director Chief Operating Officer 
9 March 2011 9 March 2011
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation and have chosen to prepare the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law 
the Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for  
that period. 
In preparing the parent Company financial statements,  
the Directors are required to:
   select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
   make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
   state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have 
been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements; and
   prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
   properly select and apply accounting policies;
   present information including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
   provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other 
events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance; and
   make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern. Business performance Governance Financials Shareholder information

Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report  
for the financial year for which the consolidated financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the consolidated 
financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion:
   certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or
   we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
   the Directors’ statement, contained within the Directors’ 
report, in relation to going concern; 
   the part of the Corporate Governance statement relating to 
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 
June 2008 Combined Code specified for our review; and
   certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board 
on Directors’ remuneration.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Company financial 
statements of Melrose PLC for the year ended 31 December 
2010 and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration 
report that is described as having been audited.

for and on behalf of Deloitte LLP
Chartered Accountants and Statutory Auditor 
London, UK 
9 March 2011
Independent auditor’s report to the members  
of Melrose PLC 
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of 
Melrose PLC for the year ended 31 December 2010 which 
comprise the consolidated Income Statement, the consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income, the consolidated 
Statement of Cash Flows, the consolidated Balance Sheet, the 
consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and the related 
notes 1 to 30. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the 
European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members,  
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so 
that we might state to the Company’s members those matters 
we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no 
other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the consolidated financial statements and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit 
and express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards 
for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts  
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free  
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or  
error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and  
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed;  
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates  
made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. 
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the consolidated financial statements:
   give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 
31 December 2010 and of its profit for the year then ended;
   have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union; and
   have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. Business performance Governance Financials Shareholder information

2. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRSs”). The financial statements have also been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs adopted for use in the European Union 
and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared  
on a historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain 
financial instruments which are recognised at fair value. 
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the 
consideration given in exchange for these assets. The principal 
accounting policies adopted are consistent with the prior year 
and are set out below. 
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements include the results of the parent 
undertaking and all of its subsidiary undertakings. The results  
of businesses acquired during the period are included from the 
effective date of acquisition and for those sold during the period 
to the effective date of disposal.
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately 
from the Group’s equity therein. The interest of non-controlling 
shareholders is initially measured at the non-controlling interests 
proportion of the share of the fair value of the acquiree’s 
identifiable net assets. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying 
amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those 
interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ 
share of subsequent changes in equity. Total comprehensive 
income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this 
results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
Where Group accounting policies are not adopted in the 
financial statements of subsidiary undertakings, appropriate 
adjustments are made in the Group financial statements.
All inter-group balances and transactions, including unrealised 
profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been 
eliminated in full.
Going concern
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial 
statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and 
the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing  
the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the 
Directors’ statement of going concern on page 34 and 35  
of the Directors’ report.
Business combinations and goodwill
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the 
purchase method. The cost of acquisition is measured at the 
fair value of assets given, the liabilities incurred or assumed  
at the date of exchange of control and equity instruments  
issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. 
Costs directly attributable to business combinations are 
recognised as an expense in the Income Statement as incurred. 
The acquired identifiable assets and liabilities are measured at 
their fair value at the date of acquisition except those where 
specific guidance is provided by IFRSs. Non-current assets and 
directly attributable liabilities that are classified as held for sale in 
accordance with IFRS 5: “Non-current assets held for sale and 
discontinued operations”, are recognised and measured at fair 
value less costs to sell. Also, deferred tax assets and liabilities  Business performance Governance Financials Shareholder information
Melrose PLC 53 Annual Report 2010 
are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12: 
“Income taxes”, liabilities and assets related to employee benefit 
arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with 
IAS 19: “Employee benefits” and liabilities or equity instruments 
related to the replacement by the Group of an acquiree’s 
share-based payments awards are measured in accordance 
with IFRS 2: “Share-based payments”. Any excess of the cost  
of the acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net 
assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. 
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete 
by the end of the reporting period in which the combination 
occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts where 
appropriate. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during  
the measurement period (see below), or additional assets or 
liabilities recognised, to reflect new information obtained about 
facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date 
that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised at 
that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of 
acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information 
about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition 
date and is subject to a maximum period of one year.
Goodwill on acquisition is initially measured at cost being the 
excess of the cost of the business combination over the 
acquirer’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities. Following initial recognition, 
goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment 
losses. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more 
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying value may be impaired.
As at the acquisition date, any goodwill acquired is allocated  
to each of the cash-generating units acquired. Impairment is 
determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the 
cash-generating unit to which goodwill relates. Where the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than  
the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised in  
the Income Statement and is not subsequently reversed.  
When there is a disposal of a cash-generating unit, goodwill 
relating to the operation disposed of is taken into account in 
determining the gain or loss on disposal of that operation.  
The amount of goodwill allocated to a partial disposal is 
measured on the basis of the relative values of the operation 
disposed of and the operation retained.
Joint ventures
A joint venture is an entity which is not a subsidiary undertaking 
but the interest of the Group is that of a partner in a business 
over which the Group exercises joint control. The results, assets 
and liabilities of joint ventures are accounted for using  
the equity method of accounting.
Revenue
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards  
of ownership of goods have passed to the buyer and can be 
reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the 
consideration received or receivable and represents amounts 
receivable for goods provided in the normal course of business, 
net of discounts, customs duties and sales taxes.
Where percentage of completion accounting is applied and 
where the outcome of a long-term contract can be estimated 
reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the 
stage of completion of the contract activity at the Balance Sheet 
date. This is normally measured by the proportion that contract 
costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated 
total contract costs, except where this would not be 
representative of the stage of completion. Variations in contract 
work, claims and incentive payments are included to the extent 
that they have been agreed with the customer.
Where the outcome of a long-term contract cannot be 
estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent 
of contract costs incurred where it is probable they will be 
recoverable. Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the 
period in which they are incurred.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total 
contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an 
expense immediately. 
Interest income is recognised when it is probable that the 
economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of 
revenue can be measured reliably. Interest income is accrued 
on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and 
the effective interest applicable.
Exceptional costs/income
Exceptional costs/income are those costs/income of a 
significant and non-recurring nature or those associated  
with significant restructuring programmes or acquisitions  
or disposals.
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated after exceptional operating costs  
and income, intangible asset amortisation and the Group’s 
share of results of joint ventures, but before finance income  
and finance costs.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of qualifying assets, which are 
assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get 
ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of 
those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially 
ready for their intended use or sale. 
Investment income earned on the temporary investment  
of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying 
assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible  
for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the Income 
Statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Issue costs of loans
The finance cost recognised in the Income Statement in  
respect of the issue costs of capital instruments is allocated  
to periods over the terms of the instrument using the effective 
interest rate method.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or 
construction cost, and any costs directly attributable to bringing 
the asset into operation. The purchase price or construction 
cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any 
other consideration given to acquire the asset. The capitalised 
value of a finance lease is also included within property, plant 
and equipment.
2. Summary of significant accounting  
policies continued 54 Melrose PLC Annual Report 2010 
Notes to the accounts 
continued
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the 
estimated useful life of the asset as follows:
Freehold land nil
Freehold buildings and long  
leasehold property
 over expected economic  
 life not exceeding 50 years
Short leasehold property over the term of the lease
Plant and equipment 3-12 years
The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment are 
reviewed on an annual basis and, if necessary, changes in 
useful lives are accounted for prospectively.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are 
reviewed for impairment when events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be 
recoverable. If any such indication exists an impairment review 
is performed and, where the carrying values exceed the 
estimated recoverable amount, the assets are written down to 
their recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of property, 
plant and equipment is the greater of net selling price and value 
in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount 
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value 
of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that 
does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the 
recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit 
to which the asset belongs.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon 
disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected  
to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss 
arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the 
difference between the net disposal proceeds or costs and  
the carrying amount of the item) is included in the Income 
Statement in the year that the item is derecognised.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
On acquisition of businesses, separately identifiable  
intangible assets are determined in relation to the specific 
circumstances of the business acquired and are valued  
on an appropriate basis.
Access to the use of patented technology and trade names are 
valued using a “relief from royalty” method which determines the 
net present value of future additional cash flows arising from the 
use of the intangible asset.
Customer relationships are valued on the basis of the net 
present value of the future additional cash flows arising from 
customer relationships with appropriate allowance for attrition  
of customers.
The estimated useful lives of intangible assets are:
Patented technology 5 years or less
Customer relationships 10 years or less
Trade names 20 years or less
Computer software is initially recorded at cost. Where these 
assets have been acquired through a business combination, 
this will be the fair value allocated in the acquisition accounting. 
Where these have been acquired other than through a business 
combination, the initial cost is the aggregate amount paid  
and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire  
the asset.
Computer software assets are amortised over their estimated 
useful lives (up to five years) on a straight-line basis.
Intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, or more 
frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
Impairment losses are measured on a similar basis to property, 
plant and equipment. Useful lives are also examined on an 
annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made  
on a prospective basis.
Research and development costs
Research costs are expensed as incurred.
Costs relating to clearly defined and identifiable development 
projects are capitalised when there is a technical degree of 
exploitation, adequacy of resources and a potential market  
or development possibility in the undertaking that are 
recognisable; and where it is the intention to produce, market  
or execute the project. A correlation must also exist between 
the costs incurred and future benefits and those costs can  
be measured reliably. Capitalised expenses are expensed on  
a straight-line basis over their useful lives. Costs not meeting 
such criteria are expensed as incurred.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Cost includes all direct expenditure and appropriate 
production overhead expenditure incurred in bringing goods  
to their current state under normal operating conditions.  
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less 
costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal. 
Provisions have been made for obsolescence or other  
expected losses where necessary.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables and other receivables are measured and 
carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method, 
less any impairment. The carrying amount of other receivables 
is reduced by the impairment loss directly and a charge is 
recorded in the Income Statement. For trade receivables, the 
carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance 
account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written 
off are credited against the allowance account and changes in 
the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised  
in the Income Statement.
Trade receivables that are assessed not to be impaired 
individually are also assessed for impairment on a collective 
basis. Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of 
receivables could include the Group’s past experience of 
collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed 
payments in the portfolio past the average credit period, as well 
as observable changes in national or local economic conditions 
that correlate with default on receivables. 
2. Summary of significant accounting  
policies continued Business performance Governance Financials Shareholder information
Melrose PLC 55 Annual Report 2010 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the Balance Sheet comprise cash 
in hand and current balances with banks and similar institutions 
and short-term deposits which are readily convertible to cash 
which are subject to insignificant risks of changes in value.
For the purpose of the Cash Flow Statement, cash and cash 
equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined 
above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of 
the consideration received net of issue costs associated with 
the borrowings.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method. Amortised cost is calculated by  
taking into account any issue costs, and any discount or 
premium on settlement.
Gains and losses are recognised in the Income Statement when 
the liabilities are derecognised or impaired, as well as through 
the amortisation process.
Leases
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all  
the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased  
item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value 
of the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum 
lease payments. The corresponding liability to the lessor is 
included in the Balance Sheet as a finance lease obligation. 
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges 
and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant 
rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. 
Finance charges are charged directly against income. 
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter  
of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in  
the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease 
term. Rental income from operating leases is recognised on  
a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Other financial liabilities 
Other financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value,  
net of transaction costs. They are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest 
expense recognised on an effective yield basis. The effective 
interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost  
of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over  
the relevant periods. The effective interest rate is the rate that 
discounts estimated future cash payments throughout the 
expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a 
shorter period to the net carrying amount on initial recognition. 
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when the Group’s 
obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage its 
exposure to interest rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity 
risks, arising from operating and financing activities. The Group 
does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading 
purposes. Details of derivative financial instruments are 
disclosed in note 24 of the financial statements. Movements on 
the hedging reserve in equity are detailed in note 25.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised and stated at fair 
value. Their fair value is recalculated at each reporting date.  
The accounting treatment for the resulting gain or loss will 
depend on whether the derivative meets the criteria to qualify  
for hedge accounting.
Where derivatives do not meet the criteria to qualify for hedge 
accounting, any gains or losses on the revaluation to fair value 
at the period end are recognised immediately in the Income 
Statement. Where derivatives do meet the criteria to qualify for 
hedge accounting, recognition of any resulting gain or loss on 
revaluation depends on the nature of the hedge relationship and 
the item being hedged.
Derivative financial instruments with maturity dates of less than 
one year from the period end date are classified as current in 
the Balance Sheet. 
Hedge accounting
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required 
to document from inception the relationship between the  
item being hedged and the hedging instrument and to show 
that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis.  
This effectiveness testing is performed at each period end  
to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes  
the hedging relationship, the hedge instrument expires or  
is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for  
hedge accounting. 
The Group designates certain hedging instruments, as either 
fair value hedges, cash flow hedges, or hedges of net 
investments in foreign operations.
Fair value hedge
Derivative financial instruments are classified as fair value 
hedges when they hedge the Group’s exposure to changes in 
the fair value of a recognised asset or liability. Changes in the 
fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair 
value hedges are recorded in the Income Statement 
immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the 
hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk. 
Cash flow hedge
Derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow 
hedges when they hedge the Group’s exposure to the variability 
in cash flows that are either attributable to a particular risk 
associated with a recognised asset or liability, or a highly 
probable forecasted cash flow. 
The effective portion of any gain or loss from revaluing the 
derivative financial instrument is recognised in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income and accumulated in equity. The gain or 
loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately 
in the Income Statement. 
2. Summary of significant accounting  
policies continued 56 Melrose PLC
Notes to the accounts 
continued
Annual Report 2010 
Amounts previously recognised in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income and accumulated in equity are recycled 
to the Income Statement in the periods when the hedged item is 
recognised in the Income Statement or the hedged relationship 
is discontinued. However, when the forecast transaction that is 
hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a 
non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously deferred  
in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial 
measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-
financial liability.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations
Derivative financial instruments are classified as net investment 
hedges when they hedge the Group’s net investment in foreign 
operations. The effective element of any foreign exchange  
gain or loss from revaluing the derivative at a reporting period 
end is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
Any ineffective element is recognised immediately in the  
Income Statement.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are recognised 
immediately in the Income Statement when the foreign operation 
is disposed of or the hedged relationship is discontinued.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present 
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is 
probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic 
benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the 
effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are 
determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at  
a rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time 
value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the 
liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision 
due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
Environmental liabilities
Liabilities for environmental costs are recognised when 
environmental assessments or clean-ups are probable and the 
associated costs can be reasonably estimated. Generally, the 
timing of these provisions coincides with the commitment to a 
formal plan of action. The amount recognised is the best 
estimate of the expenditure required. Where the liability will not 
be settled for a number of years, the amount recognised is the 
present value of the estimated future expenditure.
Employee benefits
Wages, salaries, bonuses, social security contributions, paid 
annual leave and sick leave are accrued in the year in which the 
associated services are rendered by employees of the Group. 
The accounting policy for pensions and other retirement 
benefits is described below.
The Group also operates long term incentive plans (LTIPs) for 
certain employees. The expected settlement costs of these 
plans are expensed on a straight-line basis over the life of  
the plans.
Pensions and other retirement benefits
The Group operates defined benefit pension plans and defined 
contribution plans, some of which require contributions to be 
made to administered funds separate from the Group. In some 
jurisdictions, funds are not administered separately from the 
Group but appropriate liabilities are recognised in the  
Balance Sheet.
For the defined benefit pension and retirement benefit plans, 
plan assets are measured at fair value and plan liabilities are 
measured on an actuarial basis, using the projected unit credit 
method and discounted at an interest rate equivalent to the 
current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of 
equivalent currency and term to the plan liabilities. Any assets 
resulting from this calculation are limited to past service cost 
plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in 
future contributions to the plan.
The service cost of providing pension and other retirement 
benefits to employees for the period is charged to the  
Income Statement.
A charge representing the unwinding of the discount on the plan 
liabilities during the period is included within finance costs.
A credit representing the expected return on the plan assets 
during the period is included within finance costs. This credit is 
based on the market value of the plan assets, and expected 
rates of return, at the beginning of the year.
Actuarial gains and losses may result from: differences between 
the expected return and the actual return on plan assets; 
differences between the actuarial assumptions underlying the 
plan liabilities and actual experience during the period; or 
changes in the actuarial assumptions used in the valuation of 
the plan liabilities. Actuarial gains and losses, and taxation 
thereon, are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, 
in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
For defined contribution plans, contributions payable are 
charged to the Income Statement as they fall due as an 
operating expense.
Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group company  
are presented in the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which it operates (its functional currency).  
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements,  
the results and financial position of each Group company are 
expressed in pounds Sterling, which is the functional currency 
of the Company, and the presentation currency for the 
consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual 
companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s 
functional currency (foreign currencies) are recorded at the rates 
of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each 
Balance Sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates 
prevailing on the Balance Sheet date. Non-monetary items 
carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies 
are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair 
value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured 
in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary 
items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included 
in the Income Statement for the period. Exchange differences 
arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair 
value are included in the Income Statement for the period 
except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-
monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are 
recognised directly in equity. For such non-monetary items, any 
exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised 
directly in equity.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, 
the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are 
translated at exchange rates prevailing on the Balance Sheet 
2. Summary of significant accounting  
policies continued Business performance Governance Financials Shareholder information
Melrose PLC 57 Annual Report 2010 
date. Income and expense items are translated at the average 
exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate 
significantly during that period, in which case the exchange 
rates at the date of transactions are used. Exchange differences 
arising, if any, are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income and accumulated in equity (attributed to non-controlling 
interests as appropriate). Such translation differences are 
recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which  
the related operation is disposed of. Any exchange differences 
that have previously been attributed to non-controlling  
interests are derecognised but they are not reclassified  
to the Income Statement.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition  
of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the 
foreign entity and translated at the rate prevailing at the Balance 
Sheet date.
Taxation
The tax expense is based on the taxable profits for the period 
and represents the sum of the tax paid or currently payable and 
deferred tax.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income 
Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that 
are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability 
for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on all 
temporary differences at the Balance Sheet date between the 
tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for 
financial reporting purposes.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences except:
   where the deferred tax liability arises on goodwill that is not 
tax deductible or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in 
a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the 
time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit 
nor taxable profit or loss; and
    where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences 
associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests  
in joint ventures can be controlled and it is probable that  
the temporary differences will not reverse in the  
foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary 
differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax 
losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be 
available against which the deductible temporary differences, 
and carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses 
can be utilised except:
    where the deferred tax asset arises from the initial recognition 
of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business 
combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither 
the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
    in respect of deductible temporary differences associated 
with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, 
deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the 
foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against 
which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
Balance Sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to 
allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates 
that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised 
or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that 
have been enacted or substantially enacted at the relevant 
Balance Sheet date.
Tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised 
in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and not in the 
Income Statement.
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the 
amount of sales tax except:
    where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of goods and 
services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in 
which case the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost  
of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as 
applicable; and
    where receivables and payables are stated with the amount 
of sales tax included.
The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the 
taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables 
in the Balance Sheet.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2: “Share-
based payments”. The Group issues equity-settled share-based 
payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based 
payments are measured at fair value excluding the effect of 
non-market based vesting conditions at the date of grant. The 
fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled 
share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over 
the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that 
will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market 
based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black Scholes pricing 
model. The expected life used in the model has been  
adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the  
effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and 
behavioural considerations.
Non-current assets and businesses held for sale
Non-current assets and businesses classified as held for sale 
are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less 
costs to sell.
Non-current assets and businesses are classified as held  
for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally 
through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. 
This condition is regarded as having been met only when the 
sale is highly probable and the asset or business is available for 
immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be 
committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for 
recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date  
of classification.

policies continued 58 Melrose PLC
Notes to the accounts

Annual Report 2010 
3. Critical accounting judgements and key 
sources of estimation uncertainty
In applying the Group’s accounting policies as set out in note 2, 
management has made critical accounting judgements in the 
quantification of provisions, the impairment of goodwill and 
intangible assets and the valuation of retirement benefit 
obligations, taxation and financial instruments. Due to the 
inherent uncertainty involved in making assumptions and 
estimates, actual outcomes will differ from those assumptions 
and estimates. An analysis of the key sources of estimation 
uncertainty at the Balance Sheet date that have a significant  
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount  
of assets and liabilities within the next financial year is  
provided below.
Provisions
The quantification of certain liabilities within provisions 
(environmental remediation obligations and future legal costs in 
relation to certain claims) have been estimated using the best 
information available. However, such liabilities depend on the 
actions of third parties and on the specific circumstances 
pertaining to each obligation, neither of which is controlled by 
the Group.
Impairment of non-current assets
Goodwill and intangible assets are tested for impairment 
whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying 
amounts might be impaired and at least annually. Such events 
and circumstances include the effects of restructuring initiated 
by management. 
To determine whether goodwill and intangible assets are 
impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the 
cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated. 
The value in use calculation requires management to estimate 
the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-
generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate 
present value. The carrying amount of goodwill and other 
intangible assets at the Balance Sheet date was £1,181.6 million 
(31 December 2009: £1,184.3 million). At 31 December 2010, 
the Group recognised no impairment loss in respect of  
these assets. 
Retirement benefit obligations
In assessing the Group’s obligations relating to retirement 
benefits, management made key assumptions relating to 
current and future mortality, discount rates and inflation.
Taxation
The Group is subject to income tax in most of the jurisdictions  
in which it operates. Management is required to exercise 
judgement in determining the Group’s provision for income 
taxes. Management’s judgement is required in estimating tax 
provisions where additional current tax may become payable in 
the future following the audit by the tax authorities of previously-
filed tax returns. Management’s judgement is also required as to 
whether a deferred tax asset should be recognised based on 
the availability of future taxable profits.
Financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and 
liabilities in the Group’s Balance Sheet measured at their fair 
value at the Balance Sheet date. The fair value of derivatives 
continually changes in response to changes in prevailing market 
conditions. Where permissible under IAS 39, the Group uses 
hedge accounting to mitigate the impact of changes in the fair 
value of derivatives on the Income Statement but the Group’s 
results may be affected by changes in the fair values of 
derivatives where hedge accounting cannot be applied  
or due to hedge ineffectiveness. Business performance Governance Financials Shareholder information

5. Segment information
IFRS 8: “Operating segments” requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components  
of the Group that are regularly reported to the Group’s Board in order to allocate resources to the segments and assess their 
performance. The Group’s reportable operating segments under IFRS 8 are as follows:
 Energy
 Lifting
 Dynacast
 Other Industrial
The Energy segment incorporates the Turbogenerators (now including the Transformers business unit), Marelli and Switchgear 
business units, all specialist suppliers of energy industrial products to the global market. The Lifting segment consists primarily  
of the businesses of Bridon and Crosby, serving oil and gas production, mining, petrochemical, alternative energy and general 
construction markets. The Dynacast segment only includes the Dynacast business, which is a supplier of die-cast parts and 
components to a range of industries. Other Industrial incorporates all other operating businesses. Details of the significant 
companies included within the Other Industrial segment are set out in the Business review on page 16.
There are two central cost centres which are also separately reported to the Board:
 Central – corporate
 Central – LTIPs
(1)
(1) Long Term Incentive Plans.
The Central corporate cost centre contains the Melrose Group head office costs whilst the Central LTIPs cost centre contains  
the costs associated with the 2009 Melrose Incentive Share Scheme and the divisional management LTIP schemes that are in 
operation across the Group.
Transfer prices between business units are set on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
The Group’s geographical segments are determined by the location of the Group’s non-current assets and, for revenue, the 
location of external customers. Inter-segment sales are not material and have not been included in the segment information. 60 Melrose PLC

During the year, the Group entered into a buyout arrangement to dispose of the liabilities of the Bridon Group Senior Executive Plan 
for £4.0 million in excess of the IAS 19 carrying value of plan net liabilities.
On 12 February 2010, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Generator & Motor Services of Pennsylvania, LLC (see note 
12) and, in accordance with IFRS 3 (revised 2008), the £0.2 million of costs incurred on acquisition have been recognised in the 
Income Statement. Also during the year, the Prelok France business, previously shown within the “Other Industrial” division, was 
disposed of. A net loss of £0.2 million was incurred which included disposal expenses of £0.1 million and a cumulative exchange 
gain of £0.1 million recycled from equity.
During the year, the Group incurred £5.9 million of costs relating to restructuring programmes which include the integration of the 
Transformers business into the Turbogenerators business within the Energy division. During 2009, the Group incurred £8.5 million 
of costs relating to restructuring programmes which included plant closures.
During 2009, the Group also incurred £15.4 million of labour related one-off costs, relating primarily to headcount reductions, in 
response to the economic downturn.

During the year, it was announced to members of the FKI UK Pension Plan that it would be closed to the accrual of future benefits 
on 28 February 2011, resulting in a curtailment gain of £13.1 million.
In 2010, a gain of £5.6 million was generated by the commutation of certain insurance policies within the FKI captive  
insurance company.
The net release of provisions of £2.7 million during the year represents the release of a provision set up on the acquisition of FKI net 
of an additional environmental and legal provision (see note 20). In 2009, a review of fair value provisions at the Balance Sheet date 
identified £5.0 million of liabilities in excess of the amount deemed required.
In 2009, certain US retiree benefit plans were closed resulting in a release of the future retirement benefit obligations relating to 
continuing operations of £9.0 million. Business performance Governance Financials Shareholder information

Lifting 299.7 292.6

Other Industrial 38.7 38.0
798.1 779.2
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the 
value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct 
costs during the period. The Group estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to each cash-generating unit. The growth rates are based on a prudent estimate of long term 
industry growth forecasts. Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future 
changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from financial budgets approved by management and extrapolates cash flows 
based on estimated growth rates of between 2% and 3% (2009: 2% and 3%). This rate does not exceed the average long term 
growth rate for the relevant markets. The pre-tax discount rate applied is between 8% and 10% (2009: 7% and 9%) depending on 
the risk elements associated with each cash-generating unit. No impairment was identified and a reasonable possible change in the 
assumptions applied would not result in any impairment. Business performance Governance Financials Shareholder information

The GMS business contributed £7.2 million to revenue and £1.5 million to headline operating profit during the period from 
acquisition to 31 December 2010.
Acquisition costs of £0.2 million have been incurred and these have been expensed as exceptional costs in the Income Statement 
(see note 6).
The goodwill arising on the GMS acquisition is attributable to the anticipated profitability of the incremental distribution of the 
company’s products and expected synergies. 
Acquisition of non-controlling interest
On 20 September 2010, the Group acquired the 20% non-controlling interest of the Bridon Hangzhou Ropes Company Limited 
within the Lifting division for cash consideration of £0.9 million.

The Group utilises a £750 million multi-currency committed bank facility that provides term loan and revolving credit facilities 
through to 22 April 2013. A number of Group companies act as guarantors to this facility. Drawdowns bear interest at interbank 
rates of interest plus a margin determined by reference to the Group’s performance under its debt cover covenant ratio and ranges 
between 1.25% and 2.35%. The margin as at 31 December 2010 was 1.5%.
Throughout the year, the Group remained compliant with all covenants under these facilities. The term loan facility is fully drawn 
down having originally been set at £500 million. In 2009 the Group repaid and cancelled US $80 million of this term loan facility 
following the disposal of the Logistex businesses. At 31 December 2010, the undrawn amount of the £250 million revolving credit 
facility was £234.6 million (31 December 2009: £224.9 million) with £15.4 million (31 December 2009: £25.1 million) being utilised  
for letters of credit.
The interest rate sensitivity analysis, after taking into account hedging interest rate derivatives, is described in note 24.
Maturity of financial liabilities
The maturity profile of anticipated future cash flows including interest in relation to the Group’s non derivative financial liabilities,  
on an undiscounted basis and which, therefore, differs from both the carrying value and fair value is shown in the table below. 
Interest on floating rate debt is based on the relevant LIBOR curve for US Dollar and Sterling balances and EURIBOR curve for  
Euro balances. Interest on hedging interest rate swaps is based on the relevant forward LIBOR curve for US Dollar amounts and 
EURIBOR curve for Euro and is illustrated as a net cash flow.

As at 31 December 2010, the Group has gross unused losses of £251.7 million (31 December 2009: £251.4 million) available for 
offset against future profits, none of which have been recognised within the Balance Sheet due to the divisional and geographic 
split of anticipated future profit streams (31 December 2009: recognised asset £3.8 million). These losses may be carried forward 
indefinitely subject to certain continuity of business requirements. An asset of £33.0 million (31 December 2009: £18.3 million) has 
been recognised in respect of other timing differences.
A significant part of the retirement benefit obligations recognised in the Group accounts relates to the McKechnie UK Pension Plan, 
the FKI UK Pension Plan and the FKI US Pension Plan. A deferred tax asset of £12.9 million (31 December 2009: £7.4 million) has 
been recognised on these obligations to the extent that they are expected to generate tax deductions against foreseeable profits.
As at 31 December 2010, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries  
for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was £4.5 million (31 December 2009: £4.0 million). No liability has been 
recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
22. Share-based payments
Melrose 2009 Incentive Share Scheme
The Company has 50,000 2009 Incentive Shares held by Directors, employees and the Melrose PLC Employee Benefit Trust.  
Further details of the scheme are provided in the Remuneration report on pages 40 and 41.
The estimated fair value attributable to the 2009 Incentive Shares (formerly the 2007 Incentive Shares) using a Black Scholes option 
pricing model at 31 December 2010 was £70.7 million (31 December 2009: £21.0 million). 
The inputs into the Black Scholes model used to fair value the Scheme when it was originally established in 2007 were as follows:
 Valuation  
 assumptions
Weighted average share price £1.67
Weighted average exercise price £1.00
Expected volatility 25.0%
Expected life as at inception 4.8yrs
Risk free interest 2.0%
Expected dividend yield 3.2%
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s share price. 
The Group recognised an IFRS 2 accrual of £1.8 million (2009: £1.8 million) in relation to the Melrose 2009 Incentive Share Scheme  
in 2010.  76 Melrose PLC

Melrose holds several pension plans covering many of its employees and operating in several jurisdictions.
The most significant defined benefit plans are:
  The FKI UK Pension Plan. This is defined benefit in type and is a funded plan where the future liabilities for members’ benefits are 
provided for by the accumulation of assets held externally to the Group in separate trustee administered funds.
   The McKechnie UK Pension Plan. This is defined benefit in type and is a funded plan (other than £3.3 million of unfunded 
liabilities) where the future liabilities for members’ benefits are provided for by the accumulation of assets held externally to  
the Group in separate trustee administered funds.
  The FKI US Pension Plan. This is defined benefit in type and is a funded plan where the future liabilities for members’ benefits 
are provided for by the accumulation of assets held externally to the Group in separate trustee administered funds.
Other plans include the Cleco (Logistex UK) Plan, the Dynacast US defined benefit plan and a number of funded and unfunded 
defined benefit arrangements across Europe.
Further details of the status of the significant plans are disclosed in the Directors’ report on page 32.
The cost of these plans is determined in accordance with IAS 19 with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries 
on the basis of formal actuarial valuations using the projected unit credit method. In line with normal practice, these valuations are 
undertaken triennially in the UK and annually in the US.
The valuations are based on the UK full actuarial valuations as of 31 December 2008 updated at 31 December 2010 by independent 
actuaries and US full actuarial valuations as of 1 January 2010 updated at 31 December 2010 by independent actuaries.
The Group also operates unfunded retiree medical and welfare benefit plans, principally in the US. 
During the year, it was announced to members that the FKI UK Pension Plan would be closed to the accrual of future benefit as of 
28 February 2011 resulting in a curtailment gain of £13.1 million.
The Group also entered into a buyout arrangement to dispose of the liabilities of the Bridon Group Senior Executive Plan, formerly 
part of the FKI UK Pension Plans, for £4.0 million in excess of the carrying value of the plan net liabilities. 
The Company contributes £18.5 million per annum to the FKI UK Pension Plan and £4.6 million per annum to the McKechnie UK 
Pension Plan.
In addition to this, there are a number of defined contribution plans across the Group. Contributions during the year were  
£14.4 million (2009: £15.1 million).

In addition to this, for certain deferred members, it has been determined that inflation will be based upon the Consumer Price  
Index (“CPI”) rather than the Retail Price Index (“RPI”). This results in an inflation rate 0.85% lower than RPI for those members.  
The resulting reduction in the present value of plan liabilities of £12.3 million is included in the Consolidated Statement of  
Comprehensive Income. Business performance Governance Financials Shareholder information

Mortality
FKI UK Pension Plan 
Mortality assumptions for the most significant plan in the Group, the FKI UK Pension Plan, as at 31 December 2010 are based on 
90% of the “heavy” Self Administered Pension Scheme (SAPS) tables, reflecting the plan membership being largely employed in the 
industrial sector. Future improvements are in line with 80% (60% for women) of the Long Cohort, subject to a minimum underpin  
of 1% p.a.
The assumptions are that a member currently aged 65 will live on average for a further 20.2 years if they are male and for a  
further 23.6 years if they are female. For a member who retires in 2035 at age 65, the assumptions are that they will live for a  
further 22.7 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 25.9 years after retirement if they are female.
The mortality assumptions are in line with those adopted for the triennial valuation results as at 31 December 2008.
Sensitivities
Sensitivities around movements in the principal assumptions of the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality are discussed in the 
Finance Director’s review on page 23.

The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and short-term deposits, trade receivables and derivative financial assets which 
represent the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Group’s credit risk on cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counter-parties are 
banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies. The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its 
trade receivables. The amounts presented in the Balance Sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the 
Group’s management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment. Note 16 provides 
further details regarding the recovery of trade receivables.

Interest rate risk management
The Group’s policy for managing interest rate risk is set out in the Finance Director’s review.
In January 2009, the Group entered into a number of interest rate swaps to hedge $546.0 million of US Dollar denominated bank 
debt into fixed rates of interest. Under the terms of these swaps the Group will pay an average rate of 2.1% p.a. plus a 2.0% margin 
annually in arrears and receive 3 month US Dollar LIBOR plus 2.0% quarterly in arrears. These swaps all mature in January 2013. 
In April 2009, the Group also took out an interest rate swap to hedge €33.3 million of Euro denominated debt into fixed rates of 
interest. The swap is structured in a similar way to the US Dollar interest rate swaps with the Group paying 2.6% plus a 2.0% margin 
annually in arrears and receiving 3 month EURIBOR plus 2.0% quarterly in arrears. This swap matures in April 2013. 
A corresponding amount of debt drawn under the £500 million term loan is matched with these swaps.
These interest rate swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges and were highly effective throughout 2010. The fair value  
of the contracts at 31 December 2010 was a net liability of £10.0 million (31 December 2009: net asset of £0.8 million).

Melrose PLC 83 Annual Report 2010 
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
Currency risks are defined by IFRS 7 as the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial asset or liability will fluctuate 
because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
The following table details the transactional impact of hypothetical changes in foreign exchange rates on financial assets and 
liabilities at the Balance Sheet date, illustrating the increase in Group operating profit caused by a 10 cent strengthening of the US 
Dollar and Euro against Sterling and a 10% strengthening of the Czech Koruna against Sterling compared to the year end spot rate. 
The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular other foreign currency exchange rates, remain constant. The Group 
operates in a range of different currencies, and those with a material impact are noted here:

The following table details the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign exchange rates on financial assets and liabilities at the 
Balance Sheet date, illustrating the (decrease)/increase in Group equity caused by a 10 cent strengthening of the US Dollar and 
Euro against Sterling and a 10% strengthening of the Czech Koruna against Sterling. The analysis assumes that all other variables, 
in particular other foreign currency exchange rates, remain constant. The Group operates in a range of different currencies, and 
those with a material impact are noted here:

 £m
 31 December 
 2009 
 £m
US Dollar (1.6) (0.4)
Euro 0.4 (0.5)
Czech Koruna (0.1) 0.1 
In addition, the change in equity due to a 10 cent strengthening of the US Dollar and Euro against Sterling for the translation of net 
investment hedging instruments would be a decrease of £26.6 million and £4.7 million respectively. However, there would be no 
effect on equity because there would be an offset in the currency translation of the foreign operation.
Fair value measurements recognised in the Balance Sheet 
Foreign currency forward contract fair values are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from 
quoted interest rates matching the maturities of the contracts.
Commodity swap fair values are measured using quoted forward commodity prices.
Interest rate swap contract fair values are measured using yield curves derived from quoted interest rates. The fair value is

The fair value of these are derived from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
(i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) and they therefore are categorised within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy set 
out in IFRS 7.

Since 31 December 2010 the Group has disposed of three of the smaller businesses, namely Brush Traction, Logistex UK and 
Madico generating aggregated sales proceeds of £20.7 million.
30. Contingent liabilities
Two Bridon companies that the Group acquired as part of the acquisition of FKI plc are defendants with their American distributor 
in an action in the US federal court in Houston, Texas, commenced by Noble Drilling Services, Inc., a purchaser of wire anchor lines 
that were manufactured by Bridon (prior to its acquisition by the Group), sold by its distributor and used by Noble to moor certain of 
its mobile, semisubmersible offshore drilling rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. Noble has claimed approximately US $94 million in damages 
plus loss of goodwill, alleging that certain ropes were defective and broke during Hurricane Ike in 2008. No adequate breakdown  
of Noble’s claim has been provided to date. In a separate case pending in the same court, the lessee of the same offshore drilling 
rigs, Anadarko Petroleum Corp. has sued Noble for approximately US $24 million in damages plus removal of debris, claiming that 
the rigs were unseaworthy in breach of the terms of its agreement with Noble to operate the rigs. Noble in turn has asserted 
identical claims to those asserted in the first action, alleging that if Noble is found liable to Anadarko, Bridon and its distributor 
should be liable for any damages that Noble suffers.
The two cases were recently consolidated and remain in the earliest procedural stages as the discovery process has just 
commenced. Accordingly, it is too early in the case to assess the merits of Noble’s claims. Bridon has insurance coverage of up  
to US $160 million (at current exchange rates) that may be available to respond and Bridon’s insurers have been indemnifying its 
defence costs to date. Bridon intends to vigorously defend against the claims asserted against it. Since 2008, Bridon has  
provided US $7.5 million in respect of this claim.
In addition, as a result of the acquisition of the Dynacast, McKechnie and FKI businesses, certain further contingent legal, 
environmental and tax liabilities were identified. Whilst it is difficult to reasonably estimate the ultimate outcome of these claims,  
the Directors’ best estimate of the outcome of these claims has been included in the Balance Sheet.
The Group has contingent liabilities representing guarantees and contract bonds given in the ordinary course of business  
on behalf of trading subsidiaries. No losses are anticipated to arise on these contingent liabilities. 88 Melrose PLC Annual Report 2010

Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’

Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free  
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies 
are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances and have  
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Company financial statements:
  give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs 
as at 31 December 2010;
  have been properly prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements 
of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the

In our opinion:
  the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
  the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial 
year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the Company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if,  
in our opinion:
  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
  the Company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
  certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or
  we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.

We have reported separately on the Group financial statements 
of Melrose PLC for the year ended 31 December 2010.

Notes to the Company Balance Sheet
1. Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting 
The separate financial statements of the Company are 
presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. They have 
been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for 
the revaluation of certain financial instruments which are 
recognised at fair value, and in accordance with applicable 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice  
(“UK GAAP”) and law.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below.  
They have all been applied consistently throughout the year  
and the preceding year. 
Going concern
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial 
statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for  
the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. 
Further detail is contained in the Directors’ statement of going 
concern on page 34 and 35 of the Directors’ report.
Investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less 
provision for impairment.
For investments in subsidiaries acquired for consideration, 
including the issue of shares qualifying for merger relief, cost  
is measured at the fair value of the consideration paid.  
Any premium is ignored.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, 
including direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals 
basis in the Profit and Loss Account using the effective interest 
rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the 
investment to the extent that they are not settled in the period  
in which they arise.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any impairment in value. The initial cost of  
an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost,  
and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into 
operation. The purchase price or construction cost is the 
aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other 
consideration given to acquire the asset. 
Depreciation of fixtures and fittings is calculated on a straight-
line basis over the useful economic life of the assets being three 
to twelve years. The estimated useful lives are reviewed on an 
annual basis and, if necessary, changes in useful lives are 
accounted for prospectively.
A tangible fixed asset is derecognised upon disposal or when 
no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the 
continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on 
derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between 
the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item) 
is included in the Profit and Loss Account in the year the item  
is derecognised.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the Balance Sheet comprise cash 
in hand and current balances with banks and similar institutions 
and short-term deposits which are readily convertible to cash 
and are subject to insignificant risks of changes in value.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised in the 
Balance Sheet at cost and subsequently remeasured to their 
fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss is 
dependent on whether the derivative contract is designed to 
hedge a specific risk and qualifies for hedge accounting. On the 
date a derivative contract is entered into, the Company 
designates derivatives which qualify as hedges for accounting 
purposes as either a) a hedge of the fair value of a recognised 
asset or liability (fair value hedge), or b) a hedge of a forecast 
transaction or firm commitment (cash flow hedge) or c) a hedge 
of a net investment in a foreign operation.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives which are fair value 
hedges and that are highly effective are recognised in the Profit 
and Loss Account, along with any changes in the fair value of 
the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged 
risk. Changes in the fair value of derivatives in cash flow hedges 
are recognised in equity. Where the forecasted transaction or 
firm commitment results in the recognition of an asset or liability, 
the gains and losses previously included in equity are included 
in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. Otherwise, 
amounts recorded in equity are transferred to the Profit and 
Loss Account and classified as revenue or expense in the same 
period in which the forecasted transaction affects the Profit and 
Loss Account.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted 
for similarly to cash flow hedges. The Company hedges certain 
net investments in foreign operations with foreign currency 
borrowings. All foreign exchange gains or losses arising on 
translation are recognised in equity and included in cumulative 
translation differences and are recycled through the Profit and 
Loss Account upon derecognition of the hedged item.
Certain derivative instruments, while providing effective 
economic hedges under the Company’s policies, do not  
qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of any 
derivative instruments that do not qualify for cash flow hedge 
accounting are recognised immediately in the Profit and  
Loss Account. Business performance Governance Financials Shareholder information
Melrose PLC 91 Annual Report 2010 
1. Significant accounting policies continued
Share-based payments
The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20: 
“Share-based payments”. The Company issues equity-settled 
share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled 
share-based payments are measured at fair value (excluding the 
effect of non-market based vesting conditions) at the date of 
grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the 
equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the 
Company’s estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and 
adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black Scholes pricing 
model. The expected life used in the model has been  
adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the  
effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and 
behavioural considerations.
Cash Flow Statement
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption from 
preparing a Cash Flow Statement under the terms of FRS 1 
(Revised): “Cash Flow Statements” because it prepares a 
consolidated cash flow statement which is shown on page  
49 of the Group financial statements.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is 
provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using 
the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences 
that have originated but not reversed at the Balance Sheet date 
where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay 
more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have 
occurred at the Balance Sheet date. Timing differences are 
differences between the Company’s taxable profits and its 
results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the 
inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods 
different from those in which they are recognised in the  
financial statements.
Foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are 
translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year 
end or, if hedged, at the forward contract rate. Transactions in 
foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the exchange 
rates ruling at the dates of the transactions or, if hedged, at the 
forward contract rate. Profits and losses on exchange arising in 
the normal course of trading and realised exchange differences 
arising on the conversion of foreign currency assets and 
liabilities are recognised within the Profit and Loss Account. 
2. Profit for the year
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the 
Company has elected not to present its own Profit and Loss 
Account for the year. Melrose PLC reported a profit for the 
financial year ended 31 December 2010 of £519.7 million (2009: 
£32.9 million). The Company paid a dividend of £43.8 million 
(2009: £35.6 million) during the year.
The Company has unused tax losses of approximately  
£19.7 million (31 December 2009: £20.2 million) available to 
carry forward and offset against future profits. No deferred tax 
asset has been recognised in respect of these losses due  
to uncertainty over future taxable profits arising in the 
foreseeable future. 
The estimated value of the deferred tax asset not  
recognised at 27% (31 December 2009: 28%) is £5.3 million  
(31 December 2009: £5.6 million).
The auditor’s remuneration for audit services to the Company is 
disclosed in note 7 to the Group consolidated financial statements. 92 Melrose PLC

Notes
1.  The holders of Ordinary Shares and 2009 Incentive Shares 
in the Company are entitled to attend the Annual General 
Meeting, but only holders of Ordinary Shares are entitled to 
vote. A member entitled to attend and vote may appoint a 
proxy to exercise all or any of its rights to attend, speak and 
vote at a general meeting of the Company. Such a member 
may appoint more than one proxy, provided that each proxy 
is appointed to exercise the rights attached to different 
shares. A proxy need not be a member of the Company.
2.  A form of proxy is enclosed with this notice. To be effective, 
a form of proxy must be completed and returned, together 
with any power of attorney or authority under which it is 
completed or a certified copy of such power or authority, so 
that it is received by the Company’s registrars at the address 
specified on the form of proxy not less than 48 hours 
(excluding any part of a day that is not a working day) before 
the time for holding the meeting. Returning a completed 
form of proxy will not preclude a member from attending the 
meeting and voting in person. 
3.  Any person to whom this notice is sent who is a person 
nominated under section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 
(the “Act”) to enjoy information rights (a “Nominated Person”) 
may, under an agreement between him and the shareholder 
by whom he was nominated, have a right to be appointed 
(or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy for the 
Annual General Meeting. If a Nominated Person has no such 
proxy appointment right or does not wish to exercise it, he 
may, under any such agreement, have a right to give 
instructions to the shareholder as to the exercise of voting 
rights. The statement of the rights of shareholders in relation 
to the appointment of proxies in paragraphs 1 and 2 above 
does not apply to Nominated Persons. The rights described 
in paragraphs 1 and 2 can only be exercised by shareholders 
of the Company.
4.  To be entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General 
Meeting (and for the purposes of the determination by the 
Company of the number of votes they may cast), members 
must be entered on the Company’s register of members by 
6.00 pm on 10 May 2011 (or, in the event of an adjournment, 
on the date which is two days before the time of the 
adjourned meeting). Changes to entries on the register of 
members after this time shall be disregarded in determining 
the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.
5.  As at 4 April 2011 (being the last business day prior to the 
publication of this notice) the Company’s issued share 
capital consists of 497,586,779 Ordinary Shares, carrying 
one vote each, and 50,000 2009 Incentive Shares, which do 
not carry votes. Therefore, the total voting rights in the 
Company as at 4 April 2011 are 497,586,779.
6.  CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies 
through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service 
may do so by using the procedures described in the CREST 
Manual. CREST Personal Members or other CREST 
sponsored members, and those CREST members who have 
appointed a service provider(s), should refer to their CREST 
sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to 
take the appropriate action on their behalf. Business performance Governance
Melrose PLC 99 Annual Report 2010 
Financials Shareholder information
7.  In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using 
the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST 
message (a “CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be properly 
authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland 
Limited’s specifications, and must contain the information 
required for such instruction, as described in the CREST 
Manual (available via www.euroclear.com/CREST).  
The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the 
appointment of a proxy or is an amendment to the 
instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must,  
in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by 
the issuer’s agent (ID RA19) by 11.00am on 10 May 2011.  
For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the 
time (as determined by the time stamp applied to the 
message by the CREST Application Host) from which the 
issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to 
CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time 
any change of instructions to proxies appointed through 
CREST should be communicated to the appointee through 
other means.
8.  CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST 
sponsors, or voting service providers should note that 
Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited does not make available 
special procedures in CREST for any particular message. 
Normal system timings and limitations will, therefore, apply 
in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the 
responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take  
(or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member,  
or sponsored member, or has appointed a voting service 
provider, to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting 
service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary 
to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the 
CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, 
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST 
sponsors or voting system providers are referred, in 
particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual 
concerning practical limitations of the CREST system  
and timings.
9.  The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy 
Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)
(a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
10.  Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or 
more corporate representatives who may exercise on its 
behalf all of its powers as a member provided that they do 
not do so in relation to the same shares.
11.  Under section 527 of the Act members meeting the 
threshold requirements set out in that section have the right 
to require the Company to publish on a website a statement 
setting out any matter relating to: (i) the audit of the 
Company’s accounts (including the auditor’s report and the 
conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the Annual 
General Meeting; or (ii) any circumstance connected with an 
auditor of the Company ceasing to hold office since the 
previous meeting at which annual accounts and reports 
were laid in accordance with section 437 of the Act. The 
Company may not require the shareholders requesting any 
such website publication to pay its expenses in complying 
with sections 527 or 528 of the Act. Where the Company is 
required to place a statement on a website under section 
527 of the Act, it must forward the statement to the 
Company’s auditor not later than the time when it makes the 
statement available on the website. The business which may 
be dealt with at the Annual General Meeting includes any 
statement that the Company has been required under 
section 527 of the Act to publish on a website.
12.  Any member attending the meeting has the right to ask 
questions. The Company must cause to be answered any 
such question relating to the business being dealt with at the 
meeting but no such answer need be given if (a) to do so 
would interfere unduly with the preparation for the meeting 
or involve the disclosure of confidential information, (b) the 
answer has already been given on a website in the form of 
an answer to a question, or (c) it is undesirable in the 
interests of the Company or the good order of the meeting 
that the question be answered.
13.  A copy of this notice, and other information required  
by section 311A of the Act, can be found at  
www.melroseplc.net.
14.  You may not use an electronic address provided in either 
this Notice of Annual General Meeting or any related 
documents (including the Proxy Form) to communicate  
with the Company for any purposes other than those 
expressly stated.
15.  The following documents will be available for inspection at 
the Company’s registered office during normal business 
hours (Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays excepted) 
from the date of this notice until the date of the Annual 
General Meeting and at the place of the Annual General 
Meeting for 15 minutes prior to and during the meeting:
 (A)  copies of all service agreements under which Directors 
of the Company are employed by the Company or any 
subsidiaries; and
 (B)  a copy of the terms of appointment of the non-executive 
Directors of the Company.  100 Melrose PLC Annual Report 2010

“   These are excellent results from businesses  
well positioned to enjoy superior growth in the 
years to come. We are proud of the fact that 
overall group profits have not declined through 
this sharp recession and at the current share 
price Melrose has created over £1 billion of 
shareholder value since flotation in 2003.
  We are considering the sale of Dynacast and 
looking for our next acquisition but will only 
proceed if we believe it creates shareholder 
value. Looking ahead, we are confident of  
further progress in 2011 and beyond.”

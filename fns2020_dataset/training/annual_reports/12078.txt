Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 05 Chairman’s  
statement
2012 was another good year for Petrofac. Despite the marketplace 
remaining competitive, we continued to grow, increasing revenue by 
9% to US$6,324 million and earnings by 17% to US$632 million.
Marketplace
Despite the continuing global economic 
uncertainty, demand for energy has remained 
strong. More importantly, we expect to 
see growth in demand for energy, including 
oil and gas, over the very long term. 
Coupled with the natural decline in existing oil 
and gas production, this creates a need for 
large-scale investment in oil and gas 
infrastructure. This should ensure demand 
for our services remains strong. We also see 
strong industry demand for commercially 
innovative, integrated oilﬁeld services, 
which are helping to build long-term 
sustainable earnings for the Group.
Dividends
The Company proposes a ﬁnal dividend of 
43.00 cents per share for the year ended 
31 December 2012 (2011: 37.20 cents), 
which, if approved, will be paid to 
shareholders on 24 May 2013 provided 
they were on the register on 19 April 2013. 
Shareholders who have not elected 
(by 26 February 2013) to receive dividends 
in US dollars will receive a sterling equivalent 
of 28.40 pence per share.
Together with the interim dividend of 
21.00 cents per share (2011: 17.40 cents), 
equivalent to 13.45 pence, this gives a total 
dividend for the year of 64.00 cents per share 
(2011: 54.60 cents), an increase of 17%, 
in line with the increase in net proﬁt.
From strategy to delivery
Petrofac is in business for the long term. 
As well as having the exacting medium-term 
aim of more than doubling recurring 2010 
Group earnings by 2015
1
, we aspire to 
be the world’s most admired oilﬁeld 
service company.
While we will continue to build on our existing 
strengths, we aim to deliver on our strategy 
across three key areas: geographical 
expansion, broadening our offshore capability 
and implementing our IES strategy. We are 
expanding to new markets such as Mexico, 
where we now have four long-term contracts. 
We have made good progress with our 
offshore strategy, where we are looking to 
build a differentiated offshore business that 
will give access to top tier projects.
1
  Our Group earnings target is net proﬁt after tax 
of more than US$862 million by 2015, at least 
a doubling of 2010 recurring earnings.
Overview
Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 06 We have achieved signiﬁcant milestones on 
our portfolio of Integrated Energy Services 
projects, which are building long-term 
sustainable earnings for the Group.
To be able to deliver our strategy we face 
various challenges. We particularly want 
to protect and improve our execution 
capabilities and we need to keep building 
our overall resource. The Fit for 2015 
programme, which was launched in 2012 
is designed to improve all our existing 
processes with a view to helping us work 
smarter and better. This year we continued to 
improve our capability but we still need to 
recruit a substantial number of people over 
the next ﬁve years if we are to keep growing 
the business in line with our plans. 
Notwithstanding the scale of the task, 
I am conﬁdent that we will be able to do this 
as the Group has been building its Human 
Resources capability over a number of years. 
Given the large number of people who will 
be joining our Group, it is essential that we 
continue to promote Petrofac’s long-standing 
values in order to preserve what makes the 
Group unique.
Our Board
The Governance report on pages 64 to 87 
explains what the Board did during 2012 but 
I would like to highlight two areas of Board 
focus: our risk management framework and 
capability building.
Our Board Risk Committee has continued to 
strengthen our risk management framework. 
It identiﬁed 13 areas of risk which would 
threaten the overall health of the Group 
including delivery of our strategic goals. 
We have developed a number of metrics 
for each of these areas, which we will 
monitor. We intend to build on this work in 
2013 and will continue to develop our key 
enterprise risk proﬁle. 
Following a recent period of Board change, 
our Nominations Committee has been able 
to spend more time reviewing executive 
succession planning this year. We intend to 
continue concentrating on this vital area next 
year. In addition the Board has devoted 
considerable time to reviewing our 
Human Resources strategy and has been 
much encouraged. Over the last few years 
there have been a number of initiatives 
introduced relating to retention, recruitment, 
performance management and capability 
mapping. These will be essential for delivery 
of the necessary capability.
At the start of 2012, we welcomed Marwan 
Chedid and René Médori to the Board. 
Marwan is our Chief Executive of Engineering, 
Construction, Operations & Maintenance 
and René joined as a Non-executive Director 
becoming a member of our Audit, Board 
Risk and Nominations Committees. 
These appointments complete a period 
of change over the last two years. Our broad 
mix of skills, experience and nationalities 
mean that there is little danger of ‘group 
think’. Our discussions are informed, honest 
and vigorous. Once we have agreed on a 
course of action, we all align ﬁrmly behind it. 
Setting the tone
It is essential that we promote our values if 
Petrofac is to maintain its distinctive culture. 
The Board should lead by example and 
be seen to be safe, ethical, innovative, 
responsive, quality and cost conscious, 
and driven to deliver.
In considering how the Board espouses 
Company values, two particular occasions 
this year come to mind: our annual 
safety conference and Petrofac’s EVE 
Awards ceremony:
 safety is one of our most important 
values, as beﬁts our potentially hazardous 
industry. The attendance of our Executive 
Directors at the safety conference in April 
was a clear demonstration of the emphasis 
we place on safety. Lord Cullen of 
Whitekirk, who led the 1990 public inquiry 
into the Piper Alpha oil rig disaster, was our 
keynote speaker 
 our internal recognition programme, 
the EVE Awards, stand for Excellence, 
Values and Energy and honour the 
employees who best embody our values. 
The 2012 awards presentation was held 
at our Leadership Conference in November, 
attended by our 100 top leaders. I was 
delighted to present this year’s ethical 
behaviour award. It was clear how much 
the awards, and the high proﬁle given to 
them, meant to the winners
Our people
The Board makes a point of getting out 
into the business. Meeting customers and 
employees is always a highlight of such 
visits. I continue to be struck by the 
capabilities and positive, problem-solving 
attitude of our people. They are quite 
exceptional at identifying customer needs 
and delivering the right solutions, on time 
and to budget. I would like to thank each of 
them for the sterling work they do, much 
of which is complex, arduous and carried 
out in challenging environments.
Outlook
Whilst the situation in the Middle East and 
North Africa continues to be uncertain 
and the global economic outlook remains 
challenging, Petrofac is well positioned. 
Global demand for hydrocarbons is 
expected to continue to rise and our principal 
customers, the national oil companies, 
continue to invest and furthermore welcome 
the innovative commercial solutions that we 
are able to offer plus our commitment to 
developing local capability. Whilst 2012 was 
characterised by Onshore Engineering & 
Construction customers delaying awards, 
we think the situation will improve during 
2013. In the meantime, our Integrated Energy 
Services division has many opportunities.
Our backlog gives us very good visibility of 
revenues for the coming year and we have 
a healthy bidding pipeline combined with 
an exceptional management team and a 
robust and ambitious strategy. If we retain 
our values, can-do culture and capable 
workforce, I have every conﬁdence that 
2013 will prove another successful year.
Norman Murray
Non-executive Chairman
Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 07 Interview with the  
Group Chief Executive
Group Chief Executive, Ayman Asfari reﬂects on the operational and 
contract highlights of 2012 and outlines the Group’s strategic drivers 
which underpin its 2015 goals.
Overview
Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 08 2012 has been another successful year 
for Petrofac. How does the Company 
continue to deliver strong results and a 
good operational performance, despite 
the challenging economy?
Our achievements are driven by our people and their passion for 
delivery. Despite the challenging macro-environment, the fundamentals 
for our sector remain positive and strong oil prices are encouraging 
hydrocarbon resource holders to invest in their assets and 
infrastructure, across the world. Our talented men and women 
are responding to these opportunities.
What are the three key things you want 
to report to shareholders this year?
I. The success of our two divisional structure
The organisational structure that we implemented at the start of last 
year is working very well and both divisions had a good ﬁrst full year of 
operations. Marwan Chedid and Andy Inglis, Chief Executives of 
ECOM and IES, respectively, have done an excellent job of 
establishing and leading their businesses. As we intended, the new 
structure is proving simpler for customers to understand, enables us 
to focus more clearly on our strategic goals and helps the business 
work more closely together to integrate our services.
II. The rapid development of IES
Building IES is one of our three strategic growth priorities. In 2012, 
the division increased earnings signiﬁcantly and secured major 
contracts in both new and existing geographies. In Mexico, for 
example, by the second half of this year, we will be operating four 
ﬁelds and will then be the second biggest producer in the country 
next to national oil company, PEMEX. The IES leadership team has 
made excellent progress in developing the technical and management 
strength of the division, providing a sound platform for further strong 
growth.
III. Continued excellence in execution capability
Operationally, we had another very good year across the Group. 
Our portfolio is in excellent shape and, most importantly, customers 
are pleased with our service.
In the light of Petrofac’s strategic 
ambition to grow its offshore 
engineering, procurement, installation 
and construction (EPIC) business, what 
is the signiﬁcance of the creation of 
Offshore Capital Projects (OCP)?
Our offshore business has historically been focused on operations, 
maintenance and integrity management, particularly in the UKCS 
such as our contract with Apache in the North Sea for the Forties and 
Beryl assets. In the past few years we have been responding to our 
customer needs and delivering large scale offshore developments in 
the UK Continental Shelf (Dons and Greater Stella Area) and in 
Malaysia (Cendor, West Desaru, Berantai and Sepat). 
So, we’ve been building our track record and we see continuing 
demand in this sector and a growing requirement from our customers 
for more effective delivery solutions. The establishment of our OCP 
service line, which is led by Yves Inbona, and is part of our ECOM 
division, gives us a greater focus on this important market. OCP has 
a good pipeline of bidding opportunities. We are aiming to build upon 
our existing track record by deepening our offshore technical 
capability and investing in selected assets to provide access to these 
markets.
What were the operational highlights of 
the year? 
There have been many operational landmarks this year, including:
 The introduction, in October 2012, of ﬁrst gas at Berantai, 
offshore Malaysia, under our Risk Services Contract with 
PETRONAS, Malaysia’s national oil company. We met a very 
challenging development schedule to achieve this from concept 
selection to ﬁrst gas in just 21 months 
 The swift establishment of our operations in Mexico. From a 
standing start, we created a fully functioning business by the end 
of the year and secured four production enhancement contracts 
in 12 months 
 Our success in delivering large-scale onshore projects at sites like 
Asab in Abu Dhabi, and at El Merk in Algeria 
 Offshore Projects & Operations maintained its focus on asset 
integrity and safety, signiﬁcantly reducing Lost Time Incidents 
compared with previous years, against an overall increase in 
man-hours worked 
 We made two small, yet strategic, capability enhancing acquisitions 
during the year, and welcomed KW Limited, a subsea specialist 
consultancy, and Oilennium Limited, an e-learning business, into our 
Engineering & Consulting Services and Training Services service 
lines respectively
 Also in the year, and in line with our IES strategy to help resource 
holders develop their assets and the capability of their workforces, 
Training Services formed a strategic partnership with PETRONAS 
and was appointed to design and build two training facilities 
in Malaysia
Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 09 How is the growth of the IES division 
changing Petrofac’s risk proﬁle?
Since our inception our risk proﬁle has evolved as our strategy has 
developed, but we have always demonstrated an ability to manage 
our changing risks effectively.
The development of IES is the latest stage in the evolution of our 
model. The principal driver of our IES strategy is to leverage our 
service capabilities under commercial frameworks such as Production 
Enhancement and Risk Service Contracts. It is true that we invest 
some capital in these projects, and therefore, have to be conﬁdent in 
our ability to deliver to achieve a return. In these contracts we focus 
on helping our customers develop proven reserves or to redevelop 
mature assets. IES is helping to build long-term sustainable earnings 
for the Group, thereby creating a better balanced business. 
What characterises the Company’s 
approach to managing risk?
We have an extensive internal risk review process, which we 
undertake prior to committing the business to new projects.
Our focus on oil and gas combined with our deep knowledge and 
long-term presence in key geographies help us to execute effectively 
and avoid the risk of being unable to operate in challenging or 
remote locations. 
While we can see exciting opportunities ahead, we would never 
pursue growth strategies if the risks were neither manageable nor 
commensurate with shareholder reward. A key element in de-risking 
growth is making sure we have the right capabilities, systems and 
processes to support expansion. Our Fit for 2015 programme, 
sponsored by Maroun Semaan, Petrofac’s President, is focusing on 
delivering this type of sustainable organisation. (For more details 
about Petrofac and risk, see our Board Risk Committee report 
on pages 82 to 87.)
Can you tell us more about Fit for 2015?
Fit for 2015 is an internal programme aimed at improving the 
efﬁciency and sustainability of our business. The aim of the project 
is to enable us to achieve our ﬁnancial goals of more than doubling 
our recurring 2010 Group net earnings by 2015, and to go on 
growing beyond that date. Having reviewed our business to identify 
‘road blocks’ to sustainable growth, we are now focusing on a suite 
of initiatives. These initiatives concentrate on how we win business, 
how we deliver for customers and how we motivate and develop 
our people. (For more information on our Fit for 2015 initiatives, 
see pages 22 and 23.)
How does Petrofac approach 
succession planning and do you 
have a strong enough talent pipeline 
to manage future growth?
Succession planning is an aspect of business that we have been 
managing proactively since we listed Petrofac in 2005. In the last 
seven years we have seen changes within the leadership team 
that have been well managed and have enhanced the business. 
We continue to develop our succession planning, regularly identifying 
and reviewing potential successors for each senior post, as well as 
the accompanying performance development plans that help ensure 
potential leaders have the skills to step up to these higher roles. 
We continue to build a track record in developing our own leaders 
and core capabilities in-house; and are extending this in areas of the 
business where traditionally we have had limited capability, such as 
the sub-surface expertise we have been developing as part of the 
technical directorate within IES. We have been increasing our 
graduate intake year-on-year, and in 2012 more than 240 graduates 
joined the Petrofac Group. 
In order to help maintain a full and visible talent pipeline, in 2013 we 
will be launching the Petrofac Academy. The Academy is designed to 
support the development of the technical skills of our graduate intake 
and to develop further ongoing skills and career development across 
our workforce. The ﬁrst stage of this programme, a technical 
academy for graduates supporting our Onshore Engineering & 
Construction business, will be launched later this year in Sharjah 
and we hope that it will enable us to double the level of graduates 
we bring into the organisation in the next few years.

We delivered on our strategy in three key areas:
Last year, Petrofac relaunched and 
reiterated its values of being safe, 
ethical, innovative, responsive, quality 
and cost conscious and driven to deliver. 
How successful was the relaunch? 
The 2012 campaign went very well and the adoption of our values 
was once again prevalent at our annual employee awards ceremony 
in November, where we recognised 19 individuals and teams for 
their achievements in living our values. Given the ongoing growth in 
our staff numbers, embedding our values is a continuous process. 
Our people and their distinctive values is Petrofac’s biggest 
differentiator. In 2012, we focused on communicating what our values 
mean and how they can be adopted into daily working life. In 2013, 
our revised Code of Conduct, which has the values at its core, will be 
sent to all employees. Also, and as part of our new and consistent 
approach to performance management across the Group, 25% of 
employee assessment will be based on how well individual behaviours 
reﬂect our values.
The theme of this year’s report is from 
Strategy to Delivery. How would you 
characterise progress in developing the 
strategic growth drivers and how are 
they going to help Petrofac to achieve 
its vision to be the world’s most admired 
oilﬁeld service company?
In last year’s report, we communicated the three strategic priorities 
for our business: delivering growth in our geographic footprint, 
extending our market share in the offshore EPIC sector, and building 
our IES business. 
We have made good progress across all of these areas and I have 
already touched upon some of the developments around IES and 
our offshore business in this update. Across the next six pages of the 
report, we have taken each strategic priority in turn and highlighted 
our aspirations and progress for each. 
I believe we will achieve our vision to be the world’s most admired 
oilﬁeld service company by continuing to focus on our strategy and 
delivering for our customers and shareholders. This has been another 
good year for us in all of these areas, but that’s not the end of the 
story. We have to challenge ourselves to keep doing better every year 
to achieve our vision.
From our inception in the US in the 1980s and our ﬁrst international push into 
the Middle East in the 1990s, Petrofac now has operations in many countries. 
Continuing this trajectory of careful geographic expansion is one of our 
strategic priorities. 
Our rationale
As a young company, we still have a relatively 
concentrated geographic footprint and a 
natural part of our growth strategy will be to 
look at new regions where we believe we 
can win and deliver business successfully. 
A change in government or policy can create 
fresh opportunities and the discovery of new 
oil and gas ﬁelds can generate further options 
for us. Expansion in different markets also 
makes Petrofac more resilient to particular 
challenges in individual regions, ensuring 
the overall Group portfolio remains robust. 
Our approach
We are selective and careful when expanding 
in new markets. 
We select geographies that have signiﬁcant 
hydrocarbon reserves and then assess 
whether we can do business safely and 
responsibly in that country. After this we 
focus on areas where we believe Petrofac 
can build a differentiated business: where our 
mix of innovative contract options, preference 
for delivering with local partners, and ability 
to train and develop local workforces, 
could make us particularly effective. 
Our progress
We are particularly proud of the progress 
we have made over the last 12 months in 
Mexico, Malaysia and West Africa, although 
we have also strengthened our position in 
the world’s largest oil and gas province: 
Saudi Arabia.
Mexico
In August 2011, Petrofac became the ﬁrst 
foreign company in more than 70 years to 
run a Mexican oil ﬁeld, when the state oil 
company PEMEX awarded us 25-year 
integrated Production Service Contracts for 
the Magallanes and Santuario blocks in 
Tabasco State. Since then, Petrofac has 
won two other integrated Production Service 
Contracts, each 30-years’ long: one, 
in partnership with Schlumberger, for the 
Pánuco Contract Area in Veracruz State, 
the second, to develop the Arenque 
Contract Area, offshore Mexico. 
Malaysia
In Malaysia, in October 2012, we introduced 
ﬁrst gas at the offshore Berantai ﬁeld under 
our Risk Service Contract with PETRONAS. 
In addition, we completed the upgrade of the
MOPU for the West Desaru ﬁeld and made 
signiﬁcant progress on the second phase 
of Cendor. Our Training Services business 
also formed a strategic partnership with 
PETRONAS to design and build two training 
facilities in the country.
West Africa
Petrofac built on its presence in Nigeria in 
2012 with a new relationship in West Africa. 
In November, we signed a strategic alliance 
with Bowleven, an Africa-focused oil and 
gas company, to support the proposed 
development of the Etinde Permit, offshore 
Cameroon. These steps complement our 
24.1% 1 interest in Seven Energy, a Nigerian 
production and development company.
Saudi Arabia
In 2012, Petrofac expanded its operations in 
Saudi Arabia with four new projects. In July, 
we won two engineering, procurement 
and construction (EPC) awards for Phase II 
of the petrochemical expansion project for 
Petro Rabigh, a domestic company in which 
national oil company Saudi Aramco and 
Sumitomo Chemical Company of Japan 
hold ﬁnancial interests. Then, in December, 
Saudi Aramco awarded us two further EPC 
contracts, totalling US$1.4 billion, for its 
Jazan reﬁnery and terminal development. 
The contracts are among the ﬁrst major 
awards made under Saudi Aramco’s 
In-Kingdom EPC programme, which 
requires bidders to meet local content 
and training requirements. 
Meeting new challenges
Some of our new geographies have 
challenging social and political environments. 
To ensure operations run safely and 
smoothly, we assess and monitor aspects 
such as security, social impacts and legal 
and compliance laws in each location and 
deploy appropriate protocols and procedures 
to protect our people and assets.
Looking ahead
Going forward, we intend to grow 
our activities in recently-entered 
countries and move into new markets. 
Potential geographies include: other 
countries in the Commonwealth of 
Independent States, Indonesia and 
East Africa.

Delivering
Transporting goods by road in Iraq 
can be challenging, complex and 
time-consuming. 
To solve this problem, the Petrofac 
team working on the Majnoon ﬁeld 
development, for Shell Iraq Petroleum 
Development BV, constructed a bespoke 
jetty, to enable essential equipment 
to be transported by river instead. 
There were many challenges: the local 
Shatt Al Arab River, which had not 
been used commercially for 30 years, 
had to be dredged; the team needed 
to familiarise itself with water levels, 
ﬂow rates and loading data; and 
permits had to be obtained from 
several government departments.
The completion of the jetty saved time. 
It also meant equipment arrived without 
difﬁculty and demonstrated Petrofac’s 
innovative and responsive service. 
Additionally, it will be of long-term 
beneﬁt to the local community.
The Majnoon ﬁeld engineering, 
procurement, fabrication and 
construction management services 
contract, in Southern Iraq, is one of four 
Iraqi contracts we have won, including 
two in 2012, since we began operations 
there in 2010.

Expanding our offshore EPC business 
While Petrofac is perhaps best known for our onshore engineering, procurement 
and construction (EPC) capabilities, we have been operating in offshore oil and gas 
for more than thirty years. Combining this offshore history with our EPC heritage, 
we aim to build a world-class offshore engineering, procurement, installation and 
construction (EPIC) business.
Our rationale
Since 2002 we have developed offshore oil 
and gas ﬁelds, often under lump-sum turnkey 
contracts. From the Cendor, Berantai and 
Sepat projects in Malaysia, to the Dons in 
the UK, we have brought a differentiated 
approach to this work. Looking forward, 
we believe expenditure on offshore 
developments will grow strongly and it is 
a market we feel well positioned to enter.
Our approach
In 2012, we created a new service line, 
Offshore Capital Projects (OCP), to deliver 
our offshore EPIC ambitions. OCP is led by 
Managing Director Yves Inbona, and it forms 
part of our Engineering, Construction, 
Operations & Maintenance (ECOM) division. 
Since joining in June, Yves has developed 
teams in Kuala Lumpur, Sharjah and Woking 
to execute existing projects and prepare for 
new activity.
Initially our focus has been on shallower 
waters in South East Asia, the United Arab 
Emirates (UAE) and the Caspian Sea, 
but we plan to widen our focus and target 
deepwater and Subsea Umbilicals, Risers 
and Flowlines (SURF) opportunities in other 
geographies including the Gulf of Mexico 
and West Africa. 
Our OCP operation complements our 
established Offshore Projects & Operations 
(OPO) service line. OPO focuses on 
reimbursable brownﬁeld modiﬁcations 
projects, and on operations and maintenance 
services worldwide.
Our progress
2012 has been a transition year for our 
offshore businesses. Before the creation of 
OCP , important progress had been made by 
OPO on two key offshore EPIC projects, 
Berantai and Sepat. Since its inception, 
OCP has continued to build the team and 
managed the work on the West Desaru 
development in Malaysia. At the same time, 
the team has developed a strong pipeline 
of business development opportunities. 
Meeting new challenges and 
looking ahead
Our aspiration to grow a top tier offshore EPIC 
business requires us to grow our capability. 
To do this, we plan to build upon our existing 
track record by deepening our offshore 
technical capability and investing in selected 
assets to provide access to these markets.

Building our Integrated Energy Services business
We launched our Integrated Energy Services (IES) division in 
June 2011 with a focus on supporting customers in developing their 
hydrocarbon resources, by leveraging all the capabilities of the 
Petrofac Group. The growth of IES is one of our strategic priorities.

Delivering
Our rationale
As a service company, Petrofac has no need 
to take equity in oil and gas ﬁelds or to book 
reserves or production. What we have is the 
capability to develop and manage oil and gas 
ﬁelds, by deploying a wide range of deep 
technical knowledge and skills that have been 
built up in the Group over many years. We 
believe there are many customers (particularly 
national oil companies (NOCs) and small 
explorers) that need support in developing 
and managing their assets under ﬂexible 
commercial models that enable them to 
maintain ownership of their reserves.
In some cases, Petrofac will invest capital in 
order to align ourselves more closely with our 
customers. Another part of our offering, 
particularly relevant to NOCs, is our skills 
training capability that we can deploy to 
develop local workforces and increase 
competence.
Our approach
Our IES division is made up of three discrete 
but connected service lines:
 Developments has deep engineering and 
project management capabilities that enable 
us to develop customers’ assets effectively
 Production Solutions delivers services to 
improve production, operational efﬁciency, 
asset integrity and recovery from our 
customers’ mature ﬁelds
 Training Services develops and manages 
capability plans for customers, builds and 
operates training facilities (currently 14 
facilities in seven countries) and delivers 
around 200,000 training days annually
Within IES we offer our services within three 
broad commercial models:
Risk Service Contracts (RSCs): Petrofac 
manages the development of an asset, 
operates and maintains that asset and 
invests capital in the project. The capital is 
reimbursed, generally from production cash 
ﬂows, with a return based on our 
performance across factors such as 
schedule, cost and operational performance. 
Production Enhancement Contracts 
(PECs): Petrofac takes over the operation of 
a mature asset, deﬁnes and executes and 
invests in its redevelopment plan. We earn 
a return from a tariff per barrel paid on an 
agreed baseline and on incremental 
production. In some cases the return is 
recovered completely through the tariff; 
in other cases, a portion of our capital is 
‘reimbursed’ immediately and consequently 
the incremental tariff is lower. 
Equity Upstream Investments:  
Petrofac takes a direct interest in a ﬁeld or 
block alongside our customer. Upstream 
Investments through Production Sharing 
Contracts (PSC), Concession Agreements 
and Equity, of which Block PM304, the 
Chergui ﬁeld and the Greater Stella Area 
development are examples.
Our progress
IES has grown signiﬁcantly since launch, 
expanding existing relationships and 
developing new ones. It now has a portfolio 
of projects across the globe, including:
 Malaysia: Petrofac is leading the 
development of the offshore Berantai oil 
and gas ﬁeld under a RSC. Along with 
our partner, SapuraKencana Petroleum 
Berhad, we were appointed to develop 
the ﬁeld and operate it for seven years 
after ﬁrst gas: a landmark reached in 
October 2012
 Romania: Petrofac operates the Ticleni 
oilﬁeld and its eight satellite ﬁelds for 
Petrom under a PEC. We signed the 
15-year contract, which has a 10-year 
extension option, in 2010
 UK: Upon ﬁrst production Petrofac will 
acquire a 20% interest in the Greater Stella 
Area development in the North Sea. 
The ﬁeld is being developed by a ﬂoating 
production facility, FPF1, which formerly 
belonged entirely to Petrofac but which is 
now 75% owned by our co-venturers in 
Greater Stella, Ithaca and Dyas
Meeting new challenges
IES’s growth is fostering opportunities 
and challenges that are changing the way 
we work.
For example, increased upstream activity 
requires us to expand our capabilities in 
areas such as subsurface, specialist drilling 
and asset management. To meet this need, 
we have built a technical centre in Woking, 
UK and are constructing another in Delhi, 
India.
NOCs often require us to use and develop 
local staff. Consequently, we are developing 
our already strong focus on in-country 
training and recruitment. This investment 
in local workforces complements our 
strategic commitment to deliver social 
investment programmes in host communities. 
The increasingly long-term nature of NOC 
contracts, makes such close community 
relationships essential.
The rapid growth of our Mexican 
business demonstrates the huge 
potential of our IES strategy.
We won our ﬁrst contracts in Mexico in 
August 2011 when, in a live auction, state 
operator PEMEX chose us to redevelop 
and increase production at Magallanes 
and Santuario, two mature onshore 
blocks that have been in operation since 
the early 1960s. 
Petrofac completed the safe transition of 
the two blocks from PEMEX in a record 
60 days, 30 days ahead of schedule. 
At the same time, among other 
challenges, we opened an ofﬁce; 
established an operating infrastructure; 
recruited 140 staff; established more 
than 100 procurement contracts 
and obtained licences and permits 
to operate.
In 2012 Petrofac won two further PEMEX 
contracts: one, in partnership with 
Schlumberger, for the Pánuco Contract 
Area in Veracruz State, the second, 
for the Arenque Contract Area, 
offshore Mexico. 
Looking ahead
IES’s good start puts it in a strong position to 
grow around the world. Already, its existing 
projects go a long way towards our target of 
generating at least US$300 million of net proﬁt 
from IES in 2015.

now 75% owned by our co-venturers in 
Greater Stella, Ithaca and Dyas
Meeting new challenges
IES’s growth is fostering opportunities 
and challenges that are changing the way 
we work.
For example, increased upstream activity 
requires us to expand our capabilities in 
areas such as subsurface, specialist drilling 
and asset management. To meet this need, 
we have built a technical centre in Woking, 
UK and are constructing another in Delhi, 
India.
NOCs often require us to use and develop 
local staff. Consequently, we are developing 
our already strong focus on in-country 
training and recruitment. This investment 
in local workforces complements our 
strategic commitment to deliver social 
investment programmes in host communities. 
The increasingly long-term nature of NOC 
contracts, makes such close community 
relationships essential.
The rapid growth of our Mexican 
business demonstrates the huge 
potential of our IES strategy.
We won our ﬁrst contracts in Mexico in 
August 2011 when, in a live auction, state 
operator PEMEX chose us to redevelop 
and increase production at Magallanes 
and Santuario, two mature onshore 
blocks that have been in operation since 
the early 1960s. 
Petrofac completed the safe transition of 
the two blocks from PEMEX in a record 
60 days, 30 days ahead of schedule. 
At the same time, among other 
challenges, we opened an ofﬁce; 
established an operating infrastructure; 
recruited 140 staff; established more 
than 100 procurement contracts 
and obtained licences and permits 
to operate.
In 2012 Petrofac won two further PEMEX 
contracts: one, in partnership with 
Schlumberger, for the Pánuco Contract 
Area in Veracruz State, the second, 
for the Arenque Contract Area, 
offshore Mexico. 
Looking ahead
IES’s good start puts it in a strong position to 
grow around the world. Already, its existing 
projects go a long way towards our target of 
generating at least US$300 million of net proﬁt 
from IES in 2015.

Our business
18 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 How we deliver
Petrofac has been serving the international oil and gas industry since 1981. 
From our origins as a Texas-based producer of modular 
plant, we have grown to become a leading FTSE 100 
company, with operations in 29 countries. In the past 
three decades, we have developed a wide range of skills 
and capabilities, which we use to help our customers, 
the hydrocarbon resource holders, to develop and unlock 
the value of new and existing oil and gas assets, both on 
and offshore.
Through our two divisions, Engineering, Construction, 
Operations & Maintenance (ECOM) and Integrated 
Energy Services (IES), we design and build oil and gas 
facilities, operate, maintain and manage assets, train 
personnel and enhance production. In addition, we 
develop and co-invest in upstream and infrastructure 
projects where we can leverage the wider service 
capabilities of our Group.
Our approach
Across the world, our services are characterised by our 
approach to local delivery, our customer focus and 
our ﬂexible commercial frameworks.
Local delivery
At Petrofac, we believe in working in partnership with 
customers, partners and suppliers within the communities 
where we operate. 
Our global workforce of more than 18,000 staff, 
drawn from around 80 nationalities, highlights our 
commitment to employing and developing local 
resources. National workforce development is often a 
key consideration for our customers. Our training and 
competence development programmes, facilitated 
by our Training Services business, can be tailored to 
meet organisational or project capability objectives and 
we offer language, skills and competence programmes 
alongside engineering, procurement and construction 
(EPC) or development projects.
Customer focus
Our teams put customer focus at the heart of service 
delivery. Driven by our core values, Petrofac people aim to 
anticipate problems before they arise and always try to 
respond to customer needs quickly and effectively, 
however demanding the challenge.
Our two divisions, ECOM and IES, provide services on 
either a stand-alone or integrated basis, with the ultimate 
aim of helping our customers solve their energy 
challenges as effectively as possible. 
Commercial ﬂexibility
Our commercial frameworks are designed to provide 
a ﬂexible approach to meeting our customers’ needs. 
We offer our customers a range of commercial 
propositions from reimbursable and cost plus KPIs 
to models where we share the investment and risks 
involved, and are designed to deliver differentiated 
returns. For more information on our commercial models, 
see page 20.
19 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 Our business model
The scale and depth of Petrofac’s capabilities enable us to provide services  
to our customers across the entire life cycle of oil and gas assets. 
Our services are available on either a stand-alone or integrated basis and we  
provide a range of commercial models, which are tailored to meet our customers’ 
needs. Services are delivered through our two divisions – ECOM and IES.
Design
From the concept to the detail, our design services draw  
on deep technical experience combined with a long track  
record of delivering in the ﬁeld. Our design teams span the 
technical spectrum and are available worldwide to address 
customers’ needs.
Build
Whether it is on or offshore, brown or greenﬁeld, our engineering, 
procurement and construction businesses deliver customers’ 
projects with an acute focus on schedule and cost. We work 
under both reimbursable and lump-sum contractual models  
from the million to the multi-billion dollar scale.
Manage
We provide a complete asset management service, under a 
variety of different commercial models, covering production 
enhancement, production operations and maintenance work, 
both onshore and offshore.
Train
Our global training business manages 14 training facilities in 
seven countries. We have an integrated approach, working with 
customers to assess capability needs and to build programmes 
to develop competent, safe and efﬁcient workforces.
Maintain
Our people have deep experience in operating oil and 
gas infrastructure. We provide project management, operations 
and maintenance support and engineering and construction 
solutions for planned facility modiﬁcations and upgrades.
Develop
We bring our spectrum of technical skills together under 
integrated contracts to support customers in developing their 
energy resources. We undertake this development work under 
a variety of commercial structures, sharing risk with our 
customers in order to align ourselves closely with them.
Engineering, Construction, Operations  
& Maintenance
Reimbursable services
Where the cost of our services is reimbursed by the customer plus an 
agreed margin. The majority of services provided by Engineering & 
Consulting Services and Offshore Projects & Operations are 
remunerated on this basis.
Cost plus KPIs
Often our reimbursable contracts will include incentive income linked 
to the successful delivery of key performance indicators (KPIs), for 
example, Duty Holder projects like the Kittiwake Platform in the UK 
North Sea for Centrica.
Lump-sum turnkey
Onshore Engineering & Construction and Offshore Capital Projects 
undertake engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) projects 
predominantly on a lump-sum or ﬁxed-price basis, for example the 
South Yoloten project in Turkmenistan.  
Integrated Energy Services
Risk Service Contracts (RSCs)
Where we develop, operate and maintain a ﬁeld, while the resource 
holder retains ownership and control of their reserves. Often, we will 
co-invest in the development and will be reimbursed based upon 
our performance. A recent example is the Berantai project in 
Malaysia. RSCs typically have low exposure to commodity prices 
and reservoir performance.
Production Enhancement Contracts (PECs)
Where we are paid a tariff per barrel for enhancement of oil and gas 
production above an agreed baseline and therefore have no direct 
commodity price exposure. PECs are appropriate for mature ﬁelds 
which have a long production history. Our contracts are long term, 
for example, 15 years on the Ticleni contract in Romania and 25 
years for the Magallanes and Santuario ﬁelds in Mexico.
Equity Upstream Investments
Upstream Investments through Production Sharing Contracts (PSC), 
Concession Agreements and Equity, of which Block PM304, the 
Chergui ﬁeld and the Greater Stella Area development are examples. 
We will typically have some production and commodity price 
exposure. Going forward, we expect to focus more on Risk Service 
Contracts and Production Enhancement Contracts.

21 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 Our Fit for 2015 programme
Petrofac has delivered strong growth historically and has set exacting 
medium-term goals: to more than double our recurring 2010 Group 
earnings by 2015. To help us consolidate this growth and build a 
stronger platform for the future, we have launched an internal 
programme, ‘Fit for 2015’, to improve our Group-wide structures, 
systems and processes.
Programme status
The project was launched in January 2012 and during the year we 
identiﬁed key areas for improvement and then drew up detailed plans 
to address those areas. This initial ‘wave’ of initiatives will begin to 
deliver in 2013, but we will also launch design work on a shorter 
second wave of initiatives during the course of the year.
Programme focus
The Fit for 2015 initiatives address three broad areas: 
 our strategic focus, to improve both our business development 
activity on priority prospects, customers and countries and the 
quality of projects entering our portfolio
 how we work, to identify more efﬁcient and effective ways of 
working to improve performance across all of our businesses. 
Activity has focused on identifying and codifying internal best 
practice to ensure a more systematic approach to project delivery
 who delivers the work, to ensure the right people with the right 
skills are in place to deliver our plans. The project has focused 
initially on improving our performance management processes 
as the key enabler of change

Our business
22 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 A standardised Group-wide 
approach for managing Production 
Enhancement Contracts (PECs) within 
IES will be the outcome of one Fit for 
2015 initiative.
As IES asset managers build their portfolio 
of PECs, they are identifying best practices 
as they take over and operate new ﬁelds. 
The IES asset management initiative has 
developed a new toolkit that establishes 
a consistent way of working, enabling 
us to respond more quickly, apply best 
practice, share learning and improve 
production enhancement.
Gordon East, initiative owner, says the 
toolkit will help staff understand and build 
on minimum requirements. “It is not 
intended to be a suite of new technical 
processes, but a way of organising 
existing processes to be most effective,” 
says East, Managing Director of IES 
Production Solutions.
Programme impact
Many of the initiatives apply to speciﬁc parts of the business. 
Our Integrated Energy Services (IES) division, for example, is deﬁning 
a toolkit of asset management processes to support its production 
enhancement projects, while our Onshore Engineering & Construction 
business’ activities include an initiative which aims to improve our use 
and management of subcontractors.
Reﬂecting the importance of Fit for 2015, the programme is being 
supported internally with a global employee engagement campaign. 
This includes ‘town hall’ presentations by senior managers, local team 
brieﬁngs and video, print and online updates.
Senior leadership
Petrofac senior management is driving Fit for 2015. Group President 
Maroun Semaan is sponsoring the programme and each initiative also 
has a senior owner accountable for delivery.

25 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 Overview – supply and demand
The International Energy Agency’s (IEA) ‘new policies scenario’
1
 
anticipates that global energy demand will increase by over one-third 
from 2011 to 2035, 1.2% per year on average, driven by rising 
incomes and population growth. Under the ‘current policies 
scenario’
2
, energy demand increases by 1.5% per year to 2035. 
The vast majority of the growth in demand will come from non-OECD 
countries, particularly China (the world’s largest energy consumer), 
India and the Middle East, while OECD demand increases by just 3% 
from 2010 to 2035 under the ‘new policies scenario’.
Fossil fuels will remain the predominant means of satisfying global 
energy demand over the long term
3
. Under the ‘new policies 
scenario’, demand for oil is projected to increase by around 14% 
to approximately 100 million barrels per day by 2035. Global demand 
for gas is expected to increase considerably faster, with a projected 
50% increase from 2010 to 2035, reaching the equivalent of 
approximately 88 million barrels of oil per day by 2035.
The natural decline in existing oil and gas production is of even greater 
signiﬁcance than the anticipated growth in demand for oil and gas. 
For example, the ﬁgure opposite shows the decline from currently 
producing oil ﬁelds out to 2035. Large-scale investment in oil and 
gas projects is therefore required both to limit and compensate for 
the decline in supply and to satisfy growth in demand.

Investment in oil and gas infrastructure
Driven by the supply and demand environment described above, 
investment in oil and gas infrastructure is expected to be 
approximately US$19 trillion over the period 2012 to 2035
1
 
(including upstream, reﬁning and transmission and distribution). 
This represents just over 50% of all energy-supply infrastructure 
in the new policies scenario, and is equivalent to US$614 billion 
per year from 2012 to 2035. Approximately 50% of this investment 
(around US$300 billion per annum) is expected to be in our core 
markets of the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS), the Middle East and 
Africa, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and the 
Asia Paciﬁc region.
The IEA sees the balance of investment shifting to the Middle East 
and other regions, however the average investment per year over 
the period to 2035 is similar to that spent in 2012, as the ﬁnding 
and development costs in these regions are lower, offsetting 
the higher cost of new sources such as deepwater and 
unconventional projects
2
.
Operational expenditures
Industry-wide operational expenditures are expected to increase. 
The average cost per barrel of developing, operating and maintaining 
new ﬁelds, which are often in more remote or harsher environments, 
is likely to increase over time. In addition, the cost per barrel 
of maintaining existing producing ﬁelds is also likely to increase 
as they will require greater ‘healthcare’ as they mature and 
production declines.
Strategy
Our addressable market is a small proportion of the total global capital 
and operational expenditure in the industry. We have three key 
strategic initiatives for growth which will expand our addressable 
market over time:
 expanding into new geographies within our core markets 
(see page 13)
 taking our onshore EPC capability offshore (see page 15)
 the provision of Integrated Energy Services (see page 17)
In summary
Notwithstanding that we still face signiﬁcant competition in many of 
our established markets, the key drivers of capital and operational 
expenditure should ensure that demand for our services remains 
strong over the long term. The substantial market opportunity that we 
see for the provision of Integrated Energy Services should help to 
drive strong growth in that division and help us achieve our ambition 
of more than doubling our 2010 recurring Group earnings by 2015.

27 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 Safety and integrity
We work in a technically-challenging and geographically-diverse 
industry that requires a vigilant and proactive approach to 
safeguarding our people and operations across the world.
The safety of our people and of the plants we build and operate are 
critical to the continued success of our Group. 
Asset integrity
In 2012 we launched an asset integrity framework to deliver a 
structured and consistent approach to integrity across all Petrofac 
operations. The framework comprises our asset integrity policy, 
our asset integrity standard, a number of guidance documents and 
a toolkit of supporting processes. 
The new framework was launched in April 2012 at our annual safety 
conference attended by 150 senior managers, including our Chairman 
and Group Chief Executive. To reinforce the importance of safety and 
integrity assurance to Petrofac, we invited Lord Cullen, who led the 
1990 public inquiry into the Piper Alpha oil platform disaster in which 
167 people died, to speak at this event.
We continued to strengthen the systems we use to monitor and 
maintain our projects and operations. Our Group Integrity Forum, 
which brings together the individuals responsible for overseeing 
integrity assurance in our service lines, meets quarterly. 
This forum is responsible for the oversight of the management 
of Petrofac’s integrity assurance worldwide. 
Petrofac conducts detailed audits of major sites to determine 
compliance with our asset integrity standard and protection against, 
and preparedness for, major accidents. The information gathered is 
carefully assessed to check performance and trends and remedial 
action is taken as required. During the year, we continued to develop 
our asset integrity guidelines, which aid us in recognising risks and 
setting actions to manage them.
Our Asset Integrity Review Board, which meets monthly, assesses 
operational integrity against 30 key measures. The review board, 
which involves managers from all operated sites, identiﬁes, and seeks 
to resolve, potential risks and acts as a valuable forum for peer review 
and sharing experience. 
During the year, some Petrofac Board members had the opportunity 
to view our safety and asset integrity activities in person with a series 
of visits to Company sites. One of these visits, to the Kittiwake 
platform in the North Sea, included Petrofac’s Chairman, Group Chief 
Executive and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer. 
Safety culture
High-performing assets and robust systems alone do not deliver 
safety: employees must have safety skills and mind-sets. 
Training plays an integral part here, particularly when we recruit 
local workers who are unfamiliar with our industry and safety culture. 
In 2012, our Offshore Projects & Operations business was 
instrumental in the development of an e-learning programme in safe 
working practices for offshore staff. The interactive ‘Control of work’ 
programme uses 3D animations, case studies, lessons learned from 
previous accidents and offshore videos. This programme is now being 
widely adopted throughout our industry, including by some 
of Petrofac’s customers.
We continued to promote our internal Horizon Zero safety campaign 
around the world. The campaign, named after our goal of achieving 
zero lost time accidents and major incidents, galvanises employees 
around our eight ‘Golden rules of safety’. Driving, which remains the 
primary cause of injury and death in our industry, was a particular 
focus during the year. In 2012, we translated our Golden rules safety 
video into a further six languages and revised our managers’ guides 
to motivating staff to act safely.
We work to reduce risk across the wider oil and gas industry by 
sharing best practice with our peers. We remain members of the UK 
Oil Spill Prevention and Response Advisory Group and support the 
UK industry’s Step Change in Safety initiative. Our specialist 
operations provide invaluable insights in this ﬁeld: Petrofac Training 
Services is a respected emergency response trainer and our UK 
Emergency Response Service Centre provides a 24-hour integrated 
response capability.
Sharing knowledge and experience is a critical aspect of improving 
safety culture. To help formalise this, we developed a lessons-learned 
database to enable easy access to a wealth of safety information 
and to generate alerts around speciﬁc incidents or areas of concern. 
To support the sharing of lessons learnt and best practice internally, 
we brought together around 30 safety managers from across the 
Group at our annual Safety Managers’ Forum, in Dubai. 
In safety, as in other areas of our business, we are continuously 
trying to improve by introducing greater commonality across Petrofac. 
In 2012, we reviewed our safety systems and processes and 
introduced a number of consistent Group-wide initiatives, including 
a new incident investigation and root cause analysis system.
Nothing is more important to Petrofac than safety. 
Our business
28 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 Our performance
One of the most notable aspects of our safety performance in 2012 
was the signiﬁcant increase in the total man-hours worked reﬂecting 
the number of large contracts in either construction or operations 
phases. At 272 million man-hours this was almost double the 
143 million recorded man-hours in 2011. 
In many ways, our overall safety performance was good in 2012. 
Our recordable incident frequency rate, as measured according to 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules, was 0.13 per 
200,000 man-hours (2011: 0.14) and our lost time injury (LTI) 
frequency rate was 0.018, the same as last year. Our driving incident 
frequency rate, per million kilometres driven, also stayed at last year’s 
level of 0.11.
In line with our Horizon Zero objectives, several sites experienced 
no LTI incidents at all. Particularly noteworthy was the 25 million 
man-hours without LTI achieved by our team at the El Merk gas 
processing facility in Algeria. The achievement helped the project win 
JV partner Anadarko’s, 2013 International Safety and Environmental 
Excellence Program Award. Also, our ‘HSSE in Construction’ team 
working on the Majnoon oil ﬁeld project in Iraq for Shell, recently won 
the Shell Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s Award for ‘improving performance 
in global health, safety, security and environment (HSSE) risk areas’.
Other safety landmarks were achieved at Karan, our gas plant 
development project in eastern Saudi Arabia, which has had more 
than 11 million incident-free man-hours; our Mina Al Ahmadi pipeline 
project in southern Kuwait, which has had over 10 million, and our 
oilﬁeld production enhancement operations in Ticleni, south-western 
Romania, which topped ﬁve million. 
Sadly, these achievements are overshadowed by the deaths of 
two Petrofac contract workers in 2012. In March, a foreman at our 
site in Kauther, Oman, was struck by a reversing truck and in April 
a charge-hand died after he was crushed by falling equipment at 
our site near Ruwais in western Abu Dhabi. Each incident was 
investigated and reviewed by senior management and then, 
separately, by the Petrofac Board. The lessons learned from these 
tragic events have been shared Group-wide. 
During the year we continued to focus on developing our emergency 
response preparedness across the Group. This included training 
and preparedness exercises at both the Group and divisional level. 
We also revised our crisis management standard to reﬂect the 
changing nature of our contracts and our presence in a number of 
challenging geographies, which we will continue to develop and 
reﬁne during 2013.

Sophisticated logistics planning has 
helped keep Petrofac’s US$3.4 billion 
gas ﬁeld development project in 
South Yoloten, Turkmenistan, ﬁrmly 
on track.
A demanding schedule meant early 
and effective procurement of materials 
was essential to prevent delays 
in construction. 
Our timely purchasing strategy and a 
comprehensive logistics assessment is 
helping to ensure goods are transported 
efﬁciently to land-locked Turkmenistan. 
All modes of transportation are being 
used: from road haulage, air freight 
and rail transportation to sea and 
river shipping. Meanwhile, to ensure 
smooth customs clearance, our 
dedicated translation team presents 
all documentation in both Turkmen 
and Russian.

Segmental performance During 2012, we completed the Kauther 
gas compression project in Oman, 
introduced hydrocarbons on the Asab 
oil ﬁeld development in Abu Dhabi and 
substantially completed the Karan utilities 
and cogeneration project in Saudi Arabia. 
The El Merk gas processing facility in Algeria 
is ready for the introduction of hydrocarbons. 
We made good progress across our portfolio 
of projects during 2012, including on the 
GASCO 4th NGL train in Abu Dhabi and 
the South Yoloten gas ﬁeld development in 
Turkmenistan, which remain on schedule 
for completion in 2013. Following the recent 
terrorist attack at the In Amenas natural gas 
site in Algeria, at the request of our customer, 
we have evacuated our staff on a temporary 
basis from the In Salah southern ﬁelds 
development in that country. We will 
recommence activities on the site when 
agreed with our customer.
New awards
Order intake during the year totalled 
US$3.0 billion and included the following 
major awards:
Badra oilﬁeld development project, Iraq
In February 2012, we were awarded a 
US$330 million lump-sum EPC contract 
by Gazprom for the ﬁrst phase of the Badra 
oilﬁeld development project. We are providing 
detailed design, engineering, procurement, 
construction, pre-commissioning, 
commissioning and start-up work on the 
Badra development’s central processing 
facility, which comprises three crude oil 
processing trains. The ﬁrst phase of the 
project is expected to come on stream in the 
second half of 2013, with ﬁnal completion 
scheduled during the second half of 2015.
Petro Rabigh Phase II petrochemical 
expansion project, Saudi Arabia
In July 2012, we announced the award 
of two EPC contracts for Petro Rabigh’s 
(a joint venture between Saudi Aramco 
and Sumitomo Chemical Co Ltd) Phase II 
petrochemical project in Saudi Arabia. 
The EPC contracts are for tank farms in the 
north and south areas and common utilities. 
The projects, which are scheduled to be 
undertaken within 36 months, will be 
delivered from our Saudi Arabia ofﬁce 
in Al-Khobar.
Power distribution network, Kuwait
In September 2012, we were awarded a 
US$200 million EPC contract by Kuwait Oil 
Company (KOC) for a new power distribution 
network in north Kuwait, which is expected 
to be completed in 24 months. Under the 
terms of the contract, we will construct three 
new substation buildings as well as laying 
approximately 900 kilometres of buried 
cable to connect the site’s substations to 
the distribution network. When complete, 
the new facilities will provide a more robust 
power supply to support the development 
of the onshore oil ﬁelds in north Kuwait.
Jazan reﬁnery and terminal project, 
Saudi Arabia
In December 2012, we were awarded two 
EPC packages for Saudi Aramco’s Jazan 
Reﬁnery and Terminal project, with a 
combined value of around US$1.4 billion. 
When complete, the reﬁnery will produce 
around 400,000 barrels of oil per day and 
have associated terminal facilities on the Red 
Sea near Jazan in the southwest of the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Petrofac’s Saudi 
Arabia ofﬁce will lead the delivery of the work 
scope which covers tank farms in the north 
and south areas of the development. 
These are some of the ﬁrst major awards 
made by Saudi Aramco under its In-Kingdom 
EPC programme and both packages 
are scheduled to be undertaken within 
three years.
Results
Revenue for the year increased by 5.1% to 
US$4,358 million (2011: US$4,146 million), 
reﬂecting an increase in activity levels 
compared with the prior year. Five projects 
contributed over three-quarters of the 
revenue for the reporting segment: the South 
Yoloten gas plant in Turkmenistan, the Asab 
onshore oil ﬁeld development in Abu Dhabi, 
the El Merk gas processing facility and the 
In Salah southern ﬁelds development in 
Algeria and the gas sweetening facilities 
project in Qatar.
EBITDA decreased by 0.8% to 
US$580 million with the EBITDA margin 
slightly lower than the prior year at 13.3% 
(2011: 14.1%). While we had high levels of 
activity and signiﬁcant margin delivery on 
contracts which are nearing completion, 
we also saw increased bid costs due to 
the high level of bidding activity in 2012.
Net proﬁt for the year increased by 3.5% 
to US$479 million (2011: US$463 million), 
representing a net margin of 11.0%, broadly 
in line with the prior year (2011: 11.2%). 
The increase in net proﬁt reﬂects the 
movement in EBITDA and a decrease in the 
effective tax rate for the reporting segment.
Onshore Engineering & Construction 
headcount increased from 6,600 to 7,800 
reﬂecting the increase in activity levels.
Onshore Engineering & Construction backlog 
stood at US$5.1 billion at 31 December 2012 
(2011: US$6.4 billion).

The Kittiwake production platform 
located in the Central North Sea 
reached a key safety milestone 
in October 2012 when it celebrated 
seven years without a lost 
time incident.
This strong performance, against one of 
the key safety metrics, reﬂects a range 
of factors, including: a pro-active safety 
culture promoting and fostering safe 
behaviours; a focus on understanding 
the risks from major accident hazards; 
a strong learning culture from previous 
asset or industry incidents and investment 
and support from the platform owners.
Petrofac has been Duty Holder of the 
North Sea platform since 2003, when we 
oversaw the ownership transition from 
the previous operator. Other Kittiwake 
landmarks since 2003, include operating 
several new satellite ﬁeld tie-backs and a 
new oil export pipeline system, along with 
reducing the maintenance backlog.
In 2012, Centrica renewed our Kittiwake 
Duty Holder contract for a further two years.

asset and is responsible for the safety of the asset.
Offshore Projects & Operations, which 
includes our Offshore Capital Projects service 
line, provides engineering and construction 
services at all stages of greenﬁeld and 
brownﬁeld offshore projects. In addition, 
through the provision of operations support 
services, we deliver production and 
maintenance support and extend ﬁeld life. 
The majority of Offshore Projects & 
Operations’ activities are currently in the UK 
Continental Shelf (UKCS), but a growing 
proportion of activities are outside the UK, 
including in the United Arab Emirates, 
Iraq, Malaysia and Thailand. Services are 
predominantly provided on a reimbursable 
basis, but often with incentive income linked 
to the successful delivery of performance 
targets. Many of our production and 
maintenance contracts are long-term 
(typically three to ﬁve years) and in the 
case of the provision of Duty Holder
1
 
services are generally open-ended. 
Increasingly, we are delivering our engineering 
and construction services on a lump-sum 
basis on offshore capital projects, as we 
progress our strategy of taking our onshore 
EPC capability offshore.
We have delivered record activity levels in 
Offshore Projects & Operations during 2012, 
from both long-term operations support 
contracts and offshore capital projects, 
including work on a number of projects 
secured or extended during 2011 and 2012, 
including:

New awards
Offshore Projects & Operations secured 
a number of contract wins and extensions 
during 2012, with an order intake totalling 
US$2.2 billion. New wins during the 
year included:
Bekok-C platform refurbishment, 
Malaysia
In May 2012, we were awarded a 
US$220 million contract by PETRONAS 
Carigali Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of 
PETRONAS, the Malaysian national oil 
company, for the refurbishment of the 
Bekok-C platform, located in the south-
eastern part of the Malay basin. The project 
will be executed on an engineering, 
procurement, construction, installation 
and commissioning (EPCIC) alliance basis. 
Bekok-C is a manned platform serving as 
a gas processing and compression hub 
exporting gas from the Guntong, Tiong and 
Bekok ﬁelds of Block PM9 in addition to 
production of crude oil and gas from its own 
wells. Under the terms of the refurbishment 
project we will provide EPCIC services to the 
platform with the overall project expected to 
be completed in around 15 months. 
Apache engineering and construction 
services, UK
In July 2012, we announced a three-year 
contract (with two optional one-year extensions), 
worth approximately US$160 million per 
annum, to provide onshore engineering and 
both onshore and offshore construction 
services to all of the Apache North Sea 
assets including the Beryl Alpha and Bravo 
platforms in the northern North Sea and the 
Scottish Area Gas Evacuation (SAGE) gas 
processing plant at St Fergus, Aberdeenshire. 
The contract represents an extension to the 
previous service contract which Petrofac held 
for Apache’s Forties platforms. Under the 
terms of the new contract our scope will also 
include topside brownﬁeld and greenﬁeld 
activity in addition to interfacing with 
subsea contractors.
Inspection, maintenance and repair 
contract, Iraq
In November 2012, we won a further 
inspection, maintenance and repair contract 
for the Rumaila oil ﬁeld in southern Iraq with 
our joint venture partner, China Petroleum 
Engineering & Construction Corporation 
(CPECC). The US$229 million contract was 
awarded by BP Iraq NV (BP), via the Rumaila 
Operating Organisation (ROO), following a 
competitive tender. The three-year contract, 
which is worth more than US$160 million to 
Petrofac, covers the inspection, maintenance 
and repair of degassing stations, rotating 
machinery and cluster pumping stations 
and came into effect on 1 November 2012.
Offshore operations contract, Iraq
In August 2012, we secured a contract worth 
approximately US$100 million to provide 
offshore operations and maintenance 
services for the Iraq Crude Oil Expansion 
Project. Awarded by Iraq’ s South Oil Company 
(SOC), the 12-month contract commenced 
following a three-month mobilisation period. 
There is also additional scope for the contract 
to be extended via two one-year contract 
extension options. Offshore Projects & 
Operations will provide operations and 
maintenance services for the new oil export 
facilities situated approximately 60 kilometres 
offshore the Al Fao Peninsula in southern Iraq. 
The facilities include: an offshore platform, 
metering station, single point moorings, 
subsea pipelines and tanker operations.
Results
Reported revenue for the year increased 
by 12.1% to US$1,403 million (2011: 
US$1,252 million), reﬂecting high activity 
levels on both long-term operations support 
contracts and offshore capital projects.
Around 70% of Offshore Projects & 
Operations’ revenue was generated in 
the UK and those revenues are generally 
denominated in sterling. The average US 
dollar to sterling exchange rate was broadly 
in line with the prior year.

to US$61 million (2011: US$44 million), 
reﬂecting the high levels of activity and ﬁrst 
time proﬁt recognition on the Laggan-
Tormore gas plant project.
Net margin increased to 4.3% (2011: 3.5%), 
due to an increasing proportion of higher 
margin non-UK business and an increasing 
proportion of lump-sum offshore capital 
projects.
Headcount increased to 4,300 at 
31 December 2012, reﬂecting the higher 
levels of activity (2011: 4,100).
Offshore Projects & Operations backlog 
increased to US$3.5 billion at 31 December 
2012 (2011: US$2.7 billion), following the new 
contract wins and extensions during 2012.

Petrofac has built on its presence 
in Turkmenistan with the second 
project win in a year for its strategic 
joint venture with the China 
Petroleum Engineering & 
Construction Corporation (CPECC).
China Petroleum Petrofac Engineering 
Services, (CPPES) was established in 
October 2011. During its ﬁrst two years 
of operation, it is concentrating both on 
projects in China and international 
opportunities for Chinese oil and gas 
companies. Other international prospects 
will be reviewed opportunistically. 
In September 2012, CPPES won a 
seven-month contract for the detailed 
design of gas gathering facilities in 
Bagtyyarlyk, north-east Turkmenistan. 
The project, for CPECC’s Turkmenistan 
branch, will be delivered by an integrated 
team of Petrofac and CPECC engineers. 
The award came a month after the joint 
venture completed an earlier project, 
to expand existing tank farm facilities for 
the same customer, on budget and on 
schedule, in Amu Darya, Turkmenistan.
Elsewhere in Turkmenistan, Petrofac is 
working on the US$3.4 billion South 
Yoloten gas ﬁeld development project, 
our largest ever project.

Segmental performance Engineering & Consulting Services operates 
as our centre of technical engineering 
excellence. From ofﬁces in the UK, India and 
Malaysia, we support the life cycle of oil and 
gas assets. This is through engineering 
studies, including conceptual, front-end 
engineering and design (FEED) and detailed 
design work, across onshore and offshore oil 
and gas ﬁelds, to external customers and in 
support of ECOM and IES projects, primarily 
on a reimbursable basis. 
We secured a number of conceptual and 
FEED studies during the year which has led 
to increased activity levels. For example, 
we were awarded a FEED study on behalf 
of Rialto Energy and Société Nationale 
d’Opérations Pétrolières de la Côte d’Ivoire 
for the Gazelle ﬁeld in Côte d’Ivoire.
During the year, we established an 
engineering ofﬁce in Lagos to support our 
Nigerian operations and we are evaluating 
options to establish further engineering 
ofﬁces in other countries to enhance our 
local delivery capabilities.
Acquisitions
As announced in February 2012, we 
acquired KW Limited, a high-end subsea 
engineering and consulting business 
which complements our existing skills in 
Engineering & Consulting Services and 
will enable us to strengthen our leading 
engineering proposition offshore. KW Limited 
has an extensive track record, ranging from 
conventional subsea tie-back projects, to 
deepwater projects, high-pressure high-
temperature (HPHT) wells and extreme 
natural environments.
Results
Reported revenue for the year increased 
19.1% to US$248 million (2011: US$208 
million), reﬂecting the increase in activity 
levels. Net proﬁt was marginally lower at 
US$29 million (2011: US$31 million), 
as Engineering & Consulting Services 
recognised a US$3 million loss (being 50%) 
on fair value changes in Seven Energy 
warrants (2011: US$3 million gain; 
the other 50% of the fair value changes 
were recognised in Integrated Energy 
Services; see note 12 to the ﬁnancial 
statements for more detail).
Headcount was higher at 31 December 2012 
at 2,800 (31 December 2011: 2,300), 
reﬂecting the increase in activity levels, 
particularly in our engineering ofﬁces in 
India and Woking, UK.
Engineering & Consulting Services’ backlog 
increased to US$0.2 billion at 31 December 
2012 (2011: US$nil).

Integrated Energy  
Services (IES)
Integrated Energy Services harnesses Petrofac’s broad range of capabilities 
to provide integrated services to hydrocarbon resource holders. The division 
has three integrated service lines, which report as one ﬁnancial segment.

First gas from the Berantai ﬁeld, 
offshore Malaysia, in October 2012 
was a key milestone towards our 
customer, PETRONAS, achieving 
its goals of increasing domestic 
production and building local 
capability.
Petrofac operates the ﬁeld and has led 
the fast-track development, under the 
ﬁrst Risk Services Contract awarded 
in Malaysia, alongside local partner 
SapuraKencana Petroleum, on behalf 
of PETRONAS, the national oil company.
Berantai is around 150km offshore 
Peninsular Malaysia, 10km south of the 
Tapis ﬁeld and 30km north east of the 
Angsi ﬁeld. The development comprises 
a wellhead platform connected to a 
ﬂoating production storage and ofﬂoading 
(FPSO) vessel, the FPSO Berantai. 
Gas is exported by a 30km subsea 
pipeline to the PETRONAS Carigali-
operated Angsi Field and onwards into 
the Peninsular Malaysian gas grid.

Segmental performance Integrated Energy Services comprises 
three discrete but connected service lines, 
Developments, Production Solutions and 
Training Services. Where we can leverage our 
service capabilities to enhance value, mitigate 
risks and reduce costs, Integrated Energy 
Services provides a fully integrated service 
for hydrocarbon resource holders under 
ﬂexible commercial models that are aligned 
to their requirements. Projects cover 
upstream developments, both greenﬁeld and 
brownﬁeld, and related energy infrastructure 
projects and can include the provision of 
ﬁnancial capital.
Our service offering is underpinned by our 
ability to develop resource holders’ local 
capability through the provision of technical 
skills training with competency development 
and assurance frameworks. For example, 
in January 2012, we were awarded a 
ﬁve-year contract to run Saudi Petroleum 
Services Polytechnic Centre for Construction 
Skills and Drilling training. We received our 
ﬁrst intake of students in April, which included 
local workers for Aramco along with staff 
from its contractor base. 
Integrated Energy Services deploys its 
services to meet the individual needs of 
customers using a range of commercial 
frameworks, including: Production 
Enhancement Contracts (PECs), Risk Service 
Contracts (RSCs) and traditional upstream 
equity investment models including both 
Production Sharing Contracts (PSC) and 
concession agreements. 
Production Enhancement Contracts
During the year, we were awarded the 
Pánuco and Arenque PECs in Mexico by 
PEMEX, following a competitive bidding 
process. We expect to commence ﬁeld 
operations on the Pánuco contract area, 
jointly with Schlumberger, and on the 
Arenque offshore contract during the ﬁrst 
half of 2013. 
We commenced ﬁeld operations on the 
Magallanes and Santuario PECs in Mexico 
on 1 February 2012 and we now have three 
drilling rigs and two workover rigs active on 
the blocks. The drilling programme on the 
Ticleni PEC for Petrom in Romania is 
progressing with one rig operational on 
the ﬁeld with additional activity focusing 
on sidetracks and well workovers.
We earn a tariff per barrel on the PECs for an 
agreed level of baseline production and an 
enhanced tariff per barrel on incremental 
production. We earned tariff income on a 
total of 5.2 million barrels of oil equivalent 
(mboe) (2011: 1.3 mboe) during the year, 
which included 11 months of ﬁeld operations 
on the Magallanes and Santuario PECs and 
our second full year of operations on the 
Ticleni PEC.
Risk Service Contracts
In January 2011, we secured our ﬁrst RSC 
in Malaysia, to lead the development of the 
Berantai ﬁeld, offshore Peninsular Malaysia, 
for PETRONAS. We have a 50% interest in 
the RSC, alongside local partner 
SapuraKencana. 
Under the terms of the RSC, we receive 
a rate of return linked to our performance 
against an agreed incentive structure, 
including project costs, timing of ﬁrst gas and 
sustained gas delivery measured six months 
after project completion, with an ongoing 
incentive structure based upon operational 
uptime. We achieved a key milestone on 
the Berantai RSC in October 2012, with 
the commencement of processing and 
export of gas.
In November 2012, we announced a 
strategic alliance agreement with Bowleven 
to develop the Etinde Permit in Cameroon. 
Subject to an agreed Field Development Plan 
and satisfaction of certain other conditions, 
including co-venturer and government 
approvals, the strategic alliance’s risk service 
arrangements envisage that Petrofac will 
subsequently execute the planned 
development through the provision of 
project management, engineering, 
procurement and construction services.

On Block PM304 in Malaysia, the upgraded 
West Desaru Mobile Offshore Production Unit 
(MOPU) (formerly the Ocean Legend) recently 
sailed from the conversion yard and the 
conductor support structure is presently 
being constructed. Also on Block PM304, 
we have made signiﬁcant progress on the 
second phase of Cendor, with installation 
of all in-ﬁeld facilities and good progress 
made on the ﬂoating, production, storage 
and ofﬂoading (FPSO) vessel. We expect 
production from West Desaru and the 
second phase of Cendor to commence 
in 2013.
In Tunisia, we have drilled two additional 
production wells during the year, which are 
expected to extend the production plateau 
for the Chergui gas plant.
In October 2011, we signed an agreement 
that will see the deployment of the ﬂoating 
production facility FPF1 (the FPF1) on the 
Greater Stella Area development in the North 
Sea. Following the FDP submission in early 
2012, we ﬁnalised the sale of 75% of the 
share capital in the company holding the 
FPF1 to Ithaca Energy Inc (Ithaca) and 
Dyas BV . Upon ﬁrst production we will 
acquire a combined 20% interest in the 
Greater Stella Area from the other co-
venturers in the development, consisting of 
three UKCS licences. The Greater Stella 
Area development is expected to commence 
production in 2014.
Our net entitlement from production for 
the year from our PSC and concession 
agreements (which currently includes the 
ﬁrst phase of Block PM304 (Cendor) and 
the Chergui gas plant) was 1.4 mboe 
(2011: 1.7 mboe).
Seven Energy
We have a 24.1%

 interest in Seven Energy 
International Limited, a leading Nigerian gas 
development and production company. 
Seven Energy commenced production from 
the Uquo ﬁeld in late 2012 and Stubb Creek 
will come on-stream during 2013.
Results
Integrated Energy Services’ revenue 
increased by 38.6% to US$719 million 
(2011: US$519 million), reﬂecting substantial 
progress on the Berantai RSC and 
commencement of the Magallanes and 
Santuario PECs.
Net proﬁt for the year increased 293.4% 
to US$89 million (2011: US$22 million), 
reﬂecting ﬁrst time proﬁt recognition on the 
Berantai RSC, the proﬁt from the sale of 75% 
of the share capital in the company holding 
the FPF1 and the commencement of the 
Magallanes and Santuario PECs. As a result 
of loss of control over the company holding 
the FPF1, which arises on sale of 75% of 
the share capital, accounting standards 
require us to fair value our remaining 
investment in associate and recognise the 
uplift in the fair value in the proﬁt and loss 
account. The total contribution from the FPF1 
transaction was approximately US$36 million.
Headcount increased to 3,000 at 
31 December 2012 (2011: 2,300), 
primarily due to the commencement of 
the Magallanes and Santuario PECs and 
development of our projects in Malaysia. 
Integrated Energy Services’ backlog stood 
at US$3.0 billion at 31 December 2012 
(2011: US$1.6 billion).

43 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 Financial review
I am pleased to be able to report another excellent set of results. 
We delivered another year of strong ﬁnancial performance in 2012, 
with revenue growth of 9% and net proﬁt growth of 17%.
1
 Including our share of losses from associates.
Revenue
Group revenue increased by 9.0% to US$6,324 million 
(2011: US$5,801 million) driven by growth in revenues in all four 
reporting segments. 64% of the Group’s revenues were from 
Onshore Engineering & Construction, which grew 5.1% in the year. 
The strongest growth was in Integrated Energy Services, reﬂecting 
signiﬁcant progress on the Berantai Risk Service Contract (RSC) 
and the commencement of the Magallanes and Santuario 
Production Enhancement Contracts (PECs) in Mexico. Revenues 
from Engineering & Consulting Services and Offshore Projects 
& Operations also grew strongly due to high levels of activity.
Operating proﬁt
1
Group operating proﬁt for the year increased 11.6% to US$758 million 
(2011: US$680 million), representing an operating margin of 12.0% 
(2011: 11.7%). The increase in operating margin was principally a 
function of the strong growth in the higher margin Integrated Energy 
Services reporting segment.
Net proﬁt
Reported proﬁt for the year attributable to Petrofac Limited 
shareholders increased 17.2% to US$632 million 
(2011: US$540 million). The increase was driven predominantly by: 
Integrated Energy Services, due to ﬁrst-time proﬁt recognition on 
the Berantai RSC, the proﬁt from the sale of 75% of the share 
capital in the company holding the FPF1 and the commencement 
of the Magallanes and Santuario PECs; Onshore Engineering & 
Construction, reﬂecting high activity levels and signiﬁcant margin 
delivery on certain contracts, which are reaching completion; 
and Offshore Projects & Operations, due to high levels of activity, 
an increasing proportion of higher margin non-UK business and an 
increasing proportion of lump-sum offshore capital projects, including 
ﬁrst-time proﬁt recognition on the Laggan-Tormore gas plant on 
Shetland. The net margin for the Group increased to 10.0% 
(2011: 9.3%), reﬂecting particularly strong growth in the higher 
margin Integrated Energy Services reporting segment.
Earnings Before Interest, Tax, 
Depreciation, Amortisation and 
Impairment (EBITDA)
1
EBITDA increased 16.9% to US$888 million (2011: US$760 million), 
representing an EBITDA margin of 14.0%, an increase from the 
prior year (2011: 13.1%). EBITDA margins were lower in Onshore 
Engineering & Construction at 13.3% (2011: 14.1%) reﬂecting 
signiﬁcant margin delivery on contracts nearing completion offset 
by increased bid costs in light of a step-up in tendering activity in 
the year. The EBITDA margin for Offshore Projects & Operations 
increased from 4.9% to 6.8% due to an increasing proportion of

Financial performance and risk
44 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 higher margin non-UK business and an increasing proportion of 
lump-sum offshore capital projects. EBITDA margin was signiﬁcantly 
higher in Integrated Energy Services at 27.3% (2011: 17.3%), 
primarily due to ﬁrst-time proﬁt recognition on the Berantai RSC, 
the proﬁt resulting from the sale of 75% of the share capital in 
the company holding the FPF1 and the commencement of the 
Magallanes and Santuario PECs. While EBITDA margins were lower in 
Onshore Engineering & Construction, which contributes the majority 
of the Group’s EBITDA (64% in 2012; 74% in 2011), this was more 
than offset by strong growth in Integrated Energy Services, which 
accounted for 22% of the Group’s EBITDA in 2012 (2011: 12%).
Backlog
The Group’s backlog increased to US$11.8 billion at 31 December 
2012 (2011: US$10.8 billion), due to new projects in Integrated 
Energy Services and Offshore Projects & Operations more than 
offsetting a reduction in Onshore Engineering & Construction backlog.
Exchange rates
The Group’s reporting currency is US dollars. A signiﬁcant proportion 
of Offshore Projects & Operations’ revenue is generated in the UKCS 
(approximately two-thirds) and those revenues and associated 
costs are generally denominated in sterling; however, there was 
little change in the average exchange rate for the US dollar against 
sterling for the years ended 31 December 2012 and 2011 and 
therefore little exchange rate impact on our US dollar reported results. 
The table below sets out the average and year-end exchange rates 
for the US dollar and sterling as used by the Group for ﬁnancial 
reporting purposes. 
Financial reporting exchange rates
US$/Sterling 2012 2011
Average rate for the year 1.59 1.60
Year-end rate 1.63 1.55
Interest 
Net ﬁnance income for the year increased to US$7 million 
(2011: US$1 million), due to the unwinding of discounting of long-term 
receivables on the Berantai RSC.
Taxation
Our policy in respect of tax is to:
 operate in accordance with the terms of the Petrofac Code 
of Conduct 
 act with integrity in all tax matters
 work together with the tax authorities in jurisdictions where we 
operate to build positive long-term relationships
 where disputes occur, to address them promptly
 manage tax in a proactive manner to maximise value for our 
customers and shareholders
Responsibility for the tax policy and management of tax risk rests 
with the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer and Group Head of Tax who report 
the Group’s tax position regularly to the Group Audit Committee. 
The Group’s tax affairs and the management of tax risk are delegated 
to a global team of tax professionals.
An analysis of the income tax charge is set out in note 6 to the 
ﬁnancial statements. The income tax charge for the year as a 
percentage of proﬁt before tax was lower at 17.7% (2011: 20.7%). 
A number of factors have impacted the effective tax rate including: 
a net release of tax provisions held in respect of income taxes, the 
recognition of tax losses previously unrecognised, and the mix of 
proﬁts in the jurisdictions in which proﬁts are earned.
Earnings per share
Fully diluted earnings per share increased to 183.88 cents per 
share (2011: 157.13 cents), an increase of 17.0%, in line with the 
Group’s increase in proﬁt for the year attributable to Petrofac 
Limited shareholders.
Operating cash ﬂow and liquidity
Cash used in operations was US$315 million  
(2011: US$1,423 million generated).
The decrease in cash generated from operations was due principally 
to the cash generated from operating proﬁts before working capital 
and other non-current items of US$907 million (2011: cash generated 
US$796 million) less net working capital outﬂows of US$918 million 
(2011: US$757 million inﬂow) and an increase in customer receivables 
within ‘Other ﬁnancial asset’ of US$300 million (2011: US$130 million) 
in relation to the Berantai RSC and in respect of development of the 
Greater Stella Area.
The main net working capital outﬂows included an increase in 
trade and other receivables of US$549 million (2011: US$301 million), 
a reduction in accrued contract expenses of US$525 million 
(2011: US$7 million), partly offset by an increase in trade and 
other payables of US$253 million (2011: US$735 million).
45 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 The other key movements in cash included:
 net cash outﬂows from investing activities of US$544 million 
(2011: US$523 million), including:
 – capital expenditure on Integrated Energy Services projects of 
US$433 million, predominantly in relation to the acquisition and 
upgrade of supporting infrastructure and ﬁeld development costs 
in relation to PECs and development expenditure on Block 
PM304, offshore Malaysia 
 – other capital expenditure of US$136 million, including, assets 
under construction, leasehold improvements and ofﬁce furniture 
and equipment
 – investment of a further US$25 million in Seven Energy 
(see note 12 to the ﬁnancial statements for details)
 – proceeds from the sale of 75% of the share capital in the 
company holding the FPFI
 net cash outﬂows from ﬁnancing activities of US$36 million 
(2011: US$227 million), including:
 – payment of the 2011 ﬁnal dividend and 2012 interim dividend 
totalling US$201 million
 – ﬁnancing the purchase of treasury shares for the purpose of 
making awards under the Group’s share schemes of 
US$76 million
 – US$303 million of proceeds drawn under the Group’s revolving 
credit facility (see note 24 to the ﬁnancial statements) less 
repayment of Group’s term loan of US$43 million
 net income taxes paid of US$83 million (2011: US$157 million)
The net result of the above was the Group’s net cash stood at 
US$265 million at 31 December 2012 (2011: US$1,495 million). 
Following the drawdown under the Group’s revolving credit facility, 
interest-bearing loans and borrowings increased to US$349 million 
(2011: US$77 million), resulting in the Group’s gross gearing ratio 
increasing to 23% (2011: 7%).

The Group’s total gross borrowings before associated debt acquisition 
costs at the end of 2012 were US$360 million (2011: US$80 million). 
The Group entered into a US$1.2 billion ﬁve-year committed revolving 
credit facility in September 2012, which is available for general 
corporate purposes. The majority of interest-bearing loans and 
borrowings at 31 December 2012 is in relation to the revolving credit 
facility (see note 24 to the ﬁnancial statements).
None of the Company’s subsidiaries are subject to any material 
restrictions on their ability to transfer funds in the form of cash 
dividends, loans or advances to the Company.
Capital expenditure
Expenditure capitalised on property, plant and equipment totalled 
US$430 million in the year ended 31 December 2012 (2011: 
US$435 million). The principal elements of capital expenditure 
during the year were:
 capital expenditure on Integrated Energy Services projects of 
US$309 million, predominantly in relation to the acquisition and 
upgrade of supporting infrastructure and ﬁeld development costs 
in relation to PECs
 expenditure on assets under construction of US$53 million, 
which includes expenditures incurred in relation to our new ofﬁce 
building in the United Arab Emirates and the Group’s Enterprise 
Resource Planning project
 other capital expenditure of US$68 million, including leasehold 
improvements and ofﬁce furniture and equipment 
Capital expenditure on intangible oil and gas assets during the year 
was US$165 million (2011: US$40 million) including development 
costs in relation to Integrated Energy Services’ interest in Block 
PM304, offshore Malaysia. 
Shareholders’ funds
Total equity at 31 December 2012 was US$1,550 million (2011: 
US$1,115 million). The main elements of the net movement were: 
net proﬁt for the year of US$630 million, less dividends paid in the 
year of US$198 million and the purchase of treasury shares of 
US$76 million, which are held in the Petrofac Employees Beneﬁt Trust 
for the purpose of making awards under the Group’s share schemes 
(see note 22 to the ﬁnancial statements).
Return on capital employed
The Group’s return on capital employed for the year ended 
31 December 2012 was lower at 46% (2011: 62%), in part reﬂecting 
the Group’s deployment of capital in the Integrated Energy Services 
reporting segment.
Dividends
The Company proposes a ﬁnal dividend of 43.00 cents per share 
for the year ended 31 December 2012 (2011: 37.20 cents), which, 
if approved, will be paid to shareholders on 24 May 2013, provided 
they were on the register on 19 April 2013. Shareholders who have 
not elected (before 26 February 2013) to receive dividends in US 
dollars will receive a sterling equivalent of 28.40 pence per share.
Together with the interim dividend of 21.00 cents per share 
(2011: 17.40 cents), equivalent to 13.45 pence, this gives a total 
dividend for the year of 64.00 cents per share (2011: 54.60 cents), 
an increase of 17.2%, in line with the increase in net proﬁt.
Financial performance and risk
46 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 Key risks
The key risks that could lead to a signiﬁcant loss of reputation or 
prevent us from delivering our ﬁve-year strategic plan are summarised 
here, along with our approach to mitigating these risks. Details of how 
our risk framework has evolved during the year are included in the 
Board Risk Committee Report on page 82 to 87.
Risk Mitigation and management Comments/links
Sovereign, country and ﬁnancial market
Overexposure to a single 
market risk.
Over-concentration in a 
particular market or geography, 
could impact on our ability 
to deliver the ﬁve-year 
strategic plan.
Petrofac endeavours to ensure that its portfolio is appropriately diversiﬁed as a mitigant against 
potential instability within speciﬁc countries or regions where the Group has an interest.
Our country exposure in higher risk jurisdictions is reviewed by the Group Risk Committee 
when considering discrete risks or entry into new countries or territories; and by the Board Risk 
Committee who, on a quarterly basis, review the overall concentration risk.
We also take all reasonable measures to reduce and limit our commercial exposure in each 
territory through the use of, for example, regular security risk assessments, careful selection of 
contracting parties, out of country arbitration, advanced payments and careful cash management.
See pages 13 to 17. 
We are diversifying our 
business model.
Counterparty risk
The risk of ﬁnancial or 
commercial exposure if 
counterparties (key ﬁnancial 
institutions, customers, partners 
subcontractors or vendors) fail 
to perform their obligations.
We aim to minimise our cash ﬂow exposure on contracts and where we deploy capital alongside 
our services, such as in Integrated Energy Services (IES). We will only do so where we are 
comfortable with the counterparty risk and the contractual terms and conditions.
With respect to ﬁnancial counterparty risk, we regularly monitor our exposure and ensure that 
our ﬁnancial assets are spread across a large number of creditworthy ﬁnancial institutions and 
that limits are not breached. Our Sovereign and Financial Market Risk Policy requires that material 
ﬁnancial counterparty risk is only held with counterparties that are rated by Standard and Poor’s 
as ‘A’ or better (or equivalent rating from Moody’s). Financial Counterparty Risk is managed by 
Group Treasury.
The Board Risk Committee has established speciﬁc limits for the main ﬁnancial counterparties 
used by the Group.
See our Sovereign and 
Financial Market Risk 
Policy – available on 
our website:
www.petrofac.com/
governancedownloads
Liquidity risk
The risk arising from 
insufﬁcient ﬁnancial resources 
being available to meet 
liabilities as they fall due.
We manage liquidity risk by ensuring that we maintain an adequate level of liquidity in the form 
of readily available cash, short-term investments or committed credit facilities at all times.
As the Company has grown, it is investing more of its surplus cash into strategic investments 
and other opportunities, particularly in IES. In 2012 we arranged a US$1.2bn ﬁve-year revolving 
credit facility to secure additional liquidity.
The Board Risk Committee has deﬁned a minimum level of liquidity which must be maintained 
by the Group and additionally, the Board has deﬁned a maximum level of permitted leverage. 
Careful cash ﬂow forecasting is carried out across all service lines on a regular basis to identify 
any funding requirements well in advance.
See note 31 to the 
ﬁnancial statements.
Investment risk 
Poor investment decisions 
could negatively impact 
our business.
Our organic growth is dependent on creating a portfolio of quality investments and investing in the 
best available options. Ineffective investment selection and development (particularly in IES) could 
lead to loss of value and higher capital expenditure.
Business disruption risk
Exposure to potential civil/
political unrest, civil war, regime 
change or sanctions that could 
adversely affect our operations.
Information security breaches 
may also result in the loss of 
Petrofac’s commercially 
sensitive data.
Petrofac faces a range of political risks in a variety of territories with the possibility of unforeseen 
regime change or legal/regulatory changes. The Board therefore regularly monitors the changing 
landscape of political risk, particularly in those countries regarded as high risk.
Security risk assessments are carried out in all high risk territories before entering into speciﬁc 
contracts. Careful consideration is also given to project, investment and income exposures and 
to the review of the associated terms and conditions of contracts with customers.
In respect of the protection of electronic information, Petrofac is continually improving the security 
of its information technology infrastructure, reviewing key business processes in the context of 
information security and ensuring there is heightened consideration of information security in the 
business. A new ‘Petrofac Group Information Security Policy’ was produced in 2012 to increase 
awareness and understanding of the threat.
Despite the unrest in 
the Middle East and 
North Africa during 
2011 to 2012, our 
activities suffered 
minimal disruption, 
(see page 33 for details).
Our security and 
evacuation procedures 
are kept under review.
47 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 Risk Mitigation and management Comments/links
Commodity or currency risk
Signiﬁcant movements in 
exchange rates could impact 
our ﬁnancial performance.
Oil and gas prices may have 
an impact on the level of new 
investment in the industry 
and may affect demand for 
our services.
The ﬁnancial performance of 
IES is more leveraged to the 
price of oil and gas through its 
Production Sharing Contracts/
equity positions.
The majority of our revenues are denominated in US dollars or currencies pegged to the US dollar. 
In contracts priced in US dollars (or currencies pegged to the US dollar) where the Group is 
procuring equipment or incurring costs in other currencies, we aim to hedge fully transactional 
exposures using forward currency contracts.
Offshore Projects & Operations’ revenues and costs are principally denominated in sterling. 
Our policy is not to hedge the sterling revenues generated by these activities as they are 
substantially matched by the sterling costs of our corporate ofﬁce and other UK-based activities.
As detailed in the ‘operating environment’ section, we expect demand for our services to remain 
robust and not be materially impacted by short-term ﬂuctuation in oil and gas prices. We do 
recognise however that as a result of threats to global economic growth, there is a risk of falling oil 
prices which could result in reduced or delayed activity by national oil companies (NOCs) and 
international oil companies (IOCs) impacting upon future backlog and margins.
Under our Sovereign and Financial Market Risk Policy we aim to hedge, on a rolling annual basis, 
the net proﬁt exposure resulting from at least 75% of our low-estimate of hydrocarbon production. 
We will not undertake hedging until a development has achieved steady-state production.
See note 31 to the 
ﬁnancial statements for 
details of our oil and gas 
derivative instruments 
and foreign currency 
exposures and how 
they are managed.
Over the medium term, 
growth in the IES 
division is expected 
to be primarily driven by 
Risk Service Contracts 
and Production 
Enhancement 
Contracts, where we 
have no direct oil and 
gas price exposure.
Operational and contractual
Customer concentration risk
Overexposure to any one 
customer could have a 
signiﬁcant impact if that 
customer relationship 
were jeopardised.
The Board regularly monitors the total value of contracts by customer to ensure that we are not 
overly dependent upon any one customer. We have a widely disaggregated customer base in the 
ECOM division and are working towards a larger portfolio of clients for the growing IES business.
The Company’s strategy is to disaggregate the business further in terms of its service lines, 
locations, and business models.
Furthermore, we have a formal programme to ensure that we maintain a regular dialogue with our 
major customers at a senior level to appreciate their future plans and to understand any concerns 
they may have with regard to our performance.
There are a number 
of relevant policies 
under our operating 
framework for managing 
these risks, such as the 
Operational and 
Contractual Risk Policy.
Competition risk
Risk that we lose our strategic 
market position or geographic 
spread.
As noted in the ‘operating environment’ section, we expect the demand for our services to remain 
robust over the long term, albeit we face signiﬁcant competition in many of our markets.
Our ﬁve-year strategic plans assume that a high level of competition continues, however, our 
geographic and service line expansion, including the provision of IES, has helped to grow the size 
of the addressable market for our services. Bid Win ratios and segmental competition is regularly 
analysed to monitor this risk.
See page 17 for details 
of how we plan to 
deliver Integrated 
Energy Services.
Environmental, asset 
integrity or safety risks
A serious environmental, asset 
integrity or health and safety 
incident on any of our projects 
has the potential to cause 
signiﬁcant commercial and 
reputational damage.
Major accidents or incidents (although low probability), or a failure to manage these risks 
effectively, could result in injury, loss of life, damage to the environment, and/or loss of certain 
facilities, with the associated loss of production, or costs associated with mitigation, recovery, 
compensation and ﬁnes.
Petrofac is also subject to health and safety laws in numerous jurisdictions around the world and 
failure to comply with such laws could signiﬁcantly impact the Group’s reputation, affecting the 
willingness of stakeholders to work with the Group.
As we enter new geographical markets, sometimes with new customers and partners, and 
assume responsibility for new infrastructure, it is particularly important that our focus on these 
issues is maintained.
Our strong culture of health, safety and environmental awareness is central to our operational and 
business activities. This culture is supported by our Company operating framework and its 
associated management processes and systems; for example our Asset Integrity Framework.
We have a wide variety of controls embedded within our HSSEIA processes; Safety Case 
management; Major Accident Hazard risk assessments and audits; together with regular 
monitoring of integrity management and maintenance schedules. Management teams also review 
the commercial arrangements with clients, maintain emergency preparedness plans and review 
insurance coverage.
Recorded incident 
data measures our 
effectiveness in 
managing health, safety 
and environmental risks 
(see pages 28 and 29 
for details).
Contractual performance 
risk
Our ﬁnancial performance could 
be signiﬁcantly affected by the 
performance of a relatively small 
number of large contracts.
Successful project delivery is fundamental to Petrofac’s operating performance. A substantial 
variation in cost or schedule could constitute a signiﬁcant risk to the Group’s reputation and 
ﬁnancial position.
We do however, have a strong track record of successful project execution which reﬂects our 
rigorous approach to risk identiﬁcation and mitigation, from bid submission through to project 
completion. Progress on key projects is formally reported to the Board and senior management 
(who receive detailed risk analyses) on a regular basis. 
Our design integrity assurance process involves the robust challenge of design speciﬁcations, 
whether or not they are deﬁned by the customer, including peer-review assessment and ongoing 
reviews of integrity risk are undertaken throughout the life of a project.
Our subcontractor risk management strategy involves the retention of competent subcontractors 
with a track record of delivery. We have a number of strong subcontractor relationships with 
proven high quality companies that we seek to work with wherever possible.
We seek to avoid the acceptance of any liabilities that are unquantiﬁable or for which we could not 
reasonably be regarded as responsible, including losses of a consequential nature. We monitor 
the adequacy of insurance provision and the extent to which we can bear the ﬁnancial 
consequences of a catastrophe.

Risk Transfer Arrangements 
Insurance Programme coverage
The transfer of risks to the insurance market may be affected and inﬂuenced by constraints on 
the availability of cover, market appetite and capacity, price, and the propensity of an insurer to 
respond to notiﬁcations and claims, which means that the Group could be exposed to material 
uninsured losses. Some risks associated with Petrofac’s activities cannot or may not be 
reasonably or economically insured. Petrofac may therefore incur signiﬁcant losses from risks 
that are not covered by insurance.
Petrofac maintains an insurance programme to provide mitigation against signiﬁcant losses, 
which is consistent with general industry practice. The insurance programme incorporates a 
captive insurance vehicle. Policies purchased are subject to certain limits, deductibles and 
speciﬁc terms and conditions. In addition, insurance premium costs are subject to changes 
based on a company’s loss experience, the overall loss experience of the insurance markets 
accessed, and capacity constraints.
Organisation and 
succession risk
The availability of sufﬁciently 
skilled experienced and capable 
personnel, particularly at senior 
level, remains one of the most 
signiﬁcant challenges facing 
the oil and gas industry.
Petrofac’s performance, operating results and future growth, depend to a large extent on its 
continued ability to attract, retain, motivate and organise appropriately qualiﬁed personnel 
with the level of expertise and knowledge necessary to conduct its operations effectively. 
Competition for talented, suitably experienced and qualiﬁed management and employees is 
intense across the sector for specialists in oil and gas.
Petrofac has aggressive targets for growth and anticipates a further increase in the number of 
employees in the next ﬁve years. We are therefore evolving a more systematic approach to 
resourcing to ensure we can meet our short and long-term human resource needs. We regularly 
review our resourcing demand models which underpin the Group’s business plans and aim to 
identify the best people through talent and performance management, linked to effective 
succession planning and recruitment.
We remain conﬁdent that our policies to attract, promote and reward on merit, targeted, 
but extensive, employee share ownership, management and technical training programmes, 
and access to international labour markets, will enable us to attract and retain the necessary 
skilled personnel to undertake our projects in hand.
See ‘people and 
resourcing’ on pages 
52 to 54 for progress 
during 2012.
Ethical, social and regulatory
Major breach of our  
Code of Conduct
Working with third parties, 
communities, workforce 
relations, etc.
Our Code of Conduct sets out the behaviours we expect of our employees and third parties 
working with and/or for us, such as suppliers, contractors, agents and partners. We are 
committed to complying with all applicable legal requirements and working to the highest 
ethical standards. In 2012 we also strengthened our management of the social impacts of our 
operations on directly affected communities by introducing a Social Performance Standard.
We seek assurances that all third parties, over whom we have responsibility or who are acting 
under our direction, conduct their business with us in a manner that is consistent with our Code 
of Conduct and the principles set out in our Ethical, Social and Regulatory Risk policy, our Social 
Performance Standard. External Affairs risk reviews also help to target speciﬁc areas of threat 
and ensure that we put appropriate controls in place.
We take appropriate measures to understand the social risks and impacts of our business 
activities and take steps to mitigate these risks by engaging with, supporting and investing in 
the local communities affected by our operations.
See our Ethical, Social 
and Regulatory Risk 
Policy – available on

Major regulatory breach, 
including bribery and 
corruption
We recognise the potential 
ﬁnancial and reputational risk 
that could result from a breach 
of local or international laws, 
particularly in respect of 
behaviour relating to bribery 
and corruption.
Petrofac’s business activities are conducted in many countries and are therefore subject to a 
broad range of legislation and regulations.
The Company has an anti-corruption compliance programme which seeks to manage 
corruption risk across the Group’s business activities. The compliance programme includes 
components which recognise the requirements of the UK Bribery Act 2010 and which focus 
on training, monitoring, risk management and due diligence.
Management takes a risk-based approach to due diligence and risk assessment and has 
increased the level of due diligence undertaken in respect of new contracts in pre-deﬁned 
high-risk countries, including commissioning independent investigation where appropriate. 
We also regularly review external corruption ratings before entering a particular country  
or territory.
We continue to emphasise our independently managed whistleblowing line (‘Speak Up’), 
available to all employees as well as third parties, and are committed to the investigation of 
all suspected breaches to our Code of Conduct.

of our compliance and 
training programme in 
relation to anti-bribery 
and corruption.

49 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 Corporate 
responsibility
51 Driving growth responsibly
We are strengthening the way we measure, monitor and report corporate 
responsibility performance. In 2012, as a step towards meeting Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI) guidelines, we are focusing on the material issues we believe matter 
most to our stakeholders.
52 People and resourcing
Our growth strategy relies on having the right people in the right places at the 
right time. To achieve this, in 2012, we developed our performance management 
and recruitment systems, strengthened our leadership cadre and began to evolve 
our global human resources organisation.
55 Social and economic development
We aim to make a positive difference to the regions in which we operate by 
supporting local economies and communities. In 2012, as Petrofac’s strategy took 
us into more new geographies, on longer term contracts, we developed our 
approach to managing our social performance.
57 Ethics
Petrofac aspires to the highest standards of ethical behaviour. In 2012, we revised our 
Code of Conduct, enhanced our compliance systems and strengthened employee 
engagement on this issue.
58 Safety and security
Petrofac’s strategic entry into new territories can expose us to volatile social and 
political environments. In 2012, complementing our wider social investment 
programme, our security experts worked to protect our people and assets and 
ensure operations proceeded smoothly. 
59 Environmental protection
We are committed to limiting the environmental impact of our global operations. 
In 2012, we revised our environmental policy to reﬂect the new opportunities and 
risks of our two-divisional structure and evolving business model.
For more on our approach to safety and integrity, see pages 28 and 29
50 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 Our approach to  
corporate responsibility
For Petrofac, corporate responsibility (CR) is 
a practical demonstration of our core values. 
Our value of being ethical is evident in our 
new Code of Conduct (page 57), our focus 
on quality is visible in the way we develop 
our people (pages 52 to 54), and our 
responsiveness is evidenced through 
the way we engage local communities 
(pages 55 to 56).
Although our values have always guided the 
way we do business, our CR systems and 
processes have not always kept up with our 
rapid growth. Now, as an established FTSE 
100 company, we are formalising our 
approach to CR to ensure it delivers the best 
results for our stakeholders and our business. 
This is particularly important now as, with our 
strategy involving long-term Production 
Enhancement and Risk Service Contracts, 
often in countries that are developing rapidly, 
managing our social impacts to mitigate risk 
and maximise beneﬁt for stakeholders is 
essential for our future growth.
Raising our  
reporting standards
In 2012, we agreed a roadmap towards 
achieving integrated reporting by 2015. 
The roadmap includes a number of key 
milestones and actions.
As a step towards the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI) standard, this CR report charts 
our progress against the material issues that 
we believe matter most to our stakeholders, 
including investors, customers, staff and civil 
society groups. 
The material issues reﬂect areas that are key 
to doing business responsibly and legally 
and other matters that are integral to our 
strategic ambitions. For instance, as shown 
in the diagram below, ‘safety and security’ 
is part of responsible business behaviour, 
whereas effective ‘people and resourcing’ 
is a strategic driver.
Material issues were identiﬁed at a workshop 
in October 2012, which was led by our 
external corporate sustainability advisers and 
attended by internal stakeholders from our 
social performance, external affairs, health, 
safety, security, environment and integrity 
assurance, human resources (HR), 
compliance and communications teams.
In line with best practice, and reﬂecting our 
aim to meet the GRI guidelines, we are 
developing key performance indicators (KPIs) 
to monitor our social impacts. This activity is 
still work in progress.
Stakeholder  
engagement
Following the publication of this annual 
report, we intend to conﬁrm the validity of 
our internally-prioritised material issues, 
via stakeholder engagement. 
Although new in the context of our corporate 
reporting, we have increasingly focused on 
engaging with stakeholders most directly 
impacted by our activities, and such dialogue 
has informed the way we plan and manage 
programmes. In 2012, for instance, our 
sustainable development strategy in 
Mexico was drafted in close liaison with 
our customer and community groups and, 
in early 2013, reﬂecting the increasing global 
consistency of our stakeholder engagement, 
we undertook a stakeholder and socio-
economic survey in Tunisia.
Such engagement is not only key to providing 
stakeholders with what they want and need 
to know. It also helps us manage social risk, 
improves our performance and is central to 
achieving our long-term vision to be the 
world’ s most admired oilﬁeld service company.

underpin the delivery of our three 
growth priorities and our goal of more

Corporate responsibility People and  
resourcing
Our strategy of continued geographic 
expansion, increased offshore activity and the 
growth of our Integrated Energy Services (IES) 
business will continue to have a signiﬁcant 
impact on the composition of our workforce.
In support of this, we need to increase further 
our employee numbers and develop and 
appoint many more outstanding leaders and 
technical experts. As well as having the right 
skills, these individuals will also need to 
demonstrate a commitment to our values. 
To manage these challenges, as part of our 
Fit for 2015 organisational improvement 
programme, we focused on developing a 
global performance management system 
and establishing a consistent recruitment 
process, linked to capability demand 
planning, that will build Petrofac’s brand and 
reputation. We are also working to ensure 
our HR organisation and all other support 
functions enable us to respond to our 
business objectives. As part of this, a 
dedicated HR lead was appointed for our 
Engineering, Construction, Operations & 
Maintenance (ECOM) division during the 
year, following the appointment of a similar 
lead for IES during 2011.
Performance management
In 2013, Petrofac will roll out a standard 
performance management system across 
our entire business. This programme will 
mean all employees follow the same process 
in setting their objectives to encourage good 
performance and ensure there is a clear and 
consistent link between corporate and 
individual objectives. We believe this will help 
us to motivate our people, provide clarity 
and alignment on what individuals and the 
business must do to succeed and address 
any areas of underperformance. It will also 
enable us to use behavioural indicators to 
support and strengthen our Company values.
In 2012, we ran a pilot of the new 
performance management process, 
developing the model to reﬂect lessons 
learnt. In anticipation of the coming global 
launch, we also drafted multilingual back-up 
materials and implementation plans covering 
logistics, engagement, communications 
and training.
Talent management
The oil and gas industry continues to face 
an acute skills shortage in key technical 
disciplines. Our Group-wide talent 
management strategy aims to address this 
challenge by developing and sourcing more 
of our future managers and leaders internally, 
rather than via external recruitment.
The strategy works to identify critical roles 
and gaps alongside a clear view of the talent 
pipeline, enabling us to focus development 
activity and helping to identify where external 
recruitment is required. Our Leadership 
Excellence (LE) programme, which we 
launched in 2011 in partnership with the 
London Business School, is one of our core 
senior management development tools and 
sits alongside a suite of other interventions.
Petrofac’s ambitious growth plans rely on having the right people in the 
right places at the right time. In 2012, our HR team worked closely with 
the business to meet these needs.

Corporate responsibility
52 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 Local employment
Petrofac is a multicultural business: our 
Board is made up of seven nationalities and 
our workforce of more than 80. This diversity 
enables us to reﬂect our international 
customer base and draw on a rich mix of 
culture and experience. 
The diversity of our organisation is boosted 
by our strategic commitment to employing 
people local to our operations, wherever 
possible. Eighty per cent of employees at our 
new operations in Mexico, for instance, are 
Mexican, with four out of ten employees at 
our Magallanes and Santuario operation, in 
Tabasco State, coming from the home state.
Global mobility
While endeavouring to recruit locally, 
the complex and widespread nature of 
our business sometimes requires us to 
move people across borders. In 2012, 
we further developed Group guidelines 
to ensure international moves proceed 
smoothly for employees and their families; 
assignees are treated fairly and consistently; 
opportunities for closer cost management 
are actively pursued; and Petrofac complies 
with necessary legislation in the home and 
host countries. We piloted our revised global 
mobility policy in a number of locations in 
advance of a planned 2013 launch.
Promoting diversity and 
equality
To encourage equality across gender, race 
and other differences, during 2012, we 
developed a new diversity and inclusion 
policy. The new policy will be supported by a 
number of interventions in 2013, in tandem 
with the revised Code of Conduct. The code 
itself, and an associated employee e-learning 
module, both will have dedicated sections 
on diversity. As well as being widely 
communicated to staff, the new diversity 
and inclusion policy will be shared with our 
recruitment suppliers, who will be required 
to align with it when working on our behalf. 
Leadership development
In 2012, we again ran core LE events in 
London and Dubai and have scheduled 
further events for 2013.
We built on the programme by developing 
and running further training modules for past 
attendees in ‘Advanced people skills’ and 
‘Finance skills’. We are now considering 
other modules to add to this suite. 
We are also looking to extend the LE 
programme beyond individual leaders to 
include their wider teams. We are piloting a 
group development initiative with IES 
Developments’ Malaysia leadership team, 
before potentially rolling it out across the 
wider business. This is one of a number of 
programmes in operation or design.
Resourcing
To meet our strategic workforce expansion 
plans we recruit continuously and 
systematically. HR assesses the number and 
types of employees required in alignment 
with our business plans through the 
application of a strategic forecasting tool. 
It then works with management to identify 
and recruit talented candidates. In 2012, 
our rate of recruitment was sufﬁcient to meet 
business needs, with the total number of 
employees and long-term contractors rising 
by around 17%.
Staff retention, measured in terms of those 
leaving the Company by choice, was at a 
similar level to last year overall, with turnover 
less than 6%. 
During the year, we began to redesign our 
core recruitment system technology. This will 
enable Company-wide consistency, while 
being easily adapted to local service line 
requirements. This includes a new applicant 
tracking system, which will allow us to 
manage directly-sourced candidates more 
effectively. The recruitment and applicant 
tracking systems will be rolled out in 2013 
and will be linked to an improved user 
interface on the Company’s website.
When Petrofac won its ﬁrst Mexican 
contract in August 2011, it had 
just one employee in the country, 
its Mexico general manager, within 
four months it had 140.
To build its Magallanes and Santuario 
oil ﬁelds workforce so swiftly, Petrofac 
did not just transfer staff from other 
operations. Reﬂecting its commitment to 
recruiting local people, it drew more than 
95% of its new employees from Mexico, 
Venezuela or Colombia, including half 
of the senior management team. 
Having recruited the new staff, Petrofac 
then worked hard to align them behind 
the way we work, our core values and 
our safety culture and so ensure the 
ﬁelds’ transition, from our customer 
PEMEX to us, could be undertaken 
safely and effectively.
Following the successful transition, 
Petrofac has continued to recruit staff, 
and win contracts, in Mexico.
53 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 Our culture and values 
Petrofac’s distinctive culture is key to our 
success, so we strive to ensure our people 
continue to reﬂect our culture and values 
as we grow.
The development of common, Group-wide 
HR processes, from performance 
management to recruitment, is doing much 
to create a uniﬁed company experience and 
culture, while always reﬂecting the need to 
foster creativity and be true to the geographic 
dynamics in which we operate. Emphasis on 
our core values always plays a key part. 
In 2012, we again held a high proﬁle awards 
programme to celebrate staff who embody 
our values. The EVE (Excellence, Values, 
Energy) Awards were presented at our annual 
leadership conference. Achievements 
showcased included the winner of the safety 
award, whose championing of safety helmet 
microchips improved site monitoring and 
raised safety standards and the winners of 
the responsive category, whose database 
innovation gives engineers around the 
Company access to a decade of technical 
drawings and project equipment.
Employee engagement
The skills shortage in our industry means 
talented staff are always in great demand. 
It is therefore good business practice, 
as well as being true to our values, to treat 
employees with respect and engage them 
in our Company.
Petrofac encourages employee share 
ownership, believing it builds commitment 
and rewards our people for their part in our 
success. In 2012, 32% of our staff held 
Company shares.
Following our 2011 PetroVoices employee 
survey, action plans addressed a broad 
range of issues identiﬁed by staff, from 
compensation and work-life balance to 
career development and safety. Our next 
survey will be launched in 2013.
Communications
Effective communication of our values, 
strategy and activity is crucial in aligning 
Petrofac people with our vision.
In 2012, Group and divisional 
communications teams strove to engage all 
stakeholders with transparent and relevant 
communication via digital, print and 
face-to-face channels.
Online, the Group team rolled out a more 
accessible intranet to our key geographies 
and relaunched Petrofac’s corporate website. 
Further improvements to the website during 
the year included rebuilding the careers 
section, the most visited part of the site, 
to make it more engaging. Unique visitor 
numbers to the site rose by more than one 
quarter in 2012, with total visits reaching 
more than 1.5 million. Print communication 
focused on our quarterly global employee 
magazine, Petrofacts. 
To reﬂect, and develop, its growing 
international proﬁle, Petrofac created an 
external affairs department, headed by 
an appointee with a strong background 
in oil and gas industry communications and 
managing social impacts. The department, 
which incorporates our communications and 
corporate responsibility teams, will be joined 
by a media manager in 2013.
Corporate responsibility
54 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 World-class training
Working, as we often do, in developing 
countries means we can add signiﬁcant 
economic and social impact to our host 
countries. Our commitment to training and 
employing local people, in particular, can help 
stimulate sustainable prosperity for entire 
communities. Our training centre in Mary, 
Turkmenistan, for example, trained 2,859 
staff from our South Yoloten project in 
essential construction skills and health 
and safety in 2012.
As well as developing our own staff, 
we provide world-class training to 
employees of other oil and gas companies. 
Petrofac’s 14 training centres in seven 
countries deliver around 200,000 training 
days annually. Our expertise is helping many 
state-owned companies develop their 
own national oil and gas workforces to 
internationally recognised standards.
Wherever we operate, Petrofac strives to 
be a positive presence and to minimise 
any negative impacts of our operations. 
This has become particularly important, as 
the evolution of our business is increasingly 
leading to long-term management contracts 
with national oil companies. Our recent 
Mexican production enhancement contract 
awards, for the Pánuco and Arenque 
ﬁelds, for example, will run for 30 years. 
As guests in host countries over many 
decades, it is crucial that we manage our 
social risk by developing strong, trust-based 
stakeholder relationships.
Managing social impacts
In 2012, Petrofac agreed a new social 
performance standard, which is mandatory in 
all projects where we are directly accountable 
for managing social impacts.
The standard reﬂects how our evolving 
business model, particularly the long-term 
nature of contracts, is changing our 
relationship with the communities in which 
we operate. 
By the end of 2013, we aim for this social 
performance standard to be adopted by all 
projects and operations where Petrofac 
has direct accountability for managing 
social impacts or is contractually required 
to manage them. We will report on our 
progress against this commitment, as one 
of our KPIs, in our 2013 annual report.
Our new social performance standard is 
supported by detailed implementation 
guidance documents. In 2012, we ﬁnalised 
such documents on assessing social risks 
and managing grievances. In 2013, we will 
add new guidance on stakeholder 
engagement and land and resettlement.
Our new social performance framework, 
incorporating the standard and supporting 
guidance notes, aims to deliver a 
consistent approach to managing social 
performance through credible, authoritative 
assessment, coherent planning and robust 
implementation. Reﬂecting the central 
importance of international expansion in 
our growth strategy, the framework provides 
essential guidance for rolling out, and 
managing social risk, in each new territory.
In 2012, we updated our ethical, social and 
regulatory policy, which underpins the social 
performance framework, again to reﬂect our 
changing business model.
Social and economic 
development
Petrofac’s relationship with the communities in which we operate is 
based on mutual beneﬁt. In short, we believe we should support the 
regions that support us. 
Social investment
Petrofac’s social performance standard 
requires that its social investment 
programme is built on credible and 
authoritative social assessments.
These assessments, which involve 
consultation with local stakeholders, identify 
social risks and impacts in each country. 
Following a social assessment, we aim to 
establish a bespoke social investment plan 
for the communities we operate in, reﬂecting 
their speciﬁc priorities and needs. In 2012, 
as mentioned above, we completed an 
extensive social assessment on Mexico’s 
Magallanes and Santuario ﬁelds and 
developed a social investment programme, 
which reﬂects its ﬁndings. In 2013, we will 
build on this assessment to develop a 
long-term programme to deliver tangible 
improvements and growth to local 
communities. In doing so, we will leverage 
Petrofac’s strengths, including local capability 
building and business development, to help 
stimulate economic activity.
During the year, we invested US$1,006,617 
in social projects. Our support included:
 in Tunisia, providing business start-up 
training, supporting environmental 
clean-ups and funding urgent road safety 
improvements. (For more about Tunisia, 
see our case study on page 56)
 in Mexico, refurbishing community centres, 
schools and recreational facilities, 
promoting cultural festivals, aiding 
educational environmental initiatives and 
supporting a project to manage waste.
55 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 To help evaluate Petrofac’s overall 
contribution and to record the outputs and 
long-term impacts of our projects, we use 
the London Benchmark Group Investment 
Tool. During the year, we developed the 
investment tool further and provided training 
on its use to our international network of 
external affairs representatives.
We are currently evolving our overall approach 
to strategic corporate giving and sponsorship. 
Our philanthropic and sponsorship activities 
will focus on global education initiatives that 
promote science, technology, engineering 
and mathematics (STEM) and improve 
access to education and employment of 
people from marginalised society.
In 2012, we completed our four-year 
Royal Academy of Engineering Fellowship 
programme. Since 2009, we have provided 
17 Petrofac Royal Academy of Engineering 
Fellowships to enable graduate engineers to 
pursue applied technical roles, mainly in oil 
and gas. We are renewing the programme 
in 2013.
In respect of marginalised groups, during the 
year, we provided 50 Petrofac scholarships 
to the Arvind Gandbhir Secondary School 
in northern Mumbai, India. In the UK, 
our ofﬁces in London and Woking set up 
group mentoring programmes with the 
charity Mosaic, which supports children 
from challenging backgrounds and deprived 
areas. Our mentors strive to help young 
participants fulﬁl their aspirations and 
potential by working with them to boost 
their conﬁdence, self-belief and motivation.
Petrofac is partnering with community groups to meet local needs effectively on 
Tunisia’s Kerkennah Island. We operate and have a 45% interest in the island’s 
Chergui ﬁeld with Entreprise Tunisienne D’Activitiés Pétrolières, the state oil 
company, holding the remaining 55%.
In 2012, social projects included cleaning up areas that had been used to dump municipal 
waste, providing capital to the municipal authority for urgent road safety improvements, 
and facilitating a plant nursery start-up, in partnership with an agricultural collective, 
to provide indigenous crops so households can grow cereals and vegetables. 
To support the Kerkennah Island projects, we established a permanent CR ofﬁce in 2012. 
This is currently staffed by 16 people, almost all from the island.
In 2013, we will survey island householders, community groups and other stakeholders to 
develop our understanding of local needs. The results will be used to update our plans, 
which focuses on helping young unemployed people and women.
Corporate responsibility
56 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 During 2012, we revised our Code of Conduct 
to incorporate best practice, reﬂect new 
legislation and make it more aligned 
with the increasing risks that a company 
operating in multiple jurisdictions encounters. 
Innovations included Q&A sections, guidance 
on what is expected of employees and third 
parties, a new equal opportunities chapter, 
explicit prohibition on the making of 
facilitation payments and extended sections 
on working with third parties, covering 
anti-bribery efforts, conﬂicts of interest and 
fair competition.
Protecting our reputation
The new code, entitled ‘Living Our Code’, 
will be sent to all employees and third party 
suppliers in booklet form in early 2013. 
Distribution will be supported by an extensive 
communications campaign, guidance packs 
for managers and an expanded compliance 
section on the Company intranet. Indicating 
the high-level support for the code, Group 
Chief Executive Ayman Asfari has written in 
the booklet foreword: “I expect everyone 
to follow our code. Our reputation as 
individuals and as a Company, and 
ultimately our success, depends on it.”
Ethics
We consider that behaving ethically, in accordance with one of our 
Group values, is everyone’s responsibility. Our Code of Conduct sets 
out the standards of behaviour that we expect from all our people and 
those who work for and with us. At Petrofac, upholding the code is 
everyone’s business.
Establishing ethical new 
businesses
Expansion into new territories is a pillar of our 
growth strategy and embedding compliant 
business standards is a seminal step in 
establishing new operations. In 2012, 
we assessed existing practices in our newest 
Petrofac location, Mexico, established 
compliance processes and systems and 
trained senior management in their upkeep. 
The same process is now being undertaken 
in Nigeria and will be used as a template for 
establishing ethical business foundations in 
all future new geographies. 
We are mindful of the risks and prohibitions 
that are associated with some of our projects 
in close proximity to countries subject to 
international trade sanctions, such as 
Syria and Iran. In 2012 we hired a trade 
compliance manager to work exclusively 
with our Turkmenistan based Yoloten project, 
ensuring that all of our procurement and 
logistics activities were in compliance with 
existing trade sanctions and regulations. 
Our Group compliance function continues 
to advise businesses working close to 
sanctioned states on our obligations.
Transparency in reporting
We aim to be transparent and open in our 
reporting. We are signatories of the UN 
Global Compact (UNGC). Since signing up 
in 2009, we have aimed to integrate the 
compact’s ten principles in the way we do 
business. In 2012, we conducted a UNGC 
workshop with the management team of our 
new Mexican operations, which led to the 
development of ten sustainability principles 
for the national business.
The booklet encourages employees and 
third parties to report breaches of the code 
through various means, including our whistle 
blowing line. To this end, in 2012, we ran a 
three-month Group-wide communications 
campaign to raise awareness about Speak 
Up, our phone and email service for reporting 
breaches. We also increased the number of 
free conﬁdential 24-hour national Speak Up 
phone lines from three to 20, to ensure 
increased access in different languages and 
geographies, in line with our operations.
In Petrofac the compliance agenda is 
delivered by the businesses, under the 
guidance of the Compliance function. 
The Group compliance team sets 
policies, procedures and processes but 
implementation, such as the identiﬁcation 
and mitigation of compliance risks occurs 
locally. In order to understand the issues 
that may occur in the businesses, our two 
divisions both have compliance managers, 
who report to their respective Finance 
Senior Vice President. 
We continue to embed the standard for the 
prevention of bribery and corruption that was 
launched in November 2010. For instance, 
in 2012, we honed our third party screening 
process to differentiate between types 
of suppliers, from joint venture partners to 
sub-contractors to those who work with 
Petrofac’s third parties on our behalf. 
We also monitored entries in the gifts and 
entertainments register that we introduced 
in 2011. Almost a third of our workforce 
has now completed our e-learning 
module on the prevention of bribery and 
corruption standard.
57 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 Safety 
Safety, as one of Petrofac’s core values, is a 
cornerstone of everything we do. We aim to 
deliver safety across our operations by 
achieving excellence in the integrity of our 
assets, in company processes and systems, 
and in the skills and attitude of our people. 
For more on our approach to safety, 
see pages 28 and 29.
Security
Petrofac’s security team works closely 
with the business to protect our people 
and assets and ensure operations proceed 
smoothly. This is particularly important as, 
with our growth strategy increasingly 
taking Petrofac into new territories, 
we increasingly work in volatile social 
and political environments.
Our ongoing security activity includes  
regular brieﬁngs to the Board Risk 
Committee, monitoring all Petrofac 
geographies to ensure adequate security 
measures are in place, weekly country 
updates and 24-hour emergency support. 
Contingency planning for evacuations and 
other emergencies remains a high priority. 
During 2012, our security arrangements 
allowed us to manage challenges in 
several locations.
Our risk-based Group security management 
standard provides us with a consistent 
approach to assessing risks and accordingly 
enables us to ascribe the relevant 
precautionary measures to mitigate 
such risks. 
Our security systems, like all areas of Petrofac 
activity, are changing with the evolution of our 
Company. Reﬂecting the strategic expansion 
in our offshore business, in 2012, we drafted 
a new maritime security standard.
Safety and  
security
In 2012, complementing our wider social investment programme, 
our security experts worked to protect our people and assets and 
ensure operations proceeded smoothly. 
Corporate responsibility
58 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 In November, our Planet Petrofac 
environment month involved thousands of 
staff at 25 locations in energy saving 
initiatives. The ‘Think energy. Increase 
efﬁciency’ campaign educated and 
encouraged employees to change their 
behaviour, at home and at work, to reduce 
energy use. Complementing the staff 
programme, the business carried out audits 
on ﬁve major sites to determine how carbon 
emissions could be cut. The audits built on 
previous energy-saving programmes: 
our Sharjah ofﬁce, for example, has reduced 
its energy use and spend by over one-third 
since 2010, a saving of almost US$390,000 
(see page 60).
Our evolving environmental 
programme
Building on the ISO 14001 accreditation of 
environmental management systems at 
many Petrofac locations, we are continuing 
our oil spill response audit programme and 
expanding environmental management 
audits at key sites. These audits are in 
addition to our regular internal inspections 
and ISO 14001 audits.
We were pleased to achieve an improved 
rating in the worldwide Carbon Disclosure 
Project (CDP), which encourages companies 
to protect themselves from the impacts of 
climate change and become more energy 
efﬁcient. Our score rose to 78, out of a 
possible 100, from 53 in 2011 and 36 the 
year before. The CDP reports that scores 
above 70 indicate: “Senior management 
understand the business issues related 
to climate change and are building 
climate related risks and opportunities 
into core business.”
Environmental  
protection
Petrofac is committed to limiting the environmental impact  
of its operations, around the globe.

59 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 Tracking emissions
The advance in Petrofac’s CDP rating reﬂects 
the maturity of our processes, environmental 
management innovation and more systematic 
reporting. The latter follows the 2011 
introduction of standardised environmental 
reporting practice across the Group. 
This enables us to track our total energy 
consumption, waste, travel, water use 
and air emissions more accurately. 
To progress further, we now aim to attain 
third party validation of our ﬁgures, in line 
with the GRI standard.
In 2012, we again participated in the 
UK Government’s Carbon Reduction 
Commitment Energy Efﬁciency Scheme for 
our assets located in the UK, complying with 
all criteria.
We have seen a reduction in our carbon 
footprint of approximately 11%. This is a 
result of a reduction in ﬂaring activities in 
Malaysia as well as changes to our reporting 
practices to be more in line with GRI 
standards. In all, our operations, including 
our share of joint ventures but excluding 
customer-owned facilities, emitted 201,675 
tonnes of CO2
 
(2011: 227,390). 
Although we have a very good environmental 
performance track record, we received a 
€3,000 ﬁne for an onshore oil spill at our 
Ticleni operation in Romania.
Managing changing 
environmental risks
Our environmental steering group, which 
includes senior operational and functional 
managers, continues to shape our approach 
to environmental management. In 2012, 
the group revised our environmental policy 
in line with Petrofac’s recently introduced 
two-divisional structure and our evolving 
business model, including the increase in our 
offshore activity. Changes included clarifying 
our commitments to environmental 
performance and outlining the respective 
environmental objectives for the Group and 
individual service lines. 
In 2012, we continued to explore opportunities 
in delivering capture, transport and storage 
solutions for major CO2 emitters through our 
wholly-owned subsidiary, CO2DeepStore.
As well as measuring our own emissions, 
we continue to do the same for our 
customers. Our specialist support includes 
providing extensive monitoring under the 
Oslo-Paris Convention environmental 
management requirements and the European 
Environmental Emissions Monitoring System.
We remain active members of the Arab 
Forum for Environment and Development 
and the Emirates Environmental Group.
Looking forward, we intend to revise 
our environmental standards and overall 
approach, to ensure our evolving business 
continues to manage environmental risk 
effectively and consistently.
Energy efﬁciencies at our Sharjah 
ofﬁce reduced electricity use by 18% 
in 2012.
The energy reduction at our Al Khan 
tower building led to a saving of more 
than US$150,000. This cut followed an 
even larger reduction in 2011, when 
energy consumption fell by almost a 
quarter, saving more than US$230,000. 
The savings resulted from carbon-saving 
measures that cost little to implement. 
We aim to go on saving energy, and 
money, at Al Khan. In 2013, to ensure 
the building management system runs at 
optimum efﬁciency, we will conduct daily 
reviews of electricity consumption and 
heating, ventilation and air conditioning. 
We hope this will lead to further savings 
of at least 3%.

63 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 Dear shareholder
I am pleased to present the Company’s 
corporate governance report for 2012. 
This report gives me the opportunity to 
outline our Board’s continuing commitment 
to achieving the highest standards of 
governance. Since joining Petrofac in 2011, 
I have been encouraged by the governance 
framework evident across the Group. 
As stewards of the Company, I believe it is the 
responsibility of the whole Board to ensure 
the Company’s strategy is aligned with the 
interests of our investors and stakeholders. 
During the year we have continued to engage 
with our major stakeholders to try to 
understand their views and to ensure we 
continue to improve and develop not just 
our governance reporting, but our overall 
governance behaviours. 
We believe that a robust governance 
framework based on integrity and 
transparency, which promotes challenge 
and accountability, is a cornerstone of our 
organisation. Throughout this report we have 
endeavoured to build on previous reports to 
provide clear information for all stakeholders 
on how Petrofac sets out to achieve our goals. 
Norman Murray
Chairman
64 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012
Governance
Corporate governance report What is our approach to governance? 
As a Jersey incorporated company with a premium listing on the 
London Stock Exchange, Petrofac is required to report against the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (UK Code), meeting the UK’s highest 
standards of regulation and corporate governance. In September 
2012, following a period of consultation, the Financial Reporting 
Council (FRC) announced limited changes to the UK Code which will 
take effect for ﬁnancial years beginning on or after 1 October 2012 
(2012 Updated Code). These changes have been designed to provide 
investors with greater insight into what companies are doing, through 
the work of the Board and its committees. The FRC has stated that 
changes to the 2012 Updated Code, along with changes to the 
UK Stewardship Code, ﬁrst published in 2010, are intended to 
increase director accountability and encourage greater stakeholder 
engagement, whilst promoting the interests of shareholders. 
This report, including the reports from the Nominations, Audit, Board 
Risk and Remuneration Committees, describes how the Company 
has applied all of the principles set out in sections A to E of the UK 
Code during the period under review. Where it can, the Company has 
already adopted some of the principles from the 2012 Updated Code, 
such as in relation to disclosures on Board evaluation, external search 
consultants and remuneration consultants. The Company’s auditors, 
Ernst & Young LLP (Ernst & Young), are required to review whether 
the corporate governance report reﬂects the Company’s compliance 
with the nine provisions of the UK Code speciﬁed for their review by 
the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority and to report if it does not 
reﬂect such compliance. No such report has been made. Copies of 
the UK Code, as well as the 2012 Updated Code, are publicly 
available at www.frc.org.uk.
How have we responded to recent 
governance developments?
As Chairman, I take responsibility for providing our Board with the 
opportunity to consider all governance developments and for ensuring 
that Directors receive appropriate training and education on relevant 
issues. The last year has seen the continuation of several Government 
and regulatory consultations and, where relevant for Petrofac, we 
have provided responses to a number of these, including:
 the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) consultation 
on enhanced remuneration voting rights
 the subsequent BIS consultation on revised remuneration reporting 
regulations
 the FRC consultation on the future of narrative reporting 
 the Competition Private Rights of Actions
 input into the call for evidence report on EU Women on Board 
Proposals, published by the House of Lords EU Sub-Committee
 the ICSA, in conjunction with the Investor Stewardship Working 
Party, consultation on improving engagement practices between 
companies and institutional investors
We hope the increased engagement being promoted will help to 
shape future legislation and regulation, as well as promote greater 
accountability and provide enhanced disclosures for all stakeholders. 
How are we aspiring to achieve our 
diversity targets?
Diversity continues to be a signiﬁcant governance theme, and at 
Petrofac, we see diversity as a wider topic than simply gender. 
We remain committed to achieving our future growth aspirations by 
building a pipeline of talent organically. We are therefore continuing 
to strengthen our HR processes, including our recruitment and 
performance management frameworks. We are conﬁdent that we are 
succeeding in building an organisation that recruits and promotes 
employees on the basis of ability, irrespective of background or 
gender. In order to support this aspiration, the Board approved 
a Diversity and Inclusion Policy during the year and the Company 
intends to support its roll-out across the Group with appropriate 
training over the next 12–18 months.
Notwithstanding that diversity is broader than simply gender; we feel 
we should say something about the Group’s gender imbalance, 
given how pronounced it is. Historically, engineering has been a 
predominantly male-dominated profession and, as such, we currently 
have very few women in senior operational roles, although we do 
have a number of women in senior functional roles. Whilst we do not 
anticipate this situation changing in the short term, we should begin to 
see more female employees moving up through the hierarchy over the 
next few years as our new HR processes start to take effect. In fact, 
during 2012, 21% of our graduate intake was female. Next year, 
we will provide further metrics in relation to diversity within 
our organisation.
In 2011, in response to Lord Davies’ Review, we publicly stated that 
we aspired to having a Board comprised of 15% and 25% female 
representation by 2013 and 2015 respectively, excluding the 
Chairman. I have previously explained that we would only achieve 
these aspirations by appointing new Non-executive Directors, given 
our current lack of female operational management at a senior level. 
The Nominations Committee has worked hard this year to identify 
possible female candidates for the Board. Whilst progress has been 
slower than we would have liked, we remain conﬁdent that we will 
appoint a further female Non-executive Director in the near future, 
thus meeting our aspiration for 2013, in addition to complying with the 
EU proposal on ‘gender balance in business leadership’ consultation 
which aims to ﬁll 40% of Non-executive Director positions with 
women. Shareholders can rest assured, however, that any woman 
so appointed to the Board will be the best candidate for the role on 
the basis of merit.
Further information on progress towards our boardroom targets and 
the work completed by the HR department around the development 
of our Diversity and Inclusion Policy can be found in the Nominations 
Report on page 77. 
65 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 Leadership
What should our Board be doing?
While the Board has a schedule of matters reserved to it for formal 
decision (see opposite), we recognise that there are a number of 
key topics for which all boards should take responsibility. We have 
categorised these into six key headings (see above). We acknowledge 
that as a Board, either directly or through our Committees, we should 
endeavour to focus on developing our processes in order to grow our 
business successfully and provide continuous improvement across 
the whole Group.
Schedule of matters reserved to the Board for formal 
consideration includes:
 setting the Group’s strategy
 approval to enter into contracts which are deemed to be material 
either strategically or by reason of size, duration or liability
 approval of the annual budget
 approval of major corporate transactions
 approval of major changes to the Group’s capital structure
 approval of key policies, such as those relating to Health, Safety, 
Security, Environment and Integrity Assurance (HSSEIA), our 
Code of Conduct (CoC), and Diversity and Inclusion
 preparing the Group’s and Company’s ﬁnancial statements
 recommending or declaring a dividend
 reviewing the Group’s overall governance arrangements including 
approval of the delegated authorities matrix
 maintaining effective internal controls and risk management
 succession planning and appointments to the Board
 setting senior executive remuneration
 reviewing the performance of the Board itself and its committees

Governance
Corporate governance report continued What did our Board do in 2012?
Having identiﬁed last year the key responsibilities on which we believe 
boards should be focused, I now set out some of the speciﬁc matters 
our Board considered and addressed during 2012. This is not an 
exhaustive list but it does include some of the year’s key highlights:
Setting the tone
The Board is responsible for approving key policies. The Health, 
Safety, Security, Environment and Integrity Assurance (HSSEIA) policy 
and annual plan are reviewed and updated each January. A further 
review of the Health and Safety framework for the Group is being 
considered and will be completed during 2013. Following the 
appointment in 2011 of a Group Head of Compliance, a decision was 
taken in early 2012 to refresh the Company’s Code of Conduct (CoC). 
This was completed during the year and the updated CoC was 
approved by the Board in December 2012 and is currently being 
rolled out across the Group. Further details of this project are 
provided on page 57. 
Governance
Closely linked to the work on setting the tone, the Board, through the 
Nominations Committee, reviewed and approved a new Diversity and 
Inclusion Policy. This policy draws upon the wider Code of Conduct, 
noted above, and aims to ensure that Petrofac promotes and protects 
diversity across the Group. Further details are provided on page 57. 
In addition, the new Head of External Affairs provided a report to 
the Board on future plans for the Group, which included the 
implementation of a Social Impacts Standard that will provide 
guidance on social assessments, grievance mechanisms and 
stakeholder engagement in overseas jurisdictions. 
Strategy
To continue its commitment to focus on strategy, the Board again 
spent over 30% of its time discussing strategic matters. Two speciﬁc 
meetings, a dedicated strategy day in May and a further half day in 
December, are set out in the annual timetable, and allow the Board to 
review key strategic initiatives. This year, attention was given to the 
development of the Fit for 2015 programme, as detailed on pages 22 
and 23. In addition, the Board was able to monitor and measure 
progress against strategic delivery, with reference to budget 
development, as well as the endorsement of our ﬁve-year plans. 
Management also gave the Board a series of ‘deep dive’ 
presentations on various strategic initiatives during the course of 
the year, one of which was speciﬁcally on the development of our 
Training Services service line.
Leadership
The leadership at Petrofac has been described as ‘entrepreneurial’ 
and this could be paraphrased as our management team putting 
strategy into action. Signiﬁcant time was spent during the year 
embedding the new divisional organisational structure and ensuring 
reporting lines were robust. Through the work of the Nominations 
Committee, focus was given to continued succession planning and 
identifying key employees across the Group. 
Our delegated authority framework stipulates the contracts and other 
matters which require Board approval and some of the matters which 
our Board considered and approved during 2012 include:
 the agreement in January to enter into a Co-operation Agreement 
between Integrated Energy Services and Schlumberger Production 
Management under which a working relationship would be 
established to deliver integrated and high-value projects in the 
emerging and growing production services and enhancement 
markets
 the bid for a US$330 million lump-sum engineering, procurement 
and construction (EPC) contract for the ﬁrst phase of the Badra 
Oilﬁeld Development Project in Iraq in February; and a further 
inspection and repair contract valued at US$229 million for the 
Rumaila oil ﬁeld in Southern Iraq with our joint venture partner, 
China Petroleum Engineering & Construction Corporation (CPECC) 
in November 
 the tender for a US$220 million refurbishment project of the 
Bekok-C platform in Malaysia by PETRONAS in May
 the bid for an integrated production service contract in August to 
develop the Arenque contract area in offshore Mexico, which will 
further strengthen the relationship with PEMEX and our commitment 
to assist in the development of Mexican oil and gas reserves
 entering into the strategic alliance in November with Bowleven, the 
African-focused oil and gas company to support the proposed 
development of the Etinde Permit, offshore Cameroon
 the proposed bid for two EPC packages for Saudi Aramco’s Jazan 
Reﬁnery and Terminal project in Saudi Arabia, valued around 
US$1.4 billion in December
Risk
The Board continued to review the signiﬁcant risks facing the business 
and these were outlined within the Group Chief Executive’s regular 
reports to the Board. A new Group Head of Enterprise Risk was 
appointed during the year whose primary remit is to assist the 
business units in implementing effective and consistent processes 
and controls across the Group, which will facilitate the execution of 
risk management within our agreed framework. The Board Risk 
Committee also sought to embed the updated requirements around 
risk introduced by the UK Code and further details are provided in its 
report on pages 82 to 87. 
Finance 
The Board regularly monitors the Group’s ﬁnancial performance and 
approves all ﬁnancial statements to the market. The Audit Committee 
takes prime responsibility for assuring the Board that the Group 
has satisfactory ﬁnancial controls in place. In August, the Board 
considered and approved the signing of a new US$1.2 billion 
syndicated ﬁve-year revolving credit facility, with the intention that 
this facility would provide Petrofac with future ﬁnancing ﬂexibility. 
In addition, the Board reviewed and approved the 2013 budget 
and ﬁve-year plan in December.

* Mr Asfari is a British citizen; however he is Syrian born and has dual nationality.
Full biographies of each of our Directors are shown on pages 62 and 
63 as well as in the Notice of Meeting. All our Non-executive Directors 
are independent in judgement and character. All Directors are required 
to disclose any potential conﬂict to our Board for its consideration and 
I am not aware of any relationship or circumstance which is likely to 
prejudice, or could appear to prejudice, the judgement of any Director. 
We have made considerable efforts to build a board with the right 
balance of skills, diversity and industry expertise. You will see that our 
Directors are drawn from across the world and have varied career 
histories, with no single type of person dominating the Board. We are 
fortunate in that many of our Directors bring a great deal of experience 
in the oil and gas industry, both in lump-sum contracting and 
exploration and production. We believe this is essential to safeguard 
the interests of our shareholders. The additional strengths brought to 
the Board by each Director are detailed further on pages 62 and 63. 
How is our Board organised?
Role of the Chairman
As Chairman, I am responsible for leading the Board and ensuring its 
effectiveness. I see my role as one which ensures that the Board both 
challenges and supports management. 
Role of the Group Chief Executive
Ayman Asfari is our Group Chief Executive and is responsible for 
the implementation and execution of strategy and the day-to-day 
management of the Group. He is supported by his fellow Executive 
Directors and the senior management team whose details are outlined 
on pages 24 and 25.
Ayman and I have clearly deﬁned terms of reference and these are set 
out in writing. The split in responsibilities is shown in the table below:
Roles
Chairman Group Chief Executive
Lead the Board 
Ensure effective communication 
with shareholders 
Ensure effective communication 
ﬂows between Directors 
Facilitate the effective contribution 
of all Directors 
 
Ensure effective Board 
governance
Implement strategy and objectives 
Develop manageable goals and 
priorities 
Lead and motivate the 
management teams 
Develop proposals to present to 
the Board on all areas reserved for 
its judgement 
Develop Group policies for 
approval by the Board and ensure 
implementation
Role of the Senior Independent Director
Rijnhard van Tets is our Senior Independent Director, a position he 
assumed in May 2011. He is available to shareholders to answer any 
questions which cannot be addressed by me or the Group Chief 
Executive. He acts as a sounding board and conﬁdante to me as 
Chairman and is also available as an intermediary for the other 
independent Directors if required. Rijnhard would be called upon to 
chair our Board in the unlikely event that I am unavailable to attend 
any meeting thus providing suitable continuity. As noted in the 
Nominations Report on page 77, at the Board’s request, Rijnhard will 
remain a Director beyond the end of his second three-year rotation. 
It is felt Rijnhard’s continued presence will provide continuity after a 
recent period of change to the Board’s composition. 
Secretary to the Board
Our Secretary to the Board, Mary Hitchon, is responsible to our Board 
and has acted as Secretary to all committees during the year. She is 
available to individual Directors in respect of Board procedures and 
provides general support and advice. One of her key roles is to advise 
me on governance matters so that I can enhance the governance 
and effectiveness of the Board, the committees and our individual 
Directors, which she does with professionalism and integrity. 
She ensures that our Board is kept properly informed and is consulted 
on all matters reserved to it and that papers and other information are 
delivered in a timely fashion.

Governance
Corporate governance report continued How is the Board structured?
As a Jersey company, our Board is unitary in nature. This means that 
all our Directors share equal responsibility for the decisions that we 
make. Executive and Non-executive Directors need to be able to work 
together in an atmosphere of openness, trust and mutual respect. It is 
therefore important that all Directors see the Chairman as a fair and 
impartial individual. My relationships with the Group Chief Executive 
and the Senior Independent Director are of particular importance, 
as these two individuals represent the views of management and 
Non-executive Directors, respectively. I believe that an effective 
working relationship between each of our Directors provides a robust 
framework which assists in the progression of the Company’s 
strategic aims. I hold regular private meetings with Ayman and with 
Rijnhard between our Board meetings and believe that I am equally 
informed about the views of management and Non-executive 
Directors. In addition, I set aside time during Board meetings to see 
the Non-executive Directors separately. Each of these meetings 
provides insight which assists me in two ways: I am better able to set 
the agenda for our Board meetings and I can ensure that all Directors 
contribute at our meetings through their individual and collective 
experience, challenge and support. 
The Board is assisted by four committees (as set out in the diagram 
below). Each committee is responsible for reviewing and overseeing 
activities within its particular terms of reference; copies of which are 
available on the Company’s website (www.petrofac.com). At each 
scheduled Board meeting, the chairman of each committee provides 
a summary of any committee meeting held since the previous Board 
meeting and; further, the minutes of all committee meetings are 
circulated to the Board. Individual reports from each committee 
chairman for 2012 are provided on pages 76 to 103. In addition 
to the four Board Committees, there are a number of executive 
management committees which have been established to consider 
various issues involved in the day-to-day operational management 
of Petrofac, and matters for recommendation to the Board and 
its committees.

69 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 Who attends Board meetings?
As well as Directors and the Secretary to the Board, guests from 
operational and functional management are periodically invited to 
attend Board meetings. During 2012, updates were provided from 
operational management, one and two tiers below director level, as 
well as from the functional heads of HSSEIA, HR, Risk, Compliance 
and Strategy. We believe this interaction helps Directors get to know 
the Company and its senior management better, enhances their 
understanding of the business and the implementation of strategy 
and makes for more effective Board meetings that, while always 
professional, are nevertheless lively and engaging. We also consider 
that providing senior management the opportunity to present to the 
Board and meet the Directors on more informal occasions is valuable 
for their development.
Where does our Board meet?
Petrofac Limited was incorporated in Jersey under the Companies 
(Jersey) Law 1991 and although we hold our Board meetings at a 
variety of locations, most are held in Jersey. We ensure that at least 
one of our six scheduled meetings is held in Sharjah, UAE being the 
location of our largest ofﬁce and the centre of our OEC business. 
While in Sharjah in 2012, the Board took the opportunity to meet 
around 50 members of our local management team over an informal 
dinner. Every year we also hold one meeting in a location where 
Petrofac has signiﬁcant business. In October 2012, we visited the 
El Merk project site in Algeria (see below). Meetings held outside 
of Jersey allow the Board to get to know Petrofac, its people, its 
customers and its business partners. 
How often does our Board meet?
The Board meets face-to-face at least six times a year at scheduled 
meetings. In addition, the Board meets on an ad hoc basis, either 
face-to-face or telephonically, where items of business arise which 
cannot be held over until the next scheduled meeting. Scheduled 
meetings are generally held over a two-day period, though at least 
two of these meetings are longer as during our annual programme of 
events we also hold a dedicated strategy day as well as a site visit. 
Committee meetings are held prior to the full Board meeting.

How do we deal with potential 
conﬂicts of interest?
Processes and procedures are in place that require Directors to 
identify and declare actual or potential conﬂicts of interest, whether 
matter-speciﬁc or situational. These notiﬁcations are required to be 
made by the Director concerned prior to, or at, a Board meeting. 
All Directors have a duty to update the whole Board of any changes. 
The Board may authorise potential conﬂicts which can be limited in 
scope, in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association. 
During the year, all conﬂict management procedures were adhered 
to and operated effectively. 
In October, the Board held its board meeting at the El Merk site 
in Algeria, where we were in the process of completing the 
construction of a central processing facility for our customers, 
Sonatrach and Anadarko. During this three-day visit, the Board 
was given the opportunity to understand some of the day-to-day 
challenges faced by our on-site employees. This has been even 
more pertinent for our Directors given recent events in this country. 
Updates and presentations from local management were 
provided and Directors had the chance to meet with a number 
of engineering graduates working on the base, and to see 
ﬁrst-hand the work being carried out. The visit also gave Directors 
the opportunity to meet and discuss the project with Sonatrach 
and Anadarko representatives, thus gaining an insight into our 
customers’ concerns.

Governance
Corporate governance report continued Effectiveness
How do we get the best out 
of our Board?
We invest time and effort in appointing our Directors and arranging 
Board meetings so it would be disappointing if we did not get the 
best out of our Board. I believe that the Board must operate in an 
atmosphere of mutual trust and respect in order to be effective, and 
I therefore encourage Directors to be open and forthright. As well as 
encouraging the right culture within the boardroom, Directors must 
be practically supported to enable them to engage fully with the 
Company and allow them to make the best possible contribution. 
I outline below these practical measures:
Information provided 
We spend considerable time developing the agenda for each of our 
scheduled Board meetings. There are a number of standing items 
and various matters, such as the forthcoming year’s budget or 
HSSEIA plan, which are brought to the Board on the basis of a 
12-month rolling programme. However, at least half of any Board 
meeting agenda is devoted to strategic and non-recurring items, plus 
speciﬁc project and investment related opportunities. I believe that 
taking this tailored approach encourages our Board to engage more 
effectively. As noted on page 73, time was spent during the year 
improving board paper content and focus, as well-written papers 
facilitate constructive debate and challenge. As recommended by the 
UK Code and as part of our commitment to best practice, we ensure 
papers are dispatched in a timely manner, usually one week prior 
to each meeting. During 2012, we moved to providing papers 
electronically through a dedicated application. We believe this method 
of delivery is more secure and also reduces the environmental impact. 
We also provide additional information via this portal, which gives our 
Directors easy and instant access to a useful resource bank, which I 
believe is of particular importance given our geographical spread. 
When telephonic Board meetings are held, the Secretary to the Board 
ensures that papers are circulated electronically, generally at least 24 
hours prior to the meeting.
Our selection process 
We have a formal, rigorous and transparent selection procedure 
for the appointment of Directors. The Nominations Committee is 
responsible for recommending new Directors to our Board. Board size 
and composition are considered very carefully to ensure the correct 
balance of individuals, taking into account diversity and experience. 
In addition, individuals are made aware of the need to allocate 
sufﬁcient time to the Company to discharge their responsibilities 
effectively. Care is taken to establish the existing commitments of 
all Non-executive Directors, particularly the Chairman. Should a 
Director’s external commitments change after appointment, they are 
required to make me and the Board aware as soon as practicable 
so that we can consider any potential conﬂict of interest, time 
commitment challenge or residency status conﬂict. A process will be 
implemented to allow the Board to conduct a review of interests and 
conﬂicts at the end of each year. A report on the activities of the 
Nominations Committee is set out on pages 76 and 77. 
Director development and training 
The UK Code puts signiﬁcant emphasis on director development and 
training, a governance development which I fully support. We do not, 
however, run an extensive programme of ‘one size ﬁts all’ director 
training, but instead encourage all Directors to pursue an individually 
tailored development programme during the year. We maintain a 
record of each Director’s training and development, which I review 
during the evaluation process and, over the course of this year, 
over 300 hours were recorded. This comprised a mixture of formal 
seminars led by external advisors; ofﬁce and site visits; and health 
and safety training. As might be expected, Non-executive Directors 
undertake a higher number of external seminars than their executive 
colleagues, as these frequently focus on general governance 
developments; whilst Executive Directors will complete more ofﬁce 
and site visits and health and safety training, as such activities fall 
within senior management’s day-to-day remit. Nevertheless, almost 
10% of training time recorded by our Non-executive Directors 
was spent meeting senior executives across the Group, thus 
demonstrating their commitment to understanding the business. 
During 2012 all Directors received anti-bribery and corruption training, 
either by an e-learning module or in face-to-face sessions with the 
Group Head of Compliance. In 2013, we plan to provide the Board 
with a limited number of group training sessions, which will include 
the Diversity and Inclusion training which is being rolled-out across 
the Group. 
My own training programme included governance seminars, 
including the ABI investment conference; a visit to our growing 
operations in Mexico; a visit to our Laggan-Tormore site in Shetland; 
and, following the completion of an offshore safety training course in 
Aberdeen, Tim Weller and I were able to join a visit by the Group Chief 
Executive, the Managing Director of OPO and the Group Director of 
HSSEIA to the Kittiwake installation in the North Sea, UK. This gave 
me the opportunity to see our commitments to safety and operational 
excellence in practice, view the assets in operation, meet some of our 
offshore employees and spend time with customers. I also attended 
the Company’s annual safety seminar, as noted on page 28, which is 
attended by our senior operational employees. This gave me a good 
insight into Petrofac’s culture on safety.
The Board recognises that a Directors’ development goes beyond 
formal and informal training sessions. For that reason, the Board was 
happy to support Tim Weller’s forthcoming appointment to the board 
of G4S plc.
Do the Directors have 
deeds of indemnity?
During 2012 Petrofac provided indemnities to its Directors and 
Ofﬁcers in respect of liabilities which may be incurred as a result of 
their ofﬁce, in accordance with our Articles of Association and to the 
maximum extent permitted by Jersey law. Petrofac has appropriate 
insurance coverage in respect of legal action which may be brought 
against the Directors and its ofﬁcers. Neither the Company’s 
indemnities nor insurance would provide any cover where a Director 
or Ofﬁcer was found to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
71 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 Our induction programme
René Médori and Marwan Chedid both joined the Board in January 2012. Each were provided with an individually tailored induction programme 
to account for their differing requirements and needs, details of which are set out below:

for all our new Directors.
He visited our ofﬁces in London, Aberdeen, 
Woking and Sharjah as well as attending site

on disclosure obligation, in Sharjah.
Marwan attended the London Business School’s 
Directors’ Forum during the ﬁrst half of 2012. 
This provided him the opportunity to work with 
leading ﬁgures from other companies’ boards 
and professional advisers, with the aim of 
developing his boardroom skills through role-play 
and sharing best practice.
Evaluation of Board effectiveness
Whilst I believe that our Board should continuously endeavour to 
improve its effectiveness, at the end of 2011 and start of 2012, 
I carried out one-to-one interviews with each Director using a set 
of pre-deﬁned questions. These questions focused on the themes 
identiﬁed during previous evaluations, such as strategy, risk, 
succession planning and governance, and sought to address any 
outstanding issues whilst highlighting areas for Board performance 
improvement. My aim was to address the activities and responsibilities 
of the Board as well as the Board committees. Each interview resulted 
in an open conversation, which gave sufﬁcient time for matters of 
concern to be raised and suggested areas of development to be 
discussed. My own appraisal was conducted by Rijnhard van Tets, 
our Senior Independent Director. Rijnhard did this through a series of 
interviews with our Executive and Non-executive Directors before 
meeting with me to present feedback. 
At the end of 2012, I conducted a further evaluation process on the 
same basis as last year. The Secretary to the Board and I collated the 
results of these interviews into a report and this was presented to the 
Board in February 2013. The outcome of this work will be presented 
in next year’s report. We plan to carry out an externally facilitated 
Board evaluation, in accordance with the UK Code, during 2013. 
The recommendations, actions and progress from recent evaluations 
are shown in the table opposite. 
As a result of the recent evaluations, I can conﬁrm that the 
performance of each Director was effective during the year and can 
conclude that the control and leadership required for a listed company 
is provided by the Board as a whole. 
72 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012
Governance
Corporate governance report continued Progress report on evaluation recommendations from both the external review in 2010 and the internal review in 2011:
Action Details Progress
More strategic discussion.
Greater regard to competitive environment 
when discussing strategy.
The Board continues to engage in the development of its strategic 
management and the time spent on strategy over the last three years has 
changed as follows: 2010: 15%  2011: 32%  2012: 31%
The increase is as a result of the introduction of a dedicated strategy day 
in May, a half day in December as well as regular strategic ‘deep dive’ 
presentations at other Board meetings. In addition, greater focus has been 
given to execution, with additional strategic reviews providing a deeper 
understanding of the Group’s operations and performance. Board papers 
relating to proposed projects are also now required to explain the strategic 
rationale for the matter under consideration.
Successful
Revisit the Group’s delegated authorities, 
so the Board uses its time more effectively.
A new delegated authority matrix was approved by our Board in 
November 2011.
Successful
Greater ﬁnancial detail requested to permit 
better consideration of the Group’s capital 
demands, future ﬁnancing plans and 
ﬁnancial structures.
Building on work achieved to date, we have increased the ﬁnancial 
information presented in the Group’s ﬁve-year plans. This has allowed the 
Board to participate in strategy and treasury related discussions in a more 
focused and concentrated way. 
Successful
Improvement to board papers, 
including delivery.
As a result of discussions held to establish the key considerations of the 
Directors, it was agreed that board papers should provide a pertinent 
summary of the matters under consideration, including strategic rationale, 
associated risks and ﬁnancial exposure. A board paper portal was also 
introduced during the year to facilitate the delivery of board materials. 
Successful
Articulate our risk appetite and signiﬁcant 
risks more effectively.
The 2011 evaluation highlighted the requirement for increased scrutiny of 
risks that prevent strategic delivery. A review of the Group’s risk framework, 
undertaken by the Board Risk Committee, resulted in the Board having 
greater clarity about the Group’s enterprise risk proﬁle. It has since sought 
to develop metrics to monitor trends for 13 areas of enterprise risk and the 
Board Risk Committee will review these metrics regularly. Further detail is 
shown on page 84.
Ongoing 
Focus more on succession planning. In 2011, considerable time was spent on the practical application of Board 
succession planning following the appointment of a new Chairman and 
two new Directors. Little time was given to wider succession planning, 
although the Nominations Committee broadened its remit from Board 
succession to the management layer below the Board. 
During 2012, executive succession planning was discussed at a granular 
level. In addition, reports have been submitted to the Nominations 
Committee covering succession planning and talent management initiatives 
for the entire organisation, such that the time spent on overall succession 
planning within the Nominations Committee has increased from 27% in 2011 
to over 35% in 2012.
Ongoing 
Crisis management. The development of crisis management planning and the Board’s role 
in such plans is seen as extremely important. Speciﬁc and targeted 
training initiatives are planned to ensure Directors are fully aware of 
their responsibilities.
In progress 
Understanding the brand. Following the appointment of a new Group Head of External Affairs 
during 2012, we recognise that there is an opportunity to reinforce the 
communication of our brand and the Group’s differentiated offering. Work 
with business development teams is progressing so that stakeholders’ 
views relating to potential opportunities can be fully understood.
In progress
73 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 What is our approach to shareholders 
re-appointing Directors?
In line with the UK Code, all Directors will seek re-appointment by 
shareholders at the 2013 Annual General Meeting (AGM). As required 
by the UK Code, the terms and conditions of appointment of all 
Directors are available for inspection by any person at our registered 
ofﬁce in Jersey and at our corporate services ofﬁce in London. 
They will also be available for inspection prior to the AGM to be 
held in London in May 2013.
Accountability
How does our Board formally satisfy 
itself that it has sound risk management 
and internal control systems?
The Board is responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of Petrofac’s 
risk management and internal control systems, including ﬁnancial, 
operational and compliance controls. The Board currently considers 
this by reference to the work undertaken during the year by both the 
Audit and Board Risk Committees. In addition to which, the Board 
also receives regular reports from members of management with 
responsibility for the Group’s material enterprise risks. At year-end, 
the Audit Committee provided our Board with a formal report on the 
effectiveness of the Group’s ﬁnancial and regulatory controls while the 
Board Risk Committee provides a formal report on the effectiveness 
of the Group’s risk management systems in relation to the Group’s 
enterprise risks and project and investment risks. These reports allow 
the Board to take a view on whether or not the Group has sound risk 
management and internal control systems in place. The Board is 
satisﬁed that sound risk management and internal control systems 
have been in place across the Group throughout 2012 and as at 
today’s date when the ﬁnancial statements were approved. Petrofac 
also seeks to have a sound system of internal control, based on the 
Group’s policies and guidelines, in all material associates and joint 
ventures. As with all companies, our systems of internal control and 
risk management are designed to mitigate and manage rather than 
eliminate business risk and can only ever provide reasonable, and not 
absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
How does our Board identify 
Petrofac’s signiﬁcant risks?
Management provides the Board, through the Board Risk Committee, 
with details of current signiﬁcant risks and how we plan to mitigate 
them. The risks that are considered signiﬁcant today are shown on 
pages 47 to 49. These risks are identiﬁed by reference to:
 risk matrices received from each of our individual service lines 
(bottom-up approach)
 the views of senior management (top-down approach)
Does our Board receive information 
which allows it to identify when delivery 
of its goals are under threat?
Ayman Asfari provides a full presentation on business operations 
at each face-to-face Board meeting, during which any possible 
impediments to the delivery of our Group goals are highlighted and 
discussed. The Board also receives a comprehensive written report 
from Tim Weller, at each face-to-face Board meeting, as well as 
periodic updates between such meetings. This ensures the Board 
is kept informed about the Group’s ﬁnancial performance for the 
year to date as compared with the year’s budget or the latest 
revised forecast, with explanations for any variances. The budget and 
ﬁve-year plans submitted to the Board incorporate risk analysis as 
a matter of course. In addition to ﬁnancial goals, we have strategic 
and operational goals and we continue to develop a broader set of 
ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial key performance indicators, which should 
assist us in monitoring delivery of these goals. 
Remuneration
How do we decide what 
Directors are paid?
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining the 
remuneration and terms of employment of Executive Directors as well 
as some members of senior management. This Committee is also 
responsible for determining the Chairman’s fees. A detailed report on 
the activities of the Remuneration Committee is provided on pages 88 
to 103. Responsibility for determining the remuneration payable to 
the Non-executive Directors lies with the full Board. The Executive 
Directors and I therefore effectively determine the fees payable to the 
Non-executive Directors albeit we take independent external advice. 
These fees are reviewed each year and further details are provided 
on page 93.
74 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012
Governance
Corporate governance report continued Recognising the importance of shareholder engagement, towards 
the end of the year I once again contacted investors, representative 
bodies and governance organisations offering them the opportunity 
to meet, with the aim of understanding their governance concerns. 
Accompanied by our Secretary to the Board and the Head of Investor 
Relations, we met three of our largest institutional shareholders and 
with two key voting and advisory services providers. Whilst areas 
of focus varied between meetings, succession planning, directors’ 
remuneration, risk awareness and HSE issues were raised as areas of 
particular interest. We welcome further engagement from institutions 
as they make progress in adopting the FRC stewardship code and 
the recommendations from the Kay Review published in July 2012.
A consultation exercise was also conducted by Thomas Thune 
Andersen, in his capacity as Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee, in early 2012. This entailed interaction with 24 major 
shareholders as well as three key advisory services providers and 
included a number of face-to-face meetings. The purpose of the 
consultation was to discuss remuneration policy, especially as this 
related to the introduction of our Value Creation Plan. Further details 
of this consultation process are discussed on page 96.
We place considerable importance on communication with our 
shareholders, including our employee shareholders, who all receive 
copies of our annual report and accounts and half-year reviews. 
This year we gave shareholders the choice of only receiving their 
communications in soft copy/electronic form. As at the year-end, 
over 13% of our shareholders had opted to receive their shareholder 
documents electronically. All shareholder documents, and all 
announcements made to the market, together with copies of 
presentations to analysts and interviews with Ayman are available 
on our website (www.petrofac.com), which we hope will encourage 
shareholders to become more informed investors.
Our Annual General Meeting (AGM)
Full details of this year’s AGM, which will be held in London, are set 
out in the Notice of AGM which accompanies this report and which 
is also available on our website. As a matter of good practice, we 
will conduct all resolutions on a poll and announce the results to 
the market as soon as possible after the meeting. All shareholders 
are invited to attend the Company’s AGM at which they have the 
opportunity to put questions to the Board and meet with those Board 
Directors able to attend. I look forward to seeing as many of you as 
possible this year when my colleagues and I will be available to 
answer your questions.

Relations with Shareholders
Who are our major shareholders?
Ordinarily, shareholders of Jersey-incorporated companies with a UK 
listing need only disclose their holdings if they hold voting rights of 5% 
or more in a company. However, our Articles of Association have been 
drafted so that any shareholder with 3% or more of our voting rights 
must disclose their holding, bringing us in line with UK-incorporated 
companies. Those shareholders with holdings of 3% or more at the 
year-end and as at the date of this report are as follows:
Number of 
ordinary shares
Percentage  
of issued  
share capital
Ayman Asfari and family 62,900,835 18.19
Maroun Semaan and family 28,217,864 8.16
How does our Board engage with our 
shareholders and make sure that it is 
aware of shareholders’ views? 
As a Board, we acknowledge our responsibilities to promote the 
success of Petrofac for many people but our principal focus is, of 
course, our shareholders. 
Ayman Asfari, Tim Weller and the investor relations team, headed by 
Jonathan Low, have a regular programme of meetings scheduled 
each year and conduct a series of individual meetings with existing 
and potential shareholders following our full and half year results and 
interim management statements. They also provide presentations to 
research analysts and institutional investors, including a question and 
answer session, following the announcement of our full and half year 
results. These presentations are broadcast live on our website and 
accordingly may be followed by all shareholders. In 2012, they held 
over 300 investor meetings, of which Ayman and/or Tim attended 
approximately 150 meetings. In addition, both Andy Inglis and 
Marwan Chedid joined a number of investor meetings during the year. 
I believe, therefore, that Ayman and Tim are each well placed to 
provide the rest of the Board with their insights into shareholder 
sentiment. All Directors receive brokers’ research notes from Jonathan 
and an update from our joint brokers at each Board meeting.

76 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 Dear shareholder
Following a recent period of change to 
our Board, the Nominations Committee 
has, over the last year, been able to 
concentrate on longer term succession 
planning at Board level and below. 
In doing so, we have been mindful of 
the continuing debate around diversity.
Petrofac appointed its ﬁrst external directors in the run up to the 
Company’s admission to listing on the London Stock Exchange in 
2005 and, as a consequence, the Company’s original Non-executive 
Directors stepped down from the Board in quick succession at the 
end of their respective terms in 2010 and 2011. The Committee has 
therefore spent signiﬁcant time over the last two years in search of 
new Non-executive Directors to refresh the Board. This exercise has 
now been completed following the appointment of René Médori in 
January 2012. At the same time, Marwan Chedid was appointed 
as an Executive Director. Whilst it is our policy for Non-executive 
Directors to serve for no more than six years, the Committee has 
decided to make an exception for Rijnhard van Tets and invite him to 
remain on the Board beyond the 2013 AGM. The Committee believes 
that after a period of signiﬁcant change, the Board would beneﬁt from 
Rijnhard continuing to serve as a Director. I am delighted that he has 
agreed to stay and I am grateful for his support and counsel in his role 
as Senior Independent Director.
Whilst succession planning for the Board has inevitably been less 
of an area of focus this year, we have still spent considerable time 
discussing this matter. Last year we stated that, excluding me, we 
aspired for the Board to be comprised of 15% women by 2013 and 
25% women by 2015. We explained that we would only be able to 
meet this aspiration by the appointment of female Non-executive 
Directors given our current pipeline of female executive talent. 
The Committee therefore worked extensively with Egon Zehnder 
International during 2012, with whom we have no other relationship, 
to identify appropriately qualiﬁed candidates. We remain conﬁdent 
that we will be able to meet our published target for 2013 in the near 
future. I would emphasise that any woman who is appointed to our 
Board will be appointed on merit.
During last year’s evaluation exercise Directors expressed the 
view that they wished the Board to spend more time focusing on 
succession planning below Board level. As you will see on page 73, 
we increased the amount of time spent on this vital part of our 
stewardship from 27% to over 35% between 2011 and 2012, 
with the Committee being the forum in which the Board has 
discharged this responsibility. 
Throughout the year, Geoff Tranﬁeld, our Group Director of HR 
provided the Committee with brieﬁngs about how the Group is 
building its capability in general. Details were given, at a granular level, 
on the evolving pipeline of talent and the effective processes being 
implemented to retain and attract talented individuals across the 
Group. Leadership development programmes continued throughout 
2012 and follow up modules, tailored to Petrofac’s speciﬁc needs, 
are being developed; which may include attendance by Committee 
members, who were very supportive of these programmes. 
Mr Tranﬁeld also provided the Committee with updates on the 
Group’s enhanced processes in relation to recruitment, performance 
management and talent management, designed to support the overall 
HR strategy of meeting our strategic aims and growth targets. 
The Board has determined it will monitor diversity through the 
Committee and, following the Committee’s recommendation, 
formally adopted a Diversity and Inclusion Policy at the end of 2012. 
Whilst we recognise that we have a gender imbalance within the 
Group, we are in many ways extremely varied with employees from 
more than 80 nations. We believe that this policy should help to 
promote and protect diversity, which we see as one of our key 
strengths and which draws upon the wider, recently enhanced Code 
of Conduct, details of which can be found on page 57. The adoption 
of this policy will be supported by communications and training 
programmes which are being rolled out across the Group in a phased 
manner over the next 12 to 18 months. Next year, we will review, 
explain and report further on diversity in accordance with the revised 
UK Corporate Governance Code, which will take effect for ﬁnancial 
years commencing on or after 1 October 2012. The Committee’s 
terms of reference were reviewed at the end of the year and it was 
agreed that they continue to conform to best practice and, as a result, 
they remain unchanged.

78 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 Dear shareholder
The Audit Committee’s main responsibility 
is to oversee our ﬁnancial reporting and, 
during 2012, the Committee’s agenda also 
included the consideration of matters 
which coincide with key events in our 
ﬁnancial reporting calendar. There were 
no changes in reporting standards that 
affected our ﬁnancial statements in 2012. 
As the business evolves and the IES 
division grows, the Committee will need 
to continue to stay abreast of the 
accounting implications for the Group.
In addition to the general matters considered during the year, focus 
was also given to:
 appropriateness of the Company’s non-audit services policy
 related party transactions
 solvency and going concern statements
 dividend payments, including compliance with Jersey legislation
 continuing the development between the Audit and Board Risk 
Committees, to ensure that the risk of any matter falling between 
the two committees is minimised
 monitoring progress on the implementation of our global Enterprise 
Resource Planning system 
 awareness of cyber security risks
In September 2012, the FRC published revised guidance in relation to 
audit committees which has been incorporated into the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and which will take effect for ﬁnancial years 
beginning after 1 October 2012. The Committee is fully aware of 
its current obligations and details of how the Audit Committee has 
discharged its responsibilities during the year are provided in this 
report. During the year, we reviewed our terms of reference. 
We agreed that they continue to conform to best practice and, 
as a result, remain unchanged from last year. It is likely they will 
be amended during 2013 to take account of the new governance 
reporting requirements.
The Audit Committee consists of four Independent Non-executive 
Directors and I consider that the Committee has an appropriate 
balance between those individuals with ﬁnance or accounting training 
and those from an oil and gas background. 
Rijnhard van Tets
Chairman of the Audit Committee
26 February 2013
79 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 Financial reporting
The Committee assists the Board in the effective discharge of its 
responsibilities for ﬁnancial reporting and internal control. As set out in 
our Directors’ statements on page 104, Directors are responsible for 
the preparation of Group ﬁnancial statements, in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and for being 
satisﬁed that they give a balanced and understandable view and 
provide the information necessary for stakeholders to assess the 
performance, business model and strategy of the Company. 
The Group has an internal control and risk management framework in 
place which permits the Company to prepare consolidated accounts. 
This includes policies and procedures to ensure that adequate 
accounting records are maintained and transactions accurately 
recorded to ensure the Company’s ﬁnancial reports and 
communications to the market give a clear and balanced assessment 
of the Company’s position.
During the year, the Committee considered and reviewed:
 2011 full-year and 2012 half-year ﬁnancial statements, including 
compliance with all ﬁnancial reporting requirements
 2011 annual ﬁnal results and 2012 half-year results announcements 
made to the London Stock Exchange
 any proposed announcements to be made by the Company to the 
extent that they contained material ﬁnancial information and which 
had not been considered by the whole Board
 revised accounting policies
 appropriateness of the Company’s non-audit services policy
 the Company’s application for a revolving credit facility 
 the dividend policy, including consideration of the solvency 
statement required under Companies (Jersey) Law 1991
 details of the Group’s related party transactions and whether these 
were executed on an arm’s length basis
 results of management’s assessments of the Group’s going concern 
and Group solvency position, including recommending to the Board 
that the going concern assessment was reasonable
In addition, we reviewed the 2012 full-year results and the Annual 
Report and Accounts at the start of 2013.
As part of these reviews, the Committee discussed with the Chief 
Financial Ofﬁcer and the external auditors all signiﬁcant accounting 
policies, estimates and judgements that had been adopted; any 
issues raised as part of the audit process were addressed during 
the year, as detailed in note 2 on page 113.
External auditors
Ernst & Young LLP (Ernst & Young), who have been the Company’s 
auditor since initial listing, provide the Committee with relevant 
reports, reviews, information and advice throughout the year as set 
out in their engagement letter. Their performance has been formally 
assessed by the Committee having due regard to their expertise, 
resourcing and independence. The Committee remains satisﬁed of 
their effectiveness. There are no contractual obligations restricting the 
Committee’s choice of external auditors and the Committee did not 
consider it necessary this year to conduct a tender process for the 
appointment of its auditors. In accordance with UK regulations, 
Ernst & Young adhere to a strict partner rotation policy based on the 
mandatory requirements of Auditing Practices Board Ethical Standard 
3. The Committee monitors this rotation and conﬁrms that a new lead 
audit partner will be appointed following the completion of the 2012 
audit. The Committee is aware of the recommendations set out by 
the FRC in the updated UK Governance Code in relation to audit 
tendering, which states that companies should put the external 
audit contract out to tender at least every ten years. It is understood 
that this provision has been drafted to enable audit committees to 
compare the quality and effectiveness of the services provided 
by all audit ﬁrms and, in accordance with suggested transitional 
arrangements, we believe this will be required by Petrofac at the 
end of the next partner rotation.
Non-audit services 
We have a non-audit services policy that sets out the circumstances 
where we may appoint our external auditors to undertake additional 
non-audit work. The Committee considered that the non-audit 
services policy remained appropriate and no amendments were 
proposed during the year. The current policy, a copy of which can be 
found on the Company’s website is summarised opposite. 
Management regularly provide the Committee with reports on the 
extent of non-audit services provided by our external auditors. 
These reports are reviewed at each Committee meeting and 
challenged, where necessary, to ensure such services fall within the 
agreed policy and do not impair the objectivity or independence of 
the auditors. The majority of the non-audit work carried out by the 
auditors during the year related to tax compliance services in the 
Middle East and North Africa jurisdictions and the Committee believes 
that, given their experience, Ernst & Young was the most appropriate 
supplier of this work. There were no breaches during the year of the 
US$300,000 threshold requiring prior approval by the Committee. 
Details of non-audit work carried out by Ernst & Young during 2012 
are provided in note 4e to the ﬁnancial statements. 
The non-audit fees have been monitored by the Committee 
throughout the year and, as a percentage of the overall audit fee 
for the year, the non-audit fees are 24% (2011: 32%).
80 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012
Governance
Audit Committee report continued Non-audit services policy
 The external auditors are automatically prohibited from carrying out 
work which might impair their objectivity.
 Tim Weller, CFO, will seek approval from the Committee before 
appointing the external auditors to carry out a piece of non-audit 
work where:
 – the fee is above US$300,000
 – total non-audit fees for the year are approaching 50% of the 
annual audit fee
 – the external auditors would ordinarily be prohibited from carrying 
out the work under the Company’s non-audit services policy, but 
not prohibited under Ethical Standard 5, and the CFO wants to 
appoint them due to exceptional circumstances
 The Chief Financial Ofﬁcer may appoint the external auditor to do 
other types of non-audit work as listed in the policy
Internal control systems
The Committee took responsibility for reviewing the Group’s internal 
controls as they relate to ﬁnancial matters, primarily through its 
engagement with our internal audit function. Our Group Head of 
Internal Audit, Ajit Nair, is responsible for providing assurances on 
the adequacy of internal control functions throughout the Group 
and attends each Committee meeting. At the start of the year the 
Committee agrees the annual internal audit plan, which is drawn up 
on a risk-based approach. Any signiﬁcant ﬁndings from internal 
control audits undertaken during the year have been appropriately 
investigated and the necessary actions taken to address and rectify 
any weaknesses that may have been identiﬁed. Ajit provides a 
progress report part way through the year, as a consequence of 
which, the plan may be revised. A ﬁnal report on the achievement of 
the plan is given at the end of each year. In February 2013 the 
internal audit department conﬁrmed it had completed 87 assignments 
across a broad cross-section of the Group’s activities during 2012. 
Whilst the internal audit department is appropriately resourced, 
the Committee has requested that Ajit seeks to broaden the 
department’s capabilities, such that it has individuals ﬂuent in Arabic, 
Spanish and Russian, especially as the Group expands into new 
geographies. It was further agreed that the 2013 audit plan should 
include a higher proportion of IES audits to reﬂect the growing 
signiﬁcance of this division. 
Cyber security 
There has been a great deal of external comment recently on cyber 
security and, in August last year, the UK Government published 
guidance to boards on this subject. During 2012, the Committee 
and Board Risk Committee held a combined meeting to consider 
the Group’s IT security. In line with our policy that the Board Risk 
Committee monitors operational risk while the Committee concerns 
itself with ﬁnancial controls, this matter was passed to the Board Risk 
Committee at the start of 2013. The Board Risk Committee has 
since received separate reports on the Group’s IT infrastructure 
and information management. In addition, it has included IT security 
within our enterprise risk proﬁle and as a matter of course, will 
therefore be provided with regular updates on IT security using key 
risk indicators. The Group will shortly be launching an IT security 
policy to all employees. 
Whistleblowing process
Details on the Company’s whistleblowing policy and our Speak Up 
programme are provided within the Board Risk Committee report on 
page 86. However, in accordance with our agreed process, any 
alleged breaches of the Code of Conduct relating to ﬁnancial matters 
would be provided to the Committee, with analysis of the issues 
reported together with details of any action being taken. All other 
matters are reviewed by the Board Risk Committee.
Training
Given that there were no changes to the accounting standards 
during the year which would impact the preparation of Petrofac’s 
2012 ﬁnancial statements, no speciﬁc training was provided to the 
Committee. However, members were encouraged to attend any 
external seminars run by professional advisers which were felt to be 
relevant and it has been conﬁrmed that future training topics for the 
Committee will be reviewed and reconsidered in early 2013.

Governance Dear shareholder
This year, following a busy 2011, the 
Committee has focused its attention on 
clarifying key elements of the Group’s 
enterprise risk proﬁle through the lens of 
a series of key risk indicators which have 
been reﬁned during the course of the 
year. Focus has been given to assurance 
and reporting as we ensure our risk 
management framework beds down 
throughout the organisation.
The Committee has overseen the effective deployment of the 
Company’s Delegation of Authorities (DoA), which was revised 
in 2011. The revised matrix sets out clearly those issues requiring 
Board approval and has helped to clarify the remit of the various risk 
review committees throughout the Group. 
I was delighted to welcome René Médori as a member of the 
Committee in January 2012. He brings considerable experience 
and expertise which I believe will broaden further the Committee’s 
perspective. A new Group Head of Enterprise Risk was appointed 
during the year whose primary remit is to assist the business units 
in implementing effective and consistent processes and controls 
across the Group, and facilitating risk management within our 
agreed framework. 
A great deal of support was received from management over the 
course of 2012, with all Executive Directors making themselves 
available to answer any question raised by the Committee. The new 
Group Head of Enterprise Risk, along with the Group Director Legal 
& Commercial Affairs, led the overall review of the Group’s risk 
management framework. Other members of the management team, 
including the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, Group Head of Compliance, 
Group Treasurer and Group Head of Security has each, during 2012, 
made presentations to the Committee. It is intended that this 
programme be expanded during 2013 to include presentations from 
other members of the management team, particularly around health 
and safety matters. Whilst the Board as a whole will continue to take 
responsibility in reviewing health and safety matters for the Group, 
it has been decided that the Committee will undertake periodic deep 
dives into certain health, safety and environmental management 
areas. The Group Director of HSSEIA attended the ﬁrst meeting of 
2013 to provide the Committee with a presentation on asset 
integrity assurance. 
As in previous years, the Committee reviewed the Group policies 
that cover non-ﬁnancial controls and received updates on business 
continuity planning, security and the Group’s insurance programme. 
The Committee uses the Internal Control: Guidance to Directors 
(formerly known as the Turnbull Guidance), as its main guidance for 
discharging its responsibilities as this assists in the application of the 
updated requirements introduced by the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (UK Code). During 2013 the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) 
intends to begin a consultation on the guidance, which was last 
revised in 2005, to determine whether further updates are required. 
The Committee will endeavour to participate in the consultation on 
the potential modiﬁcation of the guidance.
We believe that any framework of internal controls must be 
underpinned by values and a culture which promotes good risk 
management processes. We will continue to emphasise this. 
Petrofac has spent a substantial amount of time over the last few 
years considering its own circumstances and I believe that, while we 
still have work to do, our current processes and reporting capabilities 
provide us with an appropriate risk framework which we will continue 
to develop.
Stefano Cao
Chairman of the Board Risk Committee

83 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 Review of the Group’s risk 
management framework
The UK Code requires the Board to determine: “the nature and extent 
of the signiﬁcant risks it is willing to take in order to achieve its 
strategic objectives”. In August 2011 the FRC published a report 
‘Boards and Risk’ summarising the main issues to emerge from 
discussions with companies, investors and advisers on how boards 
were addressing risk and internal control. This report highlighted the 
need for clear differentiation between the roles of management and 
that of the Board and that when dealing with risk identiﬁcation and 
management, the Board should focus on those signiﬁcant strategic 
and external risks with the potential to cause damage to the ﬁnancial 
viability or reputation of the Company.
Recognising the evolving regulatory landscape and aiming to support 
Petrofac’s strategy for growth, the Committee continued its efforts 
during the year by developing the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 
programme which commenced in 2011. 
The ERM programme was advanced during 2012 by the appointment 
of a new Group Head of Enterprise Risk, who, following a business 
review, presented initial plans to the Committee to develop the 
ERM programme. These plans include: engaging and communicating 
on risk more effectively; bringing greater clarity to Petrofac’s 
risk management strategy and risk management framework; 
and, in accordance with recommendations made by the Committee, 
introducing further consistency to the process and language of risk 
and control across the business service lines. The diagram below 
sets out the overall ERM framework, which is explained in further 
detail below.
Risk management objectives
Petrofac’s restated objectives for managing risk are:
 to create an environment which promotes the long-term sustainable 
growth of the Group
 to articulate clear policy standards and deploy effective and efﬁcient 
processes
 to deﬁne clearly ownership and responsibilities for managing risk 
across the Group
 to create a risk-aware culture across the Group by informing, 
training and motivating employees to consider risk within their 
day-to-day decision making
 to deploy effective project risk management processes and controls 
across all business service lines 
 to provide transparency on Petrofac’s risk management approach to 
its Board and other key stakeholders
Enterprise Risk Management system
Throughout the year, the Committee has sought greater levels of 
consistency in the process and language used for risk assessment 
and reporting. An enterprise risk management system will be 
evaluated for implementation in 2013 with the aim of adding value 
through process simpliﬁcation (during risk identiﬁcation; assessment; 
management; monitoring; and reporting); and the production of 
clearer management information for decision makers at all levels 
of the Group.
Enterprise risk proﬁle
The key risks that could lead to a signiﬁcant loss of reputation 
or prevent us from delivering our strategic plan are captured in our 
enterprise risk proﬁle. The enterprise risk proﬁle is updated quarterly 
and is the means by which enterprise risks are reported to the Board. 
The Groups’ enterprise risk proﬁle is assessed through Key Risk 
Indicators (KRIs), (see pages 42 and 43 for a summary of these key 
performance indicators), which record exposure to potentially harmful 
events. The enterprise proﬁle seeks to identify and measure risk 
across risk types and monitor emerging trends and exposures. 
Further work is being undertaken to deﬁne these KRIs and, where 
possible, to identify leading indicators. 
Key Risk Register
Preparation of a Key Risk Register (KRR) also progressed during 
the year, comprising all Petrofac’s ‘critical’ and ‘signiﬁcant’ risks. 
The purpose of this is to (i) map speciﬁc risks to the risk proﬁle making 
those relationships more explicit; and (ii) promote and support the 
active management of important risks. The register will provide further 
clarity around ownership, accountability and mitigation strategies.

Governance
Board Risk Committee report continued Governance arrangements
Petrofac’s system of risk governance relies on a number of 
committees and management processes which bring together reports 
on the management of risk at various levels.
The governance process relies upon regular risk assessments and 
reviews of existing and new opportunities, by considering the risk 
exposure and appetite of each business unit service line and function. 
The diagram above sets out the risk governance structure in 
operation, showing the interaction between the various risk review 
and management committees. Terms of reference are in place for 
each individual committee. 
The Board retains ultimate responsibility for setting the Group’s risk 
appetite and reviewing the risks which the Board considers sufﬁciently 
signiﬁcant that they might prevent the delivery of strategy or threaten 
Petrofac’s continued existence. While the revised DoA has generally 
increased management’s authority with regard to routine business, 
the Board has increased its oversight of business in any new territory; 
joint venture arrangement; and contracts with novel technology, 
services or terms. 
The Board Risk Committee is constituted by the Board to assist 
it in discharging this responsibility. The Committee has responsibility 
for providing oversight and advice to the Board on the current risk 
exposures and future risk strategy and in doing so, is responsible 
for making recommendations to the Board in relation to the ERM 
framework, the Group’s risk appetite and tolerance in pursuit of 
business objectives; and for approval of the DoA. 
The Committee also assists the Board with the deﬁnition and 
execution of an effective risk management strategy and has 
responsibility for oversight of the Company’s compliance system of 
corporate standards, processes and procedures. In addition, the 
Committee provides the Board with assurance, on an annual basis, 
that the design and operating effectiveness of these systems remain 
ﬁt for purpose. 
The Group Risk Committee is a management committee 
constituted as the principal executive forum for the review of 
enterprise, project and investment risks, in accordance with the DoA 
approved by the Board. The Group Risk Committee (GRC) reviews all

The GRC is responsible for the assurance of the ERM framework

the application of the Board’s DoA.
Divisional Risk Review. Each division has a Risk Review Committee 
chaired by its Chief Executive which provides peer review of proposed 
projects and investments in accordance with the DoA approved by 
the Board. The committee reviews the risks and mitigation strategies 
in respect of new business opportunities or projects. Where required 
by the DoA, it then prepares appropriate materials for the GRC and 
ensures that no proposal is presented to the GRC without being 
reviewed and supported by the Divisional Risk Review Committee.

Risk governance framework
85 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 Business Service Line Review. Each of our individual businesses 
has its own business management system that incorporates risk 
management policies and procedures and produces its own risk 
register. Each business unit’s management team meets regularly 
and monitors risk as a matter of course, notes any change in 
risk assessment and seeks to take appropriate mitigating action. 
The risk registers for each business are formally reviewed each 
month by that business’ senior leadership team.
Risk appetite
As part of the review of our risk management framework, 
the Committee continued to believe that it should not apply 
a single aggregate risk appetite for the Group as a whole. 
The Group’s risk appetite is articulated in a number of ways, 
appropriate to the type of risk, and the Committee has continued 
to review the matter during 2012 to ensure that it is able to exercise 
appropriate stewardship. This can be seen in our Policy statements, 
which describe the Committee’s approach to each risk category; 
and our Policy standards, which describe acceptable controls and 
limits. Examples can be found in the Enterprise Risk Management 
Policy; the Sovereign and Financial Market Risk Policy; and the 
Operational and Contractual Risk Policy. 
In terms of concentration risk, our country entry assessments control 
entry into new territories. Business plans quantify maximum 
exposures in those territories through measures such as backlog, 
revenue and net income. Other risk appetite statements are 
embedded within our approach to issues such as: 
 earnings volatility – focusing on the deviation from expectations 
 credit headroom – for assessing liquidity risk
 deterministic scenarios focussing on speciﬁc project based 
opportunities (eg using IRR or net income) 
 reputation – focused on impact on stakeholders
During 2013 the Board will continue to review the Group’s 
Enterprise Risk Proﬁle, together with the evolving Key Risk Register. 
These documents will increasingly become the means by which the 
Group’s risk appetite and tolerance are deﬁned.
Assurance and reporting
The Committee has continued its work in relation to the Group’s risk 
management framework during 2012. Its primary areas of focus were 
developing further the assurance programme for the Group’s 
enterprise risk management system and ensuring the clarity and 
appropriateness of risk reporting through the chain of command.
Group Internal Audit has focused on providing assurance regarding 
ﬁnancial and regulatory controls and therefore continues to report 
solely to the Audit Committee as explained below.
Interface between the Board Risk 
Committee and Audit Committee
The Committee and Audit Committee both revised their respective 
terms of reference during 2011. As a result, the Committee has 
responsibility for assurance and oversight of enterprise risk 
management, while the Audit Committee has responsibility for 
assurance and oversight of ﬁnancial and regulatory controls. 
Whilst the Board has delegated the detailed work to these two 
Committees, it retains overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group 
has effective internal control and risk management and therefore 
receives regular reports on the work of the Committees from their 
respective chairmen. In addition, the Board retains ultimate 
responsibility for the Group enterprise risk proﬁle.
Bribery
The UK Bribery Act created a new corporate offence of failing to 
prevent bribery. Our Code of Conduct was updated in 2012 and 
relaunched in early 2013 and continues to make it clear that Petrofac 
does not permit the giving or receiving of bribes. Nevertheless, 
we have to ensure that we have in place adequate procedures, 
designed to counteract the risk of bribery in our value chain. 
The primary remit of our Group Head of Compliance is to ensure 
that employees are aware of and adhere to the Code of Conduct. 
He has initially focused on rolling out Petrofac’s standard for the 
prevention of bribery and corruption, including the implementation 
of an extensive educational and training programme and raising 
awareness of our ‘Speak Up’ programme. Online training, designed 
to communicate the existence of our standard and its key principles, 
was rolled out to an initial targeted population of 3,000 employees. 
By the end of 2012, approximately 5,000 employees across the 
Group had completed the anti-bribery training, with new employees 
being required to undertake the training within 90 days of joining the 
Group. Face-to-face anti-bribery training has been delivered to teams 
from Iraq, Turkmenistan and Algeria and there has been engagement 
with project teams in Nigeria and Mexico.
Whistleblowing
The Company’s whistleblowing policy is communicated to employees 
via the ‘Speak Up’ programme through the Company’s Code of 
Conduct. To provide further education and publicity, a global 
multi-language communication campaign was launched in each of 
our sites during 2012. The ‘Speak Up’ programme allows those who 
know, or have suspicions, of any breaches of the Code of Conduct 
to report the matter to a manager or anonymously contact the 
independent helpline by telephone or online without fear of reprisal or 
recrimination. Our international external facility has been available for a 
number of years and this service operates 24 hours a day, seven days 
a week. Access to the helpline was extended to third parties in 2012 
for the ﬁrst time. All matters reported are reviewed and assessed 
by our Group Head of Compliance, to determine whether further 
investigation is warranted and to ensure that appropriate action is 
taken. The Committee receives details of the issues reported together 
with any action being taken. Any alleged breaches relating to ﬁnancial 
compliance are dealt with by the Audit Committee.

Governance
Board Risk Committee report continued Group policies
In addition to the Code of Conduct, the Company currently has in place a number of policies, standards, and codes of practice. These are: 
Policy Articulates our attitude to risks related to:
Sovereign and Financial Market Risk Policy Country, inﬂation, commodity, liquidity, currency, credit and counterparty risk.
Ethical, Social and Regulatory Risk Policy Ethics, non-compliance with a country’s local laws and regulations.
Operational and Contractual Risk Policy Project performance, business continuity, leadership change and health, safety, security, 
environment and integrity assurance (‘HSSEIA’).
Enterprise Risk Management Policy All critical and signiﬁcant risks (Political; Economic; Strategic; Technological; Legal; 
Environmental, etc.); including key operational risks.
Health & Safety Policy Injury and ill-health; pursuing the goal of zero accidents and incidents; complying with 
all applicable health and safety laws and regulations; continual improvement of health and 
safety performance.
Environmental Policy Applicable environmental laws and regulations; minimising impact on the environment 
through pollution prevention, minimisation of waste and emissions and the efﬁcient use of 
energy and resources.
Asset Integrity Management Policy Asset integrity; maintaining appropriate standards; mitigating risks to prevent undesired events; 
transparency in reporting of the Company’s integrity assurance.
Security Policy Security of the business environment for the protection our people and our assets; 
minimising business loss and disruption; transparency in reporting of the Company’s 
security performance.
Guidelines for Acceptable use of 
Information Systems
Information generated by or entrusted to Petrofac; safeguarding conﬁdentiality and integrity; 
protecting information resources from theft, abuse, misuse and legal or regulatory exposures.
Quality Policy Our quality management systems; quality policy and standards as part of the management 
system framework; transparency in the reporting of the Company’s quality performance.
Security
Petrofac’s security department monitors the security environment in all 
countries of operation to ensure that adequate protective measures 
are in place. The security management system developed to protect 
personnel and assets across the Group remains consistent with the 
scale and geography of Petrofac’s operations, as detailed further on 
page 58. The Committee has closely followed events in the Middle 
East and North Africa (MENA) as a large proportion of our work is in 
the MENA region. During 2012 the Group suffered minimal disruption 
to its activities. Contingency planning for security-led evacuations 
and other security emergencies continues to be a high priority and 
this has been tested recently by events in Algeria. Our Group Head 
of Security provides regular updates to the Board and the Committee 
on the security status of each country.
Business continuity management
Hub ofﬁces in Sharjah, Aberdeen, Mumbai, Chennai, London, 
Woking and Kuala Lumpur, have business continuity management 
and disaster recovery plans in place and testing these plans has 
been completed for a number of these ofﬁces. As a result of recent 
growth in Malaysia, Business Impact Analysis is being updated in 
Singapore, Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur. 
Insurance
Petrofac commenced a review of insurance arrangements in 2011 
with the ultimate objective of conﬁrming that the programmes 
continue to be ‘Fit for Purpose’ given the recent changes in the scale 
and nature of the Group’s activities. Following a full tender exercise, 
Aon was appointed as the Group’s insurance broker and adviser in 
January 2012. During the course of the year speciﬁc recommendations 
were made in relation to the structure of the future insurance 
programme and these are in the process of being implemented.

Governance Dear shareholder
As Chairman of Petrofac’s Remuneration 
Committee, I am pleased to present the 
Directors’ Remuneration report following 
another year of strong performance.
2012 performance
As set out on page 3, Petrofac has continued to perform well during 
2012, delivering strong ﬁnancial performance and achievement of key 
strategic milestones.
In terms of ﬁnancial performance, we again achieved net proﬁt 
growth of 17% and are making good progress towards our target 
set out in 2011 of more than doubling Group 2010 earnings by 
2015. There was continued growth in our backlog to US$11.8 billion, 
which reﬂected major project wins in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, 
the UK and Mexico.
Notwithstanding this level of performance, the Committee sets 
stretching targets, and as a result, some of our operational and safety 
goals were not met. In general, performance against these measures 
was good, but we did not meet our own expectations in all respects. 
In particular, there were two fatalities of Petrofac contract workers, 
one at the Kauther site in Oman and one at the NGL4 site in the UAE. 
In addition, the achievement of some backlog targets was delayed as 
a result of slippage in the timing of certain contract tender processes 
during the year.
All of this was taken into account when we were determining 
annual bonuses. As a result, when coupled with strong individual 
performance, 2012 bonus outcomes were generally 75% – 85% 
of maximum.
Our three-year TSR and EPS performance over years 2010 to 2012 
was such that the 2010 PSP awards have been earned in full.
Shareholder consultation
Following consultation with major shareholders in early 2012, the 
Value Creation Plan (VCP) was approved at the 2012 AGM, with 
support received from almost 80% of our shareholders.
During the consultation, we took into consideration all comments 
received, and I am very grateful for the constructive and helpful 
feedback. As a direct result, we made several changes to the 
original proposal, including incorporating a number of performance 
underpins and substantial shareholding requirements for participants. 
We consider that these revisions help to support the underlying 
business objectives of the VCP , whilst also providing shareholders 
with additional comfort.
As a Committee, we recognise the difﬁcult environment surrounding 
executive remuneration at the current time and the relatively 
unconventional nature of the VCP . In this context, we are particularly 
appreciative of the extent of support received.
2013 proposals
Petrofac has a history of setting salaries at moderate levels, with 
emphasis placed on variable remuneration to ensure that individuals 
only receive substantial remuneration for exceptional performance 
and delivery of sustained, long-term shareholder value creation.
We believe that our existing remuneration framework remains 
appropriate for Petrofac, and accordingly, we will be making no 
changes to our policy. There have been moderate increases to 
Executive Director salaries in line with those determined for the 
wider workforce.
As a matter of course, the Committee considers executive 
remuneration matters with due reference to risk management 
and there are clear risk management measures within all of 
our incentive plans.
The Committee values all feedback from shareholders, 
and hopes to receive your support at the forthcoming AGM.
Thomas Thune Andersen
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
26 February 2013
89 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to 
the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) Regulations 2008 of the United Kingdom and relevant listing 
rules of the Financial Services Authority. The Committee takes 
responsibility for the preparation of the report, which is approved 
by the Board.
We fully support the focus on transparency set out in the new 
disclosure regulations for UK-listed companies proposed by the 
Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), which are 
due to take effect for ﬁnancial years ending after October 2013. 
Petrofac has voluntarily taken the opportunity to structure the 
2012 report to incorporate as many of the proposed features this 
year as practicable, while retaining all of the content required under 
the existing regulations. 
This report therefore contains:
1 A policy report which outlines Petrofac’ s proposed future 
remuneration policy; and
2 An implementation report which explains how our remuneration policy 
was implemented during 2012.
The sections of this report dealing with Directors’ emoluments and 
share interests (pages 97 to 103) have been audited by Ernst & 
Young, the Group’s external auditors.
At the time of publication, there remains a degree of uncertainty 
around how the binding vote on remuneration policy will operate in 
future years. As such, the Company has chosen to monitor how the 
regulations develop in this respect and does not intend to put the 
remuneration policy to a binding vote at the 2013 AGM.
Although not a requirement of Jersey law, shareholders will once 
again be invited to approve the entire remuneration report at the 
AGM on 17 May 2013. In accordance with the current regulations, 
the vote on this resolution is an advisory vote and will cover the 
remuneration policy and overall remuneration packages. Members of 
the Committee will be available at the AGM to answer shareholders’ 
questions regarding Directors’ remuneration.
The Board and the Committee consider that, throughout 2012 and 
up to the date of this report, the Company has complied with the 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (UK Code) relating 
to Directors’ remuneration. In addition, the guidelines issued by the 
Association of British Insurers (ABI) and the National Association of 
Pension Funds (NAPF) have been noted.
As set out above, the Committee considers executive remuneration 
matters in the context of alignment with risk management. 
Two members of the Board Risk Committee sit on the Committee 
which allows them to provide oversight on any Group risk factors 
relating to remuneration matters. The Committee believes that the 
remuneration arrangements in place do not raise health and safety, 
environmental, social or ethical issues, nor inadvertently motivate 
irresponsible behaviours.
Policy report: Summary of 2013 
remuneration policy
The Committee aims to establish a level of remuneration which:
 is sufﬁcient to retain, attract and motivate Executive Directors 
and key executives of the calibre required to achieve the 
Group’s objectives
 reﬂects the size, complexity and international scope of the Group’s 
business, together with an executive’s individual contribution and 
geographical location
The remuneration policy for Executive Directors and certain senior 
managers is as follows:
 basic salaries are generally median or below, against a relevant 
benchmarking group
 the variable elements of remuneration are structured so that 
individuals can achieve upper quartile total remuneration, subject 
to achievement of challenging performance standards
This remuneration policy has remained unchanged since 2007 and 
the Committee considers that it remains ﬁt for purpose and ensures 
that Executive Directors and senior managers are incentivised to 
deliver the Group’s strategic goals and long-term shareholder value.
The Committee believes that the most appropriate pay 
comparators are:
 for the Group Chief Executive and certain operational executives, 
a select group of international and UK oil and gas services 
companies (to the extent that data in relation to such companies 
is publicly available)
 for certain functional executives, FTSE companies of a similar size 
and complexity
The Committee also uses remuneration in UK companies of a similar 
size and complexity as an additional reference point when considering 
the remuneration of operational Executive Directors and senior 
managers.

92 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012
Governance
Directors’ Remuneration report continued Senior management remuneration
The remuneration policy for senior management is consistent with 
the values of the policy for the Executive Directors set out above and 
intentionally places signiﬁcant emphasis on variable remuneration. 
Remuneration, as for the wider workforce, is linked to the ﬁnancial 
and non-ﬁnancial performance metrics of the Group and each 
business service line and to appropriate individual objectives. 
Around 40 senior employees, who are essential to the success of the 
business, participate in the PSP and 12 key individuals (excluding the 
CEO and President) participate in the VCP . This framework promotes 
signiﬁcant alignment with shareholders and ensures that a substantial 
proportion of senior management remuneration is dependent on 
stretching, long-term performance goals.
A signiﬁcant proportion of Petrofac employees, including senior 
employees participate in the Deferred Bonus Share Plan (DBSP), 
under which they are required to defer a proportion of their cash 
bonus into Company shares. These contributions have historically 
been matched by the Company, on a 1:1 basis.
Subject to continued employment, invested and matching shares 
either vest over three years, usually on an annual pro rata basis or 
in full on the third anniversary of award. Executive Directors are not 
eligible to participate in the DBSP , except prior to joining the Board. 
Participation in the Restricted Share Plan (RSP) is not offered on a 
regular basis. Key employees may, however, receive awards under 
the RSP on their appointment to the Company. Awards are typically 
made to individuals who join the Company part way through the year 
in compensation for remuneration opportunities foregone elsewhere. 
Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in the RSP , except 
prior to joining the Board. 
Prior to their respective appointments as Executive Directors, 
Andy Inglis and Tim Weller both received awards under the RSP 
as part of the joining arrangements put in place to secure their 
appointments and Marwan Chedid participated in the DBSP .
Whilst Executive Directors do not participate in a pension plan, the 
Company operates a deﬁned contribution pension scheme for its 
UK employees. In line with new legislation, Petrofac will also be 
introducing pensions auto-enrolment to its UK workforce during 2013.
Recruitment policy
In cases where the Company hires a new Executive Director, the 
Remuneration Committee will use the above policy to determine the 
Executive Director’s ongoing remuneration package.
To facilitate recruitment, the Remuneration Committee may make a 
one-off award to ‘buy out’ incentives and any other compensation 
arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer. In doing 
so the Committee will ensure that any such awards would be on a 
comparable basis, taking account of all relevant factors including any 
performance conditions attached to those awards, the likelihood of 
those conditions being met, the proportion of the vesting/performance 
period remaining and the form of the award.
In determining whether it is appropriate to use such judgement, the 
Committee will ensure that any awards made are in the best interests 
of both Petrofac and its shareholders and will give due regard to all 
relevant factors (including quantum, the nature of remuneration and 
the jurisdiction the candidate was recruited from).
The Committee is at all times conscious of the need to pay no more 
than is necessary.

93 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 Performance measures
Petrofac strives to align the performance measures under the PSP 
with the long-term strategy of the Company. The PSP is based upon 
TSR and EPS performance metrics in which the Committee considers 
strong performance should result in long-term sustainable shareholder 
value creation (as detailed in the policy table on page 92).
Relative TSR remains the best measure of the Company’s ultimate 
delivery of shareholder returns and ensures that the Company must 
outperform its most important competitors in order for Executive 
Directors to receive signiﬁcant levels of remuneration.
EPS is the most relevant indicator of the underlying ﬁnancial 
performance of Petrofac and is the measure most closely linked to 
value creation in the oil and gas services business.
Executive Director awards subject to performance conditions
Under its remuneration policy, the Company only makes awards of 
variable remuneration to Executive Directors that are subject to 
stretching performance conditions.
Further information
Remuneration mix and performance scenarios
A signiﬁcant proportion of Petrofac’s total remuneration 
package is variable. There is a particular emphasis on long-term 
share-based incentives, to align closely Directors’ interests with 
shareholders’ interests. The balance between ﬁxed (basic salary, 
beneﬁts and cash allowances) and variable (annual bonus and PSP) 
elements of remuneration varies depending on performance.
The chart below provides an illustration of expected remuneration for 
Executive Directors at three levels of performance: below threshold, 
target and maximum. All Executive Directors have the same structure 
of remuneration package, and therefore an individual’s graph would 
have a similar shape to that shown below. The actual outcome may 
differ from that shown, depending on a number of factors, including 
Company share price growth.

* The graph above reﬂects the mix between ﬁxed and variable pay. For 
information, at ‘target’ performance, ﬁxed pay would equate to approximately 
42% of total remuneration, with bonus and PSP equating to 36% and 22% of 
total remuneration, respectively. At maximum performance, ﬁxed pay would 
equate to approximately 22% of total remuneration, with bonus and PSP each 
equating to 39% of total remuneration.
For the purposes of the chart above, the following assumptions have 
been made:
 beneﬁts – amount received by the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer in 2012
 target annual bonus – 50% of maximum (i.e. 100% of base salary)
 maximum annual bonus – 200% of base salary
 target vesting under the PSP – 30% of maximum (i.e. 60% of base 
salary)
 maximum vesting under the PSP – 200% of base salary
 no share price growth or dividend accrual assumptions have been 
incorporated under the PSP
 the VCP has been excluded as it is a one-off plan and does 
not form part of the Company’s ongoing remuneration policy
Service contracts and exit payment policy
Executive Directors have 12-month rolling service contracts with the 
Company and are contractually restricted to a termination payment 
equal to 12 months’ salary and beneﬁts.

  Maroun Semaan’s contract was varied on 1 December 2011 to reﬂect his 
new role as President. 
None of the Executive Directors is subject to a contractual retirement 
date. New appointments will normally be made on a one-year 
rolling contract. The Company may terminate employment by making 
a payment in lieu of notice equivalent to the value of base salary and 
beneﬁts in respect of the notice period. The Company would normally 
expect Executive Directors to mitigate any loss upon their departure. 
In addition, Maroun Semaan and Marwan Chedid, as UAE resident 
Executive Directors, are entitled by local statute to receive a cash sum 
(called an end of service indemnity payment) from their employer on 
the termination of their employment within the UAE. Such payments 
are due to all non-UAE national employees working in the UAE and 
are based on years of service and salary. Further details are provided 
on pages 97 and 139.

Wider workforce remuneration
When determining remuneration arrangements for Executive 
Directors, the Committee takes into consideration, as a matter of 
course, the pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group.
In particular, the Committee paid speciﬁc attention to the level of 
salary increases and the size of the annual bonus pool in the wider 
population, with particular reference to the year-on-year change in 
these ﬁgures.
For 2013, UK and UAE wider workforce salary increases are around 
4% and 6% respectively. UK-based Executive Director salary 
increases are c. 3% – 4%. For Marwan Chedid, a UAE-based 
Executive Director, the salary adjustment is c. 6%. All of these 
increases are broadly in line with the wider employee population 
in the relevant local market.
The total remuneration for the CEO decreased year-on-year by 
c.15%, primarily due to the lower absolute number of shares 
awarded under the PSP in 2010 that were earned in the period to 
31 December 2012. The total remuneration ﬁgure calculated for 
2012 for the CEO is on the basis of our current understanding of 
the BIS ‘single-ﬁgure’ methodology, detailed on page 97.
Within our highly competitive sector, there is upward pressure on 
remuneration levels at all grades. The Committee is aware that 
securing increasingly sought-after key talent is critical to the continued 
success of Petrofac. As such, some areas of the business are 
experiencing signiﬁcant pay inﬂation, and in these locations, wider 
workforce increases are considerably ahead of those received by 
the Executive Directors.
All-employee annual bonus arrangements are aligned with those 
of the Executive Directors, ensuring that individuals throughout the 
Company are incentivised towards consistent business goals and 
objectives, with annual bonuses subject to Company and individual 
performance targets. 
Approximately one-third of employees participate in the DBSP , under 
which they are required to defer a proportion of their cash bonus into 
Company shares. Awards may also be made under the RSP to key 
employees from time to time. Further information on these plans is 
outlined on page 93. 
The Company also operates a UK tax-approved Share Incentive Plan 
(SIP). Under the SIP , eligible employees may invest up to £1,500 of 
gross salary per tax year to purchase ordinary shares. There is no 
holding period for these shares. The Company does not make awards 
of Matching or Free Shares under the SIP . Participation is offered to 
all UK resident employees, including Executive Directors. Tim Weller 
contributes the maximum amount each month to buy shares under 
this plan.
As a result of the Company’s share incentive plans, as well as shares 
owned and purchased by employees prior to and since IPO, Petrofac 
is proud of the signiﬁcant levels of share ownership within the 
Company and we consider that this helps drive performance 
throughout the business.
The Committee has noted the proposal put forward in the BIS 
regulations for companies to disclose whether the wider workforce 
was consulted in drawing up the remuneration policy presented in this 
report. While the Company does not directly consult with employees 
as part of the process of reviewing executive pay, the Committee 
does receive feedback from employee engagement surveys and 
takes this into account when reviewing executive pay.

For information purposes, the following table shows the percentage

For the purposes of the chart above, the following deﬁnitions have 
been used:
 dividends – dividends per share paid in respect of the ﬁnancial year

Shareholder context
The Company places great emphasis on our relationship with 
shareholders, and recognises the importance of clear and full 
consultation on all aspects of remuneration and governance at Petrofac.
In early 2012, a total of 24 major shareholders and three shareholder 
representative bodies were consulted in relation to a number of 
executive remuneration matters.
The consultation included details on:
 introduction of the Value Creation Plan
 2012 salary increases and 2011 annual bonus amounts 
 remuneration arrangements for Marwan Chedid upon appointment 
to the Board in January 2012
Key shareholders were invited to attend brieﬁng sessions on these 
proposals and we greatly appreciate the number who took up this 
opportunity. Following these meetings we entered into further dialogue 
with shareholders and were grateful for the constructive and helpful 
feedback received. The Committee considered all commentary 
received and, as a direct result, made a number of changes to the 
Value Creation Plan proposal. These changes provided shareholders 
with additional comfort and assurance from a risk management 
perspective that participants would only receive value if underlying 
Company performance was strong.
The Committee is pleased to note that the 2011 Directors’ 
Remuneration Report received a vote in favour from over 97.5% 
of shareholders at the 2012 AGM. In addition, the resolution on 
the introduction of the Value Creation Plan received support from 
almost 80% of shareholders.
The Committee continues to monitor shareholder views when 
evaluating and setting ongoing remuneration strategy, and commits 
to consulting with shareholders prior to any signiﬁcant changes to 
our remuneration policy.

  All taxable beneﬁts received in 2012. UK-resident Executive Directors receive private health insurance, life assurance and long-term disability insurance. 
Ayman Asfari’s beneﬁts primarily relate to the employment of a personal assistant who spends part of her time in the administration of his personal affairs. 
UAE-resident Executive Directors receive similar beneﬁts to UK-resident Executive Directors and in addition receive other typical expatriate beneﬁts, such as 
children’s education and return ﬂights to their permanent home.

  UK-resident Executive Directors receive a cash allowance in place of beneﬁts including, but not limited to, car allowances and pension contributions. 
Directors do not receive pension contributions from the Company. UAE-resident Executive Directors receive a cash allowance in respect of housing and 
transport, in line with local market practice.

  Full cash bonus awarded in respect of ﬁnancial year 2012.
5
  UAE-resident Executive Directors are required by local statute to receive an end of service indemnity payment. Such payments are due to all non-UAE national 
employees working in the UAE and are based on years of service and salary. These sums will be payable by the Company only on termination of the individual’s 
employment from the UAE. The amounts disclosed are the increase in entitlement beneﬁt for 2012. The total amounts retained in respect of Maroun Semaan 
and Marwan Chedid are US$984,256 and US$854,749 respectively.

  UK-based Directors are paid in sterling. Amounts have been translated to US dollars based on the prevailing rate at the date of payment or award with the 
exception of the bonus amounts, which have been translated using the average exchange rate for the year of £1:US$1.5866.
11
  Non-executive Directors receive a basic fee of £60,000 per annum, and an additional fee of £14,000 per annum for acting as a Chairman of a Board Committee. 
Both of these fees are unchanged since 1 January 2011. Since appointment as Non-executive Chairman in May 2011, Norman Murray has received a fee of 
£230,000 per annum. Following a review of the time commitment required for this role, this fee was increased to £270,000, effective from 1 July 2012.
97 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 Individual elements of remuneration
Basic salary
In 2012, in line with the relevant local market, Executive Directors 
received salary increases of 5% effective from 1 January 2012.
In determining salaries for 2013, the Committee has taken into 
consideration a number of factors, including the level of salary 
increases in the wider workforce, internal and external positioning 
and the general economic climate.
The Committee also recognises that Petrofac has continued to 
perform strongly during the year and accordingly, the Committee 
proposes to increase salaries by c. 3% – 4% for UK-based Executive 
Directors, effective from 1 January 2013. For Marwan Chedid, a 
UAE-based Executive Director, the salary adjustment proposed is 
c.6%, recognising his strong performance since appointment to 
the Board. All increases are broadly in line with the wider employee 
population in the relevant local market, as outlined on page 95.
The table below shows base salaries proposed for 2013, and those 
paid in 2012.

Beneﬁts in kind and cash allowance in lieu of pension
Details of beneﬁts in kind are provided in the table on page 97. 
In 2012, cash allowances for all Executive Directors were held 
at the same level as in 2011. With effect from 1 January 2013, 
the Committee has increased cash allowances for all UK-based 
Executive Directors by £5,000, and for Marwan Chedid,  
a UAE-based Executive Director, by US$ 20,000. 
The table below shows cash allowances for 2013 and those paid

Annual bonus
For 2012, in line with the stated policy, the Committee set the 
maximum bonus potential at 200% of basic annual salary. In January 
2013, the Committee determined whether to award each Executive 
Director a cash bonus in respect of 2012. In doing so, the Committee 
considered the extent of achievement of Executive Directors against a 
balanced scorecard of metrics, including:
 HSE and integrity measures 
 ﬁnancial performance, including net income, backlog and costs
 Group and (where relevant) business service line strategic and 
operational performance measures and
 people-related measures
In addition, some Executive Directors have targets related to 
succession planning, risk management and the development and 
implementation of the Group’s CR programme. In this way, the 
Committee considers that it has an incentive structure for senior 
management that promotes responsible behaviour.
The Committee awarded bonuses of between 153% and 171% of 
salary to Ayman Asfari, Marwan Chedid, Andy Inglis and Tim Weller, 
in recognition of strong ﬁnancial performance and achievement of key 
strategic milestones.
In terms of ﬁnancial performance, net proﬁt growth was again in excess 
of 15% and good progress was made towards the target set out last 
year of more than doubling Group 2010 earnings by 2015. There was 
continued growth in our backlog to US$11.8 billion, which reﬂected 
major project wins in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, the UK and Mexico.
Notwithstanding this level of performance, the Committee sets 
stretching targets and, as a result, some operational and safety goals 
were not met. In general, performance against these measures was 
good, but expectations were not met in all respects. In particular, 
there were two fatalities and the achievement of some backlog targets 
were delayed as a result of slippage in the timing of certain contract 
tender processes during the year. 
The table below sets out 2012 annual bonus awards made to 
Executive Directors.

Vesting of 2010 PSP award
The performance period for the 2010 PSP award ended on 31 December 2012. The structure and vesting schedule for this award is consistent 
with that set out in the PSP section of the remuneration policy table on page 92.
Half of the award was based on relative TSR performance against the peer group companies set out below:
Aker Solutions Fluor Corporation Maire Tecnimont Technip
AMEC Foster Wheeler Saipem Tecnicas Reunidas
Chicago Bridge & Iron Co. Halliburton Schlumberger Wood Group (John)
Entrepose Contracting JGC SNC-Lavalin Group WorleyParsons
Over the performance period, Petrofac outperformed the index by 38%, which will result in 100% of this element of the award vesting.
The remaining half of the award was based on EPS growth. Over the performance period, Petrofac’s EPS growth was 22% over the period. 
EPS growth of 20% per annum was required for full vesting. Accordingly, this performance will result in 100% of this element of the 
award vesting.
Overall, for PSP awards made in 2010, 100% of the award is due to vest on 19 March 2013. The Committee also gave consideration to the 
strength of underlying Company performance, and determined that no reduction in the overall vesting level was required.

promotion to the Board.
2012 Value Creation Plan award
The Value Creation Plan (VCP) was approved by shareholders at the 2012 AGM. Awards of premium-priced share options were then made 
under the VCP to key individuals with responsibility for driving business growth, including three Executive Directors. Summary information on the 
VCP is laid out for your reference below. Further information is provided in our 2011 Directors’ Remuneration Report and our 2012 Notice of 
AGM, both of which are available on our website at www.petrofac.com.
As stated on page 96, the VCP is closely aligned with our policy of aligning executive and shareholders’ interests and providing upper quartile 
remuneration where challenging standards are met while paying basic ﬁxed remuneration at median or below. Participants in the VCP will only 
gain signiﬁcant amounts of reward through the VCP for the delivery of very stretching Group, and in some cases, additional business service 
line, performance targets, which would likely result in the creation of substantial shareholder value. VCP awards granted to the Executive 
Directors on 18 May 2012 are set out in the table below.

  The core award represents the value of the award on a face value basis, prior to application of the divisional/business service line multiplier, which can reduce or 
increase vesting by 0.5x to 1.5x. Tim Weller does not have a divisional/business service line multiplier and therefore this represents his maximum award. At grant, 
options were valued at 19.5% of face value using a recognised simulation model, which translates into a face value award of roughly ﬁve times expected value.
2
  The face value of the option award is based upon the maximum numbers of shares that may vest subject to the achievement of stretching targets including, 
where relevant, the impact of the divisional/business service line multiplier.
3
  The share price used for setting the exercise price was 1555 pence. This represents the average closing price over the ﬁve-day period immediately prior to the 
date of grant.
99 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 Performance conditions
Before any VCP share option award can be exercised, there are ﬁve distinct stretching performance measures that must be achieved. 
Performance condition Details
Exercise price The exercise price for the awards was set at 1710.28 pence, a 10% premium to the Company’s share price at grant. 
Accordingly, share price growth of at least 10% must be achieved before participants realise any value.

Malus The Committee may reduce vesting outcomes in certain circumstances prior to the vesting date.  
These include material mis-statement of results and misconduct under the Company’s Code of Conduct.
Additional performance 
safeguards
At each vesting date, the Committee will also evaluate performance taking full account of the following safeguards:
 HSE and ethical performance;
 EPS growth consistent with PAT growth; 
 positive economic proﬁt performance;
 TSR performance against peers (no vesting below median); 
 delivery of Board-approved business plan; and
 any other material factors impacting risk management.
Following the end of the four-year performance period (2012 to 2015), shares will vest in equal tranches on the fourth, ﬁfth and sixth 
anniversaries of grant, only to the extent that performance conditions have been satisﬁed, with full vesting only occurring six years after award.
Shareholding guidelines and interests in shares
As a result of discussions with shareholders in relation to the VCP , the Committee introduced a shareholding requirement of 300% of base 
salary for those Executive Directors participating in the plan. Ayman Asfari and Maroun Semaan are not VCP participants and therefore do not 
have a formal shareholding requirement. However, these two individuals already have substantial shareholding interests in the Company, 
signiﬁcantly in excess of the required levels as set out in the table below.
Until these shareholding guidelines have been met, Executive Directors are also encouraged to retain vested shares earned under the 
Company’s incentive plans. Current shareholding requirements and the number of shares held by Directors are set out in the table below:

  These include exceptional one-off awards made to Andy Inglis and Tim Weller under the RSP at the time of their appointments, prior to them joining the Board. 
Also included are the shares awarded under the DBSP to Marwan Chedid prior to his appointment as an Executive Director.
3
  Relevant Executive Directors are expected to build up a shareholding of three times salary over a period of ﬁve years from appointment. Andy Inglis was appointed 
as an Executive Director on 1 March 2011 and Tim Weller was appointed as an Executive Director on 13 October 2011. Whilst at this stage both individuals have 
yet to meet the shareholding requirement, they have both taken steps to acquire shares since their appointment. Marwan Chedid’ s shareholding requirement has been 
met in full. For the purposes of determining Executive Director shareholdings, the individual’ s salary and the share price as at 31 December 2012 (1623 pence) has been 
used. Although neither Ayman Asfari nor Maroun Semaan have formal shareholding requirements, both substantially exceed the target set for the Executive Directors.

ﬁnance functions.
In addition, the Committee received support during 2012 from legal 
advisers Norton Rose, who provided advice on certain matters 
relating to current and future compensation and beneﬁts. Norton 
Rose also provided formal advice on share plan matters to the 
Company during the year. 
The following individuals, none of whom were Committee members,

  Dividends awarded on shares granted under the share plans are reinvested to buy further shares.
2
  The award amounts disclosed under the PSP are the maximum number that can vest subject to the performance conditions attached to awards. The PSP 
performance conditions under which these awards would vest in full are explained on page 92.
3
  The performance conditions for the March 2009 PSP award were satisﬁed and the award vested in full on 19 March 2012 when the share price was 1705 pence. 
4
  Following his appointment to the Board on 19 January 2012, no further awards will be made to Marwan Chedid under the DBSP . On 19 March 2012, Marwan 
Chedid’s 2009 DBSP award vested in full and a third of his 2010 and 2011 DBSP awards also vested. The closing share price on 19 March 2012 was 1705 
pence.
5
  Shares awarded on 14 May 2010 have satisﬁed their performance conditions in full and are due to vest at 100% on 19 March 2013. Based on a share price of 
1,589 pence, which is the share price at 22 February 2013 (being the latest practicable date prior to the adoption of this Report by the Committee), the value of the 
awards made to the current Executive Directors would be as follows: Ayman Asfari: £1,496,345, Maroun Semaan: £1,127,380 and Marwan Chedid: £318,118.
6
  Shares awarded under the PSP on 19 March 2011 and 19 March 2012 are not due to vest until 19 March 2014 and 19 March 2015, respectively. It is too early, in 
the Committee’s opinion, to provide shareholders with a meaningful assessment to the extent that these shares will vest, if at all.
7
  Shares awarded under the RSP on 5 January 2011 and 6 September 2011 are not subject to performance conditions and will vest in equal annual tranches over 
three years from the date of grant, subject to continued employment.
8
  A total of 21,459 of these shares were originally due to vest under the RSP on 5 January 2013, but were delayed as a result of the Company being unable to deal 
at that time.

  The share price used for setting the exercise price of these awards was 1555 pence, which represents the average closing price over the ﬁve-day period 
immediately prior to the date of grant. The ﬁgure disclosed here is the market share price on the date of grant.
The Company’s share price at the end of the ﬁnancial year was 1623 pence and the market price during the year was in the range of 
1346 pence to 1772 pence. 
Loss of ofﬁce payments
No Director left the Board during 2012.
Sums paid to third parties in respect of Executive Directors’ services
No sums were paid to third parties in respect of any Executive Director’s services (2011: nil). 
External appointments
Executive Directors are normally entitled to accept one non-executive appointment outside the Company with the consent of the Board. 
Any fees received may be retained by the Director. As at the date of this report, Tim Weller is a non-executive director with The Carbon Trust 
and BBC Worldwide, for which he received £17,000 and £40,800 respectively in fees during the year. Tim Weller will step down from the BBC 
Worldwide board during March 2013 and will join the board of G4S plc as a non-executive director on 1 April 2013.

103 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012 Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and 
the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations. The Directors have chosen to prepare the ﬁnancial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS). The Directors are also responsible for the 
preparation of the Directors’ remuneration report, which they have 
chosen to prepare, being under no obligation to do so under Jersey 
law. The Directors are also responsible for the preparation of the 
corporate governance report under the Listing Rules.
Jersey Company law (the ‘Law’) requires the Directors to prepare 
ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial period in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. The ﬁnancial statements 
are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Company at the period end and the proﬁt or loss of the 
Company for the period then ended. In preparing these ﬁnancial 
statements, the Directors should:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently
 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent
 specify which generally accepted accounting principles have been 
adopted in their preparation
 prepare the ﬁnancial statements on a going concern basis unless it 
is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in 
business
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records 
which are sufﬁcient to show and explain the Company’s transactions 
and as such as to disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
ﬁnancial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the 
ﬁnancial statements prepared by the Company comply with the Law. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and ﬁnancial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in Jersey governing the preparation and 
dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
Directors’ approach
The Board’s objective is to present a balanced and understandable 
assessment of the Company’s position and prospects, particularly in 
the annual report, half year report (formerly the interim report) and 
other published documents and reports to regulators. The Board has 
established an Audit Committee to assist with this obligation.
Going concern
The Company’s business activities, together with the factors likely to 
affect its future development, performance and position are set out in 
the business review on pages 26 to 40. The ﬁnancial position of the 
Company, its cash ﬂows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities 
are described in the ﬁnancial review on pages 44 to 46. In addition, 
note 31 to the ﬁnancial statements include the Company’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing its capital; its ﬁnancial risk 
management objectives; details of its ﬁnancial instruments and 
hedging activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Company has considerable ﬁnancial resources together with 
long-term contracts with a number of customers and suppliers 
across different geographic areas and industries. As a consequence, 
the Directors believe that the Company is well placed to manage 
its business risks successfully despite the current uncertain 
economic outlook.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting in preparing the annual ﬁnancial statements.
Responsibility statement under the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules
Each of the Directors listed on pages 62 and 63 conﬁrm that to the 
best of their knowledge:
 the ﬁnancial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRS, give a 
true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position and proﬁt 
of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and
 the operating and ﬁnancial review includes a fair view of the 
development and performance of the business and the position of 
the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face.

Independent auditor’s report to the members of Petrofac Limited 
 
We have audited the Group financial statements of Petrofac Limited 
for the year ended 31 December 2012 which comprise the 
consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of financial 
position, the consolidated statement of cash flows, the consolidated 
statement of changes in equity and the related notes 1 to 32. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in 
their preparation is applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards. 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) Law 
1991 and our engagement letter dated 15 February 2011. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as 
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement 
set out on page 104, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the Group financial statements and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the Group financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
In addition the Company has also instructed us to: 
 report as to whether the information given in the Corporate 
Governance Statement with respect to internal control and risk 
Management systems in relation to financial reporting processes 
and about share capital structures is consistent with the financial 
statements 
 review the Directors’ statement in relation to going concern as set 
out on page 104, which for a premium listed UK incorporated 
company is specified for review by the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Services Authority 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-
financial information in the Annual report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become 
aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies 
we consider the implications for our report. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the Group financial statements: 
 give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 
31 December 2012 and of its profit for the year then ended 
 have been properly prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards and 
 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 
Opinions on other matters 
In our opinion, the information given in the Corporate Governance

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
For the year ended 31 December 2012 
1 Corporate information 
The consolidated financial statements of Petrofac Limited 
(the ‘Company’) for the year ended 31 December 2012 were 
authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the 
Directors on 26 February 2013. 
Petrofac Limited is a limited liability company registered and 
domiciled in Jersey under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 
and is the holding company for the international group of Petrofac 
subsidiaries (together the ‘Group’).The Company’s 31 December 
2012 financial statements are shown on pages 152 to 165. 
The Group’s principal activity is the provision of services to the 
oil and gas production and processing industry. 
The principal Group companies, and joint venture entities, 
are contained in note 32 to these consolidated financial statements. 
2 Summary of significant accounting 
policies 
Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a 
historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments 
which have been measured at fair value. The presentation currency 
of the consolidated financial statements is United States dollars and 
all values in the financial statements are rounded to the nearest 
million (US$m) except where otherwise stated. 
Statement of compliance 
The consolidated financial statements of Petrofac Limited and its 
subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and applicable requirements 
of Jersey law. 
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial 
statements of Petrofac Limited and its subsidiaries. The financial 
statements of its subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting 
year as the Company and where necessary, adjustments are made 
to the financial statements of the Group’s subsidiaries to bring their 
accounting policies into line with those of the Group. 
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control 
is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the 
date on which control is transferred out of the Group. Control is 
achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial 
and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits 
from its activities. All intra-Group balances and transactions, 
including unrealised profits, have been eliminated on consolidation. 
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries consolidated by the Group 
are disclosed separately from the Group’s equity and income 
statement and non-controlling interests are allocated their share 
of total comprehensive income for the year even if this results 
in a deficit balance. 
New standards and interpretations 
The Group has adopted new and revised Standards and 
Interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (IASB) and the International Financial Reporting 
Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) of the IASB that are relevant to its 
operations and effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2012. The following new amendments and enhanced 
disclosures did not have any current impact on the financial position, 
performance, or disclosures of the Group: 
 IAS 12 Income Taxes (Amendment) – Deferred Taxes: Recovery 
of Underlying Assets effective 1 January 2012 
 IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures – Enhanced 
Derecognition Disclosure Requirements effective 1 July 2011 
 
Standards issued but not yet effective 
Standards issued but not yet effective up to the date of issuance 
of the Group’s financial statements are listed below and include only 
those standards and interpretations that are likely to have an impact 
on the disclosures, financial position or performance of the Group 
at a future date. The Group intends to adopt these standards when 
they become effective. 
IAS 1 Financial Statement Presentation – Presentation 
of Items of Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) 
The amendments to IAS 1 change the grouping of items presented 
in OCI. Items that could be reclassified (or ‘recycled’) to profit 
or loss at a future point in time (for example, upon derecognition 
or settlement) would be presented separately from items that will 
never be reclassified. The amendment affects presentation only 
and has therefore no impact on the Group’s financial position or 
performance. The amendment becomes effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 July 2012. 
IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements (as revised in 2011) 
As a consequence of the new IFRS 10 and IFRS 12, what remains 
of IAS 27 is limited to accounting for subsidiaries, jointly controlled 
entities, and associates in separate financial statements. 
The amendment becomes effective for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2013 but is not expected to have any 
financial impact on the separate financial statements of the 
Company but will require some changes in disclosure. 
IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures 
(as revised in 2011) 
As a consequence of the new IFRS 11 and IFRS 12, IAS 28 has 
been renamed IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, 
and describes the application of the equity method to investments 
in joint ventures in addition to associates. The amendment becomes 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. 
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification 
and Measurement 
IFRS 9 as issued reflects the first phase of the IASB’s work 
on the replacement of IAS 39 and applies to classification and 
measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities as defined 
in IAS 39.The standard is effective for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2015. In subsequent phases, the IASB will 
address hedge accounting and impairment of financial assets. 
The adoption of the first phase of IFRS 9 will have an effect on the 
classification and measurement of the Group’s financial assets, 
but will not have an impact on classification and measurements of 
financial liabilities. The Group will quantify the effect in conjunction 
with the other phases, when the final standard including all phases 
is issued. 
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements 
IFRS 10 replaces the portion of IAS 27 Consolidated and 
Separate Financial Statements that addresses the accounting 
for consolidated financial statements. It also includes the issues 
raised in SIC-12 Consolidation – Special Purpose Entities. 
IFRS 10 establishes a single control model that applies to all entities 
including special purpose entities. The changes introduced by IFRS 
10 will require management to exercise significant judgement to 
determine which entities are controlled, and therefore, are required 
to be consolidated by a parent, compared with the requirements 
that were in IAS 27. Based on the preliminary analyses performed, 
IFRS 10 is not expected to have any impact on the currently held 
investments of the Group. 
This standard becomes effective for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2013. 
 
  113 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012
 
 
 
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements 
IFRS 11 replaces IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures and SIC-13 
Jointly-controlled Entities – Non-monetary Contributions 
by Venturers. 
IFRS 11 removes the option to account for jointly-controlled entities 
(JCEs) using proportionate consolidation. Instead, JCEs that meet 
the definition of a joint venture must be accounted for using the 
equity method. 
The application of this new standard will impact the financial position 
of the Group by eliminating proportionate consolidation of certain 
joint ventures. With the application of the new standard, the 
investment in those joint ventures will be accounted for using the 
equity method of accounting. This standard becomes effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, and is to be 
applied retrospectively for joint arrangements held at the date of 
initial application. The expected impact of IFRS 11 on the current 
period (which will be the comparative period in the financial 
statements as of 31 December 2013), given the current status of 
our joint arrangements, is expected to be a reduction of revenue of 
US$76m and a reduction in profit from operations of US$2m as 
income from joint ventures will be presented outside operating profit 
going forward. Current assets and current liabilities will be reduced 
by US$47m and US$89m respectively, while the impact on non-
current assets will be a reduction of US$65m and the non-current 
liabilities will be reduced by US$2m. The reduction in net assets 
above will result in recognition of investments in joint ventures which 
will be included within non-current assets.  
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Involvement with Other Entities 
IFRS 12 includes all of the disclosures that were previously in 
IAS 27 relating to consolidated financial statements, as well as all 
of the disclosures that were previously included in IAS 31 and IAS 
28.These disclosures relate to an entity’s interests in subsidiaries, 
joint arrangements, associates and structured entities. A number 
of new disclosures are also required. This standard becomes 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2013.The application of this standard affects disclosure only 
and will have no impact on the Group’s financial position 
or performance. 
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement 
IFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance under IFRS for all 
fair value measurements. IFRS 13 does not change when an entity 
is required to use fair value, but rather provides guidance on how 
to measure fair value under IFRS when fair value is required or 
permitted. The Group is currently assessing the impact that this 
standard will have on the financial position and performance 
of the Group. This standard becomes effective prospectively for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. 
Significant accounting judgements and estimates 
Judgements 
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, 
management has made the following judgements, apart from those 
involving estimations, which have the most significant effect on the 
amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements:  
 revenue recognition on fixed-price engineering, procurement 
and construction contracts: the Group recognises revenue on 
fixed-price engineering, procurement and construction contracts 
using the percentage-of-completion method, based on surveys 
of work performed. The Group has determined this basis of 
revenue recognition is the best available measure of progress 
on such contracts 
 revenue recognition on Integrated Energy Services contracts: 
the Group assesses on a case by case basis the most 
appropriate treatment for its various of commercial structures 
which include Risk Service Contracts, Production Enhancement 
Contracts and Equity Upstream Investments including Production 
Sharing Contracts (see accounting policies note on page 117 for 
further details) 
Estimation uncertainty 
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources 
of estimation uncertainty at the statement of financial position date, 
that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial 
year are discussed below:  
 project cost to complete estimates: at each statement of financial 
position date the Group is required to estimate costs to complete 
on fixed-price contracts. Estimating costs to complete on such 
contracts requires the Group to make estimates of future costs 
to be incurred, based on work to be performed beyond the 
statement of financial position date. This estimate will impact 
revenues, cost of sales, work-in-progress, billings in excess of 
costs and estimated earnings and accrued contract expenses 
 onerous contract provisions: the Group provides for future losses 
on long-term contracts where it is considered probable that the 
contract costs are likely to exceed revenues in future years. 
Estimating these future losses involves a number of assumptions 
about the achievement of contract performance targets and 
the likely levels of future cost escalation over time US$ nil at 
31 December 2012 (2011: US$ nil) 
 impairment of goodwill: the Group determines whether goodwill 
is impaired at least on an annual basis. This requires an estimation 
of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the 
goodwill is allocated. Estimating the value in use requires the 
Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows 
from each cash-generating unit and also to determine a suitable 
discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash 
flows. The carrying amount of goodwill at 31 December 2012 was 
US$125m (2011: US$107m) (note 10) 
 deferred tax assets: the Group recognises deferred tax assets 
on all applicable temporary differences where it is probable that 
future taxable profits will be available for utilisation. This requires 
management to make judgements and assumptions regarding 
the amount of deferred tax that can be recognised based on the 
magnitude and likelihood of future taxable profits. The carrying 
amount of deferred tax assets at 31 December 2012 was 
US$43m (2011: US$29m) 
   114 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 
For the year ended 31 December 2012 
2 Summary of significant accounting 
policies continued 
 income tax: the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to 
routine tax audits and also a process whereby tax computations 
are discussed and agreed with the appropriate authorities. 
Whilst the ultimate outcome of such tax audits and discussions 
cannot be determined with certainty, management estimates the 
level of provisions required for both current and deferred tax on 
the basis of professional advice and the nature of current 
discussions with the tax authority concerned 
 recoverable value of intangible oil and gas and other intangible 
assets: the Group determines at each statement of financial 
position date whether there is any evidence of indicators of 
impairment in the carrying value of its intangible oil and gas and 
other intangible assets. Where indicators exist, an impairment test 
is undertaken which requires management to estimate the 
recoverable value of its intangible assets for example by reference 
to quoted market values, similar arm’s length transactions 
involving these assets or value in use calculations 
 units of production depreciation: estimated proven plus probable 
reserves are used in determining the depreciation of oil and gas 
assets such that the depreciation charge is proportional to the 
depletion of the remaining reserves over their life of production. 
These calculations require the use of estimates including the 
amount of economically recoverable reserves and future oil and 
gas capital expenditure 
Interests in joint ventures 
The Group has a number of contractual arrangements with other 
parties which represent joint ventures. These take the form of 
agreements to share control over other entities (jointly controlled 
entities) and commercial collaborations (jointly controlled 
operations). These arrangements require unanimous agreement 
for financial and operating decisions among the venturers. 
The Group’s interests in jointly controlled entities are accounted 
for by proportionate consolidation, which involves recognising the 
Group’s proportionate share of the joint venture’s assets, liabilities, 
income and expenses with similar items in the consolidated financial 
statements on a line-by-line basis. Where the Group collaborates 
with other entities in jointly controlled operations, the expenses the 
Group incurs and its share of the revenue earned is recognised in 
the consolidated income statement. Assets controlled by the Group 
and liabilities incurred by it are recognised in the statement of 
financial position. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the 
financial statements of the Group’s jointly controlled entities and 
operations to bring their accounting policies into line with those of 
the Group. 
Investments in associates 
The Group’s investment in its associates, entities in which the Group 
has significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method. 
Under the equity method, the investment is initially carried at cost 
and adjusted for post acquisition changes in the Group’s share of 
net assets of the associate. Goodwill on the initial investment forms 
a part of the carrying amount of the investment and is not 
individually tested for impairment. 
The Group recognises its share of the net profits after tax and  
non-controlling interest of the associates in its consolidated income 
statement. Share of associate’s changes in equity is also recognised 
in the Group’s consolidated statement of changes in equity. 
Any unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions 
between the Group and the associate are eliminated to the extent 
of the interest in associates. 
The financial statements of the associate are prepared using 
the same accounting policies and reporting periods as that 
of the Group. 
The carried value of the investment is tested for impairment at each 
reporting date. Impairment, if any, is determined by the difference 
between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying 
value and is reported within the share of income of an associate 
in the Group’s consolidated income statement. 
Foreign currency translation 
The Company’s functional and presentational currency is US dollars. 
In the financial statements of individual subsidiaries, joint ventures 
and associates, transactions in currencies other than a company’s 
functional currency are recorded at the prevailing rate of exchange 
at the date of the transaction. At the year end, monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the 
rates of exchange prevailing at the statement of financial position 
date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at 
historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the rate 
of exchange as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary 
assets and liabilities measured at fair value in a foreign currency are 
translated using the rate of exchange at the date the fair value was 
determined. All foreign exchange gains and losses are taken to the 
consolidated income statement with the exception of exchange 
differences arising on monetary assets and liabilities that form part 
of the Group’s net investment in subsidiaries. These are taken 
directly to the statement of changes in equity until the disposal 
of the net investment at which time they are recognised in the 
consolidated income statement. 
The statements of financial position of overseas subsidiaries, joint 
ventures and associates are translated into US dollars using the 
closing rate method, whereby assets and liabilities are translated 
at the rates of exchange prevailing at the statement of financial 
position date. The income statements of overseas subsidiaries and 
joint ventures are translated at average exchange rates for the year. 
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of net assets are 
taken directly to other reserves within the statement of changes 
in equity. 
On the disposal of a foreign entity, accumulated exchange 
differences are recognised in the consolidated income statement 
as a component of the gain or loss on disposal. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any impairment in value. Cost comprises the 
purchase price or construction cost and any costs directly 
attributable to making that asset capable of operating as intended. 
The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount 
paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire 
the asset. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis, 
other than on oil and gas assets, at the following rates: 
Oil and gas facilities 10% – 12.5% 
Plant and equipment 4% – 33% 
Buildings and leasehold improvements 5% – 33%  
 (or lease term if shorter) 
Office furniture and equipment 25% – 50% 
Vehicles 20% – 33% 
Tangible oil and gas assets are depreciated, on a field-by-field basis, 
using the unit-of-production method based on entitlement to proven 
and probable reserves, taking account of estimated future 
development expenditure relating to those reserves. 
Each asset’s estimated useful life, residual value and method 
of depreciation are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each 
financial year end. 
No depreciation is charged on land or assets under construction. 
   115 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012
 
 
 
The carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment 
is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits 
are expected from its use or disposal. The gain or loss arising from 
the derecognition of an item of property, plant and equipment is 
included in the consolidated income statement when the item is 
derecognised. Gains are not classified as revenue. 
Non-current assets held for sale 
Non-current assets or disposal Groups are classified as held for 
sale when it is expected that the carrying amount of an asset will 
be recovered principally through sale rather than continuing use. 
Assets are not depreciated when classified as held for sale. 
Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the construction of qualifying 
assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period 
of time to prepare for their intended use, are added to the cost of 
those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready 
for their intended use. All other borrowing costs are recognised as 
interest payable in the consolidated income statement in the period 
in which they are incurred. 
Goodwill 
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is initially measured at 
cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over 
the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities of the entity at the date of acquisition. Following initial 
recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated 
impairment losses. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually, 
or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that such carrying value may be impaired. All transaction costs 
associated with business combinations are charged to the 
consolidated income statement in the year of such combination. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired is allocated 
to the cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the 
synergies of the combination. Each unit or units to which goodwill 
is allocated represents the lowest level within the Group at which 
the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and 
is not larger than an operating segment determined in accordance 
with IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’. 
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of 
the cash-generating units to which the goodwill relates. Where the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating units is less than the 
carrying amount of the cash-generating units and related goodwill, 
an impairment loss is recognised. 
Where goodwill has been allocated to cash-generating units and 
part of the operation within those units is disposed of, the goodwill 
associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying 
amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on 
disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance 
is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed 
of and the portion of the cash-generating units retained. 
Contingent consideration payable on a business combination  
When, as part of a business combination, the Group defers a 
proportion of the total purchase consideration payable for an 
acquisition, the amount provided for is the acquisition date fair value 
of the consideration. The unwinding of the discount element is 
recognised as a finance cost in the consolidated income statement. 
For business combinations prior to 1 January 2010, all changes in 
estimated contingent consideration payable on acquisition are 
adjusted against the carried goodwill. For business combinations 
after 1 January 2010, changes in estimated contingent 
consideration payable on acquisition are recognised in the 
consolidated income statement unless they are measurement 
period adjustments which arise as a result of additional 
information obtained after the acquisition date about the facts 
and circumstances existing at the acquisition date, which are 
adjusted against carried goodwill. 
Intangible assets – non oil and gas assets 
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are initially 
measured at cost being their fair values at the date of acquisition 
and are recognised separately from goodwill where the asset is 
separable or arises from a contractual or other legal right and its fair 
value can be measured reliably. After initial recognition, intangible 
assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any 
accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets with a finite life 
are amortised over their useful economic life using a straight-line 
method unless a better method reflecting the pattern in which the 
asset’s future economic benefits are expected to be consumed 
can be determined. The amortisation charge in respect of intangible 
assets is included in the selling, general and administration 
expenses line of the consolidated income statement. The expected 
useful lives of assets are reviewed on an annual basis. Any change 
in the useful life or pattern of consumption of the intangible asset is 
treated as a change in accounting estimate and is accounted for 
prospectively by changing the amortisation period or method. 
Intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever there is an 
indication that the asset may be impaired. 
Oil and gas assets 
Capitalised costs 
The Group’s activities in relation to oil and gas assets are limited 
to assets in the evaluation, development and production phases. 
Oil and gas evaluation and development expenditure is accounted 
for using the successful efforts method of accounting. 
Evaluation expenditures 
Expenditure directly associated with evaluation (or appraisal) 
activities is capitalised as an intangible asset. Such costs include the 
costs of acquiring an interest, appraisal well drilling costs, payments 
to contractors and an appropriate share of directly attributable 
overheads incurred during the evaluation phase. For such appraisal 
activity, which may require drilling of further wells, costs continue to 
be carried as an asset whilst related hydrocarbons are considered 
capable of commercial development. Such costs are subject to 
technical, commercial and management review to confirm the 
continued intent to develop, or otherwise extract value. When this 
is no longer the case, the costs are written-off in the income 
statement. When such assets are declared part of a commercial 
development, related costs are transferred to tangible oil and gas 
assets. All intangible oil and gas assets are assessed for any 
impairment prior to transfer and any impairment loss is recognised 
in the consolidated income statement. 
Development expenditures 
Expenditure relating to development of assets which include the 
construction, installation and completion of infrastructure facilities 
such as platforms, pipelines and development wells, is capitalised 
within property, plant and equipment. 
Changes in unit-of-production factors 
Changes in factors which affect unit-of-production calculations 
are dealt with prospectively in accordance with the treatment of 
changes in accounting estimates, not by immediate adjustment of 
prior years’ amounts.

For the year ended 31 December 2012 
2 Summary of significant accounting 
policies continued 
Decommissioning 
Provision for future decommissioning costs is made in full when 
the Group has an obligation to dismantle and remove a facility 
or an item of plant and to restore the site on which it is located, 
and when a reasonable estimate of that liability can be made. 
The amount recognised is the present value of the estimated future 
expenditure. An amount equivalent to the discounted initial provision 
for decommissioning costs is capitalised and amortised over the life 
of the underlying asset on a unit-of-production basis over proven 
and probable reserves. Any change in the present value of the 
estimated expenditure is reflected as an adjustment to the provision 
and the oil and gas asset. 
The unwinding of the discount applied to future decommissioning 
provisions is included under finance costs in the consolidated 
income statement. 
Impairment of assets (excluding goodwill) 
At each statement of financial position date, the Group reviews 
the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to assess 
whether there is an indication that those assets may be impaired. 
If any such indication exists, the Group makes an estimate of the 
asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is 
the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value 
in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
attributable to the asset are discounted to their present value using 
a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments 
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its 
carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately 
in the consolidated income statement, unless the relevant asset is 
carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is 
treated as a revaluation decrease. 
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying 
amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its 
recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount 
does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the 
asset in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised 
immediately in the consolidated income statement, unless the 
relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the 
reversal of the impairment is treated as a revaluation increase. 
Inventories 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the 
estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Cost comprises 
purchase price, cost of production, transportation and other directly 
allocable expenses. Costs of inventories, other than raw materials, 
are determined using the first-in-first-out method. Costs of raw 
materials are determined using the weighted average method. 
Work in progress and billings in excess of cost and 
estimated earnings 
Fixed price lump sum engineering, procurement and construction 
contracts are presented in the statement of financial position 
as follows:  
 for each contract, the accumulated cost incurred, as well as 
the estimated earnings recognised at the contract’s percentage 
of completion less provision for any anticipated losses, after 
deducting the progress payments received or receivable from 
the customers, are shown in current assets in the statement 
of financial position under ‘work in progress’ 
 where the payments received or receivable for any contract 
exceed the cost and estimated earnings less provision for any 
anticipated losses, the excess is shown as ‘billings in excess 
of cost and estimated earnings’ within current liabilities 
Trade and other receivables 
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice 
amount less an allowance for any amounts estimated to be 
uncollectable. An estimate for doubtful debts is made when there is 
objective evidence that the collection of the full amount is no longer 
probable under the terms of the original invoice. Impaired debts are 
derecognised when they are assessed as uncollectable. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash at bank and in hand 
and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months 
or less. For the purpose of the cash flow statement, cash and cash 
equivalents consists of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, 
net of outstanding bank overdrafts. 
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 
All interest-bearing loans and borrowings are initially recognised at 
the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs directly 
attributable to the borrowing. 
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking 
into account any issue costs, and any discount or premium 
on settlement. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that 
an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and 
a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
If the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted 
using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the 
risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase 
in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised in the 
consolidated income statement as a finance cost. 
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities 
Financial assets 
A financial asset (or, where applicable a part of a financial asset) 
is derecognised where: 
 the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired 
 the Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, 
but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material 
delay to a third-party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; or 
 the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the 
asset and either (a) has transferred substantially all the risks and 
rewards of the asset, or (b) has neither transferred nor retained 
substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has 
transferred control of the asset  
Financial liabilities 
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the 
liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. 
If an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same 
lender, on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing 
liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification 
is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the 
recognition of a new liability such that the difference in the 
respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees 
incurred are recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
Pensions and other long-term employment benefits 
The Group has various defined contribution pension schemes in 
accordance with the local conditions and practices in the countries 
in which it operates. The amount charged to the consolidated 
income statement in respect of pension costs reflects the 
contributions payable in the year. Differences between contributions 
payable during the year and contributions actually paid are shown 
as either accrued liabilities or prepaid assets in the statement of 
financial position. 
   117 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012
 
 
 
The Group’s other long-term employment benefits are provided in 
accordance with the labour laws of the countries in which the Group 
operates, further details of which are given in note 25. 
Share-based payment transactions 
Employees (including Directors) of the Group receive remuneration 
in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby 
employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over 
shares (‘equity-settled transactions’). 
Equity-settled transactions 
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured 
by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted. 
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any 
service or performance conditions, other than conditions linked 
to the price of the shares of Petrofac Limited (‘market conditions’), 
if applicable. 
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with 
a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the 
relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (the ‘vesting 
period’).The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled 
transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the 
extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best 
estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. 
The income statement charge or credit for a period represents the 
movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning 
and end of that period. 
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, 
except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market or 
non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective 
of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, 
provided that all other performance conditions and service 
conditions are satisfied. Equity awards cancelled are treated as 
vesting immediately on the date of cancellation, and any expense 
not recognised for the award at that date is recognised in the 
consolidated income statement. 
Petrofac Employee Benefit Trusts 
The Petrofac Employee Benefit Trust and the Petrofac Joint Venture 
Companies Employee Benefit Trust warehouse ordinary shares 
purchased to satisfy various new share scheme awards made to the 
employees of the Company and its joint venture partner employees, 
which will be transferred to the members of the scheme on their 
respective vesting dates subject to satisfying the performance 
conditions of each scheme. The trusts have been consolidated in 
the Group financial statements in accordance with SIC 12 ‘Special 
Purpose Entities’. The cost of shares temporarily held by the trusts 
are reflected as treasury shares and deducted from equity. 
Leases 
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains a lease 
is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date and 
whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use 
of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys the right 
to use the asset. 
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the 
lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. 
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as non-current 
assets of the Group at the lower of their fair value at the date of 
commencement of the lease and the present value of the minimum 
lease payments. These assets are depreciated on a straight-line 
basis over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the lease 
term. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the 
consolidated statement of financial position as a finance lease 
obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance costs 
in the income statement and reduction of the lease obligation so as 
to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of 
the liability. 
The Group has entered into various operating leases the payments 
for which are recognised as an expense in the consolidated income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. 
Revenue recognition 
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable economic 
benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably 
measured. The following specific recognition criteria also apply: 
Onshore Engineering & Construction 
Revenues from fixed-price lump-sum contracts are recognised on 
the percentage-of-completion method, based on surveys of work 
performed once the outcome of a contract can be estimated 
reliably. In the early stages of contract completion, when the 
outcome of a contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract 
revenues are recognised only to the extent of costs incurred that 
are expected to be recoverable. 
Revenues from cost-plus-fee contracts are recognised on the basis 
of costs incurred during the year plus the fee earned measured by 
the cost-to-cost method. 
Revenues from reimbursable contracts are recognised in the period 
in which the services are provided based on the agreed contract 
schedule of rates. 
Provision is made for all losses expected to arise on completion 
of contracts entered into at the statement of financial position date, 
whether or not work has commenced on these contracts. 
Incentive payments are included in revenue when the contract 
is sufficiently advanced that it is probable that the specified 
performance standards will be met or exceeded and the 
amount of the incentive payments can be measured reliably. 
Variation orders are only included in revenue when it is probable 
they will be accepted and can be measured reliably and claims 
are only included in revenue when negotiations have reached an 
advanced stage. 
Offshore Projects & Operations, Engineering & Consulting Services 
and Integrated Energy Services 
Revenues from reimbursable contracts are recognised in the period 
in which the services are provided based on the agreed contract 
schedule of rates. 
Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognised on the 
percentage-of-completion method, measured by milestones 
completed or earned value once the outcome of a contract can be 
estimated reliably. In the early stages of contract completion, when 
the outcome of a contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract 
revenues are recognised only to the extent of costs incurred that 
are expected to be recoverable. 
Incentive payments are included in revenue when the contract 
is sufficiently advanced that it is probable that the specified 
performance standards will be met or exceeded and the amount 
of the incentive payments can be measured reliably. Claims are only 
included in revenue when negotiations have reached an advanced 
stage such that it is probable the claim will be accepted and can be 
measured reliably. 
Integrated Energy Services 
Oil and gas revenues comprise the Group’s share of sales from the 
processing or sale of hydrocarbons on an entitlement basis, when 
the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been passed 
to the buyer. 
Revenue from production enhancement contracts is recognised 
based on the volume of hydrocarbons produced in the period and 
the agreed tariff and the reimbursement arrangement for costs 
incurred. 
Pre-contract/bid costs 
Pre-contract/bid costs incurred are recognised as an expense until 
there is a high probability that the contract will be awarded, after 
which all further costs are recognised as assets and expensed over 
the life of the contract.  118 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012

2 Summary of significant accounting 
policies continued 
Income taxes 
Income tax expense represents the sum of current income tax and 
deferred tax. 
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior 
periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered 
from, or paid to the taxation authorities. Taxable profit differs from 
profit as reported in the consolidated income statement because it 
excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible 
in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or 
deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using 
tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
statement of financial position date. 
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences 
at the statement of financial position date between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the 
corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, 
with the following exceptions:  
 where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition 
of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a 
business combination that at the time of the transaction affects 
neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss 
 in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with 
investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, 
where the timing of reversal of the temporary differences can be 
controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future; and 
 deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that 
it is probable that a taxable profit will be available against which 
the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits 
or tax losses can be utilised 
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at 
each statement of financial position date and reduced to the extent 
that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be 
available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax assets to be 
utilised. Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed 
at each statement of financial position date and are recognised to 
the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will 
allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an 
undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply 
when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax 
rates and tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the 
statement of financial position date. 
Current and deferred income tax is charged or credited directly to 
other comprehensive income or equity if it relates to items that are 
credited or charged to respectively, other comprehensive income 
or equity. Otherwise, income tax is recognised in the consolidated 
income statement. 
Derivative financial instruments and hedging 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward 
currency contracts and oil price collars and forward contracts to 
hedge its risks associated with foreign currency and oil price 
fluctuations. Such derivative financial instruments are initially 
recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is 
entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. 
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and 
as liabilities when the fair value is negative. 
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of 
derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken 
to the consolidated income statement. 
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by 
reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with 
similar maturity profiles. The fair value of oil price collar contracts is 
determined by reference to market values for similar instruments. 
For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as: 
 fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to changes in the 
fair value of a recognised asset or liability; or 
 cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash 
flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated 
with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast 
transaction 
The Group formally designates and documents the relationship 
between the hedging instrument and the hedged item at the 
inception of the transaction, as well as its risk management 
objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. 
The documentation also includes identification of the hedging 
instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of risk being 
hedged and how the Group will assess the hedging instrument’s 
effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged 
item’s fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. 
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception 
and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used 
in the hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes 
in fair values or cash flows of the hedged items. 
The treatment of gains and losses arising from revaluing derivatives 
designated as hedging instruments depends on the nature of the 
hedging relationship, as follows: 
Cash flow hedges 
For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on 
the hedging instrument is recognised directly in the statement of 
changes in equity, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the 
consolidated income statement. Amounts taken to equity are 
transferred to the consolidated income statement when the hedged 
transaction affects the consolidated income statement. 
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised 
without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is 
revoked, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time 
remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is 
ultimately recognised in the consolidated income statement. When a 
forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative 
gain or loss that was reported in the statement of changes in equity 
is immediately transferred to the consolidated income statement. 
Embedded derivatives 
Contracts are assessed for the existence of embedded derivatives 
at the date that the Group first becomes party to the contract, 
with reassessment only if there is a change to the contract that 
significantly modifies the cash flows. Embedded derivatives which 
are not clearly and closely related to the underlying asset, liability 
or transaction are separated and accounted for as 
standalone derivatives.

Management separately monitors the trading results of its four reporting segments for the purpose of making an assessment of their 
performance and making decisions about how resources are allocated to them. Each segment’s performance is measured based on 
its profitability which is reflected in a manner consistent with the results shown below. However, certain shareholder services related 
overheads, Group financing and consolidation adjustments are managed at a corporate level and are not allocated to reporting segments.

Revenues disclosed in the above tables are based on where the project is located. Revenues representing greater than 10% of Group 
revenues arose from one customer amounting to US$1,697m (2011: two customers US$1,653m) in the Onshore Engineering & 
Construction segment.

Sale of crude oil and gas   111 143
Sale of processed hydrocarbons    8 7
   6,324 5,801
Included in revenues from rendering of services are Offshore Projects & Operations, Engineering & Consulting Services and Integrated 
Energy Services revenues of a ‘pass-through’ nature with zero or low margins amounting to US$220m (2011: US$229m).The revenues 
are included as external revenues of the Group since the risks and rewards associated with recognition are assumed by the Group. 
b. Cost of sales 
Included in cost of sales for the year ended 31 December 2012 is depreciation charged on property, plant and equipment of US$101m 
during 2012 (2011: US$62m) (note 9). 
Also included in cost of sales are forward points and ineffective portions on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and losses on 
undesignated derivatives of US$2m (2011: US$6m loss).These amounts are an economic hedge of foreign exchange risk but do not meet 
the criteria within IAS 39 and are most appropriately recorded in cost of sales.

Effect of change in tax rates    1 1
At the effective income tax rate of 17.7% (2011: 20.7%)    135 141
The Group’s effective tax rate for the year ended 31 December 2012 is 17.7% (2011: 20.7%). A number of factors have impacted the 
effective tax rate this year including the net release of tax provisions held in respect of income taxes, the recognition of tax losses previously 
unrecognised and the mix of profits in the jurisdictions in which profits are earned. Adjustments in respect of prior periods represent the 
creation or release of tax provisions following the normal review, audit and final settlement process that occurs in the territories in which the 
Group operates. From 1 April 2013, the main UK corporation tax rate will be 23%, subsequently reducing to 21% in 2014. The change in 
the main UK rate to 23% was substantively enacted as at the balance sheet date. This change will impact the reversal of the temporary 
difference from this date onwards, reducing the Group’s UK deferred tax assets and liabilities for the year ended 31 December 2012. 
It is not expected that the proposed future rate reduction will have a significant effect on the net UK deferred tax position.

7 Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. 
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders, after adjusting for any 
dilutive effect, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for the effects of ordinary shares 
granted under the employee share award schemes which are held in trust.

Additions to oil and gas assets mainly comprise field development costs relating to the Santuario and Magallanes fields of US$106m and 
Ticleni field of US$48m. 
Additions to oil and gas facilities in 2012 mainly comprise the upgrade of the FPF5 at a cost of US$104m (2011: US$305m purchase and 
upgrade of the FPF1, FPSO Berantai, FPF3, FPF4 and FPF5). Transfers from oil and gas facilities in 2011 include transfer of the FPF1 to 
non-current asset held for sale as part of the pending Ithaca transaction (note 15). 
Of the total charge for depreciation in the income statement, US$101m (2011: US$62m) is included in cost of sales and US$18m 
(2011: US$15m) in selling, general and administration expenses. 
Assets under construction comprise expenditures incurred in relation to a new office building in the United Arab Emirates and the Group 
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) project. 
Included in land, buildings and leasehold improvements is property, plant and equipment under finance lease agreements, for which book 
values are as follows: 
Acquisitions during the year comprise the goodwill recognised on acquisition of KW Limited of US$14m being the difference between the 
fair value of the consideration of US$16m and the fair value of the assets acquired of US$2m and H&L/SPD Americas S de R.L of US$1m. 
Re-assessment of contingent consideration payable comprises of the increase in contingent consideration payable on SPD Group Limited 
of US$ nil (2011: US$1m) and a decrease in contingent consideration payable on Caltec Limited of US$1m (2011: US$ nil). 
Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated to three groups of cash-generating units, for impairment testing 
as follows:  
 Offshore Projects & Operations  
 Engineering & Consulting Services  
 Integrated Energy Services 
These represent the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.  
Offshore Projects & Operations, Engineering & Consulting Services and Integrated Energy Services cash-generating units 
The recoverable amounts for the Offshore Projects & Operations, Engineering & Consulting Services and Integrated Energy Services  
cash-generating units have been determined based on value in use calculations, using discounted pre-tax cash flow projections. 
Management have adopted projection periods appropriate to each unit’s value in use. For Offshore Projects & Operations and Engineering 
& Consulting Services cash-generating units the cash flow projections are based on financial budgets approved by senior management 
covering a five-year period, extrapolated at a growth rate of 2.5%. For the Integrated Energy Services business the cash flows are based 
on field models over the length of the contracted period for Production Enhancement Contracts and Risk Service Contracts. For other 
operations included in Integrated Energy Services, cash flows are based on financial budgets approved by senior management covering 
a five-year period, extrapolated at a growth rate of 2.5%. The carrying amount of goodwill for the Offshore Projects & Operations and 
Engineering & Consulting Services cash-generating units are not individually significant in comparison with the total carrying amount of 
goodwill and therefore no analysis of sensitivities has been provided below.

Key assumptions used in value in use calculations for the Integrated Energy Services unit: 
Market share: for the Training business which is within Integrated Energy Services, the key assumptions relate to management’s 
assessment of maintaining the unit’s market share in the UK and developing further the business in international markets. 
Capital expenditure: the Production Enhancement Contracts in the Integrated Energy Services unit require a minimum level of capital spend 
on the projects in the initial years to meet contractual commitments. If the capital is not spent a cash payment of the balance is required 
which does not qualify for cost recovery. The level of capital spend assumed in the value in use calculation is that expected over the period 
of the budget based on the current field development plans which assumes the minimum spend is met on each project and the contracts 
remain in force for the entire duration of the project. 
Reserve volumes and production profiles: management has used its internally developed economic models of reserves and production as 
inputs into the value in use for the Production Enhancement, Risk Service and Production Sharing Contracts. Management has used an oil 
price of US$100 per barrel (2011: US$85 per barrel) to determine reserve volumes on Production Sharing Contracts. 
Tariffs and payment terms: the tariffs and payment terms used in the value in use calculations for the Production Enhancement and Risk 
Service Contracts are those specified in the respective contracts with assumptions consistent with the current field development plan where 
KPI’s influence the payment terms. 
Growth rate: estimates are based on management’s assessment of market share having regard to macro-economic factors and the growth 
rates experienced in the recent past in the markets in which the unit operates. A growth rate of 2.5% per annum has been applied for 
businesses within the Integrated Energy Services cash-generating unit where the cash flows are not based on long-term contractual 
arrangements. 
Discount rate: management has used a pre-tax discount rate of 13.2% per annum (2011: 13.8% per annum). The discount rate is derived 
from the estimated weighted average cost of capital of the Group and has been calculated using an estimated risk free rate of return 
adjusted for the Group’s estimated equity market risk premium. 
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions 
With regard to the assessment of value in use of the cash-generating units, management believes that no reasonably possible change 
in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the relevant unit to exceed its recoverable amount, after giving due 
consideration to the macro-economic outlook for the oil and gas industry and the commercial arrangements with customers underpinning 
the cash flow forecasts for each of the units.

Intangible oil and gas assets 
Oil and gas assets (part of the Integrated Energy Services segment) additions above comprise largely US$149m (2011: US$39m) 
of capitalised expenditure on the Group’s assets in Malaysia. 
There were investing cash outflows relating to capitalised intangible oil and gas assets of US$165m (2011: US$40m) in the current period 
arising from pre-development activities. 
US$6m transfer in 2011 relates to a long-term receivable from a customer on the Berantai RSC contract being their share of development 
expenditure, which was transferred to costs. 
Other intangible assets 
Other intangible asset additions on acquisition represent US$6m of e-learning software that formed part of the acquisition during the year 
of Oilennium Limited. Transfers from other non-current financial assets are transition costs relating to the Santuario, Magallanes and Ticleni 
Production Enhancement Contracts of US$10m (note 14). 
Other intangible assets comprising project development expenditure, customer contracts, proprietary software, LNG intellectual property 
and patent technology are being amortised over their estimated economic useful life on a straight-line basis and the related amortisation 
charges included in selling, general and administration expenses (note 4c).

As a result of the disposal of 75.2% of Petrofac FPF1 Limited (see note 4f) the remaining 24.8% investment is classified as an associate 
recognised at a fair value of US$9m. 
Gateway Storage Company Limited 
During the year the Group’s investment of US$14m, representing 20% of the equity of Gateway Storage Company Limited, has been written 
off in the consolidated income statement and the associated contingent consideration payable of US$7m (note 26) has also been reversed 
in the consolidated income statement due to continuing uncertainty over the future prospects for the company’s business. 
Seven Energy International Limited 
On 25 November 2010, the Group invested US$100m for 15.0% (12.6% on a fully diluted basis) of the share capital of Seven Energy 
International Limited (Seven Energy), a leading Nigerian gas development and production company incurring US$1m of transaction costs. 
This investment which was previously held under available-for-sale financial assets was transferred to investments in associates, pursuant 
to an investment on 10 June 2011 of US$50m for an additional 4.6% of the share capital of Seven Energy which resulted in the Group 
being in a position to exercise significant influence over Seven Energy. On 30 October 2012, the Group invested US$25m for an additional 
2.4% of the share capital of Seven Energy. The additional US$25m investment was made as part of a discounted rights issue required to 
deal with a short-term funding requirement by Seven Energy at a subscription price of US$150 per share and in light of this the carrying 
value of the investment has been tested for impairment and no impairment provision is required. No negative goodwill has been accounted 
for on the rights issue as the range of possible outcomes was immaterial. The Group also has the option to subscribe for 148,571 of 
additional warrants in Seven Energy at a cost of a further US$52m, subject to the performance of certain service provision conditions and 
milestones in relation to project execution. These warrants have been fair valued at 31 December 2012 as derivative financial instruments 
under IAS 39, using a Black Scholes Model, amounting to US$12m (2011: US$18m). US$6m (2011: US$6m other income) has been 
recognised as other expense in the current period income statement as a result of the revaluation of these derivatives at 31 December 2012 
(note 4g). During 2012 deferred revenue recognised in trade and other payables of US$2m at 31 December 2012 was released in full to the 
consolidated income statement as 100% of the performance conditions required to subscribe for the remaining warrants in the Company 
were satisfied (2011: 80% satisfied with revenue recognised of US$10m).

The credit quality of trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired is assessed by management with reference to externally 
prepared customer credit reports and the historic payment track records of the counterparties. 
Advances represent payments made to certain of the Group’s subcontractors for projects in progress, on which the related work had not 
been performed at the statement of financial position date. The decrease in advances during 2012 relates to the unwinding of advances on 
more mature contracts in the Onshore Engineering & Construction reporting segment. 
Receivables from joint venture partners are amounts recoverable from venture partners on the Berantai FPSO, Block PM304 and Petrofac 
Emirates on an engineering, procurement and construction project. 
All trade and other receivables are expected to be settled in cash. 
Certain trade and other receivables will be settled in cash using currencies other than the reporting currency of the Group, and will be largely 
paid in sterling and euros.

22 Share-based payment plans 
Performance Share Plan (PSP) 
Under the Company’s Performance Share Plan, share awards are granted to Executive Directors and a restricted number of other senior 
executives of the Group. The shares vest at the end of three years subject to continued employment and the achievement of certain pre-
defined market and non-market-based performance conditions. The 50% market performance based part of these awards is dependent 
on the total shareholder return (TSR) of the Group, compared with an index composed of selected relevant companies. The fair value of 
the shares vesting under this portion of the award is determined by an independent valuer using a Monte Carlo simulation model taking 
into account the terms and conditions of the plan rules and using the following assumptions at the date of grant: 
2012

2011

Share price correlation with comparator Group 46.0% 43.0%  39.0%  36.0%
Risk-free interest rate 0.4% 1.7%  1.50%  2.10%
Expected life of share award 3 years 3 years  3 years  3 years
Fair value of TSR portion 1,103p 788p  743p  456p 135 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012
 
 
 
The non-market-based condition governing the vesting of the remaining 50% of the total award is subject to achieving between 10% and 
20% earnings per share (EPS) growth targets over a three-year period. The fair values of the equity-settled award relating to the EPS part of 
the scheme are estimated, based on the quoted closing market price per Company share at the date of grant with an assumed vesting rate 
per annum built into the calculation (subsequently trued up at year end based on the actual leaver rate during the period from award date to 
year end) over the three-year vesting period of the plan.  
Deferred Bonus Share Plan (DBSP) 
Under the DBSP selected employees are required to defer a proportion of their annual cash bonus into Company shares (‘Invested Award’). 
Following such an award, the Company will generally grant the participant an additional award of a number of shares bearing a specified 
ratio to the number of his or her invested shares (‘Matching Shares’), typically using a 1:1 ratio. Subject to a participant’s continued 
employment, invested and matching share awards may either vest 100% on the third anniversary of grant; or alternatively, vest one-third on 
the first anniversary of the grant, one-third on the second anniversary and the final proportion on the third anniversary. 
At the year end the values of the bonuses settled by shares cannot be determined until the Remuneration Committee has approved the 
portion of the employee bonuses to be settled in shares. Once the portion of the bonus to be settled in shares is determined, the final 
bonus liability to be settled in shares is transferred to the reserve for share-based payments. The costs relating to the Matching Shares are 
recognised over the corresponding vesting period and the fair values of the equity-settled Matching Shares granted to employees are based 
on the quoted closing market price at the date of grant with the charge adjusted to reflect the expected vesting rate of the plan. 
Share Incentive Plan (SIP) 
All UK employees, including UK Executive Directors, are eligible to participate in the SIP. Employees may invest up to sterling £1,500 per tax 
year of gross salary (or, if lower, 10% of salary) to purchase ordinary shares in the Company. There is no holding period for these shares. 
Restricted Share Plan (RSP) 
Under the RSP, selected employees are made grants of shares on an ad hoc basis. The RSP is used primarily, but not exclusively, to make 
awards to individuals who join the Group part way through the year, having left accrued benefits with a previous employer. The fair values of 
the awards granted under the RSP at various grant dates during the year are based on the quoted market price at the date of grant 
adjusted for an assumed vesting rate over the relevant vesting period.  
Value Creation Plan (VCP) 
During 2012 the Company introduced a new one-off Value Creation Plan (VCP) which is a share option scheme for Executive Directors and 
key senior executives within the Company. The VCP is a premium priced share option scheme with options granted with an exercise price 
set at a 10% premium to the grant date price. Options will vest to the extent of satisfying Group and divisional profit after tax targets, 
together with various other performance underpins and risk/malus provisions that can be imposed at the discretion of the Remuneration 
Committee of the Board. The share options vest in equal tranches on the fourth, fifth and sixth anniversaries of the original grant date but 
may be exercised up to eight years from the date of grant. 
The VCP share options were fair valued by an independent valuer using a Black-Scholes option pricing model taking into account the rules 
of the plan and using the following key assumptions: 
Tranche 1 
Share price at the date of grant 1,555p 
Exercise price 1,710p 
Expected lives of the award 6 years 
Share price volatility 41%

Nature and purpose of other reserves 
Net unrealised gains/(losses) on derivatives 
The portion of gains or losses on cash flow hedging instruments that are determined to be effective hedges is included within this reserve 
net of related deferred tax effects. When the hedged transaction occurs or is no longer forecast to occur, the gain or loss is transferred 
out of equity to the consolidated income statement. Realised net losses amounting to US$20m (2011: US$3m net gain) relating to foreign 
currency forward contracts and financial assets designated as cash flow hedges have been recognised in cost of sales. 
The forward currency points element and ineffective portion of derivative financial instruments relating to forward currency contracts and 
gains on un-designated derivatives amounting to a net loss of US$2m (2011: US$6m loss) have been recognised in the cost of sales. 
Foreign currency translation reserve 
The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements 
in foreign subsidiaries. It is also used to record exchange differences arising on monetary items that form part of the Group’s net investment 
in subsidiaries. 
Reserve for share-based payments 
The reserve for share-based payments is used to record the value of equity-settled share-based payments awarded to employees and 
transfers out of this reserve are made upon vesting of the original share awards. 
The transfer during the year reflects the transfer from accrued expenses within trade and other payables of the bonus liability relating to the 
year ended 2011 of US$20m (2010 bonus of US$18m) which has been voluntarily elected or mandatorily obliged to be settled in shares 
during the year (note 22).

Details of the Group’s interest-bearing loans and borrowings are as follows: 
(i) Bank overdrafts 
Bank overdrafts are drawn down in US dollars and sterling denominations to meet the Group’s working capital requirements. 
These are repayable on demand. 
(ii) Revolving Credit Facility 
On 11 September 2012, Petrofac entered into a US$1,200m five year committed revolving credit facility with a syndicate of 13 international 
banks, which is available for general corporate purposes. The facility, which matures on 11 September 2017, is unsecured and is subject 
to two financial covenants relating to leverage and interest cover. Petrofac was in compliance with these covenants for the year ending 
31 December 2012. As at 31 December 2012, US$303m was drawn under this facility. 
Interest is payable on the drawn balance of the facility at LIBOR + 1.5% and in addition utilisation fees are payable depending on the level 
of utilisation. 
(iii) Term loan 
The loan was repaid in full during 2012 and no amounts were drawn during the year (2011: drawings of US$15m denominated in US dollars 
and US$15m denominated in sterling). 
(iv) Term loan 
The loan was repaid in full during 2012 and no amounts were drawn during the year (2011: drawings of US$10m denominated in US dollars 
and US$4m denominated in sterling). 
The Group’s credit facilities contain covenants relating to interest and net borrowings cover. None of the Company’s subsidiaries are 
subject to any material restrictions on their ability to transfer funds in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances to the Company.

Other long-term employment benefits provision 
Labour laws in the United Arab Emirates require employers to provide for other long-term employment benefits. These benefits are payable 
to employees on being transferred to another jurisdiction or on cessation of employment based on their final salary and number of years’ 
service. All amounts are unfunded. The long-term employment benefits provision is based on an internally produced end of service benefits 
valuation model with the key underlying assumptions being as follows: 
  
Senior 
employees 
Other 
employees
Average number of years of future service  5 3
Average annual % salary increases  6% 4%
Discount factor  5% 5%
Senior employees are those earning a base of salary of over US$96,000 per annum. 
Discount factor used is the local Dubai five-year Sukuk rate. 
Provision for decommissioning 
The decommissioning provision primarily relates to the Group’s obligation for the removal of facilities and restoration of the sites at the 
PM304 field in Malaysia, Chergui in Tunisia and Santuario and Magallanes Production Enhancement Contracts in Mexico. The liability 
is discounted at the rate of 4.16% on PM304 (2011: 4.16%), 5.25% on Chergui (2011: 5.25%) and 5.38% on Santuario and Magallanes 
Production Enhancement Contracts (2011: n/a). The unwinding of the discount is classified as finance cost (note 5). The Group estimates 
that the cash outflows against these provisions will arise in 2026 on PM304, 2018 on Chergui and 2029 on Santuario and Magallanes 
Production Enhancement Contracts.

This represents amounts set aside to cover claims against the Group which will be settled via the captive insurance company Jermyn

Commitments 
In the normal course of business the Group will obtain surety bonds, letters of credit and guarantees, which are contractually required

At 31 December 2012, the Group had letters of credit of US$ nil (2011: US$6m) and outstanding letters of guarantee, including 
performance, advance payments and bid bonds of US$2,296m (2011: US$2,185m) against which the Group had pledged or restricted

31 Risk management and financial instruments 
Risk management objectives and policies 
The Group’s principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise available-for-sale financial assets, trade and other 
receivables, amounts due from/to related parties, cash and short-term deposits, work-in-progress, interest-bearing loans and borrowings, 
trade and other payables and contingent consideration. 
The Group’s activities expose it to various financial risks particularly associated with interest rate risk on its variable rate cash and short-term 
deposits, loans and borrowings and foreign currency risk on both conducting business in currencies other than reporting currency as well as 
translation of the assets and liabilities of foreign operations to the reporting currency. These risks are managed from time to time by using a 
combination of various derivative instruments, principally forward currency contracts in line with the Group’s hedging policies. The Group 
has a policy not to enter into speculative trading of financial derivatives. 
The Board of Directors of the Company has established an Audit Committee and Board Risk Committee to help identify, evaluate and 
manage the significant financial risks faced by the Group and their activities are discussed in detail on pages 78 to 87. 
The other main risks besides interest rate and foreign currency risk arising from the Group’s financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk 
and commodity price risk and the policies relating to these risks are discussed in detail below: 
Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect the value of the Group’s interest-bearing financial liabilities 
and assets. 
The Group’s exposure to market risk arising from changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s long-term variable rate debt 
obligations and its cash and bank balances. The Group’s policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. 
The Group’s cash and bank balances are at floating rates of interest. 
Interest rate sensitivity analysis 
The impact on the Group’s pre-tax profit and equity due to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on loans and borrowings at the 
reporting date is demonstrated in the table below. The analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.

Financial liabilities in the above table are disclosed gross of debt acquisition costs and effective interest rate adjustments of US$11m 
(2011: US$3m). 
Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is re-priced at intervals of less than one year. The other financial instruments of 
the Group that are not included in the above tables are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk. 
Foreign currency risk 
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases, and translation of assets and liabilities that are in a currency other than 
the functional currency of its operating units. The Group is also exposed to the translation of the functional currencies of its units to the US 
dollar reporting currency of the Group. The following table summarises the percentage of foreign currency denominated revenues, costs, 
financial assets and financial liabilities, expressed in US dollar terms, of the Group totals.

The Group uses forward currency contracts to manage the currency exposure on transactions significant to its operations. It is the Group’s 
policy not to enter into forward contracts until a highly probable forecast transaction is in place and to negotiate the terms of the derivative 
instruments used for hedging to match the terms of the hedged item to maximise hedge effectiveness. 
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis 
The income statements of foreign operations are translated into the reporting currency using a weighted average exchange rate of 
conversion. Foreign currency monetary items are translated using the closing rate at the reporting date. Revenues and costs in currencies 
other than the functional currency of an operating unit are recorded at the prevailing rate at the date of the transaction. The following 
significant exchange rates applied during the year in relation to US dollars:

and July 2013). 
At 31 December 2012, the Group had cash and short-term deposits designated as cash flow hedges with net unrealised gains/(losses) of

During 2012, changes in fair value gains of US$2m (2011: losses US$14m) relating to these derivative instruments and financial assets 
were taken to equity and US$18m of losses (2011: US$3m gains) were recycled from equity into cost of sales in the income statement. 
The forward points and ineffective portions of the above foreign exchange forward contracts and loss on un-designated derivatives 
of US$2m (2011: US$6m loss) were recognised in the income statement (note 4b). 
Commodity price risk – oil prices 
The Group is exposed to the impact of changes in oil and gas prices on its revenues and profits generated from sales of crude oil and gas. 
The Group’s policy is to manage its exposure to the impact of changes in oil and gas prices using derivative instruments, primarily swaps 
and collars. Hedging is only undertaken once sufficiently reliable and regular long-term forecast production data is available. 
During the year the Group entered into various crude oil swaps and zero cost collars hedging oil production of 1,000,000 barrels (bbl) 
(2011: 163,766 bbl) with maturities ranging from January 2013 to December 2013. In addition, fuel oil swaps were also entered into 
for hedging gas production of 31,743 metric tonnes (MT) (2011: 21,100MT) with maturities from January 2013 to September 2013. 
The fair value of oil derivatives at 31 December 2012 was US$ nil (2011: US$1m liability) with net unrealised losses deferred in equity of 
US$ nil (2011 US$ nil). During the year, losses of US$2m (2011: US$ nil loss) were recycled from equity into the consolidated income 
statement on the occurrence of the hedged transactions and a loss in the fair value recognised in equity of US$2m (2011: US$ nil). 
The following table summarises the impact on the Group’s pre-tax profit and equity (due to a change in the fair value of oil derivative 
instruments and the underlifting asset/overlifting liability) of a reasonably possible change in the oil price:

Credit risk 
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties. Business Unit Risk Review Committees (BURRC) evaluates the 
creditworthiness of each individual third-party at the time of entering into new contracts. Limits have been placed on the approval authority 
of the BURRC above which the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company is required. Receivable balances are monitored on an 
ongoing basis with appropriate follow-up action taken where necessary. At 31 December 2012, the Group’s five largest customers 
accounted for 48.8% of outstanding trade receivables and work in progress (2011: 47.1%). 
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale 
financial assets and certain derivative instruments, the Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a 
maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.

Fair values of financial assets and liabilities 
Market values have been used to determine the fair values of available-for-sale financial assets, forward currency contracts and oil 
derivatives. The fair value of warrants over equity instruments in Seven Energy has been calculated using a Black Scholes option valuation 
model (note 12). The fair values of long-term interest-bearing loans and borrowings are equivalent to their amortised costs determined as 
the present value of discounted future cash flows using the effective interest rate. The Company considers that the carrying amounts of 
trade and other receivables, work-in-progress, trade and other payables, other current and non-current financial assets and liabilities 
approximate their fair values and are therefore excluded from the above table. 
Fair value hierarchy 
The following financial instruments are measured at fair value using the hierarchy below for determination and disclosure of their respective 
fair values: 
Tier 1:  Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial assets or liabilities 
Tier 2:  Other valuation techniques where the inputs are based on all observation data (directly or indirectly) 
Tier 3:  Other valuation techniques where the inputs are based on unobservable market data

Independent auditor’s report to the members of Petrofac Limited  
We have audited the parent company financial statements of 
Petrofac Limited for the year ended 31 December 2012 which 
comprise the Company income statement, the Company statement 
of comprehensive income, the Company statement of financial 
position, the Company statement of cash flows, the Company 
statement of changes in equity and the related notes 1 to 18. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in 
their preparation is applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) Law 
1991 and our engagement letter dated 15 February 2011. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a 
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have 
formed. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement 
set out on page 104, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the Parent Company financial statements and for 
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility 
is to audit and express an opinion on the Parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require 
us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards 
for Auditors. 
In addition the Company has also instructed us to: 
 report to you our opinion on whether the section of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report that is described as audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the basis of preparation 
described therein  
 review certain elements of the report to shareholders by the board 
of directors’ remuneration, which for a premium listed UK 
incorporated company is specified for review by the Listing Rules 
of the Financial Services Authority 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the 
financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. 
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the Parent Company financial statements: 
 give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2012 and of its profit for the year then ended 
 have been properly prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards; and 
 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 
Opinion on other matter 
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to 
be audited, which you have instructed us to audit, has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the basis of preparation 
as described therein. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters: 
 where the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 requires us to report to 
you if, in our opinion: 
−proper accounting records have not been kept, or proper returns 
adequate for our audit have not been received from branches 
not visited by us; or 
−the financial statements are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or 
−we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit 
 where the Company instructed us to review certain elements of 
the report to shareholders by the Board of Directors’ remuneration 
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of 
Petrofac Limited for the year ended 31 December 2012.

Notes to the Company financial statements 
For the year ended 31 December 2012 
1 Corporate information 
The financial statements of Petrofac Limited (the ‘Company’) 
referred to as the Company financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2012 were authorised for issue in accordance with 
a resolution of the Directors on 26 February 2013. 
Petrofac Limited is a limited liability company registered in 
Jersey under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and is the 
holding company for the international Group of Petrofac 
subsidiaries (together the ‘Group’). The Group’s principal activity 
is the provision of facilities solutions to the oil and gas production 
and processing industry. 
2 Summary of significant accounting 
policies 
Basis of preparation 
The separate financial statements have been prepared on a 
historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments that 
have been measured at fair value. The functional and presentation 
currency of the separate financial statements is US dollars and all 
values in the separate financial statements are rounded to the 
nearest million (US$m) except where otherwise stated.  
Statement of compliance 
The separate financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 
and applicable requirements of Jersey law. 
Investments in subsidiaries 
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any provision 
for impairment. 
Investments in associates 
Investments in associates are stated at cost less any provision 
for impairment. 
Long-term loan receivables from subsidiaries 
Long-term loan receivables from subsidiaries are initially stated at 
fair value. After initial recognition, they are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. 
Due from/due to subsidiaries 
Due from/due to subsidiaries are both interest-bearing and  
non-interest-bearing short-term funding to and from subsidiaries. 
These are recognised at the fair value of consideration 
received/paid, less any provision for impairment. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash at bank and in hand 
and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months 
or less. For the purpose of the cash flow statement, cash and cash 
equivalents consists of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, 
net of any outstanding bank overdrafts. 
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 
All interest-bearing loans and borrowings are initially recognised 
at the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs 
directly attributable to the borrowing. 
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking 
into account any issue costs, and any discount or premium 
on settlement. 
Employee Benefit Trusts 
The Petrofac Employee Benefit Trust and the Petrofac Joint 
Venture Companies Employee Benefit Trust (EBT’s) are treated as 
extensions of the activities of the Company and accordingly the 
Company financial statements include all transactions and balances 
of the EBT’s except for transaction and balances between the 
Company and the EBT’s. 
Share-based payment transactions 
Employees (including Directors) of the Group receive remuneration 
in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby 
employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over 
shares (‘equity-settled transactions’). 
Equity-settled transactions 
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured 
by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted. 
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any 
service or performance conditions, other than conditions linked 
to the price of the shares of Petrofac Limited (‘market conditions’), 
if applicable. 
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with 
a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the 
relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (the ‘vesting 
period’). The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled 
transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects 
the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s 
best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately 
vest. The income statement charge or credit for a period represents 
the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the 
beginning and end of that period. 
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, 
except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market or 
non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective 
of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, 
provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied. 
Equity awards cancelled are treated as vesting immediately on 
the date of cancellation, and any expense not recognised for 
the award at that date is recognised in the income statement. 
The Company operates a number of share award schemes on 
behalf of the employees of the Group which are described in detail 
in note 22 of the consolidated financial statements of the Group. 
The reserve for share-based payments is used to record the value 
of equity-settled share-based payments awarded to employees and 
transfers out of this reserve are made upon vesting of the original 
share awards. The share-based payments charges pertaining to 
fellow Group companies are recharged to them and shown as 
investment in subsidiaries. Subsequently they are transferred to due 
from subsidiaries and settled in cash. 157 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2012

At 31 December  176 151
On 25 November 2010, the Company invested US$100m for 15% (12.6% on a fully diluted basis) of the share capital of Seven Energy 
International Limited (Seven Energy), a leading Nigerian gas development and production company incurring US$1m of transaction costs. 
This investment which was previously held under available-for-sale financial assets was transferred to investments in associates, pursuant to 
an investment on 10 June 2011 of US$50m for an additional 5% of the share capital of Seven Energy which resulted in the Company being 
in a position to exercise significant influence over Seven Energy. On 30 October 2012, the Company invested US$25m for an additional 
2.4% of the share capital of Seven Energy. The additional US$25m investment was made as part of a discounted rights issue required to 
deal with a short-term funding requirement by Seven Energy at a subscription price of US$150 per share and in light of this the carrying 
value of the investment has been tested for impairment and no impairment provision is required. No negative goodwill has been accounted 
for on the rights issue as the range of possible outcomes was immaterial. 
The Company also has the option to subscribe for 148,571 of additional warrants in Seven Energy at a cost of a further US$52m, subject to 
the performance of certain service provision conditions and milestones in relation to project execution. These warrants have been fair valued 
at 31 December 2012 as derivative financial instruments under IAS 39, using a Black-Scholes Model, amounting to US$12m (2011: 
US$18m). US$6m (2011: US$6m other income) has been recognised as other expense in the current period income statement as a result 
of the revaluation of these derivatives at 31 December 2012 (note 6). During 2012 deferred revenue recognised in trade and other payables 
of US$2m at 31 December 2012 was released in full to the income statement as 100% of the performance conditions required to subscribe 
for the remaining warrants in the Company were satisfied (2011: 80% satisfied with revenue recognised of US$10m). 
11 Amounts due from/due to subsidiaries

16 Risk management and financial instruments 
Risk management objectives and policies 
The Company’s principal financial assets and liabilities, are amounts due from and due to subsidiaries, cash and short-term deposits and 
interest-bearing loans and borrowings. 
The Company’s activities expose it to various financial risks particularly associated with interest rate risks on its external variable rate loans 
and borrowings. The Company has a policy not to enter into speculative trading of financial derivatives. 
The other main risks besides interest rate are foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk and the policies relating to these risks are 
discussed in detail below: 
Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect the value of the Company’s interest-bearing financial 
liabilities and assets. The Company does not hedge its exposure on its interest-bearing funding to/from subsidiaries. The Company is not 
exposed to any significant interest rate risk at the reporting date. 
The following table reflects the maturity profile of interest bearing financial liabilities and assets, excluding interest bearing subsidiary related 
financial assets and liabilities:

high credit ratings provided by international credit rating agencies. 
Liquidity risk 
The Company’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of term loans and revolving 
credit facilities to reduce its exposure to liquidity risk.

Forward currency contracts – undesignated 2 –  2 –
The fair values of long-term interest-bearing loans and borrowings and long-term receivable from a subsidiary are equivalent to amortised 
costs determined as the present value of discounted future cash flows using the effective interest rate. The Company considers that the 
carrying amounts of trade and other receivables, amounts due from/due to subsidiaries, trade and other payables and other current financial 
liabilities approximate their fair values and are therefore excluded from the above table. 
Fair value hierarchy 
The following financial instruments are measured at fair value using the hierarchy below for determination and disclosure of their respective 
fair values: 
Tier 1:  Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial assets or liabilities 
Tier 2:  Other valuation techniques where the inputs are based on all observation data (directly or indirectly) 
Tier 3:  Other valuation techniques where the inputs are based on unobservable market data

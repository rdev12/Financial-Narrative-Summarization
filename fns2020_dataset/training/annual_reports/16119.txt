Trifast plc Annual Report 2013 Dear Shareholder, 
What a difference a year makes, when, as in the case of Trifast, business dynamics start to build momentum. 
Over the past three years, our teams have focused on ‘working smarter’ in relation to suppliers, customers, buy/sell margin 
and non value-add costs and resources, latterly employing the Pareto (80/20) principle e.g. 80% of our profit coming from 
only 20% of our customers – so making sure that we don’t become ‘busy fools’!
The encouraging outcome from these efforts has been to reduce our overall overheads as a % of Revenue from 23% in 
2010 to 19% for this 2013 financial year end, and to increase underlying Group pre-tax profit by 45% against 2012, with 
85% of EBITDA* being yielded in cash from operations.
We acknowledge that this ‘self-help’ business focus has moved on from being a recovery strategy that started in early 
2010 to becoming a permanent key element of the now ingrained ‘Continuous Improvement’ culture that we know has the 
potential to deliver still further process improvements going forward.
Your Board structure has been streamlined from six Executive Directors to five; post the year end we then welcomed the 
addition of Scott Mac Meekin as our third Independent Non-Executive Director. Scott’s Asian and US fastener experience 
coupled with his strategic capabilities adds further strength to our team.
We have much to report upon with regard to operational developments around the Group. These include:
 Important new Global manufacturing licences granted by both Philips Screw Co. and Acument 
 First major trading links with Russia and South Korea 
 Exciting new product range launches of plastic fasteners and metal spacing pillars 
 Expansion of our India business 
 New headquarters for our expanding Swedish operations 
 Investment in sophisticated automation enabling us to adopt ‘zero-defect philosophy’ within product quality out of our 
Singapore and Malaysian factories – with Taiwan targeted for 2014 
 Both our Southern and Northern Ireland operations enjoying steady growth in a tough environment and,
 Our restructured US location starting to out-perform on profitability, having just enlarged its warehouse facilities with an 
additional unit in Houston.
As Directors, we are particularly pleased with the jump in profitability between March 2012 and March 2013. We remain 
committed to the pursuit of shareholder value, and as part of this, see many reasons that point to further ‘bottom-line’ 
growth for the foreseeable future; whilst we also continue to pursue ‘no nonsense earnings enhancing bolt-on acquisitions’, 
we can demonstrate that by focusing determinedly on our existing assets and resources, quantum leap improvements in 
performance are achievable.
As always, we appreciate your loyalty and support to our Company, and in return  
we will continue to do our best to maintain open, honest and regular communication  
on how we are managing your investment.
Yours sincerely
Malcolm Diamond MBE

Key Performance Indicators
TR’s Objectives set Result: March 2013
 Increase revenue, organically & acquisitively ✓ 8% increase in revenue 
 Increase profitability ✓ 45% uplift in underlying pre-tax profit 
 Ongoing margin enhancement ✓ 6% net profit margin (2012: 4.4%) 
 Maintain positive cash generation ✓ Operating cash flow nearly £8 million 
 Increase return on capital (ROCE) ✓ Increase to over 12% 
 Broadening the skills of management  
and staff
 ✓ ‘Value assessment’ model – identifying the 
leaders of the future 
All this has been achieved on a lower 
percentage cost base and within a global 
‘mixed’ market sector backdrop but more 
importantly by the TR teams focus on the 
objectives set before them last year; their hard 
work and commitment has delivered what we 
are reporting to shareholders – on behalf of all 
stakeholders, we congratulate our colleagues 
around the globe. 
 
The key financials are covered in the Group 
Finance Director’s Report, so we will focus on 
what we have achieved operationally over the 
year. 
The ongoing benefit of our ‘self-help’ 
initiatives, focusing on improving our gross 
profit margins, reducing percentage overhead 
content and increasing logistics efficiencies, 
are strongly evident in these 2013 results. 
This very creditable performance clearly 
underpins the Board’s commitment to all 
stakeholders – to build upon Trifast’s evolving 
reputation for ‘under promising and over 
delivering’ on performance. 
Group Business Review
Pictured (left to right): Executive Directors Geoff Budd, Glenda Roberts, Malcolm Diamond and Mark Belton
Trifast plc Annual Report 2013
Stock Code: TRI
07 Business overview 
The 2012/13 financial year has seen many 
operational developments and we summarise 
the key ones below: 
Organic performance of the business 
Asia 
Despite the loss of two previously long-held 
major component supply European transfer 
contracts to competing domestic Chinese 
assemblers, TR Asia has managed to improve 
overall profitability with a combination of new 
business wins, the integration of PowerSteel 
and Electro-Plating Works Sdn. Bhd 
(PSEP) and healthier demand from existing 
customers. 
Europe/Automotive 
The decision taken in 2010 to focus our sales 
engineering resources on Tier 1 automotive 
assemblers has proved to be timely for 
two reasons: the product lifecycle – once 
designed and approved, (it can take between 
12–18 months for the specifying, quoting and 
testing period prior to production start-up) 
lasts between five to six years, thus providing 
a stable and lengthy forward revenue stream; 
also with the edge having come off peak 
demand for global electronics products in 
the past four years, our growth has been 
sustained by diversifying our customer target 
sector beyond electronics and domestic 
appliances. This strategy is no better reflected 
than by TR Europe with its new automotive 
contract wins during the year. 
 
United Kingdom 
TR UK has gained by far the most benefit 
from the Management team’s determined 
focus on ‘self-help’. Operational efficiency 
gains have taken nearly three years to 
fully yield the material profit gains through 
lowering both fixed and variable costs and 
consolidating and re-negotiating terms with 
key suppliers. 
 
The new TR Direct next day 
delivery of standard products 
has also made an important 
contribution to this year’s 
substantial profit growth. 
Ireland 
Both our Southern and Northern Ireland 
operations have enjoyed steady growth in 
a tough environment, with no sign of their 
renewed momentum diminishing as we look 
forward.
USA 
TR’s recently restructured US location is 
performing well; with the additional global 
multinational customers secured last year we 
have recently enlarged our US warehouse 
facilities with a further unit in Houston. 
Although the US operation is currently the 
smallest contributor to Group revenue, TR 
Inc. is strategic to our future plans. A high 
proportion of our globally sited multinationals 
are headquartered in the USA, where many 
of the product designers and engineers are 
based and who all expect to receive fastener 
specification advice locally ‘on the spot’. 
Once TR is nominated on any component 
drawing, then buyers in Europe and Asia will 
be able to source exactly to specification as 
originally designated by their HQ. 
 
Competitive advantage 
Customers continue to 
benchmark TR against global 
fastener competitors and maintain 
their conclusion that we are 
uniquely positioned to fully satisfy 
their increasing demands by being 
able to combine ‘low cost/zero-
defect philosophy’ production via 
our six Asian based factories. 
This combines with delivery logistics to over 
50 countries along with design/application 
engineers directly employed by TR purely 
to resolve assembly challenges for our 
customers, many of whom, despite being 
large multinationals, do not carry the overhead 
of fastener engineers on their payroll. 
 
This ‘one-stop shop’ capability of TR 
is further bolstered by its range of TR 
Branded speciality fasteners for sheet 
metal and plastics, plus its launch post 
year end of a comprehensive new range of 
plastic fasteners, PCB spacers and cable 
management components.

Although each of TR’s 23 location business 
teams operate to their own P&L targets, the 
TR attitude of co-operation and cross skilling 
results in a ‘one family’ approach with regard 
to data and inventory sharing together with 
mutual and enjoined objectives in relation 
to competitive sourcing and customer 
quotations. This ‘thinking locally, operating 
globally’ gives TR the benefit of being swift 
to market whilst having the resources of an 
international player. 
 
Expansion and new territories 
Whilst the continent of India is an exciting area 
for expansion, we have been cautious in our 
adoption of new business and the associated 
investment that is required; however, in the 
past year we have taken on additional sales 
engineers to expand our capabilities at our 
two business offices there, as we serve our 
mainly US-owned multinational customers 
that are now firmly established. 
 
TR Sweden has been one of our successful 
European teams in gaining new automotive 
business – despite their earlier loss of the 
Saab closure as a going concern. 
This growth has enabled them to secure 
larger new offices in Stockholm in order to 
provide adequate scope for further expansion 
of their business. 
 
Our automotive team has opened up 
business for the first time with Russia, and 
new customers for our TR Branded sheet 
metal fasteners have emerged in South 
Korea, again a first for our sales team. 
 
New licences and products 
Important new global manufacturing licences 
have been granted to TR by Philips Screw Co. 
and Acument. These licences dramatically 
extend our range of fastener drive and clinch 
applications and these will appeal to those 
requiring more sophisticated engineered 
applications such as weight reduction and 
high torque demands. The product licence 
additions add considerable ‘kudos’ to our 
engineering/design capabilities in the eyes 
of many of our existing customers, whilst 
attracting new applications from both existing 
and potential customers. 
 
TR’s ever growing plastics portfolio is now 
one of the most extensive on the market, 
with more products being added throughout 
2013 in response to customer demand. TR’s 
plastics range meets all industry standards 
and legislation and initially, our focus is on 
automotive and PCB hardware applications. 
We are confident that all these developments 
open up new sectors and opportunities for 
TR as well as for the customer streamlining 
production processes; where a fastener 
is needed to be versatile light and strong, 
plastic is often the optimal solution. An 
example of this is our working relationship 
with a UK specialist high performance 
sports car manufacturer – as we all know, 
the automotive sector is constantly looking 
to be more economic and environmentally 
friendly without compromising quality and 
performance. 
 
Investing for the future 
Investment during the year in sophisticated 
automation is enabling TR to adopt ‘zero-
defect philosophy’ within product quality out 
of our Singapore and Malaysian factories 
– with Taiwan targeted for 2014. This is 
becoming an absolute requirement for 
high volume assembly customers who use 
automation or robotics for inserting fasteners, 
where a wrong dimension on a screw can 
bring a production line to a complete halt for 
anything up to an hour. 
 
Our Taiwanese business is multi-site with 
two factories, one warehouse and a separate 
sales office. Post year end, a cost model 
has been commissioned to establish a new 
site with an all-purpose new building to 
accommodate all the business functions 
under one roof. Any such move would deliver 
the double benefit of improved efficiency and 
more production capacity. We look forward 
to updating shareholders on progress in due 
course. 
 
Authorisation has been given for TR Sweden 
to upgrade its computer system in order to 
facilitate real time electronic data interchange 
with our automotive customers. The new 
upgrade is based on the same basic 
architecture as their existing software, and will 
be conducted by the same provider – thus 
minimising delays and disruption. This new 
IT system will serve as a teaching/training 
module for other TR business teams in order 
to test thoroughly prior to any subsequent 
upgrades on other TR Europe sites.

Management & People 
Training & adding new skills 
Last year, as part of our operational 
restructuring we introduced a ‘people, 
performance & responsibilities’ programme 
across the Company and at all levels. 
As a direct result of what we term, TR’s 
‘value assessment’ model (aligned to strategy 
and objectives) we are utilising skills and 
knowledge more effectively which, in turn, is 
further shaping TR’s ongoing Senior Executive 
development and succession planning 
programmes. The first three well-deserved 
appointments to the TR Operating Board 
have been announced recently – these are in 
recognition of hard work and skills ‘developed 
and channelled’ effectively under the Senior 
Executive programme – suffice to say, all three 
candidates possess leadership qualities and 
specialisms that will drive TR business units to 
the next level.
Through this initiative also, we have been 
able to more effectively deploy resources 
within existing systems and structure; 
this streamlining and realignment of 
responsibilities within the business is already 
having an impact and formed part of ‘self-
help’ objectives set as part of the Board’s 
strategy plan put in place at the start of 2012. 
 
The Apprenticeship scheme, first introduced 
in 2011 is going from strength to strength 
– we have been successful in attracting 
enthusiastic young school leavers keen to 
join TR, and we expect to gain greatly from 
their contribution in the future: the roll-out of 
the scheme across the UK businesses is also 
starting to gain momentum. 
At Board level, we have seen change 
too: Seamus Murphy, having successfully 
completed his key strategic projects (set 
within the lead team’s first three year plan 
initiated in 2009) stepped down from the Main 
Board at the end of January 2013 and has 
since left the business. Seamus joined us in 
2005 following the acquisition of Serco Ryan; 
the Directors acknowledge his input and 
service, we wish him and his family well in the 
future. 
 
Post the year end, Scott Mac Meekin  
joined the business as an Independent  
Non-Executive Director. Scott brings a wealth 
of experience gained over a 20-year career 
within the US and Asian fastener industry; his 
additional skills complement both the current 
Executive and Independent Non-Executive 
Directors’ skills base and provide extra 
impetus to our expansion aspirations. 
 
Finally, we would like to acknowledge every 
colleague from around the world, all of them 
have made a difference and worked hard 
together to achieve another year of solid 
growth; without their dedication stakeholders

OF SERVICE INNOVATION
YEARS would not be sharing in this year’s trading 
achievement. Jim and I, together with our 
fellow Board colleagues look forward to 
working with everyone over the coming year, 
to continue in the success.
Celebrating 40 years 
On 1 June 2013, Trifast celebrated its 40
th
 
Anniversary since being founded as TR 
Fastenings Ltd in 1973. TR has over the years 
played a major part in the transformation of 
how high volume/variety small lower value 
assembly components are delivered, creating 
‘Just In Time’ & ‘supply chain’ management 
logistics programmes to its customer base 
initially from one office in Sussex, and then 
driven by multinational customer demands, 
going on to establish an international footprint 
now serving over 50 countries, delivering 
over 150 million components worldwide each 
day by a highly motivated network of TR 
business teams. Nearly 30% of the Group’s 
revenue now derives from TR’s own Asian 
manufacturing base. 
 
A number of those that joined the business 
at its humble beginnings remain with us to 
this day including both of us – new ‘young 
blood’ has since joined us along the way and 
together, we have all experienced and seen 
many developments and challenges over 
the years. However, through our desire to 
‘Innovate and Serve,’ TR today is recognised 
as a driving force within the industry, at the 
cutting edge of fastener technology through 
its investment in the research & development 
of new products and services combined with 
the ‘TR culture’. 
 
Objectives, strategy and opportunities 
As Trifast Directors, we are particularly 
pleased with the jump in profitability between 
March 2012 and March 2013. We remain 
committed to the pursuit of shareholder value, 
and as part of this, see lots of reasons that 
point to further ‘bottom-line’ growth for the 
foreseeable future. 
 
This will be achieved by, as always, a 
combination of activities. There will be no 
end to our continual pursuit of operational 
efficiency improvements, even though, as 
each year passes there will naturally be an 
element of diminishing materiality in the 
size of profit gains. This is why we are now 
financially in a position to consider prudent 
new investments in automation, faster more 
analytical computer systems and additional 
sales engineers for both automotive and 
electronics sectors on a global basis. 
 
As stakeholders know, the global market 
for fasteners and related components for 
assembly is vast, and in terms of penetration, 
TR’s revenue is barely measurable; however, 
even though the market remains fragmented 
there is an opportunity for smaller more 
flexible players like ourselves to be ‘strategic 
consolidators’. 
 
Existing shareholders are aware that as a 
team we are cautious in our approach to 
acquisitions, with our demand for low debt/
high margin/loyal ongoing local management 
and cash generative businesses in a highly 
fragmented market, where TR’s business 
model of combining low cost manufacturing 
with global logistics distribution supported by 
design and application engineering is relatively 
unique. Consequently, our networking is 
constantly in search mode being sustained by 
our knowledge that, like PSEP the business 
acquired December 2011 (which today is 
fully and happily integrated into TR) target 
companies that meet these criteria certainly 
do exist. 
 
Meanwhile, our highly effective sales and 
marketing teams continue to open up new 
revenue opportunities – both geographically 
and with additional products and customer 
sectors as they strive to meet our ever 
ambitious revenue and profit targets. 
 
Trading outlook 
The Board remains very optimistic that the 
phrase a ‘World of Opportunity’ initiated last 
year is gathering momentum as the Group’s 
structure and focus enables further organic 
growth, and when combined with new 
business and niche expansion opportunities, 
TR’s operational teams feel confident in 
their ability to deliver strong results through 
2013/14, and into the future. 
 
We look forward to updating you on our 
progress throughout the coming year.

Revenue 
In the year being reported on, Group revenue increased by 8.0% to £121.54 million (2012: 
£112.51m), reflecting in the main the addition of our Malaysian acquisition, PSEP acquired in 
December 2011. During the year we were also successful in replacing older, non profitable 
contracts with new business wins at improved margins although we did experience high 
attrition levels in both the UK due to customer ‘end of life’ builds finishing and within Asia when 
two major transfer contracts from Europe came to an end. 
 
The Group’s key regions can be analysed as follows:

Europe £22.91m £21.20m +8.1% 
USA £2.52m £2.41m +4.6% 
Total for the year £121.54m £112.51m +8.0% 
The key driver of growth in the year was Asia due in the main to the acquisition of PSEP. 
Within the UK, revenue remained relatively stable despite a generally lower demand from UK 
customers and the transfer of some business to our Hungary operation. Europe delivered 
a strong performance with increased sales across all the operations in particular Holland 
and Sweden where we were successful in winning new automotive business. The increase 
in revenue from our North American operation reflects the confidence returning to the US 
economy. 
Whilst revenue growth is important to the business, one of our key drivers remains the focus on 
quality of earnings and margin enhancement.

Financial Review
Trifast plc Annual Report 2013
Stock Code: TRI
13 Financial Review continued
ROCE
12.1%
+80bps
The impressive 45.0% increase in underlying 
profitability to £7.25 million (before separately 
disclosed items) was achieved by increasing 
gross profit margins which showed a 40bps 
increase in the year to 26.0% (2012: 25.6%) 
and a reduction in the level of overheads in 
relation to revenue, to 19.4% (2012: 20.6%). 
This resulted in improved underlying net 
margins from 4.4% in 2012 to 6.0% thereby 
achieving two of our stated objectives: 
ongoing margin enhancement and increase 
profitability. 
 
By territory, the TR UK contribution 
increased by 50.7% resulting from the 
gross profit margin enhancements and 
overhead and logistical efficiencies previously 
acknowledged. Europe more than doubled 
its 2012 operating profit performance to 
£1.11 million with strong performances being 
achieved particularly within the Nordic region. 
TR Asia benefitted from the positive addition 
of PSEP into the Group but conversely was 
impacted by the loss of business mentioned 
already. TR USA, from its 2011 restructuring 
programme is beginning to bring the 
region from its previous losses into profit, 
demonstrating a three-fold increase in profit 
from 2012 to £0.30 million in the year under 
review. 
Separately disclosed items 
The following items are shown separately in 
the Consolidated income statement and need 
to be taken into consideration when reviewing 
the underlying performance of the Group:
Restructuring costs (£0.39m) 
Intangible amortisation (£0.33m) 
IFRS 2 charge (£0.09m) 
Total (£0.81m)
Of the £0.39 million restructuring costs,  
£0.19 million relates to Director compensation 
(for loss of office from the Board) and 
all associated costs in January 2013; 
the remaining balance relates to further 
redundancies within the UK to drive the  
ongoing efficiencies. 
Interest and interest cover 
Net financing costs increased slightly by 
£0.09 million to £0.72 million (2012: £0.63m) 
reflecting a full year’s effect of the acquisition 
term loan taken out by TR Asia Investment 
Holdings Pte Ltd (‘TR Asia’) to part fund the 
PSEP acquisition in December 2011. 
 
Net interest cover (defined as EBITDA to  
net interest, before one-off separately 
disclosed items) improved to 12.8 times 
(2012: 10.4 times). 
 
Taxation 
Taxation in the period was £1.73 million 
(2012: £1.60m); this reflects an Effective Tax 
Rate (‘ETR’) of 26.9% (2012: 33.6%), whilst 
the Group’s blended tax rate based on the 
geographical tax regimes was 21.3% (2012: 
20.4%). Nearly all of the Group’s current tax 
charges related to overseas operations as the 
UK business was able to utilise the remaining 
UK tax losses that it had suffered over the 
previous years. 
 
Balance sheet and funding 
At 31 March 2013, total Shareholder equity 
amounted to £60.42 million (2012: £53.49m), 
an increase of 13.0% reflecting the Group’s 
increase in retained profit of £4.71 million 
during the period and £2.17 million being 
the translation of Group’s overseas assets 
(predominantly in Asia). 
 
There was no major change in the Group’s 
property, plant and equipment, which 
represents 13.1% of the Group’s total assets. 
Intangible assets increased slightly by £0.50 
million to £18.37 million (2012: £17.87m) 
reflecting the movements in foreign exchange 
and a fair value adjustment of £0.10 million in 
respect of PSEP. 
 
Working capital as a percentage of revenue 
remained fairly stable at 30%. Removing the 
foreign exchange effect on stock, we saw 
levels fall by £0.84 million which resulted in 
net stock weeks dropping from 21.1 in 2012 
to 20.2 for 2013. Debtor days also remained 
fairly stable at 67 days (2012: 68). However, 
total bad debts were slightly higher than in 
previous years at £0.29 million (2012:  
£0.08m).

OF SERVICE INNOVATION
YEARS Gross debt fell by £4.46 million to  
£15.75 million (2012: £20.21m), which 
included the final repayment of £1.00 million 
of the Company’s three year term loan taken 
out initially in February 2010, and the annual 
repayment of c.£1.50 million of TR Asia’s 
acquisition loan for PSEP, with the balance 
being reduced borrowings from the UK’s 
Asset Based Lending facility (ABL). 
 
Group net cash balances as at 31 March 
2013 were £10.55 million (2012: £11.80m) 
of which, £9.47 million was held in foreign 
currencies (2012: £8.03m). As a result, year 
end net debt reduced by £3.21 million to 
£5.20 million in March 2013 (2012: £8.41m) 
and gearing remained low at 8.6%  
(2012: 15.7%). 
The Group continues to trade well within 
its banking covenants. In April 2013, Trifast 
successfully negotiated its UK banking 
facilities with an additional £5.00 million, three 
year revolving credit facility for the Company 
and extended its current ABL facilities total 
availability to £18.30 million. 
Cash flow 
Cash generation continues to be another key 
objective for the TR operations in order for us 
to be able to provide cash to reinvest back 
into the growing business. It is therefore very 
satisfying to report that operating cash flow as 
a percentage of EBITDA was 85.5%.

To support future growth and increase returns 
in the future, capital expenditure increased 
to £0.87 million predominantly represented 
by plant and machinery for our growing Asia 
business (2012: £0.65m). 
PSEP in Malaysia, acquired at the end 
of 2011, has integrated well and, under 
the Terms of Acquisition detailed in the 
Prospectus dated 16 November 2011, a final 
payment of £1.39 million, (previously retained 
for twelve months against any warranties and 
claims) was paid to the previous owners in 
December 2012. 
Return on capital employed 
The Group remains mindful of its objective to 
invest to increase Return on Capital Employed 
(ROCE). It is therefore pleasing to show that 
ROCE (being defined as EBIT/net assets + 
net debt) has once again improved year-on-
year, from 9.1% in 2012 (11.3% adjusted 
for PSEP pro-rata 12 months) to 12.1% by 
March 2013. 
Earnings per share 
The adjusted diluted earnings per share 
(‘EPS’) which in the Directors’ opinion best 
reflects the underlying performance of the 
Group, has increased by 25.8% to  
4.73 pence (2012: 3.76p). 
 
Dividend 
While the Directors’ focus remains on 
capital growth through investment in the 
business and increasing ROCE, the return 
to a progressive dividend stream has been 
a priority for the Board since its formation in 
2009. In October 2012, we were pleased to 
achieve this key objective by payment of the 
final dividend for 2012; to demonstrate the 
confidence the Management has in the future 
development and success of the business, 
the Board will be recommending a 60% 
increase in the final dividend of 0.80 pence 
(net of tax) per Ordinary share. Subject to 
Shareholder approval at the Annual General 
Meeting which is to be held on 17 September 
2013, the annual dividend will be paid to 
shareholders on the Register at the close of 
business on 5 July 2013. The Ordinary shares 
become ex-dividend on 3 July 2013. 
People 
Once again, I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank the Finance teams around 
the globe for their hard work and dedication in 
supporting the operational business units and 
myself; I look forward to working with them 
over the coming year as we look to further 
enhance working practices across the Group 
to help improve operational efficiencies and 
add-value across the TR network.

What motivates you?
No two days are the same, and the sheer 
variety and opportunities coming through 
continue to excite me. Working with the 
Teams globally is very satisfying as we have 
some great people who are a pleasure 
to work with, and the opportunities are 
borderless.
GCR
What will be the growth drivers  
this year?
Targeting successful customers and linking 
these with the best supply solutions. 
Developing new opportunities with an 
enhanced product range, providing technical 
support and adding to our licences, which 
will ensure we are the supplier of choice. 
Weight reduction in fastenings is the latest 
requirement, particularly in the automotive 
industry. 
GB
Who do you see as competitors and 
in which markets?
Our competitors vary depending on the 
product or the area we are being asked to 
supply to. From a small local distributor with 
local knowledge, to one of the global fastener 
players in our industry, we have a portfolio 
of either products or services that can offset 
challenges and offer an attractive package. 
Both in the automotive and electronics 
sectors our global footprint and ability to 
manage transfer or replicated builds gives us 
a leading edge. Major OEMs value this as they 
then get the same supply chain – seamlessly.
GCR 
What is the fastest growing Industry 
sector?
Without any doubt the automotive sector. We 
saw a gap in this sector that we felt we could 
service better by drawing on the experience of 
how we have managed the global electronics 
customers we currently support, and then 
replicated this model.

How strong is your operating team 
and do you have the ‘leaders of the

Group?
I have developed a number of sector silos 
with a strong sales driven leader heading 
up each one. This includes automotive, 
electronics and telecoms, sales to 
distributors, TR Direct looking after the smaller 
transactional customers, plastics products 
and a project management team controlling 
multi-site enquiries.
Of course all of this has to be supported 
by the sourcing and purchasing teams, 
the new product introduction New Product 
Introduction (NPI) teams which involves both 
technical and quality personnel on feasibility. 
Elimination of risk is a high priority for us and 
our customers, and the work has to be put in

Since you took on the role globally, 
how have things changed?
In the fourth year since the Team was 
reformed and strengthened the importance 
of coordinating global activity with the major 
OEMs we supply has been essential. The 
global enquiry portal has been one of the 
main reasons for our success as we have 
visibility of activity 24/7, and can influence 
and respond using all of the Group resources. 
Working with the global head offices and 
design centres of these companies, and being 
able to support this at local level in the various 
countries is a winning formula. 
GCR
What are key for you to achieve?
Continuing to coach people in the  
80/20 Pareto Principle encouraging them 
to spend their time on the important issues 
and not get bogged down in the small stuff. 
Continuing to improve the efficiencies in 
the business and eliminate non value add 
activity. Upskill as many of our people as we 
can, by training and equipping them with the 
skills to give value and gain personal pride in 
achieving their tasks and KPIs. 
GB
How often do you visit colleagues  
at the rockface?
This is one of the most interesting and 
pleasurable parts of my role and I am a 
frequent visitor to most of our sites on a 
regular basis. Listening to the Teams and 
engaging with them, maybe on a topic or an 
issue that they need assistance with, gives 
me a real feeling of being connected, that you 
cannot get from sitting behind a desk.
GB
What's so important about the  
new licences won this year?
The licences are very important and give our 
manufacturing sites an opportunity to make 
more value add products, and our sales 
teams to offer a more enhanced portfolio 
of product. This keeps us ahead within our 
industry, and in the eyes of our customers  
as we constantly look to increase our offering 
to them.
GB
How would you sum up your last year 
and your outlook? 
I am particularly delighted at the performance 
of the UK, Europe and the Middle East having 
fought back from the recession so strongly. 
All of the sites are performing well, and I am 
encouraged that there are new markets, and 
countries such as Russia to develop in the 
coming year. So we will move forward with 
confidence this year! 
GB
I would sum up last year as a tribute to 
networking, connecting up the opportunities 
globally and hard work on behalf of the 
teams. My outlook is that this year will 
continue to bring more global opportunities 
with some new multinationals engaging with 
us. China and the ASEAN Region will develop 
as a stronger force in automotive through the 
acquisition of PSEP and the work that has 
been done by the European teams to get us 
on the global platform builds as the approved 
supplier.

21 “30% of the Group's 
revenue now derives 
from TR's own Asian 
manufacturing base”
Jim Barker
Chief Executive
Overview – Asia
The year has seen the Asian business 
develop well. PowerSteel, in particular, has 
been successfully integrated into the Group 
and is now benefiting from new opportunities 
outside its traditional market. Its customer 
base has increased and dependency on one 
major customer has reduced.
It has also been a challenging year due to 
the global slowdown in the electronics and 
telecommunications sector, but at TR we 
have managed to overcome this with new 
business wins in other sectors, mainly due to 
the flexibility we can offer the market with our 
six Asian factories – which have the combined 
ability to manufacture a wide range of sizes 
and specifications from micro screws for disc 
drives to long engine bolts for automotive.
Investment
New investment in production and state-
of-the-art inspection equipment for the 
Singapore and Malaysia manufacturing plants 
has meant that these plants have adopted 
‘zero defect philosophy’, giving them a 
significant advantage over competitors. The 
Taiwan sites will also be moving in the same 
direction during 2014.
The Taiwan facility has reached maximum 
output, which means that we require further 
investment in plant and machinery to satisfy 
customer demand. As a result, we are 
reviewing the possibility of a new facility to 
bring under one roof all the plants that are 
currently multi-sited.
Due to our increased focus on 
the automotive industry, it has 
become necessary to obtain 
licences to manufacture patented 
parts and parts with trademarks. 
We have recently added Philip’s complete 
range of drive systems which include 
the newly patented Mortorq Super, and 
Acument’s Strux clinch system to our range 
of proprietary products. We already have 
licences for Torx, Torx-Plus, MA Thread, 
Totsu-Pra and Quadrex, and we own 
the Pozidriv trademark. More licensing 
agreements are being negotiated in our 
strategic objective to be able to manufacture 
the most common globally available fastener 
designs that offer technical advantages to our 
customers.
People
Investment in people is still one of the main 
focuses of the business. The sites are 
selectively recruiting experienced experts from 
our industry as well as nurturing employees 
with potential to take over key positions. 
One such newcomer is Theodore Wong, an 
automotive specialist, who is now managing

Outlook and strategy
Over the past few years we have seen a 
number of transfer projects into our Chinese 
business which are now coming to an end. 
In its place we are seeing massive 
opportunities within the automotive market 
and this should create solid ongoing growth 
for this business.
The gearing up for 4G infrastructure 
network worldwide will see the revival of the 
telecommunications sector within which we 
are well connected due to our well proven 
experience and knowledge.
Going forward we will continue to grow 
our business through acquiring new major 
accounts, growing existing accounts, and 
further expanding our market boundaries 
– especially into regional ASEAN countries. 
Working with the global team on global 
accounts ensures that we keep the business 
within the Group wherever the customers 
relocate, while also enhancing our standing 
as a global supplier. This has proved to be a 
winning formula.
The new fiscal year comes with great 
opportunities and we aim to deliver yet 
another year of good results. As a team, we 
remain very optimistic about the future.
I wish to take this opportunity to thank my 
staff in Asia for putting in tremendous efforts 
to achieve good results.

“The UK has gained by 
far the most benefit from 
the determined focus on 
self-help initiatives”
Mark Belton
Group Finance Director
The Group’s finance review shows the 
dramatic change in fortune for TR UK and the 
rest of Europe and throughout, I have enjoyed 
fantastic support, enthusiasm and sheer hard 
work from location and business teams.
Communication of our goals and objectives 
has been key. For each of the past two 
financial years through presentations to staff 
at all European locations, we made the focus 
of attention on the important issues. The 
theme for 2011-12 was Focus on Sales Profit 
– Cash, 2012-13 was the company wide 
adoption of the Pareto Principle the 80/20 
rule. Inspiration for these presentations was 
not original, the first, a particular hero of mine, 
John Winkler, and the second, an Italian born 
in the 19th Century, Vilfredo Pareto. 
The first theme highlighted that everyone 
with the Company can influence the sales 
effort as all of us are ‘ambassadors’ of the TR 
brand and the manner with which they deal 
with customers and suppliers alike affects 
the image and reputation of the Company. 
Everyone can look for opportunities to remove 
unnecessary costs and wasteful activities. 
Also that no matter how small, improvements 
can make a big difference.
John Winkler brilliantly illustrated this using 
a business with the following cost model of 
sales of say £100 million – variable costs of 
50%, fixed costs of 40%, giving a net profit  
of 10%. 
This is shown below with the result of sales 
increasing by 1% and fixed costs down 1%, 
giving a 20% increase in profit.

Equally important in this period of recovery 
has been the generation of cash. Our people 
are constantly being reminded that profit 
does not equal cash. Good cash collection 
depends on good customer relationship 
management and effective cash collection 
terms. TR has both quality CRM and finance 
staff.
The second year’s presentation introduced 
the 80/20 Pareto Principle. Not a new idea, 
although I have found (outside of TR) few 
people knew of Pareto. 
It is a philosophy that directs everyone to 
what is important. 80% of sales come from 
20% of customers – look after them – 20% 
of what you do will yield 80% of the total 
outcome and so forth. ‘Let us not be ‘busy 
fools’ but use our time wisely.’
Investing for the future
Whilst optimising our trading position, a lot of 
activity and resource has been to invest in the 
future:
 product launches most notably, Plastic 
Fastener Cable Management Products, 
spacer and electronic hardware
 a number of industry specialists and 
sales engineers have been recruited to 
accelerate our sales activity
 a major in-house Management 
Development programme for all location 
managers was implemented
 in-house apprenticeships have proved a 
great way to induct new colleagues 
In the early part of this new financial year 
we have successfully secured a number of 
new licences including the global licence 
agreement with the Philips Screw Company  
for ACR (Anti Camout Recess).

Trifast plc Annual Report 2013
Stock Code: TRI TR already owns the UK trademark, 
Pozidriv, and European marque, Pozi. 
Philips, the inventors of the Philips Drive 
and Pozidriv have also developed a number 
of patented systems. The most exciting for 
us is MOTORQ Super which enables the 
manufacture of fasteners with up to 25% less 
material in the head enabling the advantage of 
weight reduction and less material use, both 
vital in achieving greater efficiency especially 
in automotive applications.
Finally in June 2013, and as part of the 
Group’s planned succession strategy, we 
promoted a number of executives, including 
to the Board of TR Fastenings (TRF); this 
reflects the strength in depth we now have

appointed Managing Director; Stevie Meiklem, 
Purchasing & Operations Director, both have 
worked their way up the ranks of TR over 
many years whilst Maria Johnson, the newly 
appointed TRF Finance Director is extremely

Trifast plc Annual Report 2013 Launch of industry forum
In June 2013 TR was invited to speak at 
the inaugural CEO Global Fastener Industry 
Summit held in Jin Mao Tower, Shanghai, 
China. 
The key aim of the Summit has been to 
launch an industry high-end communication 
platform and establish a dialogue forum for 
the global fastener industry; an important 
sector seen as ‘traditional’ but operating in a 
rapidly changing era where, as we all witness, 
24/7 worldwide virtual communications are 
influencing the way we all lead our lives. 
Our CEO, Jim Barker was one of seven 
business leaders invited to address the 
150-strong Summit attended by decision 
makers from manufacturing companies, 
importers, exporters, distributors and 
wholesalers from across the world including 
Europe, mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, 
Japan, South Korea, Russia, Turkey and India.
Jim delivered his key speech on 
‘Customers need a solution not 
just product itself’. 
He discussed how, in today’s world of 
advancing, ever-changing communication 
tools, customers look for more requirements 
on service – it is no longer about being just 
being able to deliver a pallet of goods – 
customers need a complete supply solution, 
which is a strong USP for TR.
Others focused on branding (with 
differentiation, authenticity, consistency and 
sustainability being the essences of brand 
value); the importance of new technologies 
and social media in promoting fastener 
products; China’s auto fastener market status; 
and supply chain analysis and the need for 
modern equipment and technology being key 
to ensure high quality fastener production.
The Summit which is to become an annual 
event, provided a significant opportunity 
for global business leaders to meet and 
discuss the current industrial hot issues, 
share different ideas, and strengthen 
communication and co-operation. 
“To be invited to speak 
on behalf of TR at such 
a high profile event 
in Asia, truly reflects 
our Company’s global 
standing”

Evolution of opportunities
The main problem companies have in 
penetrating a new market is obtaining a fair 
opportunity from a customer to quote against 
an incumbent supplier. Most of the time, the 
opportunity is just a benchmarking exercise 
to get the incumbent supplier to lower their 
costs. Customers used to be reluctant to 
change suppliers due to the cost, resources, 
and time associated with the transition, let 
alone quality and supply concerns. All of 
these factors make it hard for a company to 
grow market share.
But a change, or shift in perception occurred 
during the middle of the market collapse in 
the last four years.
Companies have begun to recognise 
that markets are no longer restrained to 
geographical regions. A global economy 
drives demands for products, not just 
specific regions. Also, the market collapse 
has caused a ‘rethink’ from top to bottom in 
all companies on how to reduce costs. No 
longer is it enough to just shave off labour by 
reducing the workforce, but costs needed 
to be lowered by controlling the supply 
chain. With these two changes, those scarce 
opportunities are now abundant.

Trifast plc Annual Report 2013 Companies are now looking for global 
strategic supply chain partners, shedding 
the philosophy that the incumbent is the only 
solution. They are looking for suppliers that 
have a global footprint, suppliers who can 
provide global logistical solutions, suppliers 
who can provide cost reductions based on 
global demand, suppliers who can manage 
quality and service on a global platform, 
suppliers such as TR Fastenings.
The team here at TR USA acknowledges 
the opportunities we have before us. We 
realise how TR, as a global company, has 
positioned itself correctly to take advantage 
of this opportunity. TR USA will leverage that 
global footprint and continue to target large 
multinational companies, specifically in the 
electronics and automotive sectors. 
The trick will no longer be ‘How do we get 
an opportunity’, but ‘How do we separate 
ourselves from the competition as the correct 
solution’
So the time is now, to make good on these 
opportunities while the market is fragmented 
and looking for a solution. That solution will 
be TR.

Global Sales and Business Development
The sales focus this year has been on the 
‘World of Opportunity’. With an already 
established global footprint, we were in an 
enviable position to develop further the global 
reach and a local presence concept. The 
challenges this year have been very different 
to the previous three years, and have required 
different approaches and skills to develop 
further with the major multinational OEMs that 
we supply, and extend it to the rest of the 
customer base as required.
The enhanced requirements of these OEMs 
have been demanding, but instead of seeing 
these as issues we have embraced the 
challenges. These range from RoHS 2  
legislation on products coming into the 
European market place and the testing of 
parts to prove there are no inherent banned 
substances, to IT developments such as self 
bill and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).
Our attitude and willingness to 
support these requests in a timely 
manner has been appreciated, 
and elevates our status as many 
competitors fight the inevitable. 
This is not customer compliance, 
but an acceptance that service 
and support is a key differentiator.

Trifast plc Annual Report 2013 We have dedicated teams in place to ensure 
that RoHS2, conflict materials and carbon 
emissions are handled professionally. This 
enables us to fully comply with legislation 
and satisfy customer audits and vendor 
questionnaires. Having in-house IT support 
and programmers gives us the immediacy 
and technical knowhow to meet these needs.
In a very competitive world the levels 
of service and support that we give our 
customers is very important. The true value of 
the Vendor Managed Inventory systems (VMI) 
giving lean build cannot be underestimated, 
eliminating costs in holding and managing 
product and reducing the vendor base all 
have an intrinsic value to the customer.
End of life projects and build changes ran at 
a higher level this year, but we have replaced 
this business with new contracts that have 
longevity. In the automotive sector these 
contracts are typically for a six year period. 
A high percentage of this replacement 
business is within this sector which has the 
advantage of having fewer but higher volume 
parts compared to other sectors. This will be 
further reflected in the 2013/2014 figures as 
these contracts build in volume after the initial 
start-up of production. The way we handle 
new parts/business introduction has been 
modelled on the TS 16949 AQPQ process 
and we have fully trained NPI personnel 
controlling this key area at all hub sites. This 
ensures that we meet feasibility criteria, time 
lines, and eliminate risk to either our company 
or our customers. This is a global programme 
so that we have a consistent process with the 
same customer irrespective of where they are 
serviced.
Project Management is another key area 
of sales development. Managing enquiries 
where the same parts are required on three 
continents to multiple sites for the same 
OEM are now common, as the OEMs 
try to leverage their group usages and 
spends. To coordinate these across the TR 
business takes special skills. This involves 
logistics and finance teams input, an in 
depth understanding of freight and duty 
tariffs on product being sourced, managing 
currencies and preparing quotations tailored 
to encompass all of these factors. The global 
enquiry portal developed by TR personnel 
in-house is the central repository that is used 
as a common platform in the business and 
tracks all aspects of the quotation. We also 
have project managers on the Strategic team 
who work with sales, sourcing, quality and 
logistics in preparing the final quotations. This 
has proved to be very successful, and is a key 
component of new business development.

The Group marketing team have been very 
proactive during this year. Having this facility 
in-house is just invaluable as we can react 
swiftly to the business needs, and take 
advantage at short notice of opportunities to 
support the sales teams. The enhancements 
to the website, new brochures, support for 
product launches, new high impact exhibition 
stands used globally, and promotional activity 
all keep us ahead of the game, and we punch 
above our weight within our industry. The 
exposure we have had in trade and industry 
media using application stories or product 
launches, has increased substantially. We 
have also entered the world of social media 
using Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. We 
have seen some good results already and 
are attracting the right kind of ‘followers’, and 
fully expect this area to expand rapidly. The 
website is now in 15 languages, and Russian 
has been our latest addition as we again 
follow our customers into new markets. Mini 
sites have been created off of the main site to 
specifically focus on certain countries.
Following extensive research we increased 
our strong product portfolio with the addition 
of a comprehensive range of plastic and 
cable management parts. These products 
were already within our range, but was often 
just an add on, particularly with customers 
who required us to manage their category ‘C’ 
products. Certain market situations opened 
our eyes to an opportunity to major on this 
product and we selected very good vendors 
in Asia and America to help us launch the 
range. This is the most comprehensive 
and well planned market launch we have 
ever embarked upon. The interest this has 
created has been significant, as we have 
offered substitute products to meet demand 
and expect this to be a ‘real alternative’ to 
the dominant brand names in this market. 
This range is being constantly expanded, 
and we expect this to be a major revenue 
earner going forward. We have recruited 
an experienced plastics brand manager to 
mastermind this product strategy and sales 
development on a global basis. Our sales 
teams are excited by this product range as 
initially we get quick wins with our existing 
customers, many of whom have been buying 
this product from numerous other vendors.
Traditionally, the electronics/telecom sector 
has been the largest sector within the TR 
Group. Automotive has now overtaken 
electronics and represents 33% of the 
turnover. The electronics sector however 
taught us, during the first decade of this 
century, how to follow this business globally

Trifast plc Annual Report 2013 as parts were transitioned to lower cost 
countries, or where we had assisted in 
the design of parts and were therefore the 
approved vendor. The countries involved were 
usually Mexico, China, Hungary and Poland. 
We are now seeing the emergence of Russia, 
Thailand, Vietnam and the whole ASEAN 
Region, being the new areas for development 
as the OEMs chase new markets or the next 
lower cost area. The ASEAN Region is of 
particular interest to us as we have seven 
manufacturing and distribution sites in this 
area. There are real benefits for companies 
setting up in this region, especially if product 
is manufactured within these 11 countries 
signed up to the ASEAN trade agreement. 
One of the key strategies employed within 
both sectors is to network out to more 
locations of the same group as the hard 
work at corporate level will already have 
been completed, and we understand their 
business needs and requirements. TR’s 
global positioning enables us to do this, and 
the Strategic Teams work with the local TR 
sites to assist in securing the contracts at 
local level. Working within the design centres 
is key, and we have a preference when 
recruiting to employ more engineers who also 
possess a commercial aptitude. Product can 
be designed with an OEM in America, but 
the production volumes are then potentially 
required in China, Mexico, India, Slovakia and 
Thailand. Truly a ‘World of Opportunity’.

We have had a very successful year within the 
automotive sector, and we have been the 
recipient of prestigious service awards from 
several Tier1’s. Two of these have over 200 
sites globally, so the potential is enormous. 
The acquisition of PSEP in Malaysia and their 
integration into the TR family has further 
strengthened our position in the marketplace. 
Previously we were limited to supplying 
product for the car cockpit which 
encompassed seating, IP console, 
headliner fixings etc. Whilst these are used 
in substantial volumes, the value parts are 
in other parts of the vehicle e.g. braking 
systems, airbag assemblies, engine and 
powertrain fastenings.
 
Pictured: Management team – TR Asia
This is PSEP’s core competency and they 
are supplying the two wheel and four wheel 
vehicle sector. This gives us a complete 
supply capability on a vehicle and increases 
the product offering substantially. The TR 
European locations servicing the automotive 
Tier1’s are strategically sited close to the 
manufacturing clusters e.g. North East for 
Nissan related business, Manchester for the 
Liverpool sites, Birmingham for the Midlands, 
Holland for the German and middle European 
plants, and Sweden for the Scandinavian 
and Russian market. However, China is the 
target market that is now our area of focus. 
A number of the platform builds we supply 
into for JLR, Nissan and Volvo will now be 
replicated in China. We are in many cases the 
approved vendor, and are perfectly positioned 
to manage this business from our established 
sites in China. Senior members from the TR 
Shanghai operations have spent time with 
our automotive and NPI teams to familiarise 
themselves with the product supplied, the 
builds and the quality requirements.
The activity level within sales is high, the 
enquiry portal is at a healthy level, conversion 
rates on new business are in line with budgets 
and I am optimistic about the organic sales 
for the new year.

which lead to better 
design, improved 
productivity and new 
market opportunities are 
equally beneficial for the 
fastener manufacturer 
and customers – a great 
benefit to us all”
Geoff Budd
TR Europe Managing Director
Pictured: Plastic fasteners
The change in fastener technology 
has benefitted the manufacturer.
Millions, if not billions of fasteners are 
produced and sold worldwide every day. 
Designed in response to the constantly 
evolving needs of manufacturers, these 
integral components to our cars, fridges, 
computers and telephones are the lynchpins 
of our modern existence, without which our 
21
st
 Century lives would, literally, fall apart.
Advances in product technology and 
design, combined with economic and 
even environmental factors, mean that the 
successful fastener manufacturer and supplier 
has to be nimble enough to adapt its range 
constantly to manage its customers’ needs, 
and stay ahead of competitors.
TR has been at the forefront of the industry 
since it was founded and today, regularly 
supplies over 5,000 companies with 
components, each with specific needs in both 
product and quality. 
In recent years one major development in 
manufacturing industry has been the trend 
for using fewer, and lighter, materials. Already 
a market leader with our extensive range of 
metal fasteners and fixings, TR has recently 
launched a range of plastic fasteners, which 
looks set to become a core product range in 
its portfolio.
Where a fastener is needed to be versatile, 
light and yet strong, plastic is often the 
optimal solution. For example within the 
automotive sector the latest trend is for 
‘lightweighting’ – a lighter car uses less fuel, 
is more economic and more environmentally 
friendly. TR recently supplied plastic fasteners 
to the UK car manufacturer Ariel Motors' 
Atom sports car, the objective to take weight 
out of the structure to enhance its world-
famous performance. 
The Atom is just one example of how we 
are currently approaching our clients and 
asking to work with them to understand 
their processes and see if we can use our 
engineering skills to improve production 
benefit. Plastic fasteners have the advantage 
of being multi-functional – why use a nut, 
bolt and a washer, when you could use a 
two-piece plastic rivet that takes less time to 
apply? That is where the innovation is.
Manufacturers benefit from changes in Fastener Technology
Back in May 2011, an electric motorcycle (photo) designed and built by Phil Edwards set the UK record 
for electric motorcycle drag racing. As is the nature of motorsport the record was lost so Phil simply 
had to respond; the lure of record-breaking proving irresistible.
What’s the plan?....a more ambitious target – building the quickest electric motorcycle in the world. 
That's going to need a motorbike with 1,000hp of clean energy, accelerating to 60mph in under one 
second, 200mph in just four seconds, and on to 225mph… in just quarter of a mile.
Welcome to this great British project that’s designed to showcase UK talent and inspire the next 
generation of engineers and scientists. TR is proud to be one of the support sponsors.

Innovation is all in a day’s work for TR’s team 
of technical specialists with communication 
between customer and TR key to success – 
we regularly undertake market research and 
invest considerable time and resources in the 
development of new products as a result. 
Our Application Engineers regularly work 
alongside product designer and developers to 
provide technical assistance on materials and 
product development – a bespoke service for 
those who request it.
TR’s range of Hank Rivet Bushes, Hank Self 
Clinch, Blind Rivets, Euro Rivet Bushes, 
Swage Nuts, Weld Nuts and K-Series 
products all offer threads in a variety of 
materials where the sheet is too thin to be 
tapped by conventional methods. This has 
ensured that TR has positioned itself as a 
market leader in the sheet metal fastener 
sector with its own-range of fasteners. As 
metals became lighter and thinner during 
the 1990’s we introduced the TR Hank 
Clinch Fastening range which now currently 
comprises 750 different components and 
continues to expand to meet commercially 
viable markets and customer needs in 
numerous industry sectors, including medical 
equipment, marine, automotive, white goods, 
telecommunications, electronics and general 
engineering. 
Binx Nuts range is another exclusive fastening 
to TR’s product portfolio. Originally designed 
in the 1960’s, the Binx nut, unaffected by 
temperature fluctuations has been refined and 
developed by TR Fastenings to an all-metal, 
self-locking nut suitable for use in various 
industry sectors and remains the first choice 
for many, especially where vibration resistance 
is a priority such as in high-end specialist 
engineering industry sectors.
Meanwhile, further investment in product 
development for the thermoset and 
thermoplastic industries has enabled TR to 
expand its screws for plastics range with the 
introduction of the Plas-Fix 45 screw.

Apprentices
Following on from TR’s successful 
introduction of its Apprenticeship Scheme 
launched last year, we have taken on another 
new business apprentice this year from 
Uckfield Community Technology College. 
Earlier in the year, we attended a Careers Fair 
at the local college; joined by one of TR’s first 
apprentices, we were able to demonstrate 
the opportunity and environment for a student 
joining the business, and this approach 
seemed to attract a lot of students to our 
display stand – which was very encouraging 
to us. We all know only too well that in 
today’s fast moving world of commerce the 
business community needs to attract high 
calibre young people to be trained to become 
the next generation of business leaders and 
entrepreneurs.
At the time of writing, we 
now have apprentices in 
manufacturing, warehousing  
and in operations. 
Graham Morrison has successfully completed 
his first year as a business apprentice and 
has benefited from his hands-on experience, 
learning different modules within each 
department, and very encouraging to us is 
that the feedback has been equally good 
from both the student and the respective 
departmental heads, so an overall asset win 
for TR.
James Hope is the latest new apprentice who 
is currently in his first three-month placement 
within the warehouse environment, and 
already it has been pleasing to see we are 
developing his inner skills for both his own 
and TR’s benefit.
Jade Wickham who we featured in the 2012 
Annual Report has successfully completed 
her Apprenticeship, and we are all delighted 
that she has secured a full-time position with 
the Company as a Data Coordinator working 
within the Strategic Team.
All of these are great examples of young 
people who have committed to learning and 
training, and their hard work and dedication 
is an asset to us as a business – both from a 
local and international perspective.
Leadership Programme
We launched our Leadership modules in May 
this year. This programme is initially bringing 
together on a monthly basis eight location 
heads from the UK and Ireland; over the next 
14 months we will be striving to achieve the 
following aims: 
Aims of the programme
 To drive joint initiatives through the  
UK & Ireland
 To further develop leadership skills
 To develop and implement ‘Best Practice’ 
across the UK and Ireland
 To build and enhance relationships with 
peers and functional heads
Overall objective
 To create a highly skilled and unified team 
to manage change and deliver business 
success across the UK & Ireland
“Designing personal 
development training 
for such enthusiastic 
colleagues is a real 
delight”
Helen Toole
HR Adviser

Trifast plc Annual Report 2013
Stock Code: TRI Within the first Leadership Programme, each 
location head from the UK and Ireland has 
taken a lead for each of the key functions 
(Sales, Purchasing, Quality, Warehouse and 
Logistics, Human Resources, Systems, 
Finance). Each is responsible for collating 
the issues relating to that function and 
subsequently feeding them through to 
the functional head prior to the three-day 
leadership programme session: as a result, 
they will then be responsible for the action 
plan resulting from their discussions. 
In addition, the team is also undertaking as 
part of the programme, four one day sessions 
with an external leadership trainer who will 
be concentrating on their leadership skills 
and how they interact with others, and the 
resultant impact they can have on colleagues 
and the business. We do not want them to 
lose their local passion, which is undoubted 
and shines through, but we want them to also 
view the entire TR business as one entity.
Training and Development Module
Following on from the HR Self-Service System 
(introduced to the business two years ago) 
and the Performance Management System 
introduced last year, we are, in the coming 
twelve month period, to add a Training & 
Development module to the system. This will 
allow employees not only to browse training 
opportunities and courses and to be able to 
request training through the system, but will 
also give TR a more proactive and effective 
approach in managing the training budget. 
Once training has been completed, evaluation 
forms will be automatically generated allowing 
us to ensure that the training offered is 
relevant, fit for purpose and that the trainers 
are up to the standard that we would expect.
At TR we value our colleagues, and so it is 
therefore important to open up opportunities 
to everyone at all levels, skills and ability. 
Today we are training the leaders of the future, 
and it gives my HR team and management 
great satisfaction to see the investment in our 
people reaping dividends for all stakeholders 
and most importantly, the individual. 
We look forward to reporting on our 
successes once again, in next year’s Annual

Introduction
The Trifast Main Board and Operational 
Management teams continue to focus 
on delivering ‘Continuous Improvement’ 
in relation to the Group’s objectives and 
‘performance measurables’, that is, how 
we as a business approach CSR – both for 
individual business teams, locations and for 
the Group as a whole.
Our key Group topics embrace Health & 
Safety, energy consumption within our 
properties, fleet vehicle fuel consumption and 
emissions, wasteful packaging, personnel 
travel, flexibility for staff compassionate 
leave (combined with pastoral care), ethical 
sourcing and supply chain freight logistics.
As stakeholders are aware an increasing 
number of multinational customers now 
include CSR audits when inspecting and 
validating potential new suppliers; therefore, 
our responsibility to further develop our 
own CSR activities is ongoing and extends 
beyond business ethics, environmental 
and community to include essential major 
customer compliance.
At local level, we continue to encourage 
‘loaning’ of staff, or other relevant Company 
resources to, for example, local charities, 
youth organisations, and hospices in order to 
assist and support them with their community 
activities. We feel that it adds more value, 
appreciation and satisfaction to all involved 
to give our time and gifts ‘in kind’ wherever 
possible, rather than indulge in ‘cheque book 
charity’.
TR has developed close links with local 
schools and colleges and actively promotes 
opportunities for work experience, classroom 
seminars, pupil and staff visits so as to 
generally foster a better level of understanding 
between TR as potential employers and the 
future providers of possible applicants for 
employment. This has for the second year 
running been our main resource for recruiting 
school leavers into our new Apprenticeship 
scheme and NVQ Business studies 
programme at TR Uckfield. As a business, we 
subscribe to the UK Government initiative that 
aims to support and encourage businesses to 
offer apprenticeship schemes, especially at a 
time when the financial and career prospects 
for graduates continues to be tough for young 
people. Whilst TR is proud of its very low staff 
turnover, there remains the need to ensure 
that we encourage a steady inflow of ‘new 
blood’ into our Company that can be trained 
at an early age to learn our systems, ethics 
and business culture.
Business ethics
We expect all of our business activities to be 
conducted in accordance with high standards 
of ethical conduct and full compliance with all 
applicable national and international laws. We, 
in turn, apply these standards to all dealings 
with customers, suppliers, employees and 
other stakeholders.
Our Code of Business Ethics and Responsible 
Behaviour provides a guide to the way we 
achieve our business goals, helping us to 
behave in an open and ethical manner. This 
extends to provisions for ‘whistleblowing’ 
whereby employees may report suspected 
wrongdoings in confidence. Appropriate 
ethical behaviour is reviewed as part of the 
Group’s performance appraisal process. We 
have extended this Code to our vendors/
suppliers. This requires our key strategic 
suppliers to work towards achieving, as a 
minimum, standards covering such issues as 
the environment, employee Health & Safety 
and the prohibition of child labour, which 
through business reviews and on-site visits, 
encourages compliance and good practice 
within our supply chain.
We will also do our utmost to contract 
only with sub-contractors or suppliers 
who themselves adhere to international 
human rights and environmental laws and 
practices. TR commits to monitor the ethical 
performance of its key suppliers and to taking 
immediate steps in cases where the ethical 
performance of its key suppliers comes into 
question. All key suppliers to the business are 
required to agree and sign our comprehensive 
‘Quality and Sustainability Agreement’ 
before entering into a trading relationship 
with TR. This agreement fully covers the 
suppliers Business Ethics, Health & Safety 
and Environmental Management with regard 
to national and international laws (including 
labour and ethics) along with submission of 
their written policy and contact details of the 
persons responsible within their organisation. 
We also encourage suppliers to support their 
local communities and expect evidence of this 
to be available on request, plus we require all 
suppliers to sign a separate CSR Statement.
Corporate Social Responsibility
Illustrated are a number of charities 
and sponsorships which TR has 
supported within the communities in 
which we operate:
Chris Tull and Dave Hinton from  
TR Systems ran in the Brighton 
Marathon for The British Heart 
Foundation and the NSPCC. 
Sam Pert, from TR Uckfield, took part

1.2 Business Ethics
TR Fastenings expect all of our business 
activities to be carried out in accordance 
with high standards of ethical conduct and 
full compliance with all relevant national 
and international laws.
To achieve this we require suppliers to 
comply with all applicable legislative 
requirements in relation to labour and 
ethics. We expect suppliers to have a 
written policy, details of an implementation 
programme, and contact details for 
responsible persons available upon 
request.
1.3 Health, Safety and Environmental 
Management
TR Fastenings run a robust and well 
established system of Health, Safety and 
Environmental Management throughout 
the Company, which demands compliance 
with all laws and ISO14001 where 
applicable. 
TR Fastenings routinely audits, assesses, 
monitors and carries out training to 
ensure that our Policy and strategy are 
implemented effectively.
Our suppliers are required to comply with 
all relevant national and international laws. 
Suppliers must be able to provide evidence 
of policies, risk assessments, insurances, 
licences, contact details, accident/incident 
figures, and any other legally applicable 
documentation upon request.
1.4 Community
As a global company TR Fastenings 
recognises the role that communities play 
in our business. We encourage all areas of 
our Company to support the needs of their 
local community by contributing to local 
charities and community initiatives.
We also encourage our suppliers to 
support their local communities, and 
expect that evidence of this is available 
upon request.

Trifast plc Annual Report 2013
Stock Code: TRI Health & Safety
The Managing Directors/General Managers 
appointed by the Board have responsibility 
for the Health & Safety and environmental 
performance of their operational areas. They 
are assisted by the Health & Safety Manager. 
Trifast is committed to meeting all relevant 
Health & Safety legislation, regulation and 
Codes of Practice.
The Group Health & Safety Policy places 
responsibility for the management of health 
& safety on the individual business unit 
management who are supported by Health & 
Safety Advisers where necessary. All business 
units provide employees with relevant 
comprehensive Health & Safety training and a 
written Health & Safety policy.
The Managing Directors/General Managers 
ensure regular inspections and annual internal 
audits of Health & Safety performance and 
also have regular designated Health & Safety 
training. These audits have been successfully 
reinforced by the use of the British Safety 
Council. Our Health & Safety performance 
and significant risk exposures are reviewed 
regularly by management and the Board.
Resulting from our excellent safety record, we 
continue to work towards our stated goal of  
‘a reportable accident free target period of 
one million working hours’. 
Health & Safety is a standard agenda item at 
all Main Board Meetings.
Environment
Good environmental practice and the impact 
that our operations have on the environment 
are of great importance to TR.
The main aim of the Group’s Environmental 
Policy is to comply with all relevant legislation 
in all areas in which we operate and to adopt 
responsible environmental practices. We 
have established a process for monitoring 
legislation and acting upon it where 
necessary. Business units are required to 
comply with Group policy and local statutory 
regulations and are committed to setting their 
own environmental targets such as improving 
energy efficiency, reducing waste and 
increasing recycling in conjunction with  
Group objectives. 
 In respect of waste management 
specifically, we use the services of an 
external professional agency to manage 
and monitor activities using health check 
compliance audits and advice on data 
collection systems. Promoting recycling, 
we follow the agency’s recommendation 
for appropriate waste disposal.
 Group performance and risk reviews are 
undertaken via Management Review 
on a regular basis and reported directly 
to Jim Barker, Chief Executive who 
has Main Board responsibility for the 
Group’s Environmental Risk Policy. TR will 
communicate any significant environmental 
impact with third parties on request.
 Our Fleet Manager focuses on 
manufacturers who can supply vehicles 
with below average carbon emissions.
 Our Logistics Managers continuously 
review the efficiency of our van delivery 
routes in conjunction with customers in 
order to examine opportunities to reduce 
delivery frequency, and where appropriate, 
to outsource ‘far flung isolated’ routes to 
daily delivery freight specialists. This has 
resulted in our van fleet being reduced by 
25% since March 2009 – this has delivered 
significantly reduced mileage, costs and 
carbon emissions.
 The TR Uckfield office and warehouse 
facility has begun to recoup the capital 
cost (first of four year target set last year) 
in energy savings and reduce the actual 
carbon footprint since the investment in 
replacement HVAC. 
 The utilisation of video conferencing 
systems around the business continues 
to assist us to significantly reduce costs 
and ‘lost time’ from staff travel needed in a 
multi-site operation involving 31 business 
teams located in 16 countries. 
The business and the community
Trifast recognises the role local communities 
play in our businesses. We aspire to be a 
responsible partner in the communities in 
which we operate around the world. We 
encourage all our businesses to support 
the particular needs of their communities by 
contributing to local charities and community 
initiatives.

Stock Code: TRI
Trifast plc Annual Report 2013 Most of our financial contributions to 
charities come from the effort and personal 
involvement of our staff around the Group 
with tangible support from the Directors 
with regard to allowing flexible working and 
auctions, dressing up days and the use of 
our premises for fund raising. Not only does 
this provide real benefits to local communities 
but has the distinct advantage of further 
enhancing team spirit amongst our staff.
Employees
TR aims to attract, retain and motivate the 
highest calibre of employees within a structure 
that encourages their development and 
initiative.
Employees are provided with ongoing 
learning and development opportunities 
that are aligned to the Group’s strategic and 
business units’ objectives and formal personal 
development programmes operate where 
linked to the Group’s objectives.
To retain and add to the skills of our dedicated 
and committed workforce, we continue 
to enhance our HR resources & training, 
capabilities through professional managers 
and technology so as to provide an all-
encompassing HR tool for each staff member 
that identifies and meets their future training, 
personal development and support services.
All of these processes are reinforced with 
appropriate remuneration incentives and are 
on recognised systems.
Communications
We aim to maintain a productive and  
open dialogue with all interested parties  
in our business including shareholders,  
customers, suppliers and employees.  
We have established customer relations, 
conduct customer satisfaction surveys, 
monitor and develop supplier performance 
and undertake regular employee surveys. 
We maintain our investor and commercial 
websites as one of the main routes for 
providing information to interested parties and 
for contacting us.
The Board is dedicated to investing time and 
effort into further improving all aspects of 
TR’s internal and external communications by 
prudent use of digital media to supplement 
verbal interaction with supporting materials.
During the year, the Chief Executive, 
Executive Chairman and other Main Board 
Directors continued with the highly successful 
‘TQM Tour’, re-introduced in 2010. This 
initiative involves a visit to each English-
speaking business location at least once a 
year in order to interact with the staff and to 
update them on the progress of the Group 
by explaining the Board’s objectives and the 
business performance in some detail, and 
encouraging open dialogue, questions and 
feedback on all aspects of the business and 
its plans. From this we have been able to 
work with our colleagues and ensure that as 
a team we create the right environment to 
develop our people and overall productivity.
Our Group Marketing team works in 
partnership around the business, both 
at home and overseas, designing and 
distributing multilingual material to support 
local market activities as well as internal news 
publications that help to keep our people 
informed about for example, new business 
wins, exhibitions plus job functions and 
profiles of colleagues around the globe.
In addition they work with the Senior 
management and external agencies on 
projects that assist the profiling of the 
business both commercially and for all 
stakeholders. During the year, TR Marketing 
supported colleagues at a number of trade 
events helping to underpin the strength of 
the TR brand and its global capabilities and 
offering.
TR received documentation to certify  
that the construction of an Elephant  
Pump in Zimbabwe has now been  
completed in the Company name.  
We also received a letter of thanks  
from Taniche Mahachi, aged 14, from  
Manicaland Province where our well

Stock Code: TRI Key Risks and Uncertainties Mitigation
Personnel  
The Group’s employees are its key asset as their skills and 
commitment provide the solid foundation that is important in delivering 
our future plans and long term success.
Training forms a key part of an individuals’ personal development plan 
– with a clear HR strategy in place we operate an ongoing programme 
of rolling out new initiatives and modules to support both the Group’s 
business plans and the personal goals of all our staff. 
The Group also has in place an ‘emergency plan’ to cover short 
term issues, however the Group has also developed its ‘Succession 
Planning Module’ which provides detailed plans in the event of, for 
example, loss of key personnel; including key officers who the Board 
consider to be ‘the next generation’ leaders. In circumstances where 
more specialist skills at a senior/operational or Board level are needed, 
learning programmes and development modules are instigated to 
assist with career development and learning pathways and added to 
personal development programmes which are undertaken internally or 
externally by suitably qualified personnel.
Quality and Manufacturing   
The Group operates stringent ‘Total Quality Management’ (TQM) 
procedures and measures its performance. 
TR manufactures around 30% of its inventory, the balance being 
sourced from strategic manufacturing partners. As with key 
customers, TR regularly visit manufacturing operations to ensure that 
high standard operating procedure guidelines which cover production, 
security, logistics and quality are being adhered to.
Currency  
The business is exposed to currency movements relating to sales, 
purchases and cash borrowings particularly against the US Dollar and  
the Euro.
Currently, as far as practicable, TR operationally hedges, will monitor 
exchange rates and buy & sell currencies in order to minimise its 
exposure. It is also reviewing instruments available through its banking 
partners to reduce the Group’s open exposure to foreign exchange 
rates.
Global Protectionism  
Increasing evidence of growing trade protectionism around the world. Geographically spread our supply chain sources.

In common with all businesses the Group faces risks which may affect its performance. The Board recognises that the management 
of risk is required to enable the business objective in creating ‘stakeholder value’.
The Board and the Operational Management teams regularly monitor and develop a range of financial and non-ﬁnancial performance 
indicators to allow them to measure performance against expected targets – these can be analysed under various categories; the 
following represents a selection of these indicators. 
TR’s key performance objectives remain ongoing:-

Key Risks and Uncertainties Mitigation
Working Capital and Stocks  
As the business continues to grow TR is required to carry additional 
stock to meet its transactional and OEM business which could lead to 
an increased exposure to obsolete stock. 
Through TR’s involvement at the R&D entry point through the 
production life of a product and customer underwrite forms, control 
of obsolete stock risk is kept to a minimum. The ongoing tight control 
over stock purchases has seen us once again report a reduction in 
stock weeks.
Customer Failure and Debtor Exposure   
Serving over 5,000 customers in 50 countries bring complexity and 
stock challenges.
The business operates very tight controls on debtors and working 
capital. Monitoring systems and reports in place assist in highlighting 
and managing debtor defaults and customers’ trading; the impact of 
these controls is reﬂected in the reported Accounts which show less 
than 5% Group exposure in balances overdue. 
Macro Economics   
Currently Group revenue comes from across the UK (47%) and Asia 
(32%) with the balance from Europe and the Americas. 
Traditionally, whilst the distribution/manufacturing sectors bear the 
effect of destocking in tough and challenging economic periods, TR 
protects itself to some extent from this by differentiating itself through 
‘added value’ capabilities, such as, high levels of service, design & 
engineering support, customer partnerships and working practices. 
The Global sales team and the Group’s purchasing strategy provides 
TR with the opportunity to secure a larger market share despite a 
possible repeated reduction in overall market size; as previously 
stated in earlier publications, should another economic downturn be 
experienced across the world and TR was to secure as a much as 1% 
of the global market it would see £500m sales, so growth aspirations 
continue to be legitimate.
Raw Material Price Inflation  
Industrial businesses have to contend with ﬂuctuating material prices, 
energy and freight costs, as well as ‘cost down’ pressures and stock 
obsolescence.
The Group is exposed to raw material price increases in relation to 
steel, plastics and fuel. TR is able to monitor costs effectively and has 
the ability to pass on cost increases to customers, although in the 
current markets there can be a ‘lag’ as old stocks and contracts feed 
through and new supply prices take effect.
Competitor Pressures  
TR benchmarks its operations and services against several leading 
logistics providers, both in and outside its sector to ensure it remains 
competitive in its service offering.
As part of TR’s business objectives it regularly addresses its logistics 
systems and focuses on reducing resource duplication where possible.

40 years of Service innovation 
Founded in June 1973 in a rented room 
and the basement (for storage) in a Listed 
historic house at the top end of Uckfield High 
Street by Mike Timms and Mike Roberts, 
with their wives and a van driver as their first 
employees. They has previously built up their 
fastener industry knowledge and experience 
as managers at Tern Screw Ltd. in South-East 
London, but its subsequent acquisition by 
the Glynwed Group in Birmingham motivated 
them to start their own fastener business.
Jim Barker (a former Glynwed colleague) 
joined them in 1974, followed by myself 
and then Geoff Budd in 1976, by which 
time TR had moved to a small converted 
industrial unit in the town, and in that year, 
in-house manufacturing of threaded sheet 
metal fasteners was added to the Uckfield 
distribution facility. John Wilson joined as 
head of finance in 1978.
Rapid expansion then followed, with 
distribution sites established in Northern 
Ireland, Bracknell, East Kilbride and Newton 
Aycliffe, along with an acquired self-locking 
nut factory in Northampton and a large new 
greenfield factory in Telford for turned parts 
and cold heading of screws.
Once satisfied that their business was 
growing very successfully, the two founders 
retired from operational involvement in 1984, 
leaving TR under the day to day responsibility 
of their four Executive Directors. The founders 
then resigned as Directors shortly before the 
business was fully listed as Trifast PLC on the 
London Stock Exchange in February 1994 
with, by then, a sales turnover of £23m and a 
market capitalisation of nearly £32m.
Growth and profitability then grew 
dramatically year-on-year until the 
end of the decade, largely driven 
by TR’s expertise in component 
logistics management directly 
on to the assembly lines of 
mainly multinational electronics 
customers – predominantly in the 
telecoms sector. 
The Story Behind the Years

joined the business at

manufacturing acquisitions in Singapore, 
Malaysia and Taiwan, and then a greenfield 
distribution centre based in Shanghai.
In 1998, institutional shareholders in the 
City rejected the Board’s wish to diversify 
risk by acquiring a major UK competitor 
who mainly served the automotive and 
engineering sectors. Following the lack of 
any impact from the ‘Millennium Bug’ in 
2000, there followed the global collapse in 
demand for telecoms hardware in 2001 (now 
known as the ‘DotCom’ crash) which heavily 
decimated TR’s profits within three months. 
The Company had to act quickly to reduce 
its overheads as a result including closing the 
marginally profitable factory in Telford.
In 2002 after 18 years of leading the business, 
I stepped down as CEO and retired from 
the business and went on to build many 
commercial interests and assist young 
growing business enterprise. I handed over to 
my colleague Jim Barker, who in 2005 went 
on to lead the acquisition of Serco Ryan, a 
large UK fastener distributor that had little 
reliance on the electronics sector. By mid-
2007 having being at the helm for five years 
and recovering turnover and profit to levels 
close to performance achieved prior to the 
DotCom crash in 2001, Jim Barker retired 
after having served 26 years with TR.
However, it became clear during 2008 that 
Trifast was going to fail in reaching its City 
growth and profit targets, thus becoming 
in danger of severely disappointing its 
shareholders as profit warnings were issued 
by the Company.
In early 2009, when the full impact of the 
global recession was becoming clear, several 
major shareholders initiated a move to make 
substantial changes to the Board, and myself 
and Jim Barker were asked to make a return 
as Executive Chairman and CEO respectively, 
in order to help restore investor value.
By late that year, after the senior management 
changes, Trifast had moved back into profit 
as the first stage of a three year recovery 
plan put together by the revitalised Board 
instigated. This building back of financial 
performance and strength has continued 
consistently since then, resulting in the ability 
to acquire the high quality Malaysian based 
manufacturer PowerSteel (PSEP) in late 2011. 
This move broadened TR’s capacity in larger 
diameter cold formed components that meet 
the demands of the automotive sector, which 
now accounts for 30% of TR’s global revenue.
In retrospect, the Nineties was a ‘golden 
decade’ for TR with meteoric growth from 
£23m in 1994 to over £100m by year 2000, 
accompanied by a share price that grew 
from £2 to over £12 in six years (after share 
split in 1999, this equates to 50p and £3); 
however, being unable to secure shareholder 
investment to spread the risk of over 50% 
exposure to the electronics sector back in 
1998 proved highly costly in 2001.
Happily, the combination of the Serco Ryan 
business coupled with a highly successful 
international sales campaign to secure 
revenue from the less ‘fractious’ automotive 
sector has now made TR less exposed to 
risk by having its main customer divisions 
more evenly spread, with no one company 
accounting for more than 5% of total sales.
In June 2013, TR celebrated its 40
th
 
Anniversary; the Company continues from 
strength to strength, all thanks to our 
dedicated and skilled management and staff, 
who from humble beginnings now amount to 
over 1,000 personnel working in 23 divisions 
in 16 countries across three continents.

Trifast plc Annual Report 2013 With exceptions as highlighted below, the Company complied 
with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
issued by the Financial Reporting Council in 2010.
The Board acknowledges Malcolm Diamond is a non-independent 
Executive Chairman which does not comply with the requirements 
of section C.3.1 of the Corporate Governance Code. However, the 
Board believes, that given Mr Diamond has sat as Chairman and 
as a Non-Executive in other companies, his experience from these 
appointments and his previous knowledge of Trifast is invaluable 
and can best be delivered through the position of Chairman.
The Company has applied the principles set out in the Code, 
including both the main principles and the supporting principles, 
by complying with the Code as reported above. Further 
explanation of how the principles and supporting principles have 
been applied is set out below and in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report.
The structure of the Board and its standing Committees are as 
follows:
The Board
On 25 April 2013, Scott Mac Meekin was appointed as an 
Independent Non-Executive Director to the Board.
Currently the Board consists of five Executive Directors and 
three Independent Non-Executive Directors. The Non-Executive 
Directors are considered to be independent of management 
and free from any business or other relationship which could 
interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement for 
the purposes of the Code. The Chairman who is an Executive 
Chairman is not considered by the Board to be independent.
The appointment, replacement and powers of the Directors 
are governed by the Company’s Articles of Association, the 
Corporate Governance Code, the Companies Act, prevailing 
legislation and resolutions passed at the Annual General Meeting 
(AGM) or other general meetings of the Company.
The Senior Independent Non-Executive Director is Neil Chapman 
who was chosen due to his Executive Board experience with 
other companies.
All Independent Non-Executive Directors have the authority to 
meet with shareholders without first seeking approval from the 
Executive Directors.
The Board met nine times during the period with attendance as 
follows:
MM Diamond 9
JC Barker 9
MR Belton 9
GP Budd 8
SV Murphy 6
GC Roberts 9
NS Chapman 9
JPD Shearman 9
Upon appointment the Directors are required to seek election at 
the first AGM following appointment. All Directors are required to 
submit themselves for re-election at regular intervals and at least 
every three years.
The Company has separate posts of Chairman and Chief 
Executive. The Chairman leads the Board and the Chief 
Executive is responsible for the management of the Company, 
implementing policies and strategies determined by the Board. 
The Independent Non-Executive Directors have full access to 
the external Auditor and to management and there is a formal 
procedure for Directors to obtain independent professional 
advice in the furtherance of their duties should this be necessary. 
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary.
Appropriate and relevant training is provided to the Directors as 
and when required.
The Board meets a minimum of five times a year, and is 
supplied as early as practical with an agenda and appropriate 
papers. Further ad-hoc meetings of the Board are held as 
and when required. Directors are appointed by the Board on 
recommendation from the Nominations Committee. The Board 
monitors the financial performance of the Group, and approves 
and reviews major projects and acquisitions. The Board has 
formally adopted a schedule of matters which are reserved to 
the Board for decision, thus ensuring that it maintains control 
over appropriate strategic, financial, organisation and compliance 
issues.
The Board undertakes annual evaluation of its own performance 
and that of its Committees using questionnaires and continues to 
train and evaluate Senior Managers below Board level in order to 
maintain its continuous succession policy.
Corporate Governance
61
Trifast plc Annual Report 2013
Stock Code: TRI The Board has delegated specific responsibilities to Committees, 
as described below:
The Audit Committee
The Audit Committee’s principal responsibilities are to assist 
the Board in reviewing and approving the Company’s financial 
statements including any significant financial judgements 
contained therein, monitoring the Company’s internal 
financial control and risk management systems and making 
recommendations to the Board with regard to the appointment 
and remuneration of the external Auditor.
The Audit Committee’s terms of reference include all matters 
indicated by the Disclosure and Transparency Rule 7.1 and the 
Corporate Governance Code.
It is Group policy to ensure Auditor independence by carefully 
considering any non-audit work carried out by the Auditor. 
There are no contractual obligations that oblige the Company to 
appoint KPMG to conduct the annual audit. There is no agreed 
timescale requiring formal tendering of the audit appointment; 
however, the Committee reviews on an annual basis the 
performance, expertise and independence of the external Auditor 
and maintains appropriate contact with potential alternative 
suppliers for audit and accountancy Advisery services. In 
addition, the Board receives written confirmation from the Auditor 
of any relationships they have which may cause a conflict of 
interest, together with a declaration from them that they consider 
themselves to be independent. The Board has approved the 
Auditor undertaking certain other limited activities for the Group 
but any assignment outside these activities requires separate 
Board approval. Following its review, the Board is satisfied that 
independence has been maintained and it is satisfied that it is 
appropriate to continue with the re-appointment of KPMG LLP  
as the Company’s Auditor.
The Audit Committee comprises entirely of the Independent Non-
Executive Directors. It is chaired by Neil Chapman and has met 
three times in the year. During the period the Committee felt that, 
given the size of the Group, it was valuable having the Executive 
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Group Finance 
Director (GFD) attending the Committee meetings. The external 
Auditor also normally attends meetings. In addition there is at 
least one meeting a year where the Audit Committee meets the 
external Auditor without executive management present.
The Committee is considered to be adequately qualified. The 
Chairman, a Fellow of the ICAEW was previously the senior 
partner of KPMG’s South-East operation and now works in 
industry as a Group Finance Director.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises the Independent 
Non-Executive Directors and is chaired by Jonathan Shearman. 
The Committee meets as required during the year to review 
and determine the terms and conditions of employment of the 
Executive Directors and senior management, including levels 
of remuneration and other benefits. During the period, the 
Committee met on two occasions.
The Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee comprises Neil Chapman and 
Jonathan Shearman (Independent Non-Executive Directors), the 
Chief Executive and the Chairman, and meets at least once a 
year. It is chaired by Neil Chapman, as Senior Independent  
Non-Executive Director. The Committee is responsible for 
reviewing the Board structure, size and composition, and 
for nominating candidates for Executive and Non-Executive 
positions. It will also ensure that any newly appointed Director 
receives a full and proper induction into the Company’s affairs. 
Appointments will be made after evaluating the balance of skills, 
knowledge, experience and diversity on the Board. In identifying 
suitable candidates the Committee shall consider from a wide 
range of backgrounds both internally and externally and will take 
due regards for the benefits of diversity on the Board, including 
gender taking care that appointees have enough time to devote 
to the position. During the period, the Committee met on three 
occasions.
Shareholder relations
The Group has a website www.trifast.com, which is regularly 
updated to ensure that shareholders are fully aware of the 
Group’s activities. The Group’s Registrar, Computershare, is 
also linked to the Trifast website and offers services for the 
shareholders.
Trifast also works with City specialists to ensure all levels of 
shareholders receive Group information. These include:
Arden Partners plc – Stockbroker and Adviser to the 
Company: Institutional Fund Managers
TooleyStreet Communications – Investor Relations, Analysts, 
Private Client Brokers and Media
Edison Group – Investment Research which is also available on 
the Trifast website
The members of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination 
Committees will normally be available to speak to shareholders 
at the AGM in order that they understand the views of the 
shareholders. In addition, shareholders can contact them at 
any time by writing to Trifast plc, Trifast House, Bellbrook Park, 
Uckfield, TN22 1QW.

Trifast plc Annual Report 2013 Going concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have reasonable 
expectations that the Group has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Further 
information is given in the Basis of Preparation, note 1. For 
this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements.
Internal control 
The Corporate Governance Code requires that Directors review 
the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls 
which includes controls over financial, operational, compliance 
and risk management. The Audit Committee has reviewed the 
effectiveness of the system of internal control and reported its 
positive conclusions to the Board.
In addition, the Board takes required account of the significance 
of social, environmental and ethical matters in regard to the 
business of the Group and seeks to take an ethical view of its 
responsibilities in providing business opportunities. 
Our Corporate Social Responsibility Statement can be found in 
this publication and via the Company website. 
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s controls. 
However, such a system is designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure in order to achieve business 
objectives, and can only provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss regarding:
 The safeguarding of assets against unauthorised use or 
disposition.
 The maintenance of proper accounting records and the 
reliability of financial information used within the business or 
for publication.
The key elements of the system are as follows:
 Full detailed reviews of the business risks undertaken as part 
of the ongoing day-to-day procedures of the business.
 An organisational structure with clearly defined lines of 
responsibility and delegation of authority.
 Group policies for financial reporting, accounting, financial 
risk management, information security, capital expenditure 
appraisal and Corporate Governance are all well documented.
 Detailed annual budgets and rolling forecasts are prepared for 
all operating units and reviewed/approved by the Board.
 Performance against budget is monitored closely and material 
variances are reported to the Board on a monthly basis. 
 The control system is operated with the full co-operation 
of all Company Directors. Risk assessments are done at all 
levels from local divisional right up to the Main Board with the 
summaries all being fed up to the Main Board for review.
 The Audit Committee deals with any significant control issues 
raised by the external Auditor.
 Well structured reporting lines to the Board. There is a formal 
schedule of matters specifically reserved for decisions by the 
Board.
 Investment approval, controlled by the budgetary process with 
authorisation levels in place. Any single capital expenditure 
over £50,000 goes to the Board with detailed written 
proposals and financial analysis of expected returns.
A formalised internal review process ‘Health Check’ has been set 
up to routinely review the operational and financial controls within 
the Group. These reviews are conducted by senior personnel 
who are independent from the entity which is under review. 
Whilst the Board recognises that this does not constitute a fully 
independent internal audit function, it believes that due to the 
size of the Group, this process provides appropriate comfort as 
to the operational and financial controls in place. 
The Board and Audit Committee continually review the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control systems. No 
significant failings or weaknesses were identified as a result of 
this review process. As such, the Board and Audit Committee 
are comfortable that they meet the requirements of the Turnbull 
Report.

Trifast plc Annual Report 2013
Stock Code: TRI Directors’ Remuneration Report 
(Information not subject to audit)
Dear Shareholder
As Chairman of the Trifast Remuneration Committee, I am pleased to introduce our Remuneration Report for 2013. This 
has been a busy year for the Company during which we have continued to generate increased profits through:
 delivering high quality service which is rewarded through increased market penetration 
 winning new business at enhanced margins
 extending our product ranges
 successful integration of recent acquisitions
Our remuneration policy at Trifast is to have in place a structure that can incentivise and retain those key executives who 
are critical to execute the business strategy. Cognisant of the difficult position your Company found itself in when the 
‘new’ management team was put in place, salary levels for our Executive Directors have historically been set at highly 
conservative levels. To somewhat compensate for this, options were granted in 2009 to sit alongside the three year 
recovery plan. These have now vested given the successful completion of the plan and the Company needs to consider 
how to align the interests of executives with shareholders over the coming years as we go forward with Trifast’s next stage 
of development to consolidate our position as a leader in the global fastener business.
We do not believe that the historic policy of highly conservative levels of fixed remuneration underpinned by a grant of 
options which supported the recovery plan is any longer appropriate to retain, attract and motivate executives of a calibre 
required to execute the business strategy over our next stage of development. We are also mindful of the changing attitude 
of shareholders to executive reward and want to take these factors into account in any new structure.
As a result, the Committee is conducting a review of the current remuneration structure in light of Trifast’s overall 
remuneration policy and business strategy. The objective of this review is to develop a holistic structure which strengthens 
the link between reward and performance – both financial and strategic – and which acts as a clear incentive to our senior 
executives over both the short and long term.
Further, any incentive structure will aim to deliver an appropriate mix of fixed and variable compensation subject to the 
achievement of short and longer term financial and strategic performance metrics. This approach ensures that strong year 
on year corporate performance is sustained and the interests of executives are aligned with the interests of shareholders 
over the long term.
The outcome of this review and our proposals are, at the time of signing this Report  
still to be finalised. We have provided some thoughts as to our current thinking in  
the remainder of this Report but full details of our proposals will be provided and  
shareholder approval to the arrangements sought in due course.
We have an excellent management team, we want to keep them and reward  
and incentivise them appropriately for performance. I believe that the changes  
we will be making to our remuneration structure will enable us to do this  
and look forward to your support.
Jonathan Shearman

Trifast plc Annual Report 2013 Introduction
The Directors present the Remuneration Report for the year 
ended 31 March 2013. This Report has been prepared in 
accordance with Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium Sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 
2008 (‘the regulations’). The Auditors are required to report on 
the ‘auditable’ part of this Report and to state whether, in their 
opinion, that part of the Report has been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 (as amended by 
the regulations). The Report is therefore divided into separate 
sections for audited and unaudited information. In accordance 
with schedule 18 of the Companies Act, this Report has been 
approved by the Board for approval by shareholders at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Statement of compliance
The Board has reviewed the Group’s compliance with the 
Corporate Governance Code and it is their opinion that 
throughout the year, the Company complied with the Principles 
and Provisions on remuneration specified in the Corporate 
Governance Code.
Remuneration Committee
The objective of the Remuneration Committee (‘the Committee’) 
is to develop a remuneration strategy (for the Executive Directors 
and other key Executives) that drives both short and long term 
performance and provides levels of reward which reflect such 
performance. More specifically, the Committee has and will 
attempt to reward exceptional performance (based of Profit 
Before Tax) and share any out-performance (over and above 
the ‘city forecast’) between our shareholders and the Executive 
team. This strategy is reviewed on an annual basis.
We remain mindful of the ongoing challenges surrounding levels 
of Executive pay as well as the forthcoming BIS regulations. 
Work has already commenced to ensure compliance with the 
latter at the appropriate time.
The Committee is composed entirely of Independent Non-
Executive Directors. Members have no day-to-day involvement 
in the running of the business and no personal financial interest 
in the Company other than that of shareholders. No Executive 
Director sits on the Committee. The Remuneration Committee is 
formally constituted with written Terms of Reference. A copy of 
the Terms of Reference is available to shareholders by writing to 
the Company Secretary whose details are set out on IBC  
of the Report and Accounts.
The Committee had two meetings during the year. Both 
members of the Committee at the time, being the Chairman  
(JPD Shearman) and Senior Independent Non-Executive Director 
(NS Chapman) attended these meetings. Each of these meetings 
were routine in, initially confirming the remuneration policy for 
the year just commenced and then considering an appropriate 
approach for the year to March 2014. The Executive Chairman 
and CEO were both invited to attend to ensure the Committee 
was in possession of all the relevant facts. Alongside this, the 
Committee had several informal meetings with their external 
Advisers.
The Committee consults with the Company Secretary regarding 
issues on areas of remuneration and Corporate Governance. 
With regard to senior Executives in the Company (excluding 
Board Directors), the Committee also takes advice from the 
Executive Board.
The Committee is advised on matters relating to Directors as 
required. It uses independent external Advisers (see page 66) as 
and when, to advise on remuneration matters.
Current remuneration policy
In deciding on the levels of remuneration for Directors and senior 
managers, the comparative pay and employment conditions of 
employees across the Group are taken into account. In particular, 
the Committee takes into account the level of salary increases 
across the wider workforce when deciding upon any increases in 
remuneration for the Directors and senior management.
Actual remuneration to the Directors is shown in the table on 
page 70.
In order to achieve the objectives of the Committee’s policy 
on remuneration, the individual components of an Executive 
Director’s remuneration package are determined as follows:- 
1) Base salary
The policy of the Committee during the year ended 31 March 
2013 was to set base salaries around the lower quartile of an 
appropriate comparator group. Salaries are reviewed annually  
in April.
Factors taken into account by the Committee when determining 
base salary levels are:
 Objective research based on a review of the remuneration in 
UK quoted companies with similar corporate attributes
 Experience and responsibilities of each Executive Director
 Pay and conditions throughout the Group
The salary levels for the year under review as seen on page 70  
were largely unchanged from the previous year with the 
exception of Mark Belton. It was the view of the Committee that 
the existing level of salary was not commensurate with either the 
role of Group Finance Director, nor the contribution Mark makes 
to the Group’s performance.

Trifast plc Annual Report 2013
Stock Code: TRI 2) Annual bonus payment
The 2013 bonus scheme is based on the premise of rewarding 
exceptional performance measured by reference to Profit Before 
Tax (PBT). Payments commence only once the ‘city forecast’ is 
achieved and increased thereafter with a cap of 100% of base 
salary.
In arriving at a bonus scheme the Committee is mindful of the 
following considerations:
 The link between the fixed and variable element 
 The desire to reward team performance 
 The desire to link maximum payouts to exceptional 
performance 
 The financial performance of the Group 
 The need to align the rewards with the interests of 
shareholders 
The Committee assessed that performance in 2013 justified a 
payout of 30% for each of the Executive Directors. This is against 
a backdrop of stretching targets.
3) Long term incentives (LTI’s)
a) At the beginning of the year to March 2013, the options (see 
page 69) that were agreed with shareholders and granted on the 
change of management in 2009 were still ‘in play’. Indeed, given 
a three-month average share price greater than 51p, combined 
with a ROCE in excess of 10% during the final quarter of the 
financial year, these options have now vested.
b) Following approval at the 2005 Annual General Meeting, the 
Company introduced a long term incentive arrangement known 
as the Trifast plc 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’). Awards 
under the LTIP were delivered in the form of conditional share 
awards which were to be released in three years dependent 
on continued employment and the satisfaction of demanding 
performance targets.
Full details of the awards held by Executive Directors under the 
LTIP at the start of the year are contained in the audited section 
of this Report on page 69.
All Company Directors who held LTIP’s waived their right to these 
rewards during 2011.
c) The Executive Directors may also participate in the Trifast 
Savings Related Share Option Scheme that is open to all UK 
employees and is HMRC approved. The Scheme offers three, 
five and seven year savings contracts which provide an option to 
purchase shares after maturity at a discount to the share price on 
the date the contract is taken out (the maximum discount is 20% 
of mid-market price).
4) Benefits
In line with other companies, potential benefits are provided in 
the form of a Company car (or car allowance), private medical 
insurance, permanent health insurance, critical illness cover 
and life cover up to a maximum 13.33 times earnings at date of 
death. This life cover provides a benefit in the form of a four times 
salary lump sum and a balance to buy a spouse’s annuity. The 
provision of these benefits is in line with market practice.
5) Pension
Geoff Budd, Mark Belton, Glenda Roberts and Seamus Murphy 
(resigned 31 January 2013) are members of the Company’s  
non-contributory pension plan. This is an HMRC approved 
defined contribution scheme. The rate of Company contribution 
to this scheme is 20% of basic salary.
Malcolm Diamond and Jim Barker do not participate in the 
Company pension plan.
Future remuneration policy
The Remuneration Committee is mindful that now is an 
appropriate time to undertake a wider review of Board 
Remuneration – including base salary, on target annual bonus 
(total cash) and a new Long Term Incentive Plan. As part of 
this exercise, the Committee has commissioned a report on 
executive remuneration by independent accountants PwC, with 
the aim of creating a policy that allows each of the executives 
to feel valued and motivated by means of being fairly rewarded 
through both cash and share payments.
Below are our initial findings for the three core components:
1) Base salary
A benchmarking exercise undertaken by PwC has confirmed 
that in the case of all of the executives, both base salary and 
total cash remuneration are below even the lower quartile for 
appropriate comparator companies. We believe this is not in 
the best interests of the Group and the Committee is therefore 
looking to adjust executive salaries to reflect the median quartile 
of this comparator group.
The Committee of course recognises that it is essential to 
continue to control costs and therefore is minded, where 
appropriate, to make these adjustments over the next two years 
without substantially increasing overall Board costs. This will 
however, necessitate increases above the current rate of inflation 
and indeed above that of the rest of the Group.
2) Annual bonus payment
The Committee’s policy with regard to an annual bonus scheme 
will remain broadly unchanged with the overriding aim to ensure 
that we can still reward out-performance (vs the ‘city forecast’) 
up to a maximum of 100% of base salary.

Stock Code: TRI
Trifast plc Annual Report 2013 Alongside this, the Committee is considering whether it is 
appropriate to introduce a proportion of bonus which is not 
entirely dependent upon financial performance figures, but 
rather based on personal targets. We are also mindful that 
the proportion of cash and share payments to Executives be 
balanced, with the potential that this is reflected in the payment 
method of the bonus scheme.
It was felt inappropriate to make any meaningful changes to 
the scheme for the year ending 31 March 2014. Hence, the 
Committee intends to use the existing framework and for the 
maximum amount payable to remain at 100% of base salary.
3) Long term incentives (LTI’s)
It is the desire of the Committee to utilise LTI’s as part of longer 
term remuneration and retention planning. Given that, the 
Committee is currently working on a plan with our independent 
Advisers (PWC) and intends to fully engage with shareholders 
once any proposal is formulated. Any future plan will need to 
motivate long term performance and loyalty but will no longer be 
required to supplement the historically lower quartile salaries.
In concluding, Neil and I would firstly like to welcome Scott to the 
Committee from April 2013 onwards. We are also delighted to 
unanimously recommend that shareholders vote to approve the 
Remuneration Report at the 2013 Annual General Meeting.

Trifast plc Annual Report 2013 The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and Parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent 
Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that 
law, they are required to prepare the Group financial statements 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable 
law and have elected to prepare the Parent Company financial 
statements on the same basis.
Under company law, the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company 
and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the 
Group and Parent Company financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
 state whether they have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and
 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
Parent Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the Parent Company, and 
enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard 
the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that 
comply with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 the financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the EU and applicable law, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit 
or loss of the Company and its subsidiaries included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
 the Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and its subsidiaries included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face.

Trifast plc Annual Report 2013 1 Accounting policies 
a) Significant accounting policies
Trifast plc (‘the Company’) is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom. The registered office details are on the IBC.
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group). The 
Parent Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group. The 
loss after tax for the Company is £0.67 million (2012: £0.80m).
Statement of compliance
Both the Parent Company financial statements and the Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the 
Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘Adopted IFRSs’) except as 
explained below:
On publishing the Parent Company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, the Company 
is taking advantage of the exemption in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual Consolidated income 
statement and related notes that form a part of these approved financial statements.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these 
Group and Parent Company financial statements. 
IFRS not yet applied
The IASB and IFRIC have issued a number of standards and interpretations with an effective date after the date of these financial 
statements. The following are those standards and interpretations that it is expected may have an impact on the Group’s 
financial statements.
Presentation of items of other comprehensive income – amendments to IAS 1
 The amendments require that an entity present separately the items of OCI that may be reclassified to profit or loss in the 
future from those that would never be reclassified to profit or loss. They also preserve the existing option to present the profit 
or loss and other comprehensive income in two statements. The standard was endorsed on 5 June 2012 and the impact is 
not expected to be material.
Annual improvements to IFRSs – 2009-2011 Cycle – This cycle of improvements contains amendments to:
 IFRS 1 First-time adoption of IFRSs – repeated application of IFRS 1 and borrowing cost exemption
 IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements – comparative information beyond minimum requirements and presentation of the 
opening statement of financial position and related notes.
 IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment – classification of servicing equipment
 IAS 32 Financial Instruments: presentation – income tax consequences of distributions
 IAS 34 Interim financing reporting – segment assets and liabilities
This was endorsed on 27 March 2013 and the impact is not expected to be material.
b) Basis of preparation
The financial statements are prepared in Sterling, rounded to the nearest thousand. They are prepared on the historical cost 
basis with the exception of certain items which are measured at fair value as disclosed in the accounting policies below.
The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect 
the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from 
these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised 
in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future 
periods if the revision affects current and future periods.

1 Accounting policies continued
Judgements made by management in the application of IFRS that have significant effect on the financial statements and 
estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 31.
A review of the business activity and future prospects of the Group are covered in the Executive Chairman’s and CEO’s 
Statement and the Directors’ Business Review. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and 
borrowing facilities are described in the Finance Review. Detailed information regarding the Group’s current facility levels, liquidity 
risk and maturity dates are provided in note 26.
Current trading and forecasts show that the Group will continue to be profitable and generate cash. The banking facilities and 
covenants that are in place provide appropriate headroom against our forecasts.
On 31 December 2012, the Company term loan was fully repaid. On 23 April 2013 the Company secured a three year £5.00 
million multi-currency Revolving Credit Facility. This is in addition to the Asset Based Lending facility, which was increased to a 
maximum £18.30 million availability. Discussions with our existing Bankers confirm that they have no reason not to continue in 
the ordinary course of business to provide funding facilities to the Company on the current basis. The Asian term loan of £7.50m 
(S$15.10m) taken out in December 2011 to facilitate the purchase of PSEP is being repaid quarterly with the final repayment 
in December 2016. Current forecasts show that the Group has sufficient liquidity and headroom to continue to operate within 
these facilities.
Considering the current forecasts, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting 
in preparing the annual financial statements.
c) Basis of consolidation
i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern 
the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting 
rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in 
the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
ii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-group balances, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are 
eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
d) Foreign currency
i) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to Sterling at the foreign 
exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the Consolidated income 
statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated 
using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. 
ii) Financial statements of foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are 
translated to Sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign 
operations are translated to Sterling at average rates of exchange for the period, where this rate approximates to the foreign 
exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised directly in a separate component of equity, the translation 
reserve. They are released into the income statement upon disposal.

Stock Code: TRI
Trifast plc Annual Report 2013 1 Accounting policies continued
e) Hedge of net investment in foreign operations
The portion of the gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation that is determined to be 
an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity in the translation reserve. The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in 
the income statement. The effective portion is recycled and recognised in the income statement upon disposal of the operation.
f) Property, plant and equipment
i) Owned assets
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation (see below) and impairment 
losses (see accounting policy l).
Certain items of property, plant and equipment that had been revalued to fair value on or prior to 1 April 2004, the date of 
transition to Adopted IFRS, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount at the date of transition.
ii) Depreciation
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of 
property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. The depreciation rates are as follows:
Freehold and long leasehold buildings – 2% per annum on a straight-line basis or the period of the lease
Short leasehold properties – period of the lease
Motor vehicles – 20-25% on a straight-line basis
Plant and machinery – 10-20% per annum on a straight-line basis
Fixtures, fittings and office equipment – 10-25% per annum on a straight-line basis
When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, those components are accounted for as 
separate items of property, plant and equipment. Where relevant, residual values are reassessed annually.
iii) Leased assets
The rental charges on assets held under operating leases are taken to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over 
the life of the lease.
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as 
finance leases. Where land and buildings are held under leases the accounting treatment of the land is considered separately 
from that of the buildings. Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair 
value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and less 
accumulated impairment losses. Lease payments are accounted for as described in note (s).
iv) Subsequent costs
The Group recognises in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment the cost of replacing part of such an 
item when that cost is incurred, if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the item will flow to the Group 
and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other costs are recognised in the income statement as an expense is 
incurred.
g) Intangible assets
i) Goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. In respect of business acquisitions that have 
occurred since 1 April 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the 
net identifiable assets acquired. Identifiable intangibles are those which can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights 
regardless of whether those rights are separable.
Positive goodwill arising on acquisitions is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-
generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment (see accounting policy l). 
83
Trifast plc Annual Report 2013
Stock Code: TRI Notes (forming part of the Financial Statements) continued
1 Accounting policies continued
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 April 1998 was written off to reserves in the year of acquisition. Under IFRS1 and 
IFRS3, this goodwill will now remain eliminated against reserves. Goodwill arising on acquisitions after 1 April 1998 but before  
31 March 2004 is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amortised amount recorded under UK GAAP 
as at 31 March 2004. The classification and accounting treatment of business combinations that occurred prior to 1 April 2004 
has not been reconsidered in preparing the Group’s year end balance sheets.
Decreases in goodwill resulting from the non payment of contingent consideration are recognised in the period when non 
payment occurs.
Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised directly in profit or loss.
ii) Other intangible assets
Intangible assets other than goodwill that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation (see 
below) and impairment losses (see accounting policy l). 
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in profit or loss as an expense as incurred.
iii) Subsequent expenditure
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits 
embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.
iv) Amortisation
Amortisation is charged to the Consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of 
intangible assets, unless such lives are indefinite. Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are tested 
systematically for impairment at each annual balance sheet date.
The amortisation rates of other intangibles are as follows:
Customer relationships – 8.3% to 12.5% per annum
h) Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are held in the Company balance sheet at historic cost net of any impairment.
i) Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at their fair value, and subsequently at cost less impairment losses (see accounting  
policy l).
j) Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value with provision being made for obsolete and slow-moving items. 
In determining the cost of raw materials, consumable and goods purchased for resale, a first-in first-out purchase price is used 
and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the stocks and bringing them to their existing location and condition. For work 
in progress and finished goods manufactured by the Group, cost is taken as production cost, which includes an appropriate 
proportion of attributable overheads based on normal operating capacity.
k) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. 
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a 
component of cash and cash equivalents only for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
l) Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets, other than stocks (see accounting policy j), and deferred tax assets (see accounting 
policy t), are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such 
indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated (see accounting policy l(i)). 
84
OF SERVICE INNOVATION
YEARS
Stock Code: TRI
Trifast plc Annual Report 2013 1 Accounting policies continued
Financial assets are considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events has had a negative effect 
on the estimated future cashflows of that asset.
For goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life, the recoverable amount is estimated at each annual 
balance sheet date.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable 
amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the Consolidated income statement unless the asset is recorded at a revalued 
amount in which case it is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to cash-generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro rata 
basis. A cash generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent 
of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
i) Calculation of recoverable amount
The recoverable amount is the greater of net selling price and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the 
recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
ii) Reversals of impairment
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. An impairment loss on any other asset is reversed only to the extent 
that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or 
amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. 
m) Share capital – Dividends
Dividends to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability and deducted from shareholders’ equity in the period in 
which the shareholders’ right to receive payment is established.
n)  Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value. Where existing facilities are extinguished (rather than modified) 
arrangement fees and related costs are expensed in full in the income statement as incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost.
o) Employee benefits
i) Defined contribution plans
The Group operates Defined Contribution Pension Schemes which include stakeholder pension plans. The assets of these 
schemes are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds. The amount charged against profits 
represents the contributions payable to the schemes in respect of the accounting period.
ii) Share-based payment transactions
The share option programme allows Group employees to acquire shares of the Parent Company. The fair value of options 
granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date 
and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the 
options granted is measured using Black Scholes, Binomial lattice and Monte Carlo models, taking into account the terms and 
conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number 
of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting. IFRS2 has 
been applied, in accordance with IFRS1, to equity settled share options granted after 7 November 2002 and not vested at  
1 April 2005.

Trifast plc Annual Report 2013
Stock Code: TRI Notes (forming part of the Financial Statements) continued
1 Accounting policies continued
iii) Termination benefits
Termination benefits are recognised as an expense when the Group is demonstrably committed without realistic possibility of 
withdrawal, to a formal plan to terminate employment before the normal retirement date.
p) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of 
a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is 
material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
i) Restructuring
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan and the 
restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating costs are not provided for.
ii) Dilapidations
A provision for dilapidations is recognised when expected costs become more likely than not and can be estimated reliably.
iii) Onerous contracts
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are 
lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of 
the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract.
q) Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are stated at cost.
r) Revenue
Revenue from the sale of goods rendered is recognised net of VAT in the Consolidated income statement when the significant 
risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer. In accordance with normal practice, this will be on dispatch 
of goods.
s) Expenses
i) Operating lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the Consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the 
term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised in the Consolidated income statement as an integral part of the total 
lease expense.
ii)  Finance lease payments
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance 
charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining 
balance of the liability.
iii) Net financing costs
Net financing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings calculated using the effective interest rate method and interest 
receivable on funds invested. Interest income is recognised in the Consolidated income statement as it accrues, using the 
effective interest method. Net finance costs also include arrangement fees and related costs recognised in line with accounting 
policy (n).
t) Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the periods presented comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Consolidated 
income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in 
equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at 
the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Trifast plc Annual Report 2013 1 Accounting policies continued
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following 
temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, the initial 
recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit and differences relating to investments in 
subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided 
is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit 
will be realised.
Additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the 
related dividend. Information as to the calculation of income tax on the profit or loss for the period presented is included in note 9.
u) Operating segment reporting
A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged in providing products or services within a particular 
geographical economic environment whose operating results are reviewed regularly by the Group’s Chief Operating Decision 
maker (the Board) in order to allocate resources and assess its performance and for which discrete financial information is 
available. 
The Group operates in a number of geographical economic environments. The Company only operates in one business 
segment being the manufacture and logistical supply of industrial fasteners and category ‘C’ components.
v) Financial guarantee contracts
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its 
Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the 
Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be 
required to make a payment under the guarantee.
w) Earnings per share
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing 
the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders 
and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which 
comprise share options granted to employees.
x) Underlying measure of profits and losses
The Group believes that underlying operating profit and underlying profit before tax provide additional guidance to statutory 
measures to help understand the underlying performance of the business during the financial period. The term underlying is not 
defined under International Financial Reporting Standards. It is a measure that is used by management to assess the underlying 
performance of the business internally and is not intended to be a substitute measure for Adopted IFRSs’ GAAP measures. The 
Group defines these underlying measures as follows:
Underlying operating profit is profit before taxation and separately disclosed items (see note 2).
Underlying earnings used in the calculation of underlying earnings per share is profit after tax excluding separately disclosed 
items.
It should be noted that the definitions of underlying items being used in these financial statements are those used by the Group 
and may not be comparable with the term ’underlying’ as defined by other companies within both the same sector or elsewhere.
Separately disclosed items are included within the income statement caption to which they relate.

y) Separately disclosed items (see note 2)
Separately disclosed items are those significant items which in management’s judgement should be highlighted by virtue of their 
size or incidence to enable a full understanding of the Group’s financial performance.

Of the 2013 restructuring costs £0.19 million refers to redundancy payments and associated costs in relation to compensation 
for loss of office for Seamus Murphy following his departure from the Board on 31 January 2013. The remaining balance of 
£0.20m are further redundancies within the UK to drive the ongoing efficiencies.
The 2012 acquisition expenses were predominantly legal and accountancy fees, in relation to due diligence required in the 
purchase of the Malaysian company PowerSteel & Electro-Plating Works SDN Bhd (PSEP) in December 2011.
The 2012 restructuring credit of £0.66 million comprised £0.84 million of provision releases in respect of onerous leases that had 
been surrendered with potential liabilities up to 2017. The costs in relation to this had previously been provided and separately 
disclosed. This was offset by £0.18 million costs incurred to close one of our sites in the US; the majority of these costs refer to 
redundancies and an onerous lease.
3 Operating segmental analysis
Segment information, as discussed in note 1, is presented in the consolidated financial statements in respect of the Group’s 
geographical segments. This reflects the Group’s management and internal reporting structure, and the operating basis on 
which individual operations are reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (the Board).
Performance is measured based on segment underlying profit before finance costs and income tax as included in the internal 
management reports that are reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker. This is used to measure performance as 
management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other 
entities that operate within the industry. 
Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arm’s length basis.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a 
reasonable basis. 
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire segment assets that are expected to be used 
for more than one period.
Geographical operating segments
The Group is comprised of the following main geographical operating segments:
UK
Mainland Europe: includes Norway, Sweden, Hungary, Ireland, Holland and Poland
USA: includes USA and Mexico
Asia: includes Malaysia, China, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and India

The UK current tax expense was low during the period as the UK was able to utilise the remaining UK tax losses that it suffered 
during the previous years.
On 21 March 2012, the Chancellor announced a reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax to 24%, with effect from  
1 April 2012. On 3 July 2012, a further reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 24% to 23%, with effect from 1 April 2013, 
became substantively enacted. The effect of the rate reduction on the deferred tax balances as at 31 March 2013 has been 
included in the figures above. 
 
On 20 March 2013, the Chancellor announced proposed changes to further reduce the main rate of corporation tax to 20% by 
1 April 2015. The corporation tax rate reductions to 21% and 20% have not yet been substantively enacted and therefore are 
not included in the figures above. 
 
It has not yet been possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of the announced further 3% rate reduction, although this will 
further reduce the Company’s future current tax charge and reduce the Company’s deferred tax accordingly.

12 Intangible assets – Group continued
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment. The recoverable amount of cash generating units is determined from value in 
use calculations.
Value in use was determined by discounting the future cashflows generated from the continuing use of the unit. In this method, 
the free cashflows after funding internal needs of the subject company are forecast for a finite period of five years based 
on actual operating results, budgets and economic market research. Beyond the finite period, a terminal (residual) value is 
estimated using an assumed stable cashflow figure. 
The values assigned to the key assumptions represent management’s assessment of future trends in the fastenings market and 
are based on both external and internal sources of historical data.
The table below highlights the key assumptions:
Taiwan UK Sweden
2013 2012 2013 2012 2013 2012
Pre-tax discount rate 17% 16% 16% 16% 16% 16%
Long-term growth rate 4% 4% 3% 3% 2% 2%
Long-term growth rate
Five year management plans are used for the Group’s value in use calculations. Long-term growth rate into perpetuity has been 
determined as the lower of:
 — the nominal GDP rates for the country of operation; and
 — the long term compound annual growth rate in EBITDA in years six to ten estimated by management.
Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate
The discount rate applied to the cash flows of each of the Group’s operations is based on the risk free rate for ten year bonds 
issued by the government in the respective market, adjusted for a risk premium to reflect both the increased risk of investing in 
equities and the systematic risk of the specific Group operating company. 
In making this adjustment, inputs required are the equity market risk premium (that is the increased return required over and 
above a risk free rate by an investor who is investing in the market as a whole) and the risk adjustment, beta, applied to reflect 
the risk of the specific Group operating company relative to the market as a whole.
In determining the risk adjusted discount rate, management has applied an adjustment for the systematic risk to each of the 
Group’s operations determined using an average of the betas of comparable listed fastener distribution and manufacturing 
companies and, where available and appropriate, across a specific territory. Management has used a forward-looking equity 
market risk premium that takes into consideration both studies by independent economists, the average equity market risk 
premium over the past ten years and the market risk premiums typically used by investment banks in evaluating acquisition 
proposals.
The table above discloses pre tax discount rates across the three CGU’s. This takes into account certain components such as 
various discount rates reflecting different risk premiums and tax rates in the respective regions. Overall, the Board is confident 
the pre-tax adjusted discount rates adequately reflect the circumstances in each region and are in accordance with IAS36.

Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
Other than as disclosed below, management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions 
would cause the carrying value of any cash generating unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
The estimated values in use at 31 March 2013 of the Group’s operations in Taiwan and Sweden were £2.22 million and  
£1.45 million above their respective carrying value and, consequently, any material adverse change in key assumptions would,  
in isolation, cause an impairment loss to be recognised.
The table below shows what the variables used in the ‘value in use’ calculations for Taiwan and Sweden need to change to  
(in isolation) in order for the estimated recoverable amount to be equal to its carrying value.
Taiwan Sweden
Pre-tax adjusted discount rate 19.0% 23.0%
Budgeted change in EBIT 13.4% 29.9%
Long-term growth rate 1.8% <0%
Other subsidiaries are not included in the calculation as their individual cash generating units show a significant headroom over 
the goodwill carrying value.
The £0.63 million increase in the goodwill of SFE refers to a foreign exchange gain, as the investment is held in Singapore Dollars 
within TR Asia Investment Holdings Pte Ltd.
The £0.15 million increase in the goodwill of PSEP comprises £0.10 million in respect of the restatement of the pre-acquisition 
reserves and £0.05 million refers to a foreign exchange gain, as the investment is held in Singapore Dollars within TR Asia 
Investment Holdings Pte Ltd.

Defined contribution plans
The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension plans, which include stakeholder pension plans whose assets are 
held separately from those of the Group, in independently administered funds.
The total expense relating to these plans in the current year was £1.43 million (2012: £1.31m) and represents contributions 
payable by the Group to the funds.
At the end of the financial year, there were outstanding pensions contributions of £0.09 million (2012: £0.09m), which are 
included in creditors.
Share-based payments
The Group Share Options and Share Matching Plans provide for a grant price equal to the average quoted market price of the 
Group shares on the date of grant. The vesting period is generally three years. The options expire if they remain unexercised 
after the exercise period has lapsed. Furthermore, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest, 
unless for retirement, redundancy or health reasons. The options are equity settled.
The number and weighted average exercise prices of share options are as follows:

The options outstanding at 31 March 2013 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 5.2 years (2012: 5.5 years) and 
exercise prices ranging from £0.085 to £0.825 (2012: £0.085 to £0.825).

The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the fair value of share options 
granted. The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based on Black Scholes, Binominal lattice and 
Monte Carlo models. The contractual life of the option is used as an input into this model. 
Options granted before September 2004 (with the exception of SAYE) can only be exercised if the Company’s growth based on 
annualised earnings per share in the period or any three consecutive financial years after the grant exceeds RPI plus an average 
of 2% per annum. Options granted in September 2004 can only be exercisable where the Company’s earnings per share growth 
is at least RPI plus 4% over the three year period from date of grant.
The options granted in September 2009 are exercisable between September 2012 and September 2019 at an exercise price of 
£0.085 per share. They can only be exercised when the Company’s share price has reached a minimum of £0.51, maintained as 
an average over the three-month period preceding the Notice of Exercise; and the Company has achieved a minimum of 10% 
ROCE.

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over one, two and three years 
back from the date of grant. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate for

Trifast plc Annual Report 2013 26 Financial instruments
(a) Fair values of financial instruments
There is no difference between the fair values and the carrying values shown in the balance sheet.
(b) Financial instruments risks
Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arises in the normal course of the Group’s business, and the Group continues 
to monitor and reduce any exposure accordingly. Information has been disclosed relating to the individual company only where a 
material risk exists.
(i) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers.
Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit over a predetermined amount. Bad debt insurance is taken 
out on all key accounts where the cost is appropriate given the risk covered. All overdue debts are monitored regularly and 
customers are put on credit hold if payments are not received on time.
The carrying amount of trade receivables represents the maximum credit exposure for the Group. Therefore, the maximum 
exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date was £25.87 million (2012: £24.88m), being the total carrying amount of trade 
receivables net of an allowance. Management does not consider there to be any significant unimpaired credit risk in the year end 
balance sheet (2012: £nil).
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The amount of trade receivables which are beyond 90 days from their due date is £1.18 million (2012: £1.01m).  
This represents 5% of the total gross receivable balance.
Impairment losses
The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of loans and receivables during the year was as follows:
2013
£000
2012
£000
Balance at 1 April (451) (822)
Impairment movement (189) 371
Balance at 31 March (640) (451)
There are no significant losses/bad debts provided for specific customers.
(ii) Liquidity and interest risk
The Group holds net debt and hence its interest and liquidity risks are associated with the maturity of its loans against cash 
inflows from around the Group. The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance of continuity of funding and flexibility through the 
use of loans and banking facilities as applicable. 
On 31 December 2012, the Company and Group repaid the remaining term loan of £1.00 million.
To facilitate potential further growth, on 23 April 2013 the Company secured a £5.00 million three year multi-currency Revolving 
Credit Facility. This is in addition to the Asset Based Lending facility which was increased to a maximum £18.30 million 
availability, secured over the receivables and stock of the Group’s UK Subsidiaries and the property of the Holding Company. 
In December 2011, to part fund the PowerSteel & Electro-Plating Works SDN Bhd acquisition, TR Asia Investment Holdings 
Pte Ltd took out a five year Term Loan with the Singaporean bank, DBS at a fixed rate of 3.14% which is secured by Corporate 
Guarantees from the Company and TR Formac Pte Ltd.

Covenant headroom
The current term facilities are subject to quarterly covenant testing as follows:-
Interest cover: Underlying EBITDA to Net Interest to exceed a ratio of three.
Cashflow cover: Adjusted cashflow to Debt Service to exceed a ratio of one.
Net Debt cover: Underlying Net Debt to EBITDA not to exceed a ratio of 2.75.
With respect to the Asian loan facility, the covenant testing is as follows:
Minimum Tangible Net worth (TR Asia Investment Holdings Pte Ltd) of S$20 million
Minimum Consolidated Tangible Net worth (Asia Group) of S$35 million
Maximum Asia Group Net Debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.0x
Minimum Asia Group Debt Service Cover (DSC) of 1.2x
These covenants currently provide sufficient headroom and forecasts indicate no breach is anticipated.
Liquidity headroom
Trading forecasts show that the current facilities provide sufficient liquidity headroom. The Group continues to maintain positive 
relationships with a number of banks and the Directors believe that appropriate facilities will continue to be made available to the 
Group as and when they are required.
Interest risk
The Group monitors closely all loans outstanding which currently incur interest at floating rates.
In respect of income-earning financial assets and interest-bearing financial liabilities, the following table indicates their effective 
interest rates at the balance sheet date and the periods in which they mature:

Sensitivity analysis
A change of 1% point in interest rates at the balance sheet date would change equity and profit and loss by £0.10 million  
(2012: £0.13m). This calculation has been applied to risk exposures existing at the balance sheet date.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain consistent and considers the effect of 
financial instruments with variable interest rates. The analysis is performed on the same basis for the comparative period.
(iii) Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases and cash borrowings that are denominated in a currency 
other than local functional currency. The Group faces additional currency risks arising from monetary financial instruments held in 
non-functional local currencies.
Operational foreign exchange exposure
Where possible the Group tries to invoice in the local currency at the respective entity. If this is not possible, then to mitigate any 
exposure, the Group tries to buy from suppliers and sell to customers in the same currency.
Where possible the Group tries to hold the majority of its cash and cash equivalent balances in the local currency at the 
respective entity.
Monetary assets/liabilities
The Group continues to monitor exchange rates and buy or sell currencies in order to minimise open exposure to foreign 
exchange risk. The Group does not speculate on exchange rates.
The Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk is as follows (based on the carrying amount for monetary financial instruments 
held in non-functional currencies):

Sensitivity analysis
Group
A 1% change in the following currencies against local functional currency at 31 March would have changed equity and profit and 
loss by the amount shown below. This calculation assumes that the change occurred at the balance sheet date and had been 
applied to risk exposures existing at that date.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular other exchange rates and interest rates, remain constant. The analysis 
is performed on the same basis for the comparative period.
Equity & Profit

2013

2012

Euro to Sterling (4) (10)
A 1% strengthening of the above currencies against the pound Sterling at 31 March would have had the equal but opposite 
effect on the above currencies to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
iv) Capital management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to ensure that all entities within the Group will be able to continue as going 
concerns, while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. We regularly 
review and maintain or adjust the capital structure as appropriate in order to achieve these objectives and this is consistent with 
the management of capital for previous periods.
The Group has various borrowings and available facilities (see section (ii) Liquidity & Interest Risk and Note 20) that contain 
certain external capital requirements (‘covenants’) that are considered normal for these types of arrangements. As discussed 
above, we remain comfortably within all such covenants.
 
Identification of the total funding requirement is achieved via a detailed cash flow forecast which is reviewed and updated on a 
monthly basis.
The capital structure of the Group is presented below:
2013
£000
2012

Cash and cash equivalents (note 19) 10,555 11,798
Borrowings (note 20) (15,752) (20,208)
Net debt (5,197) (8,410)
Equity (60,422) (53,488)
Capital (65,619) (61,898)
There is a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and managing the key risks faced by the Group. Activities are  
co-ordinated by the Audit Committee. It has responsibility, on behalf of the Board, for ensuring the adequacy of systems for 
identifying and assessing significant risks, that appropriate control systems and other mitigating actions are in place, and that 
residual exposures are consistent with the Group’s strategy and objectives. Assessments are conducted for all material entities.

31 Accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Adopted IFRS’s requires management to make judgements, estimates 
and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported annual amounts of assets and liabilities, income and 
expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are 
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying 
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised 
in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future 
periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The Group believes the principal accounting estimates, assumptions and uncertainties employed in the preparation of these 
financial statements are:
 Recoverable amount of goodwill (note 12)  
The recoverable amount is the greater of net selling price and value in use, where value in use is determined by discounting 
the future cashflows generated from the continuing use of the unit. Further details are provided in note 13.
 Provisions (note 23) 
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet where the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a 
past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Management have 
based their judgements on the latest available information, reflecting the expected outcome. 
 
In respect of onerous leases and dilapidation provisions, external Advisers were used to provide estimates of potential costs 
and likelihood of sub-letting rental. The future cash flows were then discounted using risk free rates over the length of the 
leases.

Stock Code: TRI
Trifast plc Annual Report 2013 Assets
Anything owned by the company having a monetary value; e.g. fixed 
assets like buildings, plant and machinery, vehicles (these are not 
assets if rented and not owned) and potentially including intangibles 
like trademarks and brand names, and current assets, such as stock, 
debtors and cash.
P/E ratio (price per earnings)
The P/E ratio is an important indicator as to how the investing market 
views the health, performance, prospects and investment risk of a PLC. 
The P/E ratio is arrived at by dividing the share price by the earnings 
per share (profit after tax and interest divided by the number of ordinary 
shares in issue). To calculate the P/E ratio:
 Find the total profit after tax and interest for the past year
 Divide this by the number of shares issued
 This gives you the earnings per share
 Divide the price of each share by the earnings per share
 This gives the Price/Earnings or P/E ratio
Profit and loss account (P&L)
The P&L shows how well the company has performed in its trading 
activities and would cover a trading account for a period.
The P&L shows profit performance and typically shows sales revenues, 
cost of sales/cost of goods sold, generally a gross profit margin, fixed 
overheads and/or operating expenses, and then a profit before tax  
figure (PBT). 
Balance sheet 
The balance sheet provides a ‘snapshot’ at a particular date in time of 
who owns what in the company, and what assets and debts represent 
the value of the company.
The balance sheet is where to look for information about short-term and 
long term debts, gearing (the ratio of debt to equity), reserves, stock 
values (materials and finished goods), capital assets, cash, and the value 
of shareholders’ funds. The balance sheet equation is
Capital + Liabilities (where the money came from)  
= Assets (where the money is now)
Cashflow
The movement of cash in and out of a business from day-to-day direct 
trading and other non-trading effects, such as capital expenditure, tax 
and dividend payments.
Cashflow statement
The Cashflow statement shows the movement and availability of cash 
through and to the business over a given period and it is fundamental 
that financial forecasting and reporting of cash movement and availability 
is accurate. For any business ‘cash is king’ and essential to meet 
payments for example to suppliers, staff and other creditors.
Current assets
Cash and anything that is expected to be converted into cash within  
12 months of the balance sheet date. For example debtors, stocks.
Current liabilities
Money owed by the business that is generally due for payment within  
12 months of balance sheet date. For example: creditors, bank overdraft, 
taxation.
Depreciation
The proportion of cost relating to a capital item, over an agreed period, 
(based on the useful life of the asset), for example, a piece of equipment 
costing £10,000 having a life of five years might be depreciated over five 
years at a cost of £2,000 per year.
This for example would be shown in the P&L as a depreciation cost of 
£2,000 per year; the balance sheet would show an asset value of £8,000 
at the end of year one, reducing by £2,000 per year; and the cashflow 
statement would show all £10,000 being used to pay for it in year one.
Dividend
A dividend is a payment made per share, to a company’s shareholders 
and is based on the profits of the year, but not necessarily all of the 
profits; Normally a half year dividend is recommended by a company 
Board whilst the final dividend for the year is proposed by the Board of 
Directors and shareholders consider this and vote at an Annual General 
Meeting.
Earnings before
There are several ‘Earnings before…..’ ratios. The key ones being:
 PBT Profit/earnings before taxes 
 EBIT Earnings before interest and taxes
 EBITDA  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and 
amortisation
Earnings relate to operating and non-operating profits e.g. interest, 
dividends received from other investments. Depreciation and 
Amortisation are non-cash charges to the balance sheet which is made 
in writing-off an asset over a period.

THE AWARD FOR BUSINESS ACHIEVEMENT WAS
SPONSORED BY PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS AND
PRESENTED BY THE RIGHT HON. WILLIAM HAGUE MP .
DECEMBER 2007
NEW FURNACES INSTALLED AT THE
ULTRA-LARGE FORGE, REDUCING GAS USAGE
BY 50% AND IMPROVING BOTH PRODUCT
QUALITY AND THROUGHPUT.
It gives me pleasure to announce an outstanding
set of results for the Group, which surpassed all
original expectations for the year .
We are also on course to exceed one of the major
aims in our flotation strategy “to be a £40 million
turnover business within five years”, as the
Group achieved record exports to its Oil and Gas
exploration and production customers, as well as
winning selected overseas defence contracts.
RESULTS
Turnover increased to £23.7 million, compared
with £15.1 million in 2007 - a creditable rise of
over 50%. This increase in sales, combined with
ongoing operating efficiency gains, served to more
than double operating profits to £4.9 million
before exceptional items (2007: £1.9 million).
Profit before taxation was £5.0 million
(2007: £1.4 million) and earnings per share rose
to 31.6p (2007: 10.9p).
Despite long lead times from major suppliers,
I am pleased to confirm that our actions to
control working capital resulted in year end net
funds of £5.9 million (2007: £4.6 million).
The Board has agreed a progressive dividend
policy and is recommending a maiden final
dividend of 4.0 pence per share, giving a total
dividend for the year of 6.0 pence. If approved at
the Annual General Meeting, this dividend will
be paid on 12 March 2009 to shareholders
on the share register at the close of business on
13 February 2009. The ex-dividend date will be
11 February 2009.
STRATEGY
Our Business Growth Strategy, to penetrate key
growth sectors, notably global energy and high
pressure gases markets, establishing a
presence in new niche markets and acquire
businesses which offer synergistic benefits in
related niche sectors, is progressing:
Long term export contracts and orders have
been secured from overseas defence and
aerospace programmes in Europe and Asia.
As well as supplying assemblies to drilling rig
constructors, we are also continuing to win
orders for offshore diving support vessels.
In the industrial gas trailer refurbishment sector,
contracts have been secured stretching into 2009
from a major industrial gas supplier .
In the Compressed Natural Gas (“CNG”) and
Biogas sectors, we have signed an Agreement
with Greenlane
®
Biogas Limited, a New Zealand
based company with a market leading position
on Biogas upgrading technology. The UK lags
behind the rest of northern Europe in exploiting
an energy source that is growing at over 25% per
annum in those countries. Recent changes in UK
legislation will facilitate the growth of this energy
source in the UK gas market.
We continue to invest in R&D programmes,
including composite material cylinders and
internal selected surface coatings, which are
attracting interest from both industrial and
defence customers. Initial prototype products
are being manufactured and evaluated for
potential applications.
Key equipment has been procured and skilled
staff recruited that will enable us to target the
in-service field testing of ultra-large cylinders.
This sector is expected to develop as cylinders
in service start to require re-certification.
PEOPLE
We welcomed Philip Cammerman to the Board
as a Non-executive Director in April 2008 and
also James Lister, who was appointed Group
Finance Director on 1 June 2008. The Group
is already benefiting from their combined
expertise.
I am particularly pleased to report that the
achievements of our Chief Executive, John
Hayward, were recognised nationally when he
scooped the Ernst & Young Business Products
Entrepreneur of the Year Award 2008.
We strengthened our second tier management
and professional staff during the year under
review. Recognising that there is a skills
shortage in the UK, we have ramped up our
engineering training and apprentice programmes.
The Group is also well positioned geographically
to benefit from local universities and Research
Institutes which have maintained sound technical
faculties - including Sheffield University, Hallam
University and NAMTEC. Our future as a
value-driven engineered products business
depends on our investment in engineering and
metallurgical skills and resources.
It is appropriate to acknowledge the skill, hard
work and support of our Operational Directors
and all our employees in contributing to another
successful year for our business.
Finally, I would like to thank our shareholders for
their support of the Company throughout the year .
PROSPECTS
Pressure Technologies has entered the new
financial year with a record order book of
£23 million (2007: £18.0 million) giving clear
visibility throughout 2009 and into 2010. There
remains a shortage of semi submersible and
deepwater drilling rigs to support the world’s
demand for hydrocarbons and we are enthused
by the medium term prospects of the CNG and
Biogas sector, in which Chesterfield BioGas is
already developing a significant tender pipeline.
The Company continues to evaluate synergisitic
acquisitions, particularly in the light of our cash
resources and the opportunities now being
presented in the market.
The Board is confident that Pressure Technologies
will deliver further growth in the short term and,
as we roll out our diversification strategy on a
controlled and profit driven basis, the medium to
long term future of the Group remains strong.

FURTHER ORDERS RECEIVED FROM THE INDIAN
NATIONAL AERONAUTICS LABORATORY AS PART
OF OUR INVOLVEMENT IN THE INDIAN SPACE
PROGRAMME.
It was a year of exceptional organic growth,
which was recognised in our share price
performance relative to the AIM market.
We exited the year with a record order book
and a strong pipeline of quoted projects in all
markets. This seems somewhat at odds with the
world financial climate but may be explained, in
part, by the markets in which we operate.
In our main market, the Oil and Gas sector, there
remains a shortage of semi-submersible drilling
rigs and drill ships to develop deep water
hydrocarbon reserves. This has created strong
demand for our products which started in 2005
when oil prices were averaging around $50 per
barrel. If oil price is a driver of investment, then
we do not yet appear to be outside the price
range for investment to be profitable. Nor has
there been a reduction in the number of projects
for support services projects. A further indicator
of the sector’s strength is the availability of
materials, in particular, seamless pipe, which is
used for drill pipe as well as cylinders. This is
still rationed and a number of steel mills have
no available capacity in 2009.
There was an increase in activity in the export
defence market. We won naval build orders in
two new geographical areas, France and Canada.
The UK defence market remains subdued,
however we continued to supply significant
quantities of cylinders into military aircraft
programmes and are bidding for further
contracts on aircraft carriers and the Astute
submarine programme. Sales to the naval
market will be significantly higher in 2009 than
at any time since 2002.
All our other markets, in terms of orders and
levels of quotations, remain at or above historical
levels. I was particularly pleased with the growth
achieved in our trailer refurbishment business,
which should continue into 2009. We have our
largest forward order load for new trailers since
the management buyout in 2004.
Threats from market downturn do not appear
significant in the short term and I concur with
our Chairman on the medium and long term
prospects for the Group.
Looking at 2008, we had a terrific year with a
significant number of “highs” and a few missed
opportunities. The key points being:
WHAT WE DID WELL
Winning orders, growing sales and ending the
year with a record £23 million order book. Sales
at our operating company, Chesterfield Special
Cylinders, increased by 56% to £23.7 million
(2007: £15.1 million) with growth being achieved
in all our major markets.
The increase in sales was predominantly in
ultra-large cylinders and operations management
was highly effective, improving line efficiency.
As a consequence, gross profit increased by
91% after allowing for year on year net exchange
gains of £0.5 million.
Manufacturing support was improved through
the addition of a production planner and
implementation of finite capacity scheduling
software.
Building relationships with a range of business
partners and organisations, which will benefit
the growth of the business in the future.
Getting to a position where we could launch
Chesterfield BioGas (see below).
WHERE WE COULD HAVE DONE BETTER
We did not have sufficient resources to grow
the small cylinder business, due to the focus
on improving throughput on the ultra-large
production line and sales resources were
diverted onto the Biogas project (see below).
This will be addressed in 2009 by the introduction
of a separately managed business unit for small
cylinders, which will have its own dedicated
operations management and sales staff. 14 PRESSURE TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
CONTINUED
2008
A GREAT YEAR
JULY 2008
CHESTERFIELD BIOGAS FORMED IN PREPARATION
FOR THE LAUNCH OF THE NEW DIVISION IN
NOVEMBER 2008.
Stock levels were too high, as a result of holding
stock to cover poor delivery by suppliers and the
insistence, by some customers, that we source
certain fittings from their nominated suppliers.
We are working very closely with suppliers to
improve the reliability of deliveries and our
customers have now given us permission to
resource fittings from cost effective UK based
suppliers.
OPERATIONAL REVIEW
Sales and marketing
This was a very busy year for Philip Redfern and
his team at CSC. The plan to pursue growth in
the UK aggressively with the appointment of an
additional salesman focused solely on this
market was put on hold, as the new salesman
was moved to our new Biogas project. Significant
opportunities to grow the customer base in our
home market across the full range of
commercial products and services remain and a
modified version of this plan, incorporating the
new business unit structure, will be relaunched
as soon as we have recruited another salesman.
Our International Sales Development Manager
was very active in India, the Far East and China
during the year and we are actively quoting for
projects in niche sectors, where higher pressures,
product integrity and design capability are
essential.
As reported above, the export defence market
was very rewarding. It was particularly satisfying
to win the contract for high pressure cylinders on
the Barracuda submarine, after thirty years
endeavouring to gain entry to the French defence
sector . We will continue to target all naval build
programmes worldwide, as our design and
development capability in this sector is
unrivalled. Medium term prospects for the UK
look promising and we intend to lodge innovative
bids that highlight our supply chain expertise.
Operations
The challenges of the £8.6 million increase in
revenues should not be underestimated.
Operations management at CSC, led by John
Brown and Philip Catton, met the challenges
very successfully. Manufacturing employees
increased from 33 at the beginning of the year to
52 by year end. Training was not neglected and
we successfully ran induction courses and an
NVQ level 2 course. Given the success of our
apprenticeship scheme, we decided to employ
three new apprentices in September 2008.
An experienced production planner was
employed and investment in finite capacity
scheduling software was made to ensure on-
time delivery and manage production flow more
effectively. By the year end, overdue orders were
reduced to very low levels.
Capital investment was once again focused on
improving manufacturing efficiency and
increasing output. This included changing the
layout of a number of areas within ultra-large
manufacturing to improve product flow and the
installation of new end-heating furnaces for the
ultra-large forge, which halved gas usage and
improved product quality. Capital investment in
2009 will again be in excess of twice the
depreciation level.
Business units will be introduced in 2009 to
deliver improvements in both the ultra-large and
the small cylinder areas. In ultra-large, there will
be a concerted effort to eliminate waste and
further improve process flow and we are
currently working with the Manufacturing
Advisory Service on a project to achieve this.
In small cylinders, the focus will be on growing
the business.
Technical and development
Maintaining our technical and design capability
continued to pay dividends, as many of our
customers no longer have high pressure cylinder
design expertise in their organisations. The
additional designer we employed gives us greater
scope for both product and tooling development.
We are now in the process of recruiting a
graduate trainee into the design function.
The CSC Technical Director, Alan Harding, is
actively engaged in the development of new
ISO standards for ultra-large seamless steel
cylinders and ultra-large composite cylinders.
To assist with this and other areas of development,
we have engaged Dr Rohitan (Roy) Irani, former
Global Technical Authority, Cylinders, for
The BOC Group, as a consultant. Roy has a
lifetime’s experience in the design and applications
of both high and low pressure cylinders, including
cryogenic applications.
Research and development continued on a range
of products and services and we now have closer
links with the Sheffield Advanced Manufacturing
Research Centre and the two Sheffield universities.
CSC is also involved in the Special Metals
Forum's nuclear supply chain initiative. The key
areas for development in 2008 are:
The development of in-service field testing of
cylinders where we have recently procured key
equipment and recruited staff with the relevant
non-destructive testing expertise.
The development of ultra-large composite
cylinders.
The development of materials and coatings for
naval applications. PRESSURE TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 15
Corporate Social Responsibility
The management of health and safety issues
remains a management priority across the
business. Health and safety is an agenda item at
both the Pressure Technologies and CSC Boards.
It was disappointing to see reportable accidents
increase to three this year (2007: 2, target: 0);
none of these injuries were life-threatening.
Additional capital expenditure to improve
materials handling is planned for 2009 - the
major project will improve loading and unloading
of the ultra-large forge.
It was very pleasing to see CSC gain accreditation
to ISO14001:2004 in January 2008. Our product is
virtually 100% recyclable, but it is also good to
know that we also have a robust environmental
management system in our manufacturing
facility. Once again, we had no environmental
incidents in the year .
CSC gives donations of £250 per month to
charity. These donations are administered by an
employee committee. The aim of these donations
is two-fold; to help small, mainly local charities
and to raise employee awareness of, and
participation in, charitable giving.
Chesterfield BioGas
During the year, we were actively engaged in
preparing the Group’s entry to a new market.
On 10 November 2008, we announced the
establishment of a new operating division,
Chesterfield BioGas, following the signing of a
co-operation agreement with Greenlane
®
Biogas
Limited, the world leader in biogas upgrading
from raw biogas to vehicle quality fuel.
Under the agreement, which gives Pressure
Technologies exclusive rights to market Greenlane
®
equipment in the UK and Eire, Chesterfield
BioGas will provide turnkey solutions for the
cleaning, storage and dispensing of biomethane,
produced from waste water treatment and
anaerobic digestion of organic waste. We have a
long relationship with Flotech, the owners of
Greenlane
®
Biogas, as we have worked together
on a number of biogas projects in Sweden over
the last decade. This is a low-risk, tried and
tested biomethane fuel solution for the UK
market. Our joint skills and experience in this
field mean that we are able to deliver an effective
and successful system, when others can only
offer prototypes.
The UK market for biomethane has, to date,
remained untapped, largely due to a limited
availability of methane-fuelled vehicles and
subsidies for combined heat and power plants,
which have made the injection of methane into
the gas grid uneconomic. These two factors are
now being addressed. Mercedes and Volkswagen
are now producing right-hand drive methane
fuelled vehicles for the UK market and the
Energy Bill has been changed to pave the way
for financial incentives, designed to encourage
direct injection of biomethane into the gas grid.
Chesterfield BioGas will develop the UK market
for biogas cleaning equipment, which provides
clean biomethane suitable for use as an alternative
vehicle fuel or for direct injection into the natural
gas grid, across a wide range of commercial
sectors. These will include waste management
and water treatment companies, as well as large
commercial farmers and waste food processors.
A strong pipeline of projects is developing but,
due to the complexity of UK planning law and
lead times on equipment, it is anticipated that
orders secured by Chesterfield BioGas in 2009
will not contribute to Group revenues until the
year ending 30 September 2010.
Acquisitions
We have a target list of companies that match
our criteria of niche, high added value companies
in pressure containment and control markets
and we are actively in discussions with a number
of companies. We now have more time to spend
working on delivering acquisitions and intend to
employ additional resources to assist with this
process. Buying private companies is time
consuming and about relationships. Time spent
getting this right is essential to the success of
the programme and we will not buy in haste.
In summary, 2008 was another successful year
for the Group, delivering solid growth and
shareholder value. Our strong order book and
pipeline of prospects should ensure that we
deliver another good result in 2009.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
The Directors present their report and the audited financial statements for the period from 1 October 2007 to 27 September 2008.
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES
Pressure Technologies plc (“PT”) is the holding Company for Chesterfield Special Cylinders Limited (“CSC”) whose principal activities are the
design, manufacture and reconditioning of seamless steel high pressure gas cylinders.
RESULTS AND DIVIDENDS
The Consolidated Income Statement is set out on page 23. The profit on ordinary activities before taxation of the Group for the period ended
27 September 2008 amounted to £5.046 million (2007: £1.384 million).
An interim dividend of 2.0p per share was paid during the period (2007: £nil). The Directors recommend a final dividend of 4p per share (2007: £nil).
BUSINESS REVIEW
Financial overview
Revenues increased to £23.660 million (2007: £15.124 million) principally as a result of demand from the Oil and Gas sector, an increase of 56%.
Gross profit increased by 91% to £7.510 million (2007: £3.935 million) giving a gross margin of 32% (2007: 26%). The increase in gross margin was
due to improved operating efficiencies, increased activity levels through the factory and favourable exchange rate movements.
Administration expenses, excluding exceptional costs, increased by 26% to £2.578 million to support business growth.
Profit before tax increased by 265% to £5.046 million (2007: £1.384 million). Basic earnings per share were up 187% at 31.6p (2007: 10.9p).
The cash inflow from operations was £2.881 million (2007: outflow £0.609 million) reflecting the significant increase in operating profits which
were converted to cash, less the extra inventory requirements of the business.
The nature of the capital expenditure projects undertaken during the year are described in the Chief Executive’s statement.
Operational overview
The operational overview is contained in the Chief Executive’s statement on pages 12 to 15.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
Specific principal risks identified by management are described below together with management actions to minimise these risks:
Other risks may also adversely affect the Group and actual results may differ materially from anticipated results because of a variety of risk factors,
including but not limited to: changes in interest and exchange rates; changes in global, political, economic, business, competitive and market forces;
changes to legislation and tax rates; future business acquisitions or disposals; relations with customers and customer credit risk; relations with
suppliers and supplier credit risks; events affecting international security, including global health issues and terrorism, and changes in legislation.
SUMMARY AND CALCULATION OF KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
Shareholders
KPI – Earnings per share
2008 31.6p
2007 10.9p
The improvement in earnings per share is a result of growth in the business and continued drive to improve efficiency and elimination of waste.
Earnings per share is calculated as profit for the period divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue.
Financial performance
KPI – Revenue KPI – Return on revenue
2008 £23.7 million 2008 20.8%
2007 £15.1 million 2007 12.4%
Target £40 million by 2011 Target 20.0%
Revenue growth was predominantly in the offshore Oil and Gas sector which accounted for 85% of sales in 2008 (86% in 2007).
The return on revenue benefited from improved operational gearing through the factory and the weakening of Sterling against the Euro.
Return on revenue is calculated as operating profit before exceptional operating costs divided by revenue, expressed as a percentage.
Health & safety Environment
KPI – Reportable Accidents KPI – Reportable Incidents
2008 3 2008 Zero

Risk
The Group derives over 75% of its sales from two key customers in one
market sector.
The Group derives a high proportion of its raw material from a small
number of key suppliers, some of whom are competitors.
The Group operates from a single manufacturing site. In the event of a
prolonged interruption to operations at this site, the Group may not have
the ability to transfer its manufacturing activities to other facilities.
The Group is small and relies on a small number of key Directors
and senior managers.
The Group purchases some of its raw materials in both US Dollars
and Euros and receives payment for some of its products in Euros.
Management action
Significant management resource is allocated to service the requirements
of these customers. Ongoing development of new products,
customers and markets.
To reduce the inherent risk of supply from competitors, requirements
are split across the available supplier base.
Health, safety and environmental risks which could result in site
closure are managed on a day to day basis by a specialist manager
reporting directly to the CSC Operations Director.
As the business grows increases in staff numbers make succession
planning easier and recruitment is already carried out to ensure that
skills and expertise can be duplicated.
Key man insurance is in place for the PT Chief Executive, the CSC
Operations Director and the CSC Sales and Marketing Director . The Board
regularly reviews the adequacy of the policies currently in place.
The net exposure is reduced by the use of forward exchange contracts
subject to limits in the Group’s banking facility. 20 PRESSURE TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008

The Group gives full and fair consideration to applications for employment from disabled persons, where they have the necessary abilities and
skills for that position, and wherever possible will retrain employees who become disabled, so that they can continue their employment in another
position. The Group engage, promote, and train staff on the basis of their capabilities, qualifications and experience, without discrimination, giving
all employees an equal opportunity to progress.
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of
the parent Company and the Group as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the Group for the financial year. The AIM Rules for
Companies require that the Directors prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as
adopted by the European Union (IFRSs). The Directors have elected to prepare the parent Company financial statements in accordance with
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP). In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• for the Group financial statements, state whether applicable IFRSs have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the financial statements;
• for the parent Company financial statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of
the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. Legislation
in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO AUDITORS
In so far as each of the Directors is aware:
• There is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s Auditors are unaware, and
• The Directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish
that the Auditors are aware of that information.
AUDITORS
Grant Thornton UK LLP are willing to continue in office and a resolution to reappoint them will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.

REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR
TO THE MEMBERS OF PRESSURE TECHNOLOGIES PLC
We have audited the Group and parent Company financial statements (the ''financial statements'') of Pressure Technologies plc for the period
ended 27 September 2008 which comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated and parent Company balance sheets, the
consolidated cash flow statement, the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense and notes 1 to 26 to the Group consolidated
financial statements and notes 1 to 9 to the parent Company financial statements. These financial statements have been prepared under the
accounting policies set out therein.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has
been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an Auditor's report and for
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors' responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the Group financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom law
and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, and for preparing the parent Company financial
statements in accordance with United Kingdom law and Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are
set out in the Statement of Directors' Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors'
Report is consistent with the financial statements. The information given in the Directors' Report includes that specific information presented in
the Chairman's and Chief Executive's statements that are cross referred from the Principal Activities and Business Review section of the
Directors' Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors' remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. This other
information comprises only the Directors' Report, the Chairman's statement and the Chief Executive's statement. We consider the implications
for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities
do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group's and Company's circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with
sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or
other irregularity or error . In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the state of the
Group's affairs as at 27 September 2008 and of its profit for the period then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985;
• the parent Company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice, of the state of the parent Company's affairs as at 27 September 2008;
• the parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
• the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements.

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted by the
European Union and IFRIC interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS for the first time. The Company has elected to prepare its parent Company financial statements in
accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (UK GAAP). These are presented on pages 47 to 49.
The policies have changed from the previous year when the financial statements were prepared under applicable United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (UK GAAP). The comparative data for the year to 30 September 2007 has been restated and reconciliations are
included in note 26 to explain the changes.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for derivative financial instruments carried at fair value.
The following Standards and Interpretations, which have not been applied during the period but are likely to impact on the financial statements
of the Group, were in issue but not yet effective:
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements (revised 2007) (effective 1 January 2009)
IAS 23 Borrowing Costs (revised 2007) (effective 1 January 2009)
IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (Revised 2008) (effective 1 July 2009)
Amendment to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment – Vesting Conditions and Cancellations (effective 1 January 2009)
IFRS 3 Business Combinations (Revised 2008) (effective 1 July 2009)
IFRS 8 Operating Segments (effective 1 January 2009)
Improvements to IFRSs (effective 1 January 2009 other than certain elements effective 1 July 2009)
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial
statements of the Group except for IAS 1 (revised), IFRS 3 (revised) and IFRS 8. The amendment to IAS 1 affects the presentation of owner
changes in equity and introduces a statement of comprehensive income. Preparers will have the option of presenting items of income and
expense and components of other comprehensive income either in a single statement of comprehensive income with subtotals, or in two separate
statements (a separate income statement followed by a statement of other comprehensive income). This amendment does not affect the financial
position or results of the Group but will give rise to additional disclosures. Management is currently assessing the detailed impact of this
amendment on the Group’s financial statements.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations (Revised 2008) will apply to any future business combinations that the Group may undertake once it is in force.
The Group has no plans to adopt the revised standard in advance of its mandatory implementation date and it is not possible to quantify the effect
of the standard on future business combinations until those combinations take place.
IFRS 8 introduces new rules on the disclosure of operating results by business segment. The new standard requires a management approach,
under which segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting procedures. The Group will apply IFRS 8
from 1 October 2009. The impact of the standard is not expected to be significant as the Group only has one segment that currently contributes
more then ten percent of total revenue, profit or loss, or assets.
First time adoption of IFRS
Application of IFRS 1
The consolidated financial statements for the period ended 27 September 2008 are the first annual financial statements that comply fully with
IFRS 1 and all other applicable International Financial Reporting Standards. These financial statements have been prepared as described above.
The Group's transition date is 1 October 2006 and the Group prepared its opening IFRS balance sheet at that date. In preparing these consolidated
financial statements in accordance with IFRS 1, the Group has applied the mandatory exemptions and certain of the optional exemptions from full
retrospective application of IFRS. The Group did not take advantage of any optional exemptions available.
26 PRESSURE TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 27 September 2008.
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to control the financial and operating policies so as to obtain benefits from its
activities. The Group obtains and exercises control through voting rights.
All intra-group transactions have been eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its subsidiaries are
eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Acquisitions of subsidiaries are dealt with by the purchase method. The purchase method involves the recognition at fair value of all identifiable
assets and liabilities, including contingent liabilities of the subsidiary, at the acquisition date, regardless of whether or not they were recorded in
the financial statements of the subsidiary prior to acquisition. On initial recognition, the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary are included in the
consolidated balance sheet at their fair values, which are also used as the bases for subsequent measurement in accordance with the Group
accounting policies. Goodwill is stated after separating out identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over
the fair value of the Group's share of the identifiable net assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Segment reporting
A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and rewards that are
different from those of other business segments. A geographical segment is engaged in providing products or services within a particular
economic environment that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those operating in other economic environments.
Based on risks and returns, the Directors consider that the primary reporting format is by business segment. The secondary reporting format is
by geographical analysis, by origin and destination.
Revenue
Revenue is measured by reference to the fair value of consideration received or receivable and arises from the sales of goods and services
provided in the normal course of business, net of trade discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes. Revenue from the sale of goods is
recognised when the significant risks and benefits of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, which may be on despatch, completion of the
product or the product being ready for delivery, based on specific contract terms; when the amount of revenue can be measured reliably; and
when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group.
Revenue from services provided by the Group, which does not represent a significant portion of the total revenue, is recognised when the outcome
of the transaction can be estimated reliably and the Group has performed its obligations and, in exchange, obtained the right to consideration.
Exceptional administration costs
Exceptional administration costs are material items which individually or, if a similar type, in aggregate, need to be disclosed by virtue of their size
or incidence because of their relevance to understanding the entity’s financial performance.
Costs of this nature were incurred in the prior period and are detailed in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.
Research and development
Expenditure on research (or the research phase of an internal project) is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Development costs are capitalised when all the following conditions are satisfied:
• completion of the intangible asset is technically feasible so that it will be available for use or sale;
• the Group intends to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;
• the Group has the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;
• the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits. Among other things, this requires that there is a market for the output
from the intangible asset or for the intangible asset itself, or, if it is to be used internally, the asset will be used in generating such benefits;
• there are adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset; and
• the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development can be measured reliably.
Development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalisation are expensed as incurred.
Pressure Technologies plc has not incurred any costs in the year that have met the above criteria for development costs, with all relevant costs
being expensed as research costs as they are incurred.
PRESSURE TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 27 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Share-based employee remuneration
All share-based payment arrangements granted after 7 November 2002, which had not vested by the date of transition to IFRS, are recognised in
the consolidated financial statements. The Group operates equity-settled share-based remuneration plans for remuneration of its employees.
The Group's plan does not feature any options for a cash settlement.
All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values. Where employees are
rewarded using share-based payments, the fair values of employees' services are determined indirectly by reference to the fair value of the
instrument granted to the employee. This fair value is appraised at the grant date and excludes the impact of non-market vesting conditions (for
example, profitability and sales growth targets).
All share-based remuneration is ultimately recognised as an expense in profit or loss with a corresponding credit to the profit and loss reserve.
If vesting periods or other vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period, based on the best available estimate of the
number of share options expected to vest. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are
expected to become exercisable. Estimates are subsequently revised, if there is any indication that the number of share options expected to vest
differs from previous estimates. Any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is recognised in the current period. No adjustment is made to any
expense recognised in prior periods if share options ultimately exercised are different to that estimated on vesting. Upon exercise of share
options, the proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs up to the nominal value of the shares issued are allocated to share
capital with any excess being recorded as additional paid-in capital.
The cancellation of equity-settled share based payments is accounted for as an acceleration of vesting.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised when the shareholders right to receive payment is established.
Property, plant and equipment
Plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment. No depreciation is charged whilst assets are still in
the course of construction. Depreciation is applied on a straight-line basis so as to reduce the assets to their residual values over their estimated
useful lives. Residual values are reviewed annually. The rates of depreciation used are:
Plant and machinery 4 – 15 years
The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the
asset and is recognised in the income statement.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows
(cash-generating units). As a result, some assets are tested individually for impairment and some are tested at cash-generating unit level.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, reflecting market conditions less costs to sell, and value in use based on an internal
discounted cash flow evaluation.
The Group operates from a single manufacturing site in Sheffield under a 15 year lease expiring in June 2020. The Directors consider that the
remaining life of the building to be considerably longer than the remaining life of the lease and consequently the lease has been treated as an
operating lease.
Operating leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the
lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Payments under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives are
spread over the term of the lease.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, on a first in first out basis. Cost includes materials, direct labour and an
attributable proportion of manufacturing overheads based on normal levels of activity. Net realisable value is based on the estimated sales price
after allowing for all further costs of completion and disposal. Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where appropriate.

Income taxes
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. Current tax is the tax currently payable based on taxable profit for the year .
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences. Deferred tax is generally provided on the difference
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of
goodwill, nor on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business combination or affects tax or accounting
profit. Deferred tax on temporary differences associated with shares in subsidiaries is not provided if reversal of these temporary differences can
be controlled by the Group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future. In addition, tax losses available to be carried
forward as well as other income tax credits to the Group are assessed for recognition as deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full, with no discounting. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the
underlying deductible temporary differences will be able to be offset against future taxable income. Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities
are calculated at tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective periods of realisation, provided they are enacted or substantively enacted
at the balance sheet date.
Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the income statement, except where they relate to
items that are charged or credited directly to equity in which case the related deferred tax is also charged or credited directly to equity.
Accounting for financial assets
The Group has financial assets in the following categories:
• loans and receivables
• financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets are assigned to the different categories on initial recognition, depending on the characteristics of the instrument and its purpose.
A financial instrument's category is relevant for the way it is measured and whether any resulting income and expenses are recognised in profit or
loss or directly in equity.
All financial assets are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets other than
those categorised as at fair value through profit or loss are recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. Financial assets categorised as at fair
value through profit or loss are recognised initially at fair value with transaction costs expensed through the income statement.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. After initial
recognition these are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. Any change in their value is
recognised in profit or loss. Pressure Technologies plc's trade and most other receivables fall into this category of financial instrument.
Discounting, however, is omitted where the effect of discounting is immaterial.
Significant receivables are considered for impairment on a case-by-case basis when they are past due at the balance sheet date or when objective
evidence is received that a specific counterparty will default. All other receivables are reviewed for impairment in Groups, which are determined by
reference to the industry and region of a counterparty and other available features of shared credit risk characteristics, if any. The percentage of
the write down is then based on recent historical counterparty default rates for each identified Group.
Accounting for financial liabilities
Financial liabilities represent a contractual obligation for the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets. Financial liabilities are initially
recognised at fair value, net of issue costs, when the Group becomes a party to the contractual agreements of the instrument. All interest-related
charges and, if applicable, changes in an instrument's fair value that are reported in profit or loss are included in the income statement line items
“finance costs” or “finance income”.
The Group's financial liabilities include borrowings, trade and other payables (including finance lease liabilities), which are measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
PRESSURE TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 29 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Derivative financial instruments
The Group has derivative financial instruments and embedded derivative financial instruments that are carried at fair value through profit or loss.
The Group does not hedge account for these items.
Any gain or loss arising from derivative financial instruments is based on changes in fair value, which is determined by direct reference to active market
transactions or using a valuation technique where no active market exists. The Group has foreign currency forward contracts that fall into this category.
Derivatives embedded within contracts for the sale or purchase of a non-financial item that are denominated in a foreign currency are separated
when their economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract. Embedded derivatives are valued at their fair
value with changes in fair value being recognised in the income statement.
The Group have sales and purchase orders that contain embedded derivatives.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, together with other short-term, highly liquid investments that are
readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, and bank overdrafts, where they
form an integral part of the Group's cash management.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity
instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. The only equity instrument applicable to the
Group is its issued share capital.
Compound instruments
The component parts of compound instruments issued by the Group are classified separately as financial liabilities and equity in accordance with
the substance of the contractual arrangement. At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing
market interest rate for a similar non-convertible instrument. This amount is recorded as a liability on an amortised cost basis using the effective
interest rate method until extinguished upon conversion or at the instrument's maturity date. The equity component is determined by deducting
the amount of the liability component from the fair value of the component instrument as a whole. This is recognised and included in equity, net of
income tax effects, and is not subsequently re-measured.
The Group previously had preferential ordinary shares in issue which fell into this category. These shares were converted to ordinary shares
during the previous financial year.
Interest
Interest is recognised using the effective interest method which calculates the amortised cost of a financial asset or liability and allocates the
interest income over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the
expected life of the financial asset to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.
Foreign currency translation
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency (being the currency of the primary economic environment in which the
Group operates) of the respective Group entity, using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions (spot exchange rate). Foreign
exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the re-measurement of monetary balance sheet items at
year-end exchange rates are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign
currencies are translated at rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of
historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group Company are expressed in Pounds
Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements.
Grants
Grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to the income statement over the expected useful
lives of the assets concerned. Other grants are credited to the income statement in the same period as the related expenditure is incurred.
Pensions
The Group operates a defined contribution scheme with costs being charged to the income statement in the period to which they relate.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
30 PRESSURE TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 2. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
In the application of the Group's accounting policies, which are described in note 1, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated
assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and assumptions that have a material risk to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below:
Fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments
As described in note 19, the Directors use their judgement in selecting an appropriate valuation technique for financial instruments not quoted in
an active market. Valuation techniques commonly used by market practitioners are applied. For derivative and embedded derivative financial
instruments, assumptions are made based on quoted market rates adjusted for specific features of the instrument. Details of the assumptions
used and the results of sensitivity analyses regarding these assumptions are provided in note 19.
Revenue recognition
The Group recognises revenue when the goods in question have finished production and passed any applicable factory and customer acceptance
tests. Where goods remain on the Group’s premises at the year end at the request of the customer, management consider the detailed criteria for
the recognition of revenue from the sale of goods as set out in IAS 18. In particular, consideration is given as to whether the significant risks and
rewards of ownership are considered to have transferred to the buyer.
Capitalisation of research and development
Where the conditions of IAS 38 (Intangible Assets) are met, the Group capitalises the relevant development expenditure as an asset. In order to
capitalise research and development expenditure, the Group must create an asset that is expected to generate future economic benefits in which
the revenue can be reliably measured. The Group incurred research and development expenditure during the year which the Director’s do not
consider to have met this criteria and consequently the expenditure has been expensed during the period.
Inventory provisions
The Directors have reviewed the level of specific and general provisions carried against inventory in the light of outstanding current and
anticipated customer orders. Where no customer orders are received against finished goods, full provision is made.
3. SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS
Based on risks and returns, the Directors consider that the primary reporting format is by business segment. The Directors consider that only one
business segment exists, being the Group's supply of high-pressure gas cylinders into the energy market. No other segment represents more
than 10% of revenue. Consequently, separate disclosure of each business segment is not required as disclosures for the primary segment are
already given in the financial statements.
Geographical segment
The following table provides an analysis of the Group's revenue by geographical market. The carrying amount of segment assets and additions to
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets have not been analysed separately by location, as they are all located in the United Kingdom.

Capital risk management
Pressure Technologies plc's capital management objectives are to ensure the Group's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide an
adequate return to shareholders.
The Group manages its capital through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance and by pricing products and services commensurately with
the level of risk. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 18, cash and cash equivalents
and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in note 23.

equity holders of the parent.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements, other than the minimum capital requirements and duties regarding a serious
reduction of capital, as imposed by the Companies Act 1985 on all public limited companies.

Financial risk management objectives
Management monitor and manage the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group through regular reports to the Board. These risks
include currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group seeks to minimise the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to reduce these risk exposures. The use of financial
derivatives is governed by the Group's policies on foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and non-derivative
financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity. The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative
financial instruments, for speculative purposes. Whilst the Group enters into forward currency contracts during the year to mitigate foreign
currency risk, it does not apply hedge accounting. 38 PRESSURE TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
19. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED
Market risk
The Group's activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly in US Dollars and Euros, and
interest rates. The Group enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk and interest rate risk including
the use of fixed interest rates on its long term borrowings. The level of long term borrowings in place at the year end is not significant to the Group.
Foreign currency risk management
The Group purchases its principal raw materials in both US Dollars and Euros and receives payment for some of its products in Euros as well as
in Pounds Sterling. After netting off foreign currency receipts and payments there is a net exposure to the risk of currency movements both in US
Dollars and Euros. Where necessary the net exposure is hedged using forward contracts subject to limits in the Group’s banking facility.
The carrying amounts of the Group's foreign currency denominated monetary financial assets and monetary financial liabilities at the reporting
date are as follows:
Financial Financial Financial Financial
liabilities assets liabilities liabilities
2008 2007 2008 2007

Norwegian Krone — 42 — —
US Dollar 331 339 — —
2,037 2,737 1,574 825
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The Group is mainly exposed to the US Dollar and Euro currency movements.
The following table details the Group's sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in Pound Sterling against the relevant foreign currencies:
Euro currency Euro currency Norwegian Krone Norwegian Krone US Dollar US Dollar
impact impact currency impact currency impact currency impact currency impact

£'000 £'000 £'000 £'000 £'000 £'000
Profit or loss 26 143 — 7 28 31
The use of a 10% movement in exchange rates is considered appropriate given recent movements in exchange rates.
The above analysis represents the Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk based financial assets and liabilities outstanding at the year end.
A substantial amount of the Group’s sales and purchases are made in foreign currencies. The exposure to foreign exchange rates varies
throughout the year depending on the volume and timing of transactions in foreign currencies.
Forward foreign exchange contracts
It is the policy of the Group to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency payments and receipts. The Group
also periodically enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the risk associated with anticipated sales and purchase transactions
out to between 6-12 months. The Group does not hedge account for the forward currency exchange contracts.
As of 27 September 2008 the aggregate amount of profit/loss under forward foreign exchange contracts was £21,000.
At 27 September 2008 the Group had an outstanding forward exchange contract to purchase $560,000 which substantially covered the outstanding
value of US Dollar denominated purchase orders.
Interest rate risk management
The Group finances its operations where necessary through bank loans and overdrafts. Surplus cash is placed on short-term deposit at fixed
rates of interest.
If interest rates had been 0.5% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the impact on the results in the Income Statement and
equity would be an increase/decrease of £17,000.
The Group had un-drawn borrowing facilities available at 27 September 2008 of £1,500,000 (2007: £1,250,000).
Price risk management
Where possible the Group enters into contracts incorporating price escalation clauses to mitigate any significant exposure to materials and
utilities price risk. PRESSURE TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 39
19. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED
Credit risk management
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade debtors. Credit risk is managed by monitoring the aggregate amount and duration of
exposure to any one customer. The Group’s management estimate the level of allowances required for doubtful debts based on prior experience
and their assessment of the current economic environment. The credit risk on liquid funds is minimized by using counterparty banks with high
credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
Liquidity risk management
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash
flows and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
At 27 September 2008, the Group's liabilities have contractual maturities summarised below:

of £20,000 per quarter.
Included in cash and cash equivalents is a Sterling balance of £2,000,000 (2007: £3,500,000) which represents a single fixed term deposit for one

The Group maintains foreign currency denominated bank accounts that earn interest based on the Bank of Scotland base rate applicable to that currency.
At 27 September 2008 there was an outstanding foreign exchange liability of £283,000 which expires within 6 months of the year end (2007: £nil).
The following amounts have been recognised in the income statement in respect of derivative financial instruments:

Fair values
The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are determined as follows:
– Outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date. The Group does
not hedge account.
– The value of outstanding sales and purchase orders denominated in foreign currencies are revalued at the balance sheet date using exchange
rates then applicable to the expected settlement of the outstanding orders.
The carrying value and fair value of the financial assets and financial liabilities are considered to be the same. 40 PRESSURE TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008

22. SHARE BASED PAYMENTS
Pressure Technologies plc introduced a share option scheme for all employees of the Group during the period. No options were in issue in the
prior year. Options are exercisable at 176p. The vesting period is 3 years. If the options remain unexercised after a period of 3 years and 6 months
from the date of the grant, the options expire. Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
Details of the share options outstanding during the period are as follows:
Options
No.
Granted during the period 59,197
Cancelled during the period (10,908)
Outstanding and Exercisable at the end of the period 48,289
The options outstanding at 27 September 2008 had a weighted average exercise price of 176p and a weighted average remaining contractual life
of 2.2 years. The terms of these options are as follows:
Options

at 27 September Vesting at date of Exercise Exercise
Date of grant 2008 period grant (p) price (p) period
30/11/07 48,289 3 years 220 176 6 months
There are no performance conditions that apply to the options, other than continued employment.
On 30 November 2007, the Company's Non-executive Chairman, R.L. Shacklady, and its Non-executive Director, N.F. Luckett, were each granted
options over 5,454 Ordinary Shares under the Scheme. These options comprised the Directors entire holdings of share options. These options
were cancelled on 20 August 2008 following a review of best practice in corporate governance in which the Directors concluded that it would be
inappropriate for the Non-executive Directors to participate in the Scheme.
The options granted have been valued using the Black-Scholes model. The inputs into the Black-Scholes model are as follows:
Scheme: date of grant 30/11/07
Weighted average share price 220p
Weighted average exercise price 176p
Expected volatility 37.6%
Expected life 3 years
Risk free rate 5.2%
Expected dividend yield 0%
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group's share price over the period since the Group was
admitted to AIM. The expected option value used in the model has been adjusted, based on management's best estimate, for the effects of
non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. The expected dividend yield was based on the Group’s dividend payout
pattern at the date of issue of the options.
The total charge to the income statement in the period in respect of share-based payments was £18,000.
A deferred tax charge of £3,000 was recognised in the income statement during the period in respect of share based payments. A further £1,000
was taken directly to reserves. 42 PRESSURE TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008

Explanation of transition to IFRS
An explanation of how the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS has affected the Group’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows is
set out below:
IAS 17 – Accounting for operating leases
The Group benefited from an operating lease incentive at the outset of its 15 year lease on the Meadowhall factory in 2005.
Under UK GAAP, the benefit of the operating lease incentive is spread to the date that the rent is first revised to market rent.
Under IAS 17 “Leases”, payments made under operating leases should be recognised as an expense on a straight line basis over the lease term,
even if lease payments are not made on such a basis. As a result, the total amount payable under the operating lease has been spread over the
entire lease term on a straight line basis, with the difference between the amount recognised in the income statement and the amount paid being
included within other payables on the balance sheet.
IAS 39 – Contracts in foreign currencies
IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: recognition and measurement”, requires that embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and
accounted for as a derivative when they are not closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract. A value is placed on all sales
and purchase orders at the time of order placement based on the forward rate applicable for the expected date of delivery. Where orders remain
outstanding at subsequent reporting dates, the difference between that rate and the forward rate for the expected delivery date calculated at the
reporting date is accounted for separately as a derivative asset or liability.
Movements in the carrying value of the derivative asset or liability are recognised through the income statement.
IAS 39 also requires forward foreign exchange contracts to be recognised on the balance sheet at their fair value with movements in the fair value
being recognised through the income statement.
IAS 12 – Income taxes
IAS 12 “Income taxes”, requires that deferred tax is calculated based on the difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and
their tax bases. As a result, deferred tax has been calculated on each of the adjustments explained above. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognised separately. PRESSURE TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 47

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards and
the Companies Act 1985. Under section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and
loss account. The profit for the financial year dealt within the financial statements of the holding Company was £1,113,000 (2007: £498,000).
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost subject to provision for impairment where the underlying business does not support the
carrying value of the investment. Where the ownership of investments have been transferred between Group undertakings, this has been
accounted for at nominal value under the provisions of merger relief.
Pensions
The Company makes contributions to a defined contribution scheme with costs being charged to the profit and loss account in the period to which
they relate.
Share based payments
The share option programme allows Pressure Technologies plc to grant options to Group employees to acquire shares in Pressure Technologies
plc. The fair value is measured at the date of granting the options and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally
entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured using an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and
conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised as fair value is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options
that vest except where forfeiture is due only to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting. Deferred taxation is recognised over the
vesting period.
Where the individuals are employed by the parent Company, the fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a
corresponding increase in equity. Where the individuals are employed by a subsidiary undertaking, the fair value of options to purchase shares in
the Company that have been issued to employees of subsidiary companies is recognised as an additional cost of investment by the parent
Company. An equal amount is credited to other equity reserves. This treatment is in accordance with UITF 44 and FRS 20: Share based payments.
2. EMPLOYEE COSTS
The only employee costs of the Company are those of the Directors, these are detailed in note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
